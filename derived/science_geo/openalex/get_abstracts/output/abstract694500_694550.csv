https://openalex.org/W4281891658,"A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000 years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36 μs. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal."
https://openalex.org/W4281913860,"Age-related change in human haematopoiesis causes reduced regenerative capacity1, cytopenias2, immune dysfunction3 and increased risk of blood cancer4-6, but the reason for such abrupt functional decline after 70 years of age remains unclear. Here we sequenced 3,579 genomes from single cell-derived colonies of haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years of age. Haematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length. Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of 20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production. By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older subjects, 30-60% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18 independent clones, each contributing 1-34% of blood production. Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40 years old, but only 22% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12 non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in blood cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective benefits in males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant stem cell population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive selection acting on many more genes than currently identified."
https://openalex.org/W4282932245,"The factors driving therapy resistance in diffuse glioma remain poorly understood. To identify treatment-associated cellular and genetic changes, we analyzed RNA and/or DNA sequencing data from the temporally separated tumor pairs of 304 adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant glioma. Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells. Collectively, these recurrence-associated phenotypes represent potential targets to alter disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4281901178,"Neurotransmitters play essential roles in regulating neural circuit dynamics both in the central nervous system as well as at the peripheral, including the gastrointestinal tract1-3. Their real-time monitoring will offer critical information for understanding neural function and diagnosing disease1-3. However, bioelectronic tools to monitor the dynamics of neurotransmitters in vivo, especially in the enteric nervous systems, are underdeveloped. This is mainly owing to the limited availability of biosensing tools that are capable of examining soft, complex and actively moving organs. Here we introduce a tissue-mimicking, stretchable, neurochemical biological interface termed NeuroString, which is prepared by laser patterning of a metal-complexed polyimide into an interconnected graphene/nanoparticle network embedded in an elastomer. NeuroString sensors allow chronic in vivo real-time, multichannel and multiplexed monoamine sensing in the brain of behaving mouse, as well as measuring serotonin dynamics in the gut without undesired stimulations and perturbing peristaltic movements. The described elastic and conformable biosensing interface has broad potential for studying the impact of neurotransmitters on gut microbes, brain-gut communication and may ultimately be extended to biomolecular sensing in other soft organs across the body."
https://openalex.org/W4281780963,"Clonal expansions driven by somatic mutations become pervasive across human tissues with age, including in the haematopoietic system, where the phenomenon is termed clonal haematopoiesis1-4. The understanding of how and when clonal haematopoiesis develops, the factors that govern its behaviour, how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to malignant progression remains limited5,6. Here we track 697 clonal haematopoiesis clones from 385 individuals 55 years of age or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4% of clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study period, with different mutations driving substantially different growth rates, ranging from 5% (DNMT3A and TP53) to more than 50% per year (SRSF2P95H). Growth rates of clones with the same mutation differed by approximately ±5% per year, proportionately affecting slow drivers more substantially. By combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of 1,731 whole-genome sequences of haematopoietic colonies from 7 individuals from an older age group, we reveal distinct patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene mutations drove expansion only later in life, whereas TET2-mutant clones emerged across all ages. Finally, we show that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk of malignant progression. Our findings characterize the lifelong natural history of clonal haematopoiesis and give fundamental insights into the interactions between somatic mutation, ageing and clonal selection."
https://openalex.org/W4281845262,"Deep neural networks with applications from computer vision to medical diagnosis1-5 are commonly implemented using clock-based processors6-14, in which computation speed is mainly limited by the clock frequency and the memory access time. In the optical domain, despite advances in photonic computation15-17, the lack of scalable on-chip optical non-linearity and the loss of photonic devices limit the scalability of optical deep networks. Here we report an integrated end-to-end photonic deep neural network (PDNN) that performs sub-nanosecond image classification through direct processing of the optical waves impinging on the on-chip pixel array as they propagate through layers of neurons. In each neuron, linear computation is performed optically and the non-linear activation function is realized opto-electronically, allowing a classification time of under 570 ps, which is comparable with a single clock cycle of state-of-the-art digital platforms. A uniformly distributed supply light provides the same per-neuron optical output range, allowing scalability to large-scale PDNNs. Two-class and four-class classification of handwritten letters with accuracies higher than 93.8% and 89.8%, respectively, is demonstrated. Direct, clock-less processing of optical data eliminates analogue-to-digital conversion and the requirement for a large memory module, allowing faster and more energy efficient neural networks for the next generations of deep learning systems."
https://openalex.org/W4281838770,"Laser cooling and trapping1,2, and magneto-optical trapping methods in particular2, have enabled groundbreaking advances in science, including Bose–Einstein condensation3–5, quantum computation with neutral atoms6,7 and high-precision optical clocks8. Recently, magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of diatomic molecules have been demonstrated9–12, providing access to research in quantum simulation13 and searches for physics beyond the standard model14. Compared with diatomic molecules, polyatomic molecules have distinct rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom that promise a variety of transformational possibilities. For example, ultracold polyatomic molecules would be uniquely suited to applications in quantum computation and simulation15–17, ultracold collisions18, quantum chemistry19 and beyond-the-standard-model searches20,21. However, the complexity of these molecules has so far precluded the realization of MOTs for polyatomic species. Here we demonstrate magneto-optical trapping of a polyatomic molecule, calcium monohydroxide (CaOH). After trapping, the molecules are laser cooled in a blue-detuned optical molasses to a temperature of 110 μK, which is below the Doppler cooling limit. The temperatures and densities achieved here make CaOH a viable candidate for a wide variety of quantum science applications, including quantum simulation and computation using optical tweezer arrays15,17,22,23. This work also suggests that laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of many other polyatomic species24–27 will be both feasible and practical. The polyatomic molecule calcium monohydroxide is magneto-optically trapped and cooled below the Doppler cooling limit, making it a candidate for applications in quantum simulation and computation."
https://openalex.org/W4281708620,"Abstract All known triterpenes are generated by triterpene synthases (TrTSs) from squalene or oxidosqualene 1 . This approach is fundamentally different from the biosynthesis of short-chain (C 10 –C 25 ) terpenes that are formed from polyisoprenyl diphosphates 2–4 . In this study, two fungal chimeric class I TrTSs, Talaromyces verruculosus talaropentaene synthase (TvTS) and Macrophomina phaseolina macrophomene synthase (MpMS), were characterized. Both enzymes use dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate or hexaprenyl diphosphate as substrates, representing the first examples, to our knowledge, of non-squalene-dependent triterpene biosynthesis. The cyclization mechanisms of TvTS and MpMS and the absolute configurations of their products were investigated in isotopic labelling experiments. Structural analyses of the terpene cyclase domain of TvTS and full-length MpMS provide detailed insights into their catalytic mechanisms. An AlphaFold2-based screening platform was developed to mine a third TrTS, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides colleterpenol synthase (CgCS). Our findings identify a new enzymatic mechanism for the biosynthesis of triterpenes and enhance understanding of terpene biosynthesis in nature."

https://openalex.org/W4281690762,"Antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in suppressing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1. However, eradication of the virus in individuals with HIV has not been possible to date2. Given that HIV suppression requires life-long antiretroviral therapy, predominantly on a daily basis, there is a need to develop clinically effective alternatives that use long-acting antiviral agents to inhibit viral replication3. Here we report the results of a two-component clinical trial involving the passive transfer of two HIV-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, 3BNC117 and 10-1074. The first component was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled participants who initiated antiretroviral therapy during the acute/early phase of HIV infection. The second component was an open-label single-arm trial that enrolled individuals with viraemic control who were naive to antiretroviral therapy. Up to 8 infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, administered over a period of 24 weeks, were well tolerated without any serious adverse events related to the infusions. Compared with the placebo, the combination broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies maintained complete suppression of plasma viraemia (for up to 43 weeks) after analytical treatment interruption, provided that no antibody-resistant HIV was detected at the baseline in the study participants. Similarly, potent HIV suppression was seen in the antiretroviral-therapy-naive study participants with viraemia carrying sensitive virus at the baseline. Our data demonstrate that combination therapy with broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can provide long-term virological suppression without antiretroviral therapy in individuals with HIV, and our experience offers guidance for future clinical trials involving next-generation antibodies with long half-lives."
https://openalex.org/W4281725021,"Disseminated cancer cells from primary tumours can seed in distal tissues, but may take several years to form overt metastases, a phenomenon that is termed tumour dormancy. Despite its importance in metastasis and residual disease, few studies have been able to successfully characterize dormancy within melanoma. Here we show that the aged lung microenvironment facilitates a permissive niche for efficient outgrowth of dormant disseminated cancer cells—in contrast to the aged skin, in which age-related changes suppress melanoma growth but drive dissemination. These microenvironmental complexities can be explained by the phenotype switching model, which argues that melanoma cells switch between a proliferative cell state and a slower-cycling, invasive state1–3. It was previously shown that dermal fibroblasts promote phenotype switching in melanoma during ageing4–8. We now identify WNT5A as an activator of dormancy in melanoma disseminated cancer cells within the lung, which initially enables the efficient dissemination and seeding of melanoma cells in metastatic niches. Age-induced reprogramming of lung fibroblasts increases their secretion of the soluble WNT antagonist sFRP1, which inhibits WNT5A in melanoma cells and thereby enables efficient metastatic outgrowth. We also identify the tyrosine kinase receptors AXL and MER as promoting a dormancy-to-reactivation axis within melanoma cells. Overall, we find that age-induced changes in distal metastatic microenvironments promote the efficient reactivation of dormant melanoma cells in the lung. Changes in the microenvironment of the aged lung relative to younger lung tissue can lead to the reactivation of dormant melanoma cells through a mechanism that involves a decrease in WNT5A and AXL signalling and an increase in MERTK."
https://openalex.org/W4281893299,"All multicellular organisms rely on differential gene transcription regulated by genomic enhancers, which function through cofactors that are recruited by transcription factors1,2. Emerging evidence suggests that not all cofactors are required at all enhancers3–5, yet whether these observations reflect more general principles or distinct types of enhancers remained unknown. Here we categorized human enhancers by their cofactor dependencies and show that these categories provide a framework to understand the sequence and chromatin diversity of enhancers and their roles in different gene-regulatory programmes. We quantified enhancer activities along the entire human genome using STARR-seq6 in HCT116 cells, following the rapid degradation of eight cofactors. This analysis identified different types of enhancers with distinct cofactor requirements, sequences and chromatin properties. Some enhancers were insensitive to the depletion of the core Mediator subunit MED14 or the bromodomain protein BRD4 and regulated distinct transcriptional programmes. In particular, canonical Mediator7 seemed dispensable for P53-responsive enhancers, and MED14-depleted cells induced endogenous P53 target genes. Similarly, BRD4 was not required for the transcription of genes that bear CCAAT boxes and a TATA box (including histone genes and LTR12 retrotransposons) or for the induction of heat-shock genes. This categorization of enhancers through cofactor dependencies reveals distinct enhancer types that can bypass broadly utilized cofactors, which illustrates how alternative ways to activate transcription separate gene expression programmes and provide a conceptual framework to understand enhancer function and regulatory specificity. The systematic categorization of human enhancers by their cofactor dependencies provides a conceptual framework to understand the sequence and chromatin diversity of enhancers and their roles in different gene-regulatory programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4281850518,"Noradrenaline released from the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous neuromodulator1-4 that has been linked to multiple functions including arousal5-8, action and sensory gain9-11, and learning12-16. Whether and how activation of noradrenaline-expressing neurons in the LC (LC-NA) facilitates different components of specific behaviours is unknown. Here we show that LC-NA activity displays distinct spatiotemporal dynamics to enable two functions during learned behaviour: facilitating task execution and encoding reinforcement to improve performance accuracy. To examine these functions, we used a behavioural task in mice with graded auditory stimulus detection and task performance. Optogenetic inactivation of the LC demonstrated that LC-NA activity was causal for both task execution and optimization. Targeted recordings of LC-NA neurons using photo-tagging, two-photon micro-endoscopy and two-photon output monitoring showed that transient LC-NA activation preceded behavioural execution and followed reinforcement. These two components of phasic activity were heterogeneously represented in LC-NA cortical outputs, such that the behavioural response signal was higher in the motor cortex and facilitated task execution, whereas the negative reinforcement signal was widely distributed among cortical regions and improved response sensitivity on the subsequent trial. Modular targeting of LC outputs thus enables diverse functions, whereby some noradrenaline signals are segregated among targets, whereas others are broadly distributed."
https://openalex.org/W4281952443,"Abstract Topology in quantum many-body systems has profoundly changed our understanding of quantum phases of matter. The model that has played an instrumental role in elucidating these effects is the antiferromagnetic spin-1 Haldane chain 1,2 . Its ground state is a disordered state, with symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate edge states due to fractional spin excitations. In the bulk, it is characterized by vanishing two-point spin correlations, gapped excitations and a characteristic non-local order parameter 3,4 . More recently it has been understood that the Haldane chain forms a specific example of a more general classification scheme of symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, which is based on ideas connected to quantum information and entanglement 5–7 . Here, we realize a finite-temperature version of such a topological Haldane phase with Fermi–Hubbard ladders in an ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We directly reveal both edge and bulk properties of the system through the use of single-site and particle-resolved measurements, as well as non-local correlation functions. Continuously changing the Hubbard interaction strength of the system enables us to investigate the robustness of the phase to charge (density) fluctuations far from the regime of the Heisenberg model, using a novel correlator."
https://openalex.org/W4281737302,"Abstract The reluctance of people to get vaccinated represents a fundamental challenge to containing the spread of deadly infectious diseases 1,2 , including COVID-19. Identifying misperceptions that can fuel vaccine hesitancy and creating effective communication strategies to overcome them are a global public health priority 3–5 . Medical doctors are a trusted source of advice about vaccinations 6 , but media reports may create an inaccurate impression that vaccine controversy is prevalent among doctors, even when a broad consensus exists 7,8 . Here we show that public misperceptions about the views of doctors on the COVID-19 vaccines are widespread, and correcting them increases vaccine uptake. We implement a survey among 9,650 doctors in the Czech Republic and find that 90% of doctors trust the vaccines. Next, we show that 90% of respondents in a nationally representative sample ( n = 2,101) underestimate doctors’ trust; the most common belief is that only 50% of doctors trust the vaccines. Finally, we integrate randomized provision of information about the true views held by doctors into a longitudinal data collection that regularly monitors vaccination status over 9 months. The treatment recalibrates beliefs and leads to a persistent increase in vaccine uptake. The approach demonstrated in this paper shows how the engagement of professional medical associations, with their unparalleled capacity to elicit individual views of doctors on a large scale, can help to create a cheap, scalable intervention that has lasting positive impacts on health behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4281628743,"Abstract Though immensely successful, the standard model of particle physics does not offer any explanation as to why our Universe contains so much more matter than antimatter. A key to a dynamically generated matter–antimatter asymmetry is the existence of processes that violate the combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) symmetry 1 . As such, precision tests of CP symmetry may be used to search for physics beyond the standard model. However, hadrons decay through an interplay of strong and weak processes, quantified in terms of relative phases between the amplitudes. Although previous experiments constructed CP observables that depend on both strong and weak phases, we present an approach where sequential two-body decays of entangled multi-strange baryon–antibaryon pairs provide a separation between these phases. Our method, exploiting spin entanglement between the double-strange Ξ − baryon and its antiparticle 2 $${\bar{{\Xi }}}^{+}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mover> <mml:mi>Ξ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo> </mml:mover> </mml:mrow> <mml:mo>+</mml:mo> </mml:msup> </mml:math> , has enabled a direct determination of the weak-phase difference, ( ξ P − ξ S ) = (1.2 ± 3.4 ± 0.8) × 10 −2 rad. Furthermore, three independent CP observables can be constructed from our measured parameters. The precision in the estimated parameters for a given data sample size is several orders of magnitude greater than achieved with previous methods 3 .

https://openalex.org/W3210267296,"Imposing chirality on a physical system engenders unconventional energy flow and responses, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect1 and the topological quantum Hall phase for electrons in a symmetry-breaking magnetic field. Recently, great interest has arisen in combining that principle with broken Hermiticity to explore novel topological phases and applications2-16. Here we report phononic states with unique symmetries and dynamics that are formed when combining the controlled breaking of time-reversal symmetry with non-Hermitian dynamics. Both of these are induced through time-modulated radiation pressure forces in small nano-optomechanical networks. We observe chiral energy flow among mechanical resonators in a synthetic dimension and Aharonov-Bohm tuning of their eigenmodes. Introducing particle-non-conserving squeezing interactions, we observe a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect in ring-shaped networks in which mechanical quasiparticles experience parametric gain. The resulting complex mode spectra indicate flux-tuning of squeezing, exceptional points, instabilities and unidirectional phononic amplification. This rich phenomenology points the way to exploring new non-Hermitian topological bosonic phases and applications in sensing and transport that exploit spatiotemporal symmetry breaking."
https://openalex.org/W4281778594,"The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems regulate the activities of internal organs1, but the molecular and functional diversity of their constituent neurons and circuits remains largely unknown. Here we use retrograde neuronal tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, optogenetics and physiological experiments to dissect the cardiac parasympathetic control circuit in mice. We show that cardiac-innervating neurons in the brainstem nucleus ambiguus (Amb) are comprised of two molecularly, anatomically and functionally distinct subtypes. The first, which we call ambiguus cardiovascular (ACV) neurons (approximately 35 neurons per Amb), define the classical cardiac parasympathetic circuit. They selectively innervate a subset of cardiac parasympathetic ganglion neurons and mediate the baroreceptor reflex, slowing heart rate and atrioventricular node conduction in response to increased blood pressure. The other, ambiguus cardiopulmonary (ACP) neurons (approximately 15 neurons per Amb) innervate cardiac ganglion neurons intermingled with and functionally indistinguishable from those innervated by ACV neurons. ACP neurons also innervate most or all lung parasympathetic ganglion neurons-clonal labelling shows that individual ACP neurons innervate both organs. ACP neurons mediate the dive reflex, the simultaneous bradycardia and bronchoconstriction that follows water immersion. Thus, parasympathetic control of the heart is organized into two parallel circuits, one that selectively controls cardiac function (ACV circuit) and another that coordinates cardiac and pulmonary function (ACP circuit). This new understanding of cardiac control has implications for treating cardiac and pulmonary diseases and for elucidating the control and coordination circuits of other organs."
https://openalex.org/W4281784709,"Flowering plants (angiosperms) can grow at extreme altitudes, and have been observed growing as high as 6,400 metres above sea level1,2; however, the molecular mechanisms that enable plant adaptation specifically to altitude are unknown. One distinguishing feature of increasing altitude is a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2). Here we investigated the relationship between altitude and oxygen sensing in relation to chlorophyll biosynthesis-which requires molecular oxygen3-and hypoxia-related gene expression. We show that in etiolated seedlings of angiosperm species, steady-state levels of the phototoxic chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide are influenced by sensing of atmospheric oxygen concentration. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this is mediated by the PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASE (PCO) N-degron pathway substrates GROUP VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors (ERFVIIs). ERFVIIs positively regulate expression of FLUORESCENT IN BLUE LIGHT (FLU), which represses the first committed step of chlorophyll biosynthesis, forming an inactivation complex with tetrapyrrole synthesis enzymes that are negatively regulated by ERFVIIs, thereby suppressing protochlorophyllide. In natural populations representing diverse angiosperm clades, we find oxygen-dependent altitudinal clines for steady-state levels of protochlorophyllide, expression of inactivation complex components and hypoxia-related genes. Finally, A. thaliana accessions from contrasting altitudes display altitude-dependent ERFVII activity and accumulation. We thus identify a mechanism for genetic adaptation to absolute altitude through alteration of the sensitivity of the oxygen-sensing system."

Here, we identified cell-type-specific transcriptional signatures associated with a sustained ketamine response in mice. Most interestingly, we identified the Kcnq2 gene as an important downstream regulator of ketamine action in glutamatergic neurons of the ventral hippocampus. We validated these findings through a series of complementary molecular, electrophysiological, cellular, pharmacological, behavioral, and functional experiments. We demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with retigabine, a KCNQ activator, augments ketamine’s antidepressant-like effects in mice. Intriguingly, these effects are ketamine specific, as they do not modulate a response to classical antidepressants, such as escitalopram.

The discovery that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, produces a rapid yet sustained antidepressant response, even in treatment-resistant patients, is one of the most significant improvements in the field of depression in over 60 years (Duman, 2018Duman R.S.

Ketamine is effective for the treatment of suicidal ideation in emergency room settings, and its antidepressant effects have been demonstrated in many human and animal studies (Krystal et al., 2019Krystal J.H.

Despite these encouraging clinical and preclinical findings, controversy remains regarding ketamine’s efficacy in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) (Gastaldon et al., 2019Gastaldon C.

This has encouraged research into ketamine’s mechanisms of action in an effort to understand its primary and downstream targets, so that better treatment interventions for depression can be developed. Previous studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine, and several mechanisms of action have been proposed (Aleksandrova et al., 2017Aleksandrova L.R. Wang Y.T. Phillips A.G. Hydroxynorketamine: implications for the NMDA receptor hypothesis of ketamine's antidepressant action.Chronic Stress (Thousand Oaks). 2017; 1PubMed Google Scholar). However, given that the antidepressant effects of ketamine remain long after its metabolism, its mechanism of action cannot be solely attributed to ketamine’s ability to inhibit NMDR or increase the function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR). Instead, it may result from the activation of downstream signaling cascades causing long-lasting and sustained adaptations in key brain areas and neural circuits. Despite the progress (Zanos, and Gould, 2018Zanos P. Gould T.D. Mechanisms of ketamine action as an antidepressant.Mol. Psychiatry. 2018; 23: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism of ketamine action is still not fully understood. It is possible that some of the more elusive molecular components of this mechanism remain unclear due to important methodological limitations, specifically the absence of cell-type-specific information (Gururajan et al., 2018Gururajan A.

In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we comprehensively cataloged the transcriptome of thousands of ventral hippocampus (vHipp) cells of mice treated with a single dose of (R,S)-ketamine or a saline vehicle control and found cell-type-specific transcriptional signatures associated with the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine. Notably, we identified Kcnq2 as an important downstream regulator of ketamine action in glutamatergic neurons of the vHipp. These findings were validated using glutamatergic neurons sorted from a conditional reporter mouse line, in vitro treatment of primary hippocampal neurons, electrophysiological recordings in vitro and from acute vHipp slices, a validated mouse chronic stress model for depression, as well as a viral-mediated knockdown of Kcnq2 in the vHipp of mice. In addition, we identified a previously unknown mechanism of action for ketamine via Kcnq2 in glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus. We demonstrated that (1) systemic pharmacological manipulation of KCNQ channels modulates antidepressant behaviors in mice, (2) adjunctive treatment with retigabine, a KCNQ activator, augments ketamine’s effects, and (3) the effects of KCNQ are specific to ketamine, as they do not modulate the response to classical antidepressants. We provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine and postulated the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ as a downstream regulator of ketamine action, as well as a promising target for the development of MDD treatments. To characterize cell-type-specific molecular changes associated with the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine, we treated mice with either ketamine or a saline control. Brains were collected 2 days post-treatment, and single-cell suspensions were prepared for scRNA-seq (Figure 1A). The transcriptome of thousands of single cells from the vHipp, a well-known region for ketamine antidepressant action in rodents and humans, was sequenced (Ionescu et al., 2018Ionescu D.F.

After quality control and preprocessing (Figure S1A), single cells were grouped according to their GE profiles using graph-based clustering. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots were used to visualize clusters. Our unsupervised cluster analysis revealed 13 cell clusters with distinct GE signatures (Figures 1B and S1B). We found no significant differences in the relative cell-type composition for each cluster between the ketamine- and saline-treated groups (Figure 1C; Table S1). Subsequently, we performed differential expression analyses to evaluate cell-type-specific molecular signatures of ketamine action (see STAR Methods). We identified a total of 263 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 7 of the 13 clusters, ranging from 1 to 165 DEGs per cell type (Figure 1D; Table S2). We found that 31 of the 263 DEGs were significantly dysregulated in more than 1 cluster; however, 135 DEGs were exclusively in glutamatergic (GLUT) neurons, 27 in astrocytes, 16 in oligodendrocytes, 3 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), 1 in endothelial cells, and 1 in vascular cells (Figure S1C; Table S3). Additionally, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis for the three cell types with the largest DEGs, using Enrichr (Xie et al., 2021Xie Z. Bailey A. Kuleshov M.V. Clarke D.J.B. Evangelista J.E. Jenkins S.L. Lachmann A. Wojciechowicz M.L. Kropiwnicki E. Jagodnik K.M. et al.Gene set knowledge discovery with Enrichr.Curr. Protoc. 2021; 1: e90Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In GLUT neurons, our analysis revealed many significant pathways involved in calcium signaling, synaptic function and plasticity, and neurodevelopmental disorders (Figure S1D). Astrocytes showed an enrichment for fatty acid elongation, gap junction, phagosome activity, and Alzheimer’s disease (Figure S1E), whereas oligodendrocytes showed an enrichment for vitamin digestion, absorption, and fatty acid elongation (Figure S1F). The GLUT neurons were the most interesting cell type based on their multigenic response (165 DEGs) (Figure 1D) and their known role in modulating the antidepressant effects of ketamine (Duman et al., 2019Duman R.S.

Psychiatry. 2021; 26: 5097-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Next, we generated a conditional reporter mouse line (Nex-Cre-Ai9) where most GLUT neurons of the forebrain, including the hippocampus, are fluorescently labeled by tdTomato (Figure S2A) (Hartmann et al., 2017Hartmann J. Dedic N. Pöhlmann M.L. Häusl A. Karst H. Engelhardt C. Westerholz S. Wagner K.V. Labermaier C.

Psychiatry. 2017; 22: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mice were injected with ketamine or a saline control. The vHipp was dissected 2 days post-injection (Figure 2A). Individual whole cells were sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into two separate pools of cells from each mouse. One pool contained GLUT neurons (tdTomato+), and the other contained all other vHipp cell types (tdTomato−) (Figures 2A and S2B–S2D). To confirm the presence of GLUT neurons in the tdTomato+ pool, we quantified mRNA and found higher levels of the genes coding for Neurod6, tdTomato, as well as Slc17a7, a known marker of GLUT neurons, as compared with the tdTomato− pool (Figure S2E). We quantified mRNA of the established cell-type-specific markers Slc32a1 (GABAergic neurons), Slc1a3 (astrocytes), Mog (oligodendrocytes), C1qc (microglia), and Cldn5 (endothelial cells) and found that tdTomato+ cells expressed lower levels of these genes, as compared with tdTomato− cells (Figure S2E), confirming the presence of GLUT neurons in the tdTomato+ cells. We used these two pools to validate our scRNA-seq findings at the population level, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We found no significant differences in the total number of tdTomato+ cells from the ketamine or saline groups, confirming our scRNA-seq results (Figures S2F–S2H). As a proof of principle, we selected 8 of the top DEGs in GLUT neurons (4 upregulated and 4 downregulated) from our scRNA-seq analysis (Table S2). We found that most of the genes quantified in the tdTomato+ cells were significantly dysregulated and directionally consistent with our scRNA-seq findings (Figure 2B). The voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily Q member 2 (Kcnq2) showed the strongest effect after ketamine treatment (p < 0.001, FC = 2.2). We found no significant differences in mRNA levels for any of the 8 DEGs in the tdTomato− cells (Figure 2C). To compare whole tissue “bulk” versus cell-type-specific methods, we quantified the mRNA expression of these 8 genes using brain punches from the vHipp of a new cohort of mice. Our results showed small changes in a direction that was consistent with our scRNA-seq results; however, these effects did not reach statistical significance (Figures S2I and S2J). Overall, these results show that ketamine elicits sustained cell-type-specific GE changes in the vHipp of mice and that these changes are masked in bulk analyses. Next, we examined whether a single ketamine treatment of primary hippocampal neurons could modify the mRNA expression of the 8 genes tested earlier. Mouse primary hippocampal neurons are mostly made up of GLUT neurons and therefore make a very good model system to further validate our previous in vivo findings. Primary neurons were cultured for 21 days and then stimulated with a single dose of ketamine (10 μM) or its active metabolite, (2R, 6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) (10 μM). These concentrations were selected after careful experimental consideration and review of the available literature (Figures S3A–S3G). Following the treatment, neurons were collected 2, 12, 24, or 48 h later and compared with untreated and saline controls (Figure 3A). We found no significant differences in the expression of any of the 8 genes tested after treatment with a saline control, as compared with the untreated primary neurons (Figure 3A). However, we found significant changes in the mRNA expression of 7 out of 8 genes after ketamine treatment, which were directionally consistent with our scRNA-seq findings (Figure 3A). Among the DEGs, Kcnq2 displayed the largest changes in GE after treatment, showing a significant upregulation at all time points. Our findings suggest that Kcnq2 is transcriptionally regulated by ketamine and could be an important downstream regulator of ketamine action in glutamatergic neurons of the vHipp. The Kcnq2 gene encodes for the Kv7.2 protein, a slow-acting, voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability (Jentsch, 2000Jentsch T.J. Neuronal KCNQ potassium channels: physiology and role in disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 proteins (Kcnq3 gene) can form KCNQ (Kv7) homo- or heterotetramers that generate a signature M-current, modulating the overall excitability of neurons (Barrese et al., 2018Barrese V. Stott J.B. Greenwood I.A. KCNQ-encoded potassium channels as therapeutic targets.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2018; 58: 625-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Cooper and Jan, 2003Cooper E.C. Jan L.Y. M-channels: neurological diseases, neuromodulation, and drug development.Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To investigate the KCNQ channel as a mediator of the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine, we treated mouse primary hippocampal neurons with HNK (10 μM) or a saline control for 24 h and quantified M-current density (IM) using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Figure 3B). Neurons treated with HNK displayed a significant increase in IM current density versus saline-treated controls (Figures 3C and 3D). Next, we performed ex vivo patch-clamp recordings from acute hippocampal slices to test the effects of ketamine treatment on IM current density (Figure 3E). Briefly, mice were injected with ketamine or a saline control and sacrificed 2 days later. Electrophysiological recordings were taken specifically from glutamatergic (CA1 pyramidal) neurons of the vHipp. Similarly to our in vitro findings, ketamine-treated mice showed a significant increase in IM current density versus saline-treated controls (Figures 3F, 3G, S3H, and S3I), suggesting that ketamine increases the expression of KCNQ channels in vivo. These findings indicate that the increased Kcnq2 mRNA expression observed in glutamatergic neurons 2 days after ketamine treatment is accompanied by a significant gain in the number of functional KCNQ channels expressed in GLUT neurons of the hippocampus both in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings further support the idea that KCNQ channels are a downstream regulator of sustained ketamine action and suggest that modulation of these channels in GLUT neurons of the vHipp could be a potential target for MDD treatment. The M channel (KCNQ) is formed by the proteins encoded by the Kcnq2 and Kcnq3 genes, both integral membrane proteins (Baculis et al., 2020Baculis B.C. Zhang J. Chung H.J. The role of Kv7 channels in neural plasticity and behavior.Front. Physiol. 2020; 11: 568667Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We did not find any significant differences in the mRNA expression of Kcnq3 after ketamine treatment in our original cohort, our FACS-sorted sample, or in primary hippocampal neurons (Figures S4A–S4C; Table S2), suggesting that ketamine produces an effect specific to Kcnq2, but not to Kcnq3. To explore the expression of Kcnq2 and Kcnq3 in the brain, we examined publicly available in situ hybridization (ISH) data from 12 different regions of the mouse brain (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholar). Kcnq2 shows its highest expression in the hippocampus formation, whereas Kcnq3 is highly expressed throughout multiple brain regions (Figures S4D–S4F). In addition, our single-cell data, as well as other publicly available single-cell datasets, show that Kcnq2 is exclusively expressed in neurons, whereas Kncq3 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs (Lopez et al., 2021Lopez J.P. Brivio E. Santambrogio A. De Donno C. Kos A. Peters M. Rost N. Czamara D. Brückl T.M.

These findings reinforce the idea that Kcnq2 plays an important and more centralized role in neurons of the hippocampus, making this region a good candidate for in vivo viral manipulations. To functionally explore the role of Kcnq2 in mediating the antidepressant effects of ketamine, we designed adeno-associated virus (AAV) constructs to knock down Kcnq2 in vivo (Figure 4A). Transfection of Neuro2a (N2a) cultured cells and viral injection into the vHipp of adult mice resulted in a significant decrease in Kcnq2 mRNA levels, both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 4B and 4C). We injected shRNA-Kcnq2 or shRNA-scramble control AAVs bilaterally into the vHipp of a new cohort. Four weeks after viral injection, half of the mice were randomly selected to receive a ketamine or saline injection, and the antidepressant effects of ketamine were assessed using the forced swim test (FST), a validated test for evaluating antidepressant efficacy in rodents (Yankelevitch-Yahav et al., 2015Yankelevitch-Yahav R. Franko M. Huly A. Doron R. The forced swim test as a model of depressive-like behavior.J. Vis. Exp. 2015; 97Google Scholar) (Figures 4D and 4E). In the group of mice treated with an shRNA-scramble control, we found a significant decrease in immobility time during the FST in mice treated with ketamine versus controls (Figure 4E, left). Notably, the antidepressant effects of ketamine were no longer detected in mice expressing the shRNA-Kcnq2 virus (Figure 4E, right). We also assessed locomotor activity to rule out any confounding effects of hyperlocomotion in the FST after ketamine treatment and found no differences in total activity between groups (Figures S6A and S6B). These results indicate that the vHipp is an important site for Kcnq2 function and the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine. To further investigate the role of Kcnq2 in GLUT neurons of the vHipp, a new group of Nex-Cre-Ai9 mice was subjected to the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, a validated paradigm to induce long-lasting depression- and anxiety-like endophenotypes in mice (Figure 5A) (Lopez et al., 2021Lopez J.P. Brivio E. Santambrogio A. De Donno C. Kos A. Peters M. Rost N. Czamara D. Brückl T.M. Roeh S. et al.Single-cell molecular profiling of all three components of the HPA axis reveals adrenal ABCB1 as a regulator of stress adaptation.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 10 days of CSDS exposure led to hallmark features of chronically stressed mice (Figures S6C–S6F). In the FST, chronically stressed mice showed a significant increase in immobility time, as compared with non-stressed controls (Figure 5B). Endpoint and tissue collection were performed 24 h after the last social defeat session (day 11), thus capturing the cumulative effects of chronic stress, rather than any acute effects of the last defeat. The vHipp was dissected, and individual cells were sorted (as described in Figure 2A). We found that Kcnq2 mRNA expression was decreased only in GLUT neurons (tdTomato+) of the vHipp, as we did not find any significant differences in the remaining cell types (tdTomato−) (Figure 5C). We also found a significant difference in Kcnq2 mRNA expression between tdTomato+ and tdTomato− cells, confirming that Kcnq2 is enriched in GLUT neurons of the vHipp. Finally, to access bulk mRNA expression levels of Kcnq2 following chronic stress, we quantified its expression in vHipp brain punches from a new cohort of chronically stressed and control mice. Although there was a decrease in Kcnq2 mRNA levels in stressed mice versus controls, it did not reach statistical significance (Figure S6G; p = 0.08). In order to test whether CSDS-induced Kcnq2 decrease can be reversed by ketamine treatment, we exposed a new group of Nex-Cre-Ai9 mice to the CSDS model. On day 11, mice were treated with either ketamine or a saline control (Figure 5D). The antidepressant effects of ketamine were assessed 2 days after treatment (day 13), using the FST. In addition, the vHipp of saline- and ketamine-treated CSDS mice were dissected, and individual cells were sorted using FACS. Interestingly, ketamine reversed the effects of chronic stress in the FST (Figure 5E) and Kcnq2 mRNA in GLUT neurons (Figure 5F). Kcnq2 mRNA expression was significantly increased to baseline levels (as seen in non-stressed controls, Figure 5C) in ketamine-treated CSDS mice versus saline-treated controls (Figure 5F). In addition, these effects were specific to GLUT neurons (tdTomato+) of the vHipp (Figure 5F, left), since we did not find any significant differences in tdTomato− cells (Figure 5F, right). We found no significant increase in Kcnq2 mRNA in ketamine-treated CSDS mice using bulk mRNA (Figure S6H). These results demonstrate that Kcnq2 mRNA is altered after chronic stress exposure in GLUT neurons of the vHipp and that these effects can be reversed by ketamine treatment. Furthermore, these cell-type-specific effects could be diluted or distorted when using brain homogenates. Having identified Kcnq2 as a downstream regulator of the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine, we wanted to further investigate how ketamine transcriptionally upregulates Kcnq2 mRNA to exert its sustained antidepressant-like effects. Previous studies have successfully shown that Kcnq2 mRNA can be regulated via calmodulin (CaM), calcineurin (CaN), and the A-kinase-anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) (Zhang, and Shapiro, 2012Zhang J. Shapiro M.S.

This complex activates the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), which acts on Kcnq2 gene regulatory elements, as opposed to Kcnq3 (Zhang, and Shapiro, 2012Zhang J.

As a result, enhanced and sustained Kcnq2 transcription leads to increased M channel activity and regulation of neuronal excitability. Interestingly, the CaM genes, Calm1 and Calm2, as well as Akap5, were among the DEGs of our scRNA-seq analysis (Table S2). Having already shown that ketamine increases the mRNA expression of Kcnq2 in primary hippocampal neurons (Figure 3A), we next wanted to investigate whether ketamine regulates Kcnq2 mRNA via Ca2+, CaM, CaN, or AKAP5 signaling. We used pharmacological inhibition of the key components of this pathway to see whether it interferes with the upregulation of Kcnq2 mRNA by a single ketamine treatment in vitro. Primary hippocampal neurons were stimulated with a single dose of either saline, HNK, or a combination of HNK plus nifedipine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker), W-7 hydrochloride (CaM inhibitor), or cyclosporine-A (Ca"

https://openalex.org/W4281950391,"It is widely recognized that collisional mountain belt topography is generated by crustal thickening and lowered by river bedrock erosion, linking climate and tectonics1-4. However, whether surface processes or lithospheric strength control mountain belt height, shape and longevity remains uncertain. Additionally, how to reconcile high erosion rates in some active orogens with long-term survival of mountain belts for hundreds of millions of years remains enigmatic. Here we investigate mountain belt growth and decay using a new coupled surface process5,6 and mantle-scale tectonic model7. End-member models and the new non-dimensional Beaumont number, Bm, quantify how surface processes and tectonics control the topographic evolution of mountain belts, and enable the definition of three end-member types of growing orogens: type 1, non-steady state, strength controlled (Bm > 0.5); type 2, flux steady state8, strength controlled (Bm ≈ 0.4-0.5); and type 3, flux steady state, erosion controlled (Bm < 0.4). Our results indicate that tectonics dominate in Himalaya-Tibet and the Central Andes (both type 1), efficient surface processes balance high convergence rates in Taiwan (probably type 2) and surface processes dominate in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (type 3). Orogenic decay is determined by erosional efficiency and can be subdivided into two phases with variable isostatic rebound characteristics and associated timescales. The results presented here provide a unified framework explaining how surface processes and lithospheric strength control the height, shape, and longevity of mountain belts."

Here we isolate individual chromosomes and use sequencing, Hi-C 3,4 and linkage mapping to assemble a chromosome-scale genome reference. The linkage map reveals an extremely low rate of recombination on chromosome 1. We confirm suppression of recombination on chromosome 1 by genotyping individual sperm cells and oocytes. We show that previously identified genomic regions that maintain heterozygosity even after prolonged inbreeding make up essentially all of chromosome 1. Genome sequencing of individuals isolated in the wild indicates that this phenomenon has evolved specifically in populations from Sardinia and Corsica. We find that most known master regulators 5–13 of the reproductive system are located on chromosome 1. We used RNA interference 14,15 to knock down a gene with haplotype-biased expression, which led to the formation of a more pronounced female mating organ. On the basis of these observations, we propose that chromosome 1 is a sex-primed autosome primed for evolution into a sex chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W4281628150,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders as well as shortages of personal protective equipment forced primary care physicians (PCPs) to transition rapidly from in-person visits to telehealth. While telehealth expanded extensively in a short period of time, research about the consequences of the shift to remote care is lacking. The objective of this qualitative study was to examine how telehealth benefited PCPs and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From July to August 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 PCPs associated with a single academic medical center to examine their perspectives about delivering care remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using deductive thematic analysis. Results PCPs identified several benefits of remote care delivery for both physicians and patients. They indicated that (1) patients were reassured that they could receive safe and timely care, (2) remote visits were convenient for patients, (3) patients were comfortable receiving care at home, and (4) video visits enhanced patient- and family-centered care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also noted that (1) telehealth accommodated working from home, (2) physicians were equitably reimbursed for telehealth visits, and that (3) telehealth promoted physician work-life balance. Conclusions Our data provides preliminary evidence that PCPs and their patients had positive experiences with remote care during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians identified opportunities by which telehealth could enhance the delivery of patient-centered care by allowing them to see patients’ home environments and to engage family members and caregivers during telehealth visits. More research is needed to understand how to sustain these benefits beyond the global COVID-19 pandemic and ensure patients’ needs are met."

Since the teeth of an individual subject are controlled by the same set of genes (genotype) and are exposed to mostly identical oral environment (phenotype), the occlusal morphology and 3D position of teeth of an individual patient are inter-related. It is hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) can automate the design of single-tooth dental prostheses after learning the features of the remaining dentition.This article describes the protocol of a prospective experimental study, which aims to train and to validate the AI system for design of single molar dental prostheses. Maxillary and mandibular dentate teeth models will be collected and digitized from at least 250 volunteers. The (original) digitized maxillary teeth models will be duplicated and processed by removal of right maxillary first molars (FDI tooth 16). Teeth models will be randomly divided into training and validation sets. At least 200 training sets of the original and the processed digitalized teeth models will be input into 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for training. Among the validation sets, tooth 16 will be generated by AI on 50 processed models and the morphology and 3D position of AI-generated tooth will be compared to that of the natural tooth in the original maxillary teeth model.

Potential pSS saliva metabolite biomarkers were explored using test group saliva samples (20 patients with pSS vs. 25 healthy adults) and were then verified by a cross-validation group (12 patients with pSS vs. 13 healthy adults). Results Metabolic pathways, including tryptophan metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, carbon fixation, and aspartate and asparagine metabolism, were found to be significantly regulated and related to inflammatory injury, neurological cognitive impairment and the immune response. Phenylalanyl-alanine was discovered to have good predictive ability for pSS, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 in the testing group (validation group: AUC = 0.75). Conclusion Our study shows that salivary metabolomics is a useful strategy for differential analysis and biomarker discovery in pSS."

Questionnaires were distributed to 243 nurses from the emergency departments of ten tertiary hospitals from September to October 2019. SPSS was used to conducted ANOVA. The AMOS was used to conduct structural equation model to test the mediating effect of organizational climate on the association between psychological violence and dimensions of work engagement.Psychological violence was negatively correlated with organizational climate, vitality, dedication, and focus, and organizational climate was positively correlated with dimensions of work engagement. A negative relationship was found between psychological violence and three dimensions of work engagement, which was mediated by organizational climate.In order to curb workplace psychological violence and improve the work engagement level of emergency nurses, organizational climate can be used as an intervention measure. The support of leaders, the care of colleagues and the mutual understanding and communication between doctors and patients can alleviate the job burnout of nurses in the face of heavy work, so that nurses can face their daily work with a better mental outlook."
https://openalex.org/W4281618762,"Background Renal transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is associated with better quality of life and patient survival. Nevertheless, these benefits come with rising concerns about weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, which adversely impact transplant outcomes. Objective The objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of weight gain in the first year post-renal transplant in addition to the assessment of potential risk factors and the resulting outcome of the graft. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of all 295 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) between January 2016 and December 2019. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected from electronic records. Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation. Comparison between groups was assessed by unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test while follow-up data were compared using paired t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Association between the potential risk factors and the weight gain was assessed by means of binary logistic regression analysis. Results Significant weight gain was observed in 161 (54.6%) patients. Females were 119 (40.30%) of the cohort. The mean age was 45.3±15.1 years. The prevalence of diabetes was 234 (79.6%), while hypertensives constituted 77 (26.3%). The comparison between patients who gained weight significantly and patients with stable weight showed a numerical higher prevalence of female gender in patients who had more weight gain (44.1% vs. 35.8%), higher diabetes, higher rate of a living donor, and statistically significant lower dialysis duration before transplant. Other clinical and laboratory variables were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion Our study showed a high incidence of clinically significant weight gain among patients post-renal transplantation. Patients with lower dialysis duration, a living kidney donor and those who are obese at baseline were at higher risk of gaining weight. Patients who underwent kidney transplantation should be monitored closely for weight gain and further studies are needed to determine the risk factors and appropriate interventions."

The purpose of this study was to explore whether sleep quality and quality of life (QoL) play mediating roles in anxiety and depression among Chinese college students.A total of 2757 college students (mean age = 19.07; SD = 1.14) completed the questionnaires, including a brief demographic survey. The 2-item General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) were used to assess the symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. And the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) were used to evaluate college students' sleep quality and QoL, respectively. Mediation analyses were conducted by using PROCESS macro in the SPSS software.Anxiety had both direct and indirect effects on depression. Sleep quality and QoL were not only independent mediators in the relationship between anxiety and depression but also chain mediators.The results of the current study highlight the crucial role of early intervention for depression with a focus on college students with anxiety, more especially, on those with poorer sleep quality and lower QoL."

The root canals were instrumented using Protaper NEXT and filled with calcium hydroxide. After removal of calcium hydroxide, the remaining volume of calcium hydroxide was measured by micro-CT analysis. Data were compared among root canal curvatures and irrigation systems using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test (p < .05). The oscillating range of each irrigation system was measured using light-coupled motion tracking.The volumes of calcium hydroxide remaining in the canals with severe curvature were significantly higher than in those of straight curvature (p < .05). In the canals of moderate or severe curvature, EQ-S showed the highest removal percentage, followed by EndoActivator, Vibringe, and needle irrigation (p < .05). Light-coupled tracking showed the largest oscillating range in EQ-S (p < .05).Sonically activated irrigation systems with a flexible tip can be beneficial for calcium hydroxide intracanal dressing removal in the curved apical canals."
https://openalex.org/W4282044982,"Background Freezing in the levodopa-medicated-state (ON-state) is a debilitating feature of Parkinson’s disease without treatment options. Studies detailing the distinguishing features between people with freezing of gait that improves with levodopa and those whose freezing continues even on levodopa are lacking. Objective To characterize the gross motor, gait, and non-motor features of this phenotype. Methods Instrumented continuous gait was collected in the levodopa-medicated-state in 105 patients: 43 non-freezers (no-FOG), 36 with freezing only OFF-levodopa (OFF-FOG) and 26 with freezing both ON- and OFF-levodopa (ONOFF-FOG). Evaluation of motor and non-motor disease features was undertaken using validated scales. A linear mixed model with age, sex, disease duration, and motor UPDRS scores as covariates was used to determine differences in spatiotemporal gait and non-motor disease features among the groups. Results Compared to OFF-FOG, the ONOFF-FOG group had greater disease severity (on the Unified Parkinson’s disease Rating Scale) and worse cognition (on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Frontal Assessment Battery and Scales for Outcome in Parkinson’s disease-Cognition scales) and quality of life (on the PDQ-39), but similar mood (on the Hamilton depression and anxiety scales) and sleep quality (on Epworth sleepiness scale and RBD questionnaire). For several gait features, differences between the ONOFF-OFF groups were at least as large and in the opposite direction as differences between OFF-no groups, controlling for disease severity. Variability in ONOFF-FOG was greater than in other groups. Using results from our study and others, a power analysis for a potential future study reveals sample sizes of at least 80 ONOFF and 80 OFF-FOG patients would be needed to detect clinically meaningful differences. Conclusions Intra-patient variability in spatiotemporal gait features was much greater in ONOFF-FOG than in the other two groups. Our results suggest that multifactorial deficits may lead to ONOFF-FOG development."

Twenty-eight participants aged ≥50 years with medial knee osteoarthritis and varus malalignment were recruited from the community. Three-dimensional full-body motion, ground reaction forces and surface electromyograms from twelve lower-limb muscles were acquired during six speed-matched walking trials for flat flexible and stable supportive shoes, tested in random order. An electromyogram-informed neuromusculoskeletal model with subject-specific geometry estimated bodyweight (BW) normalized MTCF. Waveforms were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping with a repeated measures analysis of variance model. Peak MTCF, MTCF impulse and MTCF loading rates (discrete outcomes) were evaluated using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance model.Statistical parametric mapping showed lower MTCF in stable supportive compared to flat flexible shoes during 5-18% of stance phase (p = 0.001). For the discrete outcomes, peak MTCF and MTCF impulse were not different between the shoe styles. However, mean differences [95%CI] in loading impulse (-0.02 BW·s [-0.02, 0.01], p<0.001), mean loading rate (-1.42 BW·s-1 [-2.39, -0.45], p = 0.01) and max loading rate (-3.26 BW·s-1 [-5.94, -0.59], p = 0.02) indicated lower measure of loading in stable supportive shoes compared to flexible shoes.Stable supportive shoes reduced MTCF during loading stance and reduced loading impulse/rates compared to flat flexible shoes and therefore may be more suitable in people with medial knee osteoarthritis and varus malalignment.Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (12619000622101)."
https://openalex.org/W4281679835,"Background Despite reforming health policies to create more enabling environments, insufficient physical activity in Sri Lanka remains a major public health issue. Socio-culture specific determinants underlying the physical activity of adults living in such environments need to be identified. The aim of this study was to explore the barriers and facilitators for physical activity, as perceived by adult urban dwellers in activity-friendly environments in Colombo District, Sri Lanka. Methods A qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted among adults aged 20–60 years living in an urban area which has been recently re-designed for recreational and rejuvenating purposes in Sri Lanka. Recruitment targeted varying socio-economic status and risk of non-communicable diseases; and was continued until the data saturation point was reached. Interviews were conducted in homes, primary healthcare units and fitness centres, and were transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis. Results A total of 31 eligible and consenting adults were interviewed. Of the reported barriers to physical activity, lack of time was very common. Other frequently reported barriers included unpleasant experiences following exercise and misconceptions about exercise, whereas physical environmental factors, weather and road safety were reported less frequently. All participants reported at least one facilitator for engaging in exercise. Expectations of preventing diseases, improving health, physical fitness, psycho-social wellbeing, optimising body functions and increasing lifespan were frequently cited as reasons to be active, while social factors such as positive attitudes of family members and the influence of peers were found to be motivating. Conclusions The study showed that while participants valued the health benefits of physical activity and refurbished activity-friendly urban environments, these were not sufficient to support them to overcome key perceived barriers to being physically active."
https://openalex.org/W4281892928,"A preliminary exploration of technical methodology for dynamic analysis of scaphoid, capitate, and lunate during unconstrained movements is performed in this study. A heavily accelerated and fat-saturated 3D Cartesian MRI acquisition was used to capture temporal frames of the unconstrained moving wrist of 5 healthy subjects. A slab-to-volume point-cloud based registration was then utilized to register the moving volumes to a high-resolution image volume collected at a neutral resting position. Comprehensive in-silico error analyses for different acquisition parameter settings were performed to evaluate the performance limits of several dynamic metrics derived from the registration parameters. Computational analysis suggested that sufficient volume coverage for the dynamic acquisitions was reached when collecting 12 slice-encodes at 2.5mm resolution, which yielded a temporal resolution of and 2.6 seconds per volumetric frame. These acquisition parameters resulted in total in-silico errors of 1.9°±1.8° and 3°±4.6° in derived principal rotation angles within ulnar-radial deviation and flexion-extension motion, respectively. Rotation components of the carpal bones in the radius coordinate system were calculated and found to be consistent with earlier 4D-CT studies. Temporal metric profiles derived from ulnar-radial deviation motion demonstrated better performance than those derived from flexion/extension movements. Future work will continue to explore the use of these methods in deriving more complex dynamic metrics and their application to subjects with symptomatic carpal dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W4281745084,"Polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I loci are known to have a great impact on disease progression in HIV-1 infection. Prevailing HIV-1 subtypes and HLA genotype distribution are different all over the world, and the HIV-1 and host HLA interaction could be specific to individual areas. Data on the HIV-1 and HLA interaction have been accumulated in HIV-1 subtype B- and C-predominant populations but not fully obtained in West Africa where HIV-1 subtype CRF02_AG is predominant. In the present study, to obtain accurate HLA typing data for analysis of HLA association with disease progression in HIV-1 infection in West African populations, HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) four-digit allele typing was performed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals in Ghana (n = 324) by a super high-resolution single-molecule sequence-based typing (SS-SBT) using next-generation sequencing. Comparison of the SS-SBT-based data with those obtained by a conventional sequencing-based typing (SBT) revealed incorrect assignment of several alleles by SBT. Indeed, HLA-A*23:17, HLA-B*07:06, HLA-C*07:18, and HLA-C*18:02 whose allele frequencies were 2.5%, 0.9%, 4.3%, and 3.7%, respectively, were not determined by SBT. Several HLA alleles were associated with clinical markers, viral load and CD4+ T-cell count. Of note, the impact of HLA-B*57:03 and HLA-B*58:01, known as protective alleles against HIV-1 subtype B and C infection, on clinical markers was not observed in our cohort. This study for the first time presents SS-SBT-based four-digit typing data on HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles in Ghana, describing impact of HLA on viral load and CD4 count in HIV-1 infection. Accumulation of these data would facilitate high-resolution HLA genotyping, contributing to our understanding of the HIV-1 and host HLA interaction in Ghana, West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4281749151,"Drivers of patterns of ectoparasitism in rodents in patchy Mojave Desert wetlands were investigated. A total of 1,571 ectoparasites in Mesostigmata, Trombidiformes, Siphonaptera and Ixodida were collected from 341 rodents ( Microtus californicus scirpensis , Mus musculus , Reithrodontomys megalotis , Peromyscus eremicus , and Neotoma lepida ) at eleven marshes. Trombiculids accounted for 82.5% of mites, followed by the mesostigmatid Ornithonyssus bacoti (17.5%), with chiggers predominating on voles and harvest mice. There were at least three genera of chiggers ( Eutrombicula alfreddugesi , Euschoengastia sp. novel, and Blankaartia sp. novel). Fleas included Orchopeas leucopus (90.3% of all fleas) and O . sexdentatus (9.7%), and ticks were the novel endemic Ixodes mojavensis (82.1% of ticks) and Dermacentor similis (17.9%). On all hosts and at all marshes, coverage-based rarefaction sampling was over 96%, indicating coverage sufficient for analysis. Dissimilarities in ectoparasite community structure were driven mainly by chiggers, I . mojavensis and O . leucopus . Northern marshes were dominated by chiggers; central marshes by I . mojavensis ; and southern marshes by O . leucopus . Primary determinants of ectoparasite community structure were host species, patch size, and parasite interspecific interactions. Host species richness and environmental factors such as patch distance and water and plant availability were not significantly associated with patterns of ectoparasitism. There were nine (60%) significant negative pairwise associations between ectoparasite taxa and no significant positive relationships. Ixodes mojavensis had the highest number of negative associations (with five other species), followed by chiggers and O . bacoti with two negative associations each. The study area is among the most arid in North America and supports numerous rare and endemic species in increasingly isolated wetland habitat patches; knowledge of ectoparasite ecology in this region identifies potential ectoparasite vectors, and provides information needed to design and implement programs to manage vector-borne diseases for purposes of wildlife conservation."

In Kuwait, diabetes prevalence in adults is estimated at 22.0%%-double the worldwide prevalence (9.3%). There is little current data on pharmaceutical costs in Kuwait of managing diabetes and diabetes-related complications and comorbidities.Estimate the utilization and cost of drugs for diabetes and diabetes-related complications and comorbidities in Kuwait for year 2018, as well determinants of costs.This cross-sectional study used a multi-stage stratified sampling method. Patients were Kuwaiti citizens with diabetes, aged 18-80, recruited from all six governorates. Physicians collected demographic data, clinical data, and current drug prescription for each patient which was extrapolated for the full year of 2018. A prevalence-based approach and bottom-up costing were used. Data were described according to facility type (primary care vs. hospital). A generalized linear model with log function and normal distribution compared drug costs for patients with and without comorbidities/complications after adjustments for demographic and health confounders (gender, age group, disease duration, and obesity).Of 1182 diabetes patients, 64.0% had dyslipidemia and 57.7% had hypertension. Additionally, 40.7% had diabetes-related complications, most commonly neuropathy (19.7%). Of all diabetes patients, 85.9% used oral antidiabetics (alone or in combinations), 49.5% used insulin alone or in combinations, and 29.3% used both oral antidiabetics and insulin. The most frequently used oral drug was metformin (75.7%), followed by DPP4 inhibitors (40.2%) and SGLT2 inhibitors (23.8%). The most frequently used injectables were insulin glargine (36.6%), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (15.4%). Total annual drug cost for Kuwait's diabetic population for year 2018 was US$201 million (US$1,236.30 per patient for antidiabetics plus drugs for comorbidities/complications).Drug costs for treating diabetes and comorbidities/complications accounted for an estimated 22.8% of Kuwait's 2018 drug expenditures.

https://openalex.org/W4282026423,"Trapa bispinosa Roxb. is a traditional Chinese food which is well known for its medicinal properties. The shell of Trapa bispinosa has anticancer activity, maybe due to its high content of polyphenols. There are few studies on the chemical composition of Trapa bispinosa shells, then we isolated the active components from Trapa bispinosa shell and clarified the mechanism of its anticancer activity. One monomer compound was separated from the ethanol extract of the Trapa bispinosa shell by fractional extraction, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 gel column chromatography and liquid phase separation. The structure, identified by NMR was 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose. The results of the CCK-8 assay showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, and the effect was close to that of 5-fluorouracil. Here, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could affect the cell cycle of SGC7901 cells. At the dose of 200 μg/mL and an incubation time of 48 h, SGC7901 cells remained in the G1 phase, apoptosis occurred, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the P53 signalling pathway associated with apoptosis. The results of qPCR and Western blot showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could induce apoptosis of SGC7901 cells by up-regulating the expression levels of P21, PUMA, PERP and IGF-BP3 genes, down-regulating the CyclinD gene, increasing the expression levels of cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9 protein and decreasing that of the protein BCL-2."

Astrocyte-like glia cells, fibrous lamellar glia cells and cortex glia cells were identified. Viral transduction targeted one specific type of glia cells that could not be identified. EGFP positive cells types were rather variable after electroporation, and viral transduction resulted in more homogenous groups of positive cells. We propose that these techniques remain a good alternative to transgenic animals because they potentially target only somatic cells."

https://openalex.org/W4281684252,"Immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 (IGSF1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with high expression in the mammalian pituitary gland. Mutations in the IGSF1 gene cause congenital central hypothyroidism in humans. The IGSF1 protein is co-translationally cleaved into N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD), the latter of which is trafficked to the plasma membrane and appears to be the functional portion of the molecule. Though the IGSF1-NTD is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and has no apparent function, it has a high degree of sequence identity with the IGSF1-CTD and is conserved across mammalian species. Based upon phylogenetic analyses, we propose that the ancestral IGSF1 gene encoded the IGSF1-CTD, which was duplicated and integrated immediately upstream of itself, yielding a larger protein encompassing the IGSF1-NTD and IGSF1-CTD. The selective pressures favoring the initial gene duplication and subsequent retention of a conserved IGSF1-NTD are unresolved."

Data from the HNSC subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and one previous single-cell RNA-seq dataset was used. Subgroup analysis was conducted in tumors from different anatomic sites. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune cell infiltration analysis were performed to check the influence of SEC11A on the tumor microenvironment. Among the genes significantly upregulated in the tumor group, only SEC11A expression (as a continuous variable) is independently associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 2.075, 95%CI: 1.447–2.977, p &lt;0.001) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR: 2.023, 95%CI: 1.284–3.187, p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis confirmed the prognostic value in tumors from three anatomic origins, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, oral cavity-related squamous cell carcinoma, and oropharynx-related squamous cell carcinoma. SEC11A is expressed in all subtypes of cells in the tumor microenvironment. Its expression showed a moderate positive correlation with its gene-level copy number (Pearson’s r = 0.53, p &lt;0.001). SEC11A expression was negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and B cells, but was positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblast and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment. In summary, SEC11A upregulation is a result of gene amplification in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Its upregulation might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker and a predictor of the infiltration of certain types of immune cells."

Aim This study aimed to evaluate the effects of hybrid compound RVT-FxMe, derived from resveratrol bearing a NO-donor subunit, on two murine model that display priapism phenotype, SCD transgenic mice and endothelial NO synthase gene-deficient (eNOS -/- ) mice. Methods Wild-type, SCD, and eNOS -/- mice were treated with RVT-FxMe (25 mg/kg/d, 2 weeks). Outcomes Hematological parameters, concentration-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), as well as to electrical field stimulation (EFS), were obtained in mice corpus cavernosum strips. Results Corpus cavernosum relaxations to SNP and EFS were increased in eNOS -/- group, which were normalized by RVT-FxMe treatment. SCD mice exhibited an excessive CC relaxant response induced by ACh, EFS and SNP RVT-FxMe treatment did not change the increased relaxant responses to ACh, EFS and SNP in corpus cavernosum from SCD group. Clinical translation Excess of plasma hemoglobin in SCD may interfere in pharmacological activity of NO donors compounds. Strength/Limitations While mechanistic data with promising potential is showed, the current study is not without limitations. RVT-FxMe effects in the mid- and long-term warrant complementary studies. Conclusion Treatment with RVT-FxMe reversed the enhanced NO-cGMP-mediated CC relaxations in eNOS -/- mice, but not in SCD mice; it is likely that excess of plasma hemoglobin in SCD mice act to inactivate NO before it reaches soluble guanylyl cyclase, avoiding restoration of NO bioavailability in penis."
