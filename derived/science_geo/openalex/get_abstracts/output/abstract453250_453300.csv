We performed the largest genome-wide association study for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau/ptau levels published to date (n = 1,269), identifying three genome-wide significant loci for CSF tau and ptau: rs9877502 (p = 4.89 × 10⁻⁹ for tau) located at 3q28 between GEMC1 and OSTN, rs514716 (p = 1.07 × 10⁻⁸ and p = 3.22 × 10⁻⁹ for tau and ptau, respectively), located at 9p24.2 within GLIS3 and rs6922617 (p = 3.58 × 10⁻⁸ for CSF ptau) at 6p21.1 within the TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare variants that increase AD risk. In independent data sets, rs9877502 showed a strong association with risk for AD, tangle pathology, and global cognitive decline (p = 2.67 × 10⁻⁴, 0.039, 4.86 × 10⁻⁵, respectively) illustrating how this endophenotype-based approach can be used to identify new AD risk loci."

Recently, we had demonstrated that these reactive astrocytes, or glia, can form self-renewing and multipotent neurospheres in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that it is only invasive injury, such as stab wounding or cerebral ischemia, and not noninvasive injury conditions, such as chronic amyloidosis or induced neuronal death, that can elicit this increase in plasticity. Furthermore, we find that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is the signal that acts directly on the astrocytes and is necessary and sufficient to elicit the stem cell response both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a molecular basis for how cells with neural stem cell lineage emerge at sites of brain injury and imply that the high levels of SHH known to enter the brain from extraneural sources after invasive injury can trigger this response.

Stab wound injury and MCAo elicit a profound stem cell response Noninvasive brain injury fails to elicit a stem cell response SHH is upregulated and required in lesion conditions with a stem cell response SHH transducer deletion in astrocytes reduces their proliferative response to injury Reactive gliosis is the prototypical response of the central nervous system (CNS) to diverse types of injury mediated by various cell types and involves the activation of microglia and all classes of macroglia: oligodendrocytes, NG2+ glia, and astroglia (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C.

After traumatic brain injury, a significant fraction of the cells isolated from injured CNS tissue has been shown to generate multipotent, self-renewing cells in vitro (Barnabé-Heider et al., 2010Barnabé-Heider F.

Genetic fate mapping identified a subtype of reactive astrocytes in the forebrain gray matter (GM) as the source of the cells that exhibit such neural stem cell (NSC) properties in vitro (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Origin of new glial cells in intact and injured adult spinal cord.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 470-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Cells that can take on an NSC character after injury could provide an important new resource for endogenous repair and could be particularly valuable in the case of neurodegenerative diseases associated with widespread neuronal damage, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Duyckaerts et al., 2009Duyckaerts C.

Olabarria M. Chvatal A. Verkhratsky A. Astroglia in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This prompts the question of the extent to which chronic neurodegeneration may actually elicit an NSC response. We addressed this question by comparing responses to acute ischemic lesion, traumatic injury, progressive (chronic) amyloid plaque deposition, and a noninvasive model of widespread neuronal death. To study the effects of progressive plaque deposition, we took advantage of APPPS1 mice. This mouse strain carries the Swedish double mutation, which results in overexpression of mutant forms of both the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) in neurons (Radde et al., 2006Radde R. Bolmont T. Kaeser S.A. Coomaraswamy J. Lindau D. Stoltze L. Calhoun M.E. Jäggi F. Wolburg H.

The consequences of endogenously induced neuronal death on reactive glia were examined after targeted activation of p25 expression in neurons of the cerebral cortex. This activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) elicits extensive loss of neurons, tau pathology, and intraneuronal Aβ accumulation, thus mimicking further hallmarks of AD (Cruz et al., 2003Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10536-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Analysis of these acute and chronic models revealed striking differences in the proliferative response of reactive glia and the appearance of cells with NSC properties, which enabled us to identify Sonic hedgehog (SHH) as a key regulator of the stem cell response in reactive glia. To examine the glial reaction over time in the presence of continuing amyloid plaque deposition, we first used immunostaining for Aβ to visualize amyloid plaques at 3 months of age in the brains of APPPS1 mice (Radde et al., 2006Radde R. Bolmont T. Kaeser S.A. Coomaraswamy J. Lindau D. Stoltze L. Calhoun M.E. Jäggi F. Wolburg H. Gengler S. et al.Abeta42-driven cerebral amyloidosis in transgenic mice reveals early and robust pathology.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and their subsequent spread throughout the cerebral cortex within the next months (Figure 1A). Hypertrophic astrocytes that were immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were mostly located in the vicinity of plaques in 3-month-old APPPS1 (APPPS1-3mo) mice and were detected in all neuronal layers at later times (Figures 1B and 1C). Many reactive astrocytes located in the GM of the cerebral cortex were also found to express proteins characteristic of immature glia or NSCs, such as nestin (Figure 1D), the membrane-associated proteoglycan DSD1 (the 473HD epitope), and tenascin-C (TNC, Figures S1A and S1B available online), all of which are typically upregulated in reactive astrocytes (Robel et al., 2011aRobel S. Berninger B. Götz M. The stem cell potential of glia: lessons from reactive gliosis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To determine whether these reactive astrocytes also proliferate, we provided the DNA base analog BrdU in the drinking water for 2 weeks. The incidence of BrdU-labeled cells was significantly increased in APPPS1-3mo mice relative to controls, and their numbers further increased thereafter (Figure 1F). Surprisingly, however, only 2.7% of all BrdU+ cells also expressed the astrocyte markers GFAP and/or S100β (Figures 1G and 1H), and this population accounted for as little as 1.1% of all astrocytes in the GM of APPPS1-6mo mice, while up to 50% of astrocytes incorporate BrdU after stab wound (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Conversely, Iba1+ microglia showed a strikingly robust proliferative response, constituting the majority of proliferating cells (Figures 1G and 1H), while the remaining 40% of the proliferative glial cell pool in the GM of APPPS1-6mo mice was composed of NG2+ glia (Figures 1G and 1H). Given the virtual absence of cell death in APPPS1 mice (Rupp et al., 2011Rupp N.J. Wegenast-Braun B.M. Radde R. Calhoun M.E. Jucker M. Early onset amyloid lesions lead to severe neuritic abnormalities and local, but not global neuron loss in APPPS1 transgenic mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2011; 32 (2324.e1-6)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we examined the glial reaction after neuronal overexpression of p25 induced by doxycycline withdrawal in CK/p25 mice at 6 weeks of age (Figure 2A, Cruz et al., 2003Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Aberrant Cdk5 activation by p25 triggers pathological events leading to neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles.Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, Cruz et al., 2006Cruz J.C. Kim D. Moy L.Y. Dobbin M.M. Sun X. Bronson R.T. Tsai L.H. p25/cyclin-dependent kinase 5 induces production and intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid beta in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10536-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Neuronal cell death became manifest within 2 weeks (CK/p25-2w) and resulted in profound shrinkage of the GM within 5 weeks (CK/p25-5w) (Figure 2B, Figures S2A and S2B). Reactive gliosis, as monitored by immunostaining for GFAP and Iba1, was clearly increased 14 days after p25 induction, while it is absent or less pronounced in controls (Figure 2C). Strikingly, the only glial cells to show increased proliferation were microglia (>100×), while neither astrocytes nor NG2 glia increased their proliferation rate despite the massive neuronal cell death (Figures 2D and 2E). As described previously (Simon et al., 2011Simon C. Götz M. Dimou L. Progenitors in the adult cerebral cortex: cell cycle properties and regulation by physiological stimuli and injury.Glia. 2011; 59: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), virtually all cells found to proliferate in the GM of controls for APPPS1 (6 months) and CK/p25 (∼3 months) (Figures 1H and 2D) are NG2 glia, and their rate of proliferation decreases with age in controls (Figure 1F; see also Behrendt et al., 2013Behrendt G. Baer K. Buffo A. Curtis M.A. Faull R.L. Rees M.I. Götz M. Dimou L. Dynamic changes in myelin aberrations and oligodendrocyte generation in chronic amyloidosis in mice and men.Glia. 2013; 61: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). While reactive astrocytes failed to proliferate in the above noninvasive models, they upregulated proteins also present in NSCs, such as nestin, the proteoglycan DSD1, or TNC (Figures S1 and S2C). This prompted us to probe their potential for neurosphere formation by isolating a defined volume of GM from the somatosensory cortex of noninjured controls, APPPS1 mice, and CK/p25 mice and plating the cells at clonal density (one to five cells/μl) for 14 days in vitro (div). Intact, uninjured GM gave rise to virtually no neurospheres, and only few neurospheres emerged from the GM of the APPPS1-6mo mice, although reactive gliosis was prominent at this age (Figures 3A and 3B ). The few neurospheres that did form, however, exhibited the typical hallmarks of true stem cells: they could be passaged and were capable of self-renewal, as indicated by the formation of secondary neurospheres (Figure 3B). One-third of the neurospheres were also multipotent and generated neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes when exposed to differentiation conditions for 7 div (Figure 3C). This degree of multipotency is quite comparable to that of spheres generated from stab-wound-injured or laser-lesioned cerebral cortex (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Focal laser-lesions activate an endogenous population of neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult visual cortex.Brain. 2009; 132: 2252-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because reactive astrocytes labeled by GLASTCreERT2-mediated recombination generated most neurospheres after stab wound injury (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), we crossed GLASTCreERT2, a knockin mouse line that faithfully expresses CreERT2 in GLAST+ cells, and a GFP reporter line (Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Colbert M.C. Robbins J. Neural crest cells retain multipotential characteristics in the developing valves and label the cardiac conduction system.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with APPPS1 mice (Figure S3A) to trace the origin of the few neurospheres formed upon amyloidosis. At the dosage of tamoxifen used for fate mapping, this population consists mostly of astrocytes in the GM of the cerebral cortex (Figures S3A and S3B; Mori et al., 2006Mori T. Tanaka K. Buffo A. Wurst W. Kühn R. Götz M.

Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar; Robel et al., 2011bRobel S. Bardehle S. Lepier A. Brakebusch C. Götz M. Genetic deletion of cdc42 reveals a crucial role for astrocyte recruitment to the injury site in vitro and in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2011; 30: 12471-12482Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All neurospheres derived from the cerebral cortex of 6-month-old APPPS1;GLASTCreERT2;CAG-eGFP mice that received tamoxifen 30 days before they were sacrificed were GFP+ (Figure S3C). Thus, the few self-renewing and multipotent cells with neurosphere-forming capabilities that appear during chronic amyloidosis in the GM of the cerebral cortex must be derived from GLAST+ astrocytes. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that massive neuronal cell death should elicit a stronger NSC response, virtually no primary spheres, and no secondary neurospheres at all, formed from cells isolated from 3-month-old CK/p25 mice 5 weeks after doxycycline withdrawal (Figure 3B). Thus, both of these noninvasive models of pathology largely fail to elicit neurosphere formation and prompt a rather low proliferative response of the reactive astrocytes, the population responsible for generating most neurospheres. Indeed, in injury models with higher rates of astrocyte proliferation, such as acute invasive injury, we observed a striking difference in the stem cell response. When cells were isolated from the tissue adjacent to a stab wound or the region that had been subjected to focal cerebral ischemia upon occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) with a filament for 1 hr (Plesnila et al., 2004Plesnila N. Zhu C. Culmsee C. Gröger M. Moskowitz M.A. Blomgren K. Nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor after focal cerebral ischemia.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2004; 24: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) at 3 days postinjury (3 dpi), we observed a 5-fold increase in the frequency of neurosphere formation compared to APPPS1 mice (Figures 3A and 3B; 45% of neurospheres from MCAo exhibited multipotency, data not shown). Thus, within 3 days after acute invasive injury, the neurosphere-forming response has reached a significant level, equivalent to one-fifth of the maximal incidence of stem cells obtainable from cells of the subependymal zone (SEZ). In models of chronic noninvasive injury, in contrast, such a response is virtually or totally absent. These models may either fail to elicit a latent stem cell potential or, alternatively, reactive glia/astrocytes may be prevented from manifesting such potential by inhibitory signals, such as aberrant Notch signaling due to the mutant form of presenilin present in the neurons of APPPS1 mice (De Strooper et al., 1999De Strooper B.

To address the first possibility, APP23 mice overexpressing only mutant APP, but not aberrant PS1 (Sturchler-Pierrat et al., 1997Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M. Wiederhold K.H. Mistl C. Rothacher S. Ledermann B. Bürki K. Frey P. Paganetti P.A. et al.Two amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer disease-like pathology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 13287-13292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar), were investigated at a comparable stage of amyloidosis, at 12 months of age (Boncristiano et al., 2005Boncristiano S.

USA. 1997; 94: 13287-13292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Cells isolated from these mice gave rise to comparably small number of neurospheres (Figure S3D), indicating that this trait cannot be attributed to the aberrant PS1 expression in APPPS1 mice. Next, APPPS1-9mo mice were subjected to stab wounding, and here we detected a significant increase in the number of primary and secondary neurospheres generated from cells obtained at 3 dpi compared to age-matched APPPS1 mice (Figure 3D). Moreover, the number of neurospheres formed was not significantly different from that observed when cells from age-matched control mice lacking amyloidosis were tested (Figure 3D). These findings indicate that cells with the potential to form neurospheres are still present in APPPS1 mice, but are largely impervious to activation by the signals elicited by amyloid plaque deposition. Interestingly, in the course of the above experiments, we noted that age had a strong influence on the rate of neurosphere formation after stab wound injury. Cells isolated at either 3 or 5 dpi from the cortex of 6- or 9-month-old mice subjected to stab wounding gave rise to 2- to 3-fold fewer neurospheres than cells obtained from 3-month-old mice (Figure 3E). However, irrespective of age, stab wound injury always elicits the appearance of a significantly higher number of neurospheres than does amyloidosis (Figure 3E), and no neurospheres have yet been obtained from the cortex of APPPS1-3mo mice, suggesting that the degree of amyloidosis and reactive gliosis at this point is too low to elicit any neurosphere formation at all (Figure 3E). The experiments described above uncovered a profound difference in the incidence of astrocyte proliferation and in vitro neurosphere formation elicited by invasive (stab wound, MCAo) versus noninvasive injury, such as amyloidosis or p25-induced neuronal death. To gain insight into the molecular basis for this differential response, we focused on pathways previously suggested to regulate the proliferation of reactive glia and measured levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and c-Jun (pc-Jun) (Figure S4) and levels of SHH (Amankulor et al., 2009Amankulor N.M.

Only levels of SHH were found to correlate with the proliferative and stem cell response. Both forms of SHH, the monomer (25 kDa) and the multimer (52 kDa), were detected in the GM of the cerebral cortex and their levels increased significantly on the ipsilateral side between 1 and 5 dpi (Figures 4A and 4B ). Intriguingly, a similar increase was observed 3 days after MCAo (Figure 4B), while no noteworthy changes in amounts of SHH were detected in the cerebral cortex of APPPS1, CK/p25 (Figures 4C and 4D), or APP23 mice (Figure S3E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SHH is upregulated specifically in injury models that display a significant increase in macroglia proliferation and neurosphere formation in response to insult. To determine the source of the increase in SHH after stab wound injury, we used immunostaining and in situ hybridization. In accordance with previous data (Alvarez et al., 2011Alvarez J.I.

Immunoreactivity and mRNA was also detected in some astrocytes and endothelial cells, especially after injury, but these cells made only a minor contribution to the total signal (data not shown). Because extraneural fluids infiltrate the brain parenchyma after invasive injury, we checked the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and found significant amounts of SHH (Figure 4G), suggesting that extraneural sources contribute to the higher SHH levels seen in the brain after invasive injury. It should be noted here that, while the stab wound does not penetrate the ventricles, it does disrupt the subarachnoid space overlying the cerebral cortex, which contains CSF. In order to determine the functional significance of SHH for the stem cell response of reactive glia, we first asked whether addition of SHH protein to the in vitro neurosphere assay affected the capacity of isolated cells to generate neurospheres. Quantitative assessment of cultures prepared from cortical GM at 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi revealed a significant increase in neurosphere formation in the presence of 5 nM SHH in cultures derived from 3 and 5 dpi cells compared with control cultures (Figure 5A). This effect could be blocked by the addition of cyclopamine (5 μM) (Figure 5A), a known inhibitor of SHH signaling (Chen et al., 2002Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling by direct binding of cyclopamine to Smoothened.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2142114820,"Microevolutionary adaptations and mechanisms of fungal pathogen resistance were explored in a melanic population of the Greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. Under constant selective pressure from the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, 25th generation larvae exhibited significantly enhanced resistance, which was specific to this pathogen and not to another insect pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae. Defense and stress management strategies of selected (resistant) and non-selected (susceptible) insect lines were compared to uncover mechanisms underpinning resistance, and the possible cost of those survival strategies. We hypothesize that the insects developed a transgenerationally primed resistance to the fungus B. bassiana, a costly trait that was achieved not by compromising life-history traits but rather by prioritizing and re-allocating pathogen-species-specific augmentations to integumental front-line defenses that are most likely to be encountered by invading fungi. Specifically during B. bassiana infection, systemic immune defenses are suppressed in favour of a more limited but targeted repertoire of enhanced responses in the cuticle and epidermis of the integument (e.g. expression of the fungal enzyme inhibitor IMPI, and cuticular phenoloxidase activity). A range of putative stress-management factors (e.g. antioxidants) is also activated during the specific response of selected insects to B. bassiana but not M. anisopliae. This too occurs primarily in the integument, and probably contributes to antifungal defense and/or helps ameliorate the damage inflicted by the fungus or the host’s own immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2083754863,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), a key mediator of cardiac fibroblast activation, has a major influence on collagen type I production. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which TGF-β induces collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) expression are not fully understood. This study was designed to examine whether or not DNA methylation is involved in TGF-β-induced COL1A1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts. Cells isolated from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured and stimulated with TGF-β1. The mRNA levels of COL1A1 and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were determined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the protein levels of collagen type I were determined via Western blot as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The quantitative methylation of the COL1A1 promoter region was analyzed using the MassARRAY platform of Sequenom. Results showed that TGF-β1 upregulated the mRNA expression of COL1A1 and induced the synthesis of cell-associated and secreted collagen type I in cardiac fibroblasts. DNMT1 and DNMT3a expressions were significantly downregulated and the global DNMT activity was inhibited when treated with 10 ng/mL of TGF-β1 for 48 h. TGF-β1 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the DNA methylation percentage across multiple CpG sites in the rat COL1A1 promoter. Thus, TGF-β1 can induce collagen type I expression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3a expressions as well as global DNMT activity, thereby resulting in DNA demethylation of the COL1A1 promoter. These findings suggested that the DNMT-mediated DNA methylation is an important mechanism in regulating the TGF-β1-induced COL1A1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2074801788,"Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can induce tumor regression in up to 50% or more of patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma. However, current methods to expand melanoma TIL, especially the “rapid expansion protocol” (REP) were not designed to enhance the generation of optimal effector-memory CD8+ T cells for infusion. One approach to this problem is to manipulate specific co-stimulatory signaling pathways to enhance CD8+ effector-memory T-cell expansion. In this study, we determined the effects of activating the TNF-R family member 4-1BB/CD137, specifically induced in activated CD8+ T cells, on the yield, phenotype, and functional activity of expanded CD8+ T cells during the REP. We found that CD8+ TIL up-regulate 4-1BB expression early during the REP after initial TCR stimulation, but neither the PBMC feeder cells in the REP or the activated TIL expressed 4-1BB ligand. However, addition of an exogenous agonistic anti-4-1BB IgG4 (BMS 663513) to the REP significantly enhanced the frequency and total yield of CD8+ T cells as well as their maintenance of CD28 and increased their anti-tumor CTL activity. Gene expression analysis found an increase in bcl-2 and survivin expression induced by 4-1BB that was associated with an enhanced survival capability of CD8+ post-REP TIL when re-cultured in the absence or presence of cytokines. Our findings suggest that adding an agonistic anti-4-1BB antibody during the time of TIL REP initiation produces a CD8+ T cell population capable of improved effector function and survival. This may greatly improve TIL persistence and anti-tumor activity in vivo after adoptive transfer into patients."
https://openalex.org/W2082924345,"Dedicated AAA+ ATPases deposit hexameric ring-shaped helicases onto DNA to promote replication in cellular organisms. To understand how loading occurs, we used electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine the ATP-bound structure of the intact E. coli DnaB⋅DnaC helicase/loader complex. The 480 kDa dodecamer forms a three-tiered assembly, in which DnaC adopts a spiral configuration that remodels N-terminal scaffolding and C-terminal motor regions of DnaB to produce a clear break in the helicase ring. Surprisingly, DnaC’s AAA+ fold is dispensable for ring remodeling because the DnaC isolated helicase-binding domain can both load DnaB onto DNA and increase the efficiency by which the helicase acts on substrates in vitro. Our data demonstrate that DnaC opens DnaB by a mechanism akin to that of polymerase clamp loaders and indicate that bacterial replicative helicases, like their eukaryotic counterparts, possess autoregulatory elements that influence how hexameric motor domains are loaded onto and unwind DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1975200631,"Option to attenuate atherosclerosis by depleting B2 cells is currently limited to anti-CD20 antibodies which deplete all B-cell subtypes. In the present study we evaluated the capacity of a monoclonal antibody to B cell activating factor-receptor (BAFFR) to selectively deplete atherogenic B2 cells to prevent both development and progression of atherosclerosis in the ApoE(-/-) mouse.To determine whether the BAFFR antibody prevents atherosclerosis development, we treated ApoE(-/-) mice with the antibody while feeding them a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Mature CD93(-) CD19(+) B2 cells were reduced by treatment, spleen B-cell zones disrupted and spleen CD20 mRNA expression decreased while B1a cells and non-B cells were spared. Atherosclerosis was ameliorated in the hyperlipidemic mice and CD19(+) B cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were reduced in atherosclerotic lesions. Expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, IL1β, TNFα, and IFNγ in the lesions were also reduced, while MCP1, MIF and VCAM-1 expressions were unaffected. Plasma immunoglobulins were reduced, but MDA-oxLDL specific antibodies were unaffected. To determine whether anti-BAFFR antibody ameliorates progression of atherosclerosis, we first fed ApoE(-/-) mice a HFD for 6 weeks, and then instigated anti-BAFFR antibody treatment for a further 6 week-HFD. CD93(-) CD19(+) B2 cells were selectively decreased and atherosclerotic lesions were reduced by this treatment.Anti-BAFFR monoclonal antibody selectively depletes mature B2 cells while sparing B1a cells, disrupts spleen B-cell zones and ameliorates atherosclerosis development and progression in hyperlipidemic ApoE(-/-) mice. Our findings have potential for clinical translation to manage atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2104293217,"Functional telomeres are critical for stem cell proliferation; however, whether they are equally important for the stability of stem cell differentiation is not known. We found that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with critically short telomeres (Tert(-/-) ESCs) initiated normal differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal but, unlike control ESCs, failed to maintain stable differentiation when LIF was reintroduced to the growth medium. Tert(-/-) ESCs expressed higher levels of Nanog and, overall, had decreased genomic CpG methylation levels, which included the promoters of Oct4 and Nanog. This unstable differentiation phenotype could be rescued by telomere elongation via reintroduction of Tert, via suppression of Nanog by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown, or via enforced expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3b. These results demonstrate an unexpected role of functional telomeres in the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of cell differentiation and suggest a potentially important role of telomere instability in cell fate during development or disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069679365,"Endocardial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process required for heart valve formation. Notch, Wnt and Bmp pathways are known to regulate this process. To further address how these pathways coordinate in the process, we specifically disrupted Notch1 or Jagged1 in the endocardium of mouse embryonic hearts and showed that Jagged1-Notch1 signaling in the endocardium is essential for EMT and early valvular cushion formation. qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization assays reveal that endocardial Jagged1-Notch1 signaling regulates Wnt4 expression in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardium and Bmp2 in the AVC myocardium. Whole embryo cultures treated with Wnt4 or Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) show that Bmp2 expression in the AVC myocardium is dependent on Wnt activity; Wnt4 also reinstates Bmp2 expression in the AVC myocardium of endocardial Notch1 null embryos. Furthermore, while both Wnt4 and Bmp2 rescue the defective EMT resulting from Notch inhibition, Wnt4 requires Bmp for its action. These results demonstrate that Jagged1-Notch1 signaling in endocardial cells induces the expression of Wnt4, which subsequently acts as a paracrine factor to upregulate Bmp2 expression in the adjacent AVC myocardium to signal EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2024664898,"Diabetes is associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and increased risk for adverse vascular and fibrogenic events post-MI. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cell (BMPC) therapy has been shown to promote neovascularization, decrease infarct area and attenuate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Unlike vascular effects, the anti-fibrosis mechanisms of BMPC, specifically under diabetic conditions, are poorly understood. We demonstrated that intramyocardial delivery of BMPCs in infarcted diabetic db/db mice significantly down-regulates profibrotic miRNA-155 in the myocardium and improves LV remodeling and function. Furthermore, inhibition of paracrine factor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling in vivo suppressed the BMPC-mediated inhibition of miR-155 expression and the associated protective effect on cardiac fibrosis and function. In vitro studies confirmed that the conditioned media of BMPC inhibited miR-155 expression and profibrotic signaling in mouse cardiac fibroblasts under diabetic conditions. However, neutralizing antibodies directed against HGF blocked these effects. Furthermore, miR-155 over-expression in mouse cardiac fibroblasts inhibited antifibrotic Sloan-Kettering Institute proto-oncogene (Ski) and Ski-related novel gene, non-Alu-containing (SnoN) signaling and abrogated antifibrogenic response of HGF. Together, our data demonstrates that paracrine regulation of cardiac miRNAs by transplanted BMPCs contributes to the antifibrotic effects of BMPC therapy. BMPCs release HGF, which inhibits miR-155-mediated profibrosis signaling, thereby preventing cardiac fibrosis. These data suggest that targeting miR-155 might serve as a potential therapy against cardiac fibrosis in the diabetic heart."
https://openalex.org/W2031376814,"Expression of A53T mutant human alpha-synuclein under the mouse prion promoter is among the most successful transgenic models of Parkinson's disease. Accumulation of A53T alpha-synuclein causes adult mice to develop severe motor impairment resulting in early death at 8-12 months of age. In younger, pre-symptomatic animals, altered motor activity and anxiety-like behaviors have also been reported. These behavioral changes, which precede severe neuropathology, may stem from non-pathological functions of alpha-synuclein, including modulation of monoamine neurotransmission. Our analysis over the adult life-span of motor activity, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors identifies perturbations both before and after the onset of disease. Young A53T mice had increased distribution of the dopamine transporter (DAT) to the membrane that was associated with increased striatal re-uptake function. DAT function decreased with aging, and was associated with neurochemical alterations that included increased expression of beta-synuclein and gamma synuclein. Prior to normalization of dopamine uptake, transient activation of Tau kinases and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the striatum were also observed. Aged A53T mice had reduced neuron counts in the substantia nigra pars compacta, yet striatal medium spiny neuron dendritic spine density was largely maintained. These findings highlight the involvement of the synuclein family of proteins and phosphorylation of Tau in the response to dopaminergic dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2087614072,"Characterizing the trophic relationships between large herbivores and the outstanding plant diversity in rainforest is a major challenge because of their elusiveness. This is crucial to understand the role of these herbivores in the functioning of the rainforest ecosystems. We tested a non-invasive approach based on the high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples using small plant plastid sequences (the trnL P6 loop) and ribosomal ITS1 primers, referred to as DNA metabarcoding, to investigate the diet of the largest neotropical herbivore, the lowland tapir. Sequencing was performed on plant DNA extracted from tapir faeces collected at the Nouragues station, a protected area of French Guiana. In spite of a limited sampling, our approach reliably provided information about the lowland tapir's diet at this site. Indeed, 95.1% and 74.4% of the plant families and genera identified thanks to the trnL P6 loop, respectively, matched with taxa already known to be consumed by tapirs. With this approach we were able to show that two families and eight new genera are also consumed by the lowland tapir. The taxonomic resolution of this method is limited to the plant family and genera. Complementary barcodes, such as a small portion of ITS1, can be used to efficiently narrow identifications down to the species in some problematic families. We will discuss the remaining limitations of this approach and how useful it is at this stage to unravel the diet of elusive rainforest herbivores and better understand their role as engineers of the ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2005120755,"Cognitive complaints involving problems with concentration, memory, decision-making and thinking are relatively common in the work force. The sensitivity of both subjective and objective cognitive functioning to common psychiatric conditions, stress levels and to cognitive load makes it plausible that psychosocial working conditions play a role in cognitive complaints. Thus, this study aimed to test the associations between psychosocial work factors and cognitive complaints in nationally representative samples of the Swedish work force. Cross-sectional (n = 9751) and prospective (n = 3644; two time points two years apart) sequential multiple regression analyses were run, adjusting for general confounders, depressive- and sleeping problems. Additional prospective analyses were run adjusting for baseline cognitive complaints.High quantitative demands, information and communication technology (ICT) demands, under qualification and conflicts were positively associated with cognitive complaints, while social support, good resources at work and over qualification were negatively associated with cognitive complaints in all models. Skill discretion and decision authority were weakly associated with cognitive complaints. Conflicts were more strongly associated with cognitive complaints in women than in men, after adjustment for general confounders.Quantitative job demands, ICT demands and under qualification were positively associated with future cognitive complaints in all models, including when adjusted for baseline cognitive complaints. Decision authority was weakly positively associated with future cognitive complaints, only after adjustment for depressive- and sleeping problems respectively. Social support was negatively associated with future cognitive complaints after adjustment for general confounders and baseline cognitive complaints. Skill discretion and resources were negatively associated with future cognitive complaints after adjustment for general confounders. The associations between quantitative demands and future cognitive complaints were stronger in women.The findings indicate that psychosocial working conditions should be taken into account when considering cognitive complaints among employees."
https://openalex.org/W2086996069,"Endosymbiont-bearing trypanosomatids have been considered excellent models for the study of cell evolution because the host protozoan co-evolves with an intracellular bacterium in a mutualistic relationship. Such protozoa inhabit a single invertebrate host during their entire life cycle and exhibit special characteristics that group them in a particular phylogenetic cluster of the Trypanosomatidae family, thus classified as monoxenics. In an effort to better understand such symbiotic association, we used DNA pyrosequencing and a reference-guided assembly to generate reads that predicted 16,960 and 12,162 open reading frames (ORFs) in two symbiont-bearing trypanosomatids, Angomonas deanei (previously named as Crithidia deanei) and Strigomonas culicis (first known as Blastocrithidia culicis), respectively. Identification of each ORF was based primarily on TriTrypDB using tblastn, and each ORF was confirmed by employing getorf from EMBOSS and Newbler 2.6 when necessary. The monoxenic organisms revealed conserved housekeeping functions when compared to other trypanosomatids, especially compared with Leishmania major. However, major differences were found in ORFs corresponding to the cytoskeleton, the kinetoplast, and the paraflagellar structure. The monoxenic organisms also contain a large number of genes for cytosolic calpain-like and surface gp63 metalloproteases and a reduced number of compartmentalized cysteine proteases in comparison to other TriTryp organisms, reflecting adaptations to the presence of the symbiont. The assembled bacterial endosymbiont sequences exhibit a high A+T content with a total of 787 and 769 ORFs for the Angomonas deanei and Strigomonas culicis endosymbionts, respectively, and indicate that these organisms hold a common ancestor related to the Alcaligenaceae family. Importantly, both symbionts contain enzymes that complement essential host cell biosynthetic pathways, such as those for amino acid, lipid and purine/pyrimidine metabolism. These findings increase our understanding of the intricate symbiotic relationship between the bacterium and the trypanosomatid host and provide clues to better understand eukaryotic cell evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1983307337,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the chances of achieving disease-free survival are low. Studies have demonstrated a supportive role of endothelial cells (ECs) in normal hematopoiesis. Here we show that similar intercellular relationships exist in leukemia. We demonstrate that leukemia cells themselves initiate these interactions by directly modulating the behavior of resting ECs through the induction of EC activation. In this inflammatory state, activated ECs induce the adhesion of a sub-set of leukemia cells through the cell adhesion molecule E-selectin. These adherent leukemia cells are sequestered in a quiescent state and are unaffected by chemotherapy. The ability of adherent cells to later detach and again become proliferative following exposure to chemotherapy suggests a role of this process in relapse. Interestingly, differing leukemia subtypes modulate this process to varying degrees, which may explain the varied response of AML patients to chemotherapy and relapse rates. Finally, because leukemia cells themselves induce EC activation, we postulate a positive-feedback loop in leukemia that exists to support the growth and relapse of the disease. Together, the data defines a new mechanism describing how ECs and leukemia cells interact during leukemogenesis, which could be used to develop novel treatments for those with AML."

C. andersoni was the only species found in the examined cattle in this province. Fifty-seven C. andersoni isolates were characterized into 5 MLST subtypes using multilocus sequence typing analysis, including a new subtype in the native beef breed Qinchuan cattle. All of these C. andersoni isolates presented a clonal genetic structure. These findings provide new insights into the genetic structure of C. andersoni isolates in Shaanxi province and basic data of Cryptosporidium prevalence status, which in turn have implications for controlling cryptosporidiosis in this province."
https://openalex.org/W2072709259,"Glutamate delta-1 (GluD1) receptors are expressed throughout the forebrain during development with high levels in the hippocampus during adulthood. We have recently shown that deletion of GluD1 receptor results in aberrant emotional and social behaviors such as hyperaggression and depression-like behaviors and social interaction deficits. Additionally, abnormal expression of synaptic proteins was observed in amygdala and prefrontal cortex of GluD1 knockout mice (GluD1 KO). However the role of GluD1 in learning and memory paradigms remains unknown. In the present study we evaluated GluD1 KO in learning and memory tests. In the eight-arm radial maze GluD1 KO mice committed fewer working memory errors compared to wildtype mice but had normal reference memory. Enhanced working memory in GluD1 KO was also evident by greater percent alternation in the spontaneous Y-maze test. No difference was observed in object recognition memory in the GluD1 KO mice. In the Morris water maze test GluD1 KO mice showed no difference in acquisition but had longer latency to find the platform in the reversal learning task. GluD1 KO mice showed a deficit in contextual and cue fear conditioning but had normal latent inhibition. The deficit in contextual fear conditioning was reversed by D-Cycloserine (DCS) treatment. GluD1 KO mice were also found to be more sensitive to foot-shock compared to wildtype. We further studied molecular changes in the hippocampus, where we found lower levels of GluA1, GluA2 and GluK2 subunits while a contrasting higher level of GluN2B in GluD1 KO. Additionally, we found higher postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and lower glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) expression in GluD1 KO. We propose that GluD1 is crucial for normal functioning of synapses and absence of GluD1 leads to specific abnormalities in learning and memory. These findings provide novel insights into the role of GluD1 receptors in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2025849119,"Caseinolytic (Clp) proteases are widespread energy-dependent proteases; the functional ATP-dependent protease is comprised of multimers of proteolytic and regulatory subunits. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two ClpP proteolytic subunits (ClpP1 and ClpP2), with both being essential for growth in vitro. ClpP1 and clpP2 are arranged in an apparent operon; we demonstrated that the two genes are co-expressed under normal growth conditions. We identified a single promoter region for the clpP1P2 operon; no promoter was detected upstream of clpP2 demonstrating that independent expression of clpP1 and clpP2 was highly unlikely. Promoter activity was not induced by heat shock or oxidative stress. We identified a regulatory region upstream of the promoter with a consensus sequence matching the ClgR regulator motif; we determined the limits of the region by mutagenesis and confirmed that positive regulation of the promoter occurs in M. tuberculosis. We developed a reporter system to monitor ClpP1 and ClpP2 enzymatic activities based on LacZ incorporating ssrAtag sequences. We showed that whilst both ClpP1 and ClpP2 degrade SsrA-tagged LacZ, ClpP2 (but not ClpP1) degrades untagged proteins. Our data suggest that the two proteolytic subunits display different substrate specificities and therefore have different, but overlapping roles in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026294309,"Obesity is an important risk factor for colon cancer in humans, and numerous studies have shown that a high fat diet enhances colon cancer development. As both increased adiposity and high fat diet can promote tumorigenesis, we examined the effect of diet-induced obesity, without ongoing high fat diet, on colon tumor development. C57BL/6J male mice were fed regular chow or high fat diet for 8 weeks. Diets were either maintained or switched resulting in four experimental groups: regular chow (R), high fat diet (H), regular chow switched to high fat diet (RH), and high fat diet switched to regular chow (HR). Mice were then administered azoxymethane to induce colon tumors. Tumor incidence and multiplicity were dramatically smaller in the R group relative to all groups that received high fat diet at any point. The effect of obesity on colon tumors could not be explained by differences in aberrant crypt foci number. Moreover, diet did not alter colonic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ, which were measured immediately after azoxymethane treatment. Crypt apoptosis and proliferation, which were measured at the same time, were increased in the HR relative to all other groups. Our results suggest that factors associated with obesity - independently of ongoing high fat diet and obesity - promote tumor development because HR group animals had significantly more tumors than R group, and these mice were fed the same regular chow throughout the entire carcinogenic period. Moreover, there was no difference in the number of aberrant crypt foci between these groups, and thus the effect of obesity appears to be on subsequent stages of tumor development when early preneoplastic lesions transition into adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W2020281578,"Bluetongue is an arboviral disease of ruminants causing significant economic losses. Our risk assessment is based on the epidemiological key parameter, the basic reproduction number. It is defined as the number of secondary cases caused by one primary case in a fully susceptible host population, in which values greater than one indicate the possibility, i.e., the risk, for a major disease outbreak. In the course of the Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) outbreak in Europe in 2006 we developed such a risk assessment for the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria. Basic reproduction numbers were calculated using a well-known formula for vector-borne diseases considering the population densities of hosts (cattle and small ruminants) and vectors (biting midges of the Culicoides obsoletus spp.) as well as temperature dependent rates. The latter comprise the biting and mortality rate of midges as well as the reciprocal of the extrinsic incubation period. Most important, but generally unknown, is the spatio-temporal distribution of the vector density. Therefore, we established a continuously operating daily monitoring to quantify the seasonal cycle of the vector population by a statistical model. We used cross-correlation maps and Poisson regression to describe vector densities by environmental temperature and precipitation. Our results comprise time series of observed and simulated Culicoides obsoletus spp. counts as well as basic reproduction numbers for the period 2009–2011. For a spatio-temporal risk assessment we projected our results from the location of Vienna to the entire region of Austria. We compiled both daily maps of vector densities and the basic reproduction numbers, respectively. Basic reproduction numbers above one were generally found between June and August except in the mountainous regions of the Alps. The highest values coincide with the locations of confirmed BTV cases."

Shrub willow is an annual flowering dioecious woody plant, and possesses many characteristics that lend it as a great model for tracking the missing pieces of sex determination evolution. To gain a global view of the genes differentially expressed in the male and female shrub willows and to develop a database for further studies, we performed a large-scale transcriptome sequencing of flower buds which were separately collected from two types of sexes.Totally, 1,201,931 high quality reads were obtained, with an average length of 389 bp and a total length of 467.96 Mb. The ESTs were assembled into 29,048 contigs, and 132,709 singletons. These unigenes were further functionally annotated by comparing their sequences to different proteins and functional domain databases and assigned with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A biochemical pathway database containing 291 predicted pathways was also created based on the annotations of the unigenes. Digital expression analysis identified 806 differentially expressed genes between the male and female flower buds. And 33 of them located on the incipient sex chromosome of Salicaceae, among which, 12 genes might involve in plant sex determination empirically. These genes were worthy of special notification in future studies.In this study, a large number of EST sequences were generated from the flower buds of a male and a female shrub willow. We also reported the differentially expressed genes between the two sex-type flowers. This work provides valuable information and sequence resources for uncovering the sex determining genes and for future functional genomics analysis of Salicaceae spp."

Therefore, de novo designing regulatory elements is brought back to the forefront of synthetic biology research. Here we developed a quantitative design method for regulatory elements based on strength prediction using artificial neural network (ANN). One hundred mutated Trc promoter & RBS sequences, which were finely characterized with a strength distribution from 0 to 3.559 (relative to the strength of the original sequence which was defined as 1), were used for model training and test. A precise strength prediction model, NET90_19_576, was finally constructed with high regression correlation coefficients of 0.98 for both model training and test. Sixteen artificial elements were in silico designed using this model. All of them were proved to have good consistency between the measured strength and our desired strength. The functional reliability of the designed elements was validated in two different genetic contexts. The designed parts were successfully utilized to improve the expression of BmK1 peptide toxin and fine-tune deoxy-xylulose phosphate pathway in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that the methodology based on ANN model can de novo and quantitatively design regulatory elements with desired strengths, which are of great importance for synthetic biology applications."
https://openalex.org/W2008399827,"Online game is an increasingly popular source of entertainment for all ages, with relatively prevalent negative consequences. Addiction is a problem that has received much attention. This research aims to develop a measure of online game addiction for Indonesian children and adolescents. The Indonesian Online Game Addiction Questionnaire draws from earlier theories and research on the internet and game addiction. Its construction is further enriched by including findings from qualitative interviews and field observation to ensure appropriate expression of the items. The measure consists of 7 items with a 5-point Likert Scale. It is validated by testing 1,477 Indonesian junior and senior high school students from several schools in Manado, Medan, Pontianak, and Yogyakarta. The validation evidence is shown by item-total correlation and criterion validity. The Indonesian Online Game Addiction Questionnaire has good item-total correlation (ranging from 0.29 to 0.55) and acceptable reliability (α = 0.73). It is also moderately correlated with the participant's longest time record to play online games (r = 0.39; p<0.01), average days per week in playing online games (ρ = 0.43; p<0.01), average hours per days in playing online games (ρ = 0.41; p<0.01), and monthly expenditure for online games (ρ = 0.30; p<0.01). Furthermore, we created a clinical cut-off estimate by combining criteria and population norm. The clinical cut-off estimate showed that the score of 14 to 21 may indicate mild online game addiction, and the score of 22 and above may indicate online game addiction. Overall, the result shows that Indonesian Online Game Addiction Questionnaire has sufficient psychometric property for research use, as well as limited clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2031572565,"The aim of this study was to isolate and identify marine-derived bacteria which exhibited high tolerance to, and an ability to biodegrade, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquids. The salinity and hydrocarbon load of some marine environments may induce selective pressures which enhance the ability of microbes to grow in the presence of these liquid salts. The isolates obtained in this study generally showed a greater ability to grow in the presence of the selected ionic liquids compared to microorganisms described previously, with two marine-derived bacteria, Rhodococcus erythropolis and Brevibacterium sanguinis growing in concentrations exceeding 1 M 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. The ability of these bacteria to degrade the selected ionic liquids was assessed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and three were shown to degrade the selected ionic liquids by up to 59% over a 63-day test period. These bacterial isolates represent excellent candidates for further potential applications in the bioremediation of ionic liquid-containing waste or following accidental environmental exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1970811881,"Elucidating the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islet β cells is important for understanding and treating diabetes. MIN6 cells, a transformed β-cell line derived from a mouse insulinoma, retain GSIS and are a popular in vitro model for insulin secretion. However, in long-term culture, MIN6 cells' GSIS capacity is lost. We previously isolated a subclone, MIN6 clone 4, from the parental MIN6 cells, that shows well-regulated insulin secretion in response to glucose, glybenclamide, and KCl, even after prolonged culture. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for preserving GSIS in this subclone, we compared four groups of MIN6 cells: Pr-LP (parental MIN6, low passage number), Pr-HP (parental MIN6, high passage number), C4-LP (MIN6 clone 4, low passage number), and C4-HP (MIN6 clone 4, high passage number). Based on their capacity for GSIS, we designated the Pr-LP, C4-LP, and C4-HP cells as “responder cells.” In a DNA microarray analysis, we identified a group of genes with high expression in responder cells (“responder genes”), but extremely low expression in the Pr-HP cells. Another group of genes (“non-responder genes”) was expressed at high levels in the Pr-HP cells, but at extremely low levels in the responder cells. Some of the responder genes were involved in secretory machinery or glucose metabolism, including Chrebp, Scgn, and Syt7. Among the non-responder genes were Car2, Maf, and Gcg, which are not normally expressed in islet β cells. Interestingly, we found a disproportionate number of known imprinted genes among the responder genes. Our findings suggest that the global expression profiling of GSIS-competent and GSIS-incompetent MIN6 cells will help delineate the gene regulatory networks for insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1983012929,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease with variable clinical outcome. Several prognostic factors such as the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IGHV) mutation status are linked to the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, supporting a role for triggering the BCR in vivo in the pathogenesis. The miRNA profile upon stimulation and correlation with IGHV mutation status is however unknown. To evaluate the transcriptional response of peripheral blood CLL cells upon BCR stimulation in vitro, miRNA and mRNA expression was measured using hybridization arrays and qPCR. We found both IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells to respond with increased expression of MYC and other genes associated with BCR activation, and a phenotype of cell cycle progression. Genome-wide expression studies showed hsa-miR-132-3p/hsa-miR-212 miRNA cluster induction associated with a set of downregulated genes, enriched for genes modulated by BCR activation and amplified by Myc. We conclude that BCR triggering of CLL cells induces a transcriptional response of genes associated with BCR activation, enhanced cell cycle entry and progression and suggest that part of the transcriptional profiles linked to IGHV mutation status observed in isolated peripheral blood are not cell intrinsic but rather secondary to in vivo BCR stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1988502968,"Obese people suffer from postural deficits and are more subject to falls than their lean counterpart. To improve prevention and post-fall rehabilitation programs, it seems important to better understand the posturo-kinetic disorders in daily life situations by determining the contribution of some key factors, mainly morphological characteristics and physical activity level, in the apparition of these disorders. Twelve severe android obese and eight healthy non obese adults performed a reaching task mobilizing the whole body. To further determine the origin of the postural and motor behavior differences, non obese individuals also performed an experimental session with additional constraints which simulated some of the obese morphological characteristics. Impact of the sedentary lifestyle was also studied by dissociation of the obese in two subgroups: physically « active » and physically « inactive ». Movement kinetics and kinematics were characterized with an optoelectronic system synchronized to a force platform. The mechanical equilibrium pattern was evaluated through the displacements of the Centre of Mass (CoM) and the centre of foot pressure within the Base of Support (BoS). Results showed that obesity decreased movement speed (≈−23%, p<0.01), strongly increased CoM displacement (≈+30%, p<0.05) and induced an important spatio-temporal desynchronization (≈+40%, p<0.05) of the focal and postural components of the movement during the transition between the descending and ascending movements. The role of some morphological characteristics and of physical activity on obese patients' postural control disorder is discussed and set back in the more general context of overall factors contributing to postural deficits with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2047759803,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a crucial process for plant innate immunity and development. In plant innate immunity, PCD is believed to prevent the spread of pathogens from the infection site. Although proper control of PCD is important for plant fitness, we have limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating plant PCD. Plant innate immunity triggered by recognition of effectors (effector-triggered immunity, ETI) is often associated with PCD. However pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), which is triggered by recognition of elicitors called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), is not. Therefore we hypothesized that PTI might suppress PCD. Here we report that PCD triggered by the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) can be suppressed by PTI in Arabidopsis. FB1-triggered cell death was suppressed by treatment with the MAMPs flg22 (a part of bacterial flagellin) or elf18 (a part of the bacterial elongation factor EF-Tu) but not chitin (a component of fungal cell walls). Although plant hormone signaling is associated with PCD and PTI, both FB1-triggered cell death and suppression of cell death by flg22 treatment were still observed in mutants deficient in jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling. The MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK6 are transiently activated and inactivated within one hour during PTI. We found that FB1 activated MPK3 and MPK6 about 36-48 hours after treatment. Interestingly, this late activation was attenuated by flg22 treatment. These results suggest that PTI suppression of FB1-triggered cell death may involve suppression of MPK3/MPK6 signaling but does not require JA/ET/SA signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1991993829,"Understanding how plant trait-species abundance relationships change with a range of single and multivariate environmental properties is crucial for explaining species abundance and rarity. In this study, the abundance of 94 woody plant species was examined and related to 15 plant leaf and wood traits at both local and landscape scales involving 31 plots in subtropical forests in eastern China. Further, plant trait-species abundance relationships were related to a range of single and multivariate (PCA axes) environmental properties such as air humidity, soil moisture content, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil organic matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents. At the landscape scale, plant maximum height, and twig and stem wood densities were positively correlated, whereas mean leaf area (MLA), leaf N concentration (LN), and total leaf area per twig size (TLA) were negatively correlated with species abundance. At the plot scale, plant maximum height, leaf and twig dry matter contents, twig and stem wood densities were positively correlated, but MLA, specific leaf area, LN, leaf P concentration and TLA were negatively correlated with species abundance. Plant trait-species abundance relationships shifted over the range of seven single environmental properties and along multivariate environmental axes in a similar way. In conclusion, strong relationships between plant traits and species abundance existed among and within communities. Significant shifts in plant trait-species abundance relationships in a range of environmental properties suggest strong environmental filtering processes that influence species abundance and rarity in the studied subtropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W1968483633,"Background Deletion of 3p is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), suggesting the existence of one or more tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) within these regions. In this study, one TSG, CACNA2D3 at 3p21.1, was characterized. Methods Expression of CACNA2D3 in ESCCs was tested by quantitative real-time PCR and tissue microarray. The mechanism of CACNA2D3 downregulation was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR). The tumor suppressive function of CACNA2D3 was characterized by both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic assays, cell migration and invasion assays. Results CACNA2D3 was frequently downregulated in ESCCs (24/48, 50%), which was significantly associated with promoter methylation and allele loss (P<0.05). Tissue microarray result showed that downregulation of CACNA2D3 was detected in (127/224, 56.7%) ESCCs, which was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01), TNM staging (P = 0.003) and poor outcome of ESCC patients (P<0.05). Functional studies demonstrated that CACNA2D3 could inhibit tumorigenicity, cell motility and induce apoptosis. Mechanism study found that CACNA2D3 could arrest cell cycle at G1/S checkpoint by increasing expressions of p21 and p53 and decreasing expression of CDK2. In addition, CACNA2D3 could upregulate intracellular free cytosolic Ca2+ and subsequently induce apoptosis. Conclusion CACNA2D3 is a novel TSG responsible to the 3p21 deletion event and plays a critical suppressing role in the development and progression of ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2055606397,"Dog models with spontaneously occurring mutations in retinal dystrophy genes are an invaluable resource for preclinical development of retinal gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been most successful; to target the outer retina and RPE they are delivered by subretinal injection, causing a temporary retinal detachment with some potential for retinal morbidity. A recent reporter gene study using an AAV2/8 vector in dogs reported transgene expression beyond the boundary of the subretinal bleb. This could be a desirable feature which increases the area of retina treated while minimizing the retinal detachment and any associated morbidity. We performed a detailed study of the lateral spread of transgene expression beyond the subretinal injection site following subretinally delivered AAV vectors in normal dogs. Vectors expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a small chicken beta-actin promoter. AAV2/2 (quadruple tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y-F) capsid mutant), self-complementary (sc) AAV2/8 (single Y-F capsid mutant) and a scAAV2/5 were used. We found that in all eyes GFP expression involved retina beyond the initial post-injection subretinal bleb boundary. In all eyes there was post-injection spread of the retinal detachment within the first 3 days post procedure and prior to retinal reattachment. In 11/16 eyes this accounted for the entire ""lateral spread"" of GFP expression while in 5/16 eyes a very slight extension of GFP expression beyond the final boundary of the subretinal bleb could be detected. All 3 AAV constructs induced GFP expression in the nerve fiber layer with spread to the optic nerve. Patients treated by subretinal injection should be monitored for possible expansion of the subretinal injection bleb prior to reattachment. Injections in the para-foveal region may expand to lead to a foveal detachment that may be undesirable. Cell-specific promoters may be required to limit spread of expressed transgene to the brain with these AAV serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2050284245,"After fertilization, the sperm and oocyte genomes undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming to form a totipotent zygote. The dynamic epigenetic changes during early embryo development primarily involve DNA methylation and demethylation. We have previously identified Gse (gonad-specific expression gene) to be expressed specifically in germ cells and early embryos. Its encoded protein GSE is predominantly localized in the nuclei of cells from the zygote to blastocyst stages, suggesting possible roles in the epigenetic changes occurring during early embryo development. Here, we report the involvement of GSE in epigenetic reprogramming of the paternal genome during mouse zygote development. Preferential binding of GSE to the paternal chromatin was observed from pronuclear stage 2 (PN2) onward. A knockdown of GSE by antisense RNA in oocytes produced no apparent effect on the first and second cell cycles in preimplantation embryos, but caused a significant reduction in the loss of 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) and the accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) in the paternal pronucleus. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels in CpG sites of LINE1 transposable elements, Lemd1, Nanog and the upstream regulatory region of the Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) gene were clearly increased in GSE-knockdown zygotes at mid-pronuclear stages (PN3-4), but the imprinted H19-differential methylated region was not affected. Importantly, DNA immunoprecipitation of 5 mC and 5 hmC also indicates that knockdown of GSE in zygotes resulted in a significant reduction of the conversion of 5 mC to 5 hmC on LINE1. Therefore, our results suggest an important role of maternal GSE for mediating active DNA demethylation in the zygote."
https://openalex.org/W2031979341,"A considerable number of previous studies have shown abnormalities in the processing of emotional faces in major depression. Fewer studies, however, have focused specifically on abnormal processing of neutral faces despite evidence that depressed patients are slow and less accurate at recognizing neutral expressions in comparison with healthy controls. The current study aimed to investigate whether this misclassification described behaviourally for neutral faces also occurred when classifying patterns of brain activation to neutral faces for these patients.TWO INDEPENDENT DEPRESSED SAMPLES: (1) Nineteen medication-free patients with depression and 19 healthy volunteers and (2) Eighteen depressed individuals and 18 age and gender-ratio-matched healthy volunteers viewed emotional faces (sad/neutral; happy/neutral) during an fMRI experiment. We used a new pattern recognition framework: first, we trained the classifier to discriminate between two brain states (e.g. viewing happy faces vs. viewing neutral faces) using data only from healthy controls (HC). Second, we tested the classifier using patterns of brain activation of a patient and a healthy control for the same stimuli. Finally, we tested if the classifier's predictions (predictive probabilities) for emotional and neutral face classification were different for healthy controls and depressed patients.Predictive probabilities to patterns of brain activation to neutral faces in both groups of patients were significantly lower in comparison to the healthy controls. This difference was specific to neutral faces. There were no significant differences in predictive probabilities to patterns of brain activation to sad faces (sample 1) and happy faces (samples 2) between depressed patients and healthy controls.Our results suggest that the pattern of brain activation to neutral faces in depressed patients is not consistent with the pattern observed in healthy controls subject to the same stimuli. This difference in brain activation might underlie the behavioural misinterpretation of the neutral faces content by the depressed patients."

The molecular mechanisms underlying this complex, multi-step pathway are yet to be completely elucidated. Recent reports have stressed the importance of intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the development of a metastatic phenotype. The purpose of this study was to characterize the intra-tumoral phenotypic heterogeneity between two iso-clonal human colon cancer sublines HCT116 and HCT116b on their ability to undergo metastatic colonization and survive under growth factor deprivation stress (GFDS).HCT116 and HCT116b cells were transfected with green fluorescence protein and subcutaneously injected into BALB/c nude male mice. Once xenografts were established, they were excised and orthotopically implanted into other male BALB/c nude mice using microsurgical techniques. Animal tissues were studied for metastases using histochemical techniques. Microarray analysis was performed to generate gene signatures associated with each subline. In vitro assessment of growth factor signaling pathway was performed under GFDS for 3 and 5 days.Both HCT116 and HCT116b iso-clonal variants demonstrated 100% primary tumor growth, invasion and peritoneal spread. However, HCT116 was highly metastatic with 68% metastasis observed in liver and/or lungs compared to 4% in HCT116b. Microarray analysis revealed an upregulation of survival and metastatic genes in HCT116 cells compared to HCT116b cells. In vitro analysis showed that HCT116 upregulated survival and migratory signaling proteins and downregulated apoptotic agents under GFDS. However, HCT116b cells effectively showed the opposite response under stress inducing cell death.We demonstrate the importance of clonal variation in determining metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells using the HCT116/HCT116b iso-clonal variants in an orthotopic metastatic mouse model. Determination of clonal heterogeneity in patient tumors can serve as useful tools to identify clinically relevant biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic assessment of metastatic colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1986244156,"Phenol red is widely used in cell culture as a pH indicator. Recently, it also has been reported to have estrogen-like bioactivity and be capable of promoting cell proliferation in different cell lines. However, the effect of phenol red on primary neuronal culture has never been investigated. By using patch clamp technique, we demonstrated that hippocampal pyramidal neurons cultured in neurobasal medium containing no phenol red had large depolarization-associated epileptiform bursting activities, which were rarely seen in neurons cultured in phenol red-containing medium. Further experiment data indicate that the suppressive effect of the phenol red on the abnormal epileptiform burst neuronal activities was U-shape dose related, with the most effective concentration at 28 µM. In addition, this concentration related inhibitory effect of phenol red on the epileptiform neuronal discharges was mimicked by 17-β-estradiol, an estrogen receptor agonist, and inhibited by ICI-182,780, an estrogen receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that estrogen receptor activation by phenol red in the culture medium prevents formation of abnormal, epileptiform burst activity. These studies highlight the importance of phenol red as estrogen receptor stimulator and cautions of careful use of phenol red in cell culture media."
https://openalex.org/W1978863652,"The phytohormone auxin plays a critical role in plant development, including embryogenesis, organogenesis, tropism, apical dominance and in cell growth, division, and expansion. In these processes, the concentration gradient of auxin, which is established by polar auxin transport mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins and several ATP-binding cassette/multi-drug resistance/P-glycoprotein (ABCB/MDR/PGP) transporters, is a crucial signal. Here, we characterized the function of ABCB19 in the control of Arabidopsis organ boundary development. We identified a new abcb19 allele, abcb19-5, which showed stem-cauline leaf and stem-pedicel fusion defects. By virtue of the DII-VENUS marker, the auxin level was found to be increased at the organ boundary region in the inflorescence apex. The expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) was decreased, while no obvious change in the expression of CUC3 was observed, in abcb19. In addition, the fusion defects were greatly enhanced in cuc3 abcb19-5, which was reminiscent of cuc2 cuc3. We also found that some other organ boundary genes, such as LOF1/2 were down-regulated in abcb19. Together, these results reveal a new aspect of auxin transporter ABCB19 function, which is largely dependent on the positive regulation of organ boundary genes CUC2 and LOFs at the postembryonic organ boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2017658155,"Background Heart failure patients have inadequate nutritional intake and alterations in metabolism contributing to an overall energy depleted state. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is a common and successful intervention in patients with end-stage heart failure. LVAD support leads to alterations in cardiac output, functional status, neurohormonal activity and transcriptional profiles but the effects of LVADs on myocardial metabolism are unknown. This study set out to measure cardiac metabolites in non-failing hearts, failing hearts, and hearts post-LVAD support. Methods The study population consisted of 8 non-ischemic failing (at LVAD implant) and 8 post-LVAD hearts, plus 8 non-failing hearts obtained from the tissue bank at the University of Colorado. NMR spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate differences in myocardial energy substrates. Paired and non-paired t-tests were used to determine differences between the appropriate groups. Results Glucose and lactate values both decreased from non-failing to failing hearts and increased again significantly in the (paired) post-LVAD hearts. Glutamine, alanine, and aromatic amino acids decreased from non-failing to failing hearts and did not change significantly post-LVAD. Total creatine and succinate decreased from non-failing to failing hearts and did not change significantly post-LVAD. Discussion Measured metabolites related to glucose metabolism are diminished in failing hearts, but recovered their values post-LVAD. This differed from the amino acid levels, which decreased in heart failure but did not recover following LVAD. Creatine and the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate followed a similar pattern as the amino acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W2034848011,"The universal facial attractiveness (UFA) hypothesis proposes that some facial features are universally preferred because they are reliable signals of mate quality. The primary evidence for this hypothesis comes from cross-cultural studies of perceived attractiveness. However, these studies do not directly address patterns of morphological variation at the population level. An unanswered question is therefore: Are universally preferred facial phenotypes geographically invariant, as the UFA hypothesis implies? The purpose of our study is to evaluate this often overlooked aspect of the UFA hypothesis by examining patterns of geographic variation in chin shape. We collected symphyseal outlines from 180 recent human mandibles (90 male, 90 female) representing nine geographic regions. Elliptical Fourier functions analysis was used to quantify chin shape, and principle components analysis was used to compute shape descriptors. In contrast to the expectations of the UFA hypothesis, we found significant geographic differences in male and female chin shape. These findings are consistent with region-specific sexual selection and/or random genetic drift, but not universal sexual selection. We recommend that future studies of facial attractiveness take into consideration patterns of morphological variation within and between diverse human populations."

However, VCT service has not been effectively utilized among rural migrants, a high risk group in China. In this study, we developed a community based intervention to examine if community mobilization with comprehensive VCT is more effective than current HIV preventions with routine VCT service in promoting VCT acceptability among rural migrants in Shanghai, China.A comprehensive intervention with community mobilization and comprehensive VCT services including community-based VCT and mobile VCT was implemented during 2007-2009. Three communities in Minhang District of Shanghai were randomly selected and were designed to receive community mobilization and comprehensive VCT, traditional VCT and none intervention, respectively. After 24 months intervention, effects were evaluated by comparing outcome indicators between the baseline (2,690 participants) and follow-up surveys (1,850 participants).A substantial increase in VCT acceptance was observed among community mobilization group (94.9% vs. 88.5%, P<0.001), whereas the reverse effect was seen in the traditional VCT group (86.1% vs. 94.6%, P<0.001) and control group (69.0% vs. 91.7%, P<0.001). Rural migrants from community mobilization group were more likely to accept VCT (OR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.69-4.97). Rural migrants from community mobilization group also showed significant increase in HIV/AIDS knowledge, positive attitude towards HIV positive individuals and condom use.Community mobilization with comprehensive VCT has significant impact on promotion of VCT acceptance and utilization among rural migrants in Shanghai. These findings provide evidence to support community mobilization as a suitable strategy for VCT promotion among rural migrants in Shanghai, China."
https://openalex.org/W2000966408,"The adult Drosophila melanogaster body develops from imaginal discs, groups of cells set-aside during embryogenesis and expanded in number during larval stages. Specification and development of Drosophila imaginal discs have been studied for many years as models of morphogenesis. These studies are often based on mutations with large developmental effects, mutations that are often lethal in embryos when homozygous. Such forward genetic screens can be limited by factors such as early lethality and genetic redundancy. To identify additional genes and genetic pathways involved in leg imaginal disc development, we employed a Genome Wide Association Study utilizing the natural genetic variation in leg proportionality found in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel fly lines. In addition to identifying genes already known to be involved in leg development, we identified several genes involved in pathways that had not previously been linked with leg development. Several of the genes appear to be involved in signaling activities, while others have no known roles at this time. Many of these uncharacterized genes are conserved in mammals, so we can now begin to place these genes into developmental contexts. Interestingly, we identified five genes which, when their function is reduced by RNAi, cause an antenna-to-leg transformation. Our results demonstrate the utility of this approach, integrating the tools of quantitative and molecular genetics to study developmental processes, and provide new insights into the pathways and networks involved in Drosophila leg development."
https://openalex.org/W2027623537,"Oscillations have been increasingly recognized as a core property of neural responses that contribute to spontaneous, induced, and evoked activities within and between individual neurons and neural ensembles. They are considered as a prominent mechanism for information processing within and communication between brain areas. More recently, it has been proposed that interactions between periodic components at different frequencies, known as cross-frequency couplings, may support the integration of neuronal oscillations at different temporal and spatial scales. The present study details methods based on an adaptive frequency tracking approach that improve the quantification and statistical analysis of oscillatory components and cross-frequency couplings. This approach allows for time-varying instantaneous frequency, which is particularly important when measuring phase interactions between components. We compared this adaptive approach to traditional band-pass filters in their measurement of phase-amplitude and phase-phase cross-frequency couplings. Evaluations were performed with synthetic signals and EEG data recorded from healthy humans performing an illusory contour discrimination task. First, the synthetic signals in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations highlighted two desirable features of the proposed algorithm vs. classical filter-bank approaches: resilience to broad-band noise and oscillatory interference. Second, the analyses with real EEG signals revealed statistically more robust effects (i.e. improved sensitivity) when using an adaptive frequency tracking framework, particularly when identifying phase-amplitude couplings. This was further confirmed after generating surrogate signals from the real EEG data. Adaptive frequency tracking appears to improve the measurements of cross-frequency couplings through precise extraction of neuronal oscillations."

Spatial analyses have been applied in an attempt to identify environmental risk factors, but most studies do not take human mobility into account. The aim of this study was to identify clustering of NHL in space and time in Denmark, using 33 years of residential addresses. We utilised the nation-wide Danish registers and unique personal identification number that all Danish citizens have to conduct a register-based case-control study of 3210 NHL cases and two independent control groups of 3210 each. Cases were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry and controls were matched by age and sex and randomly selected from the Civil Registration System. Residential addresses of cases and controls from 1971 to 2003 were collected from the Civil Registration System and geocoded. Data on pervious hospital diagnoses and operations were obtained from the National Patient Register. We applied the methods of the newly developed Q-statistics to identify space-time clustering of NHL. All analyses were conducted with each of the two control groups, and we adjusted for previous history of autoimmune disease, HIV/AIDS or organ transplantation. Some areas with statistically significant clustering were identified; however, results were not consistent across the two control groups; thus we interpret the results as chance findings. We found no evidence for clustering of NHL in space and time using 33 years of residential histories, suggesting that if the rise in incidence of NHL is a result of risk factors that vary across space and time, the spatio-temporal variation of such factors in Denmark is too small to be detected with the applied method."
https://openalex.org/W2000098445,"The origin of extraordinarily rich biodiversity in tropical forests is often attributed to evolution under stable climatic conditions over a long period or to climatic fluctuations during the recent Quaternary period. Here, we test these two hypotheses using Dracaena cambodiana, a plant species distributed in paleotropical forests.WE ANALYZED NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE DATA OF TWO CHLOROPLAST DNA (CPDNA: atpB-rbcL and trnD-trnT) regions and genotype data of six nuclear microsatellites from 15 populations (140 and 363 individuals, respectively) distributed in Indochina Peninsular and Hainan Island to infer the patterns of genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure. The population bottleneck and genetic drift were estimated based upon nuclear microsatellites data using the software programs BOTTLENECK and 2MOD. The lineage divergence times and past population dynamics based on cpDNA data were estimated using coalescent-based isolation-with-migration (IMa) and BEAST software programs.A significant phylogeographic structure (N ST = 0.876, G ST = 0.796, F ST-SSR = 0.329, R ST = 0.449; N ST>G ST, R ST>F ST-SSR, P<0.05) and genetic differentiation among populations were detected. Bottleneck analyses and Bayesian skyline plot suggested recent population reduction. The cpDNA haplotype network revealed the ancestral populations from the southern Indochina region expanded to northward. The most recent ancestor divergence time of D. cambodiana dated back to the Tertiary era and rapid diversification of terminal lineages corresponded to the Quaternary period.The results indicated that the present distribution of genetic diversity in D. cambodiana was an outcome of Tertiary dispersal and rapid divergence during the Quaternary period under limited gene flow influenced by the uplift of Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau and Quaternary climatic fluctuations respectively. Evolutionary processes, such as extinction-recolonization during the Pleistocene may have contributed to the fast diversification in D. cambodiana."

To that end, 21 outpatients with schizophrenia and 23 healthy comparison subjects performed a visual attention task in the presence or absence of distracting, environmentally relevant ""urban"" noise while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T. The task had two conditions (difficult and easy); task-related neural activity was defined as difficult - easy. During task performance, a significant distraction (noise or silence) by group (patient or control) interaction was observed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right hippocampus, left temporoparietal junction, and right fusiform gyrus, with patients showing relative hypoactivation during noise compared to controls. In patients, the ability to recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the task in noise was negatively correlated with the effect of noise on reaction time. Clinically, the ability to recruit the fusiform gyrus during the task in noise was negatively correlated with SANS affective flattening score, and hippocampal recruitment during the task in noise was positively correlated with global functioning. In conclusion, schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in neural response during visual attention tasks in the presence of cross-modal noise distraction. These response differences may predict global functioning in the illness, and may serve as a biomarker for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2129558341,"Increased levels of N-linked (β-N- acetylglucosamine)2 [N-GlcNAc2]-modified proteins have been recognized to be an effective response to glucose deprivation. In the first step of this study, using a next generation sequencer, we investigated the global transcriptional changes induced by glucose deprivation in a T24 bladder carcinoma cell line, producing N-GlcNAc2-modified proteins under glucose deprivation. Our transcriptome analysis revealed significant up-regulation of the UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis pathway and unfolded protein response genes, and down-regulation of G2/M transition-related genes containing mitotic kinases. Our biological analysis confirmed that N-GlcNAc2-modified proteins were localized with BiP proteins in the ER. G2/M arrest was caused by glucose deprivation in T24 cells. Moreover, the knockdown of unfolded protein response genes induced the expressional recovery of mitotic kinases under glucose deprivation. Taken together, our results suggest N-GlcNAc2-modified proteins produced under glucose deprivation caused unfolded protein response in the ER, and that this response induced G2/M arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1992682605,"The promoter of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene CFTR is tightly controlled by regulators including CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). We previously reported that the transcription factors YY1 and USF2 affect CFTR expression. We can now demonstrate that C/EBPβ, a member of the CCAAT family, binds to the CFTR promoter and contributes to its transcriptional activity. Our data reveal that C/EBPβ cooperates with USF2 and acts antagonistically to YY1 in the control of CFTR expression. Interestingly, YY1, a strong repressor, fails to repress the CFTR activation induced by USF2 through DNA binding competition. Collectively, the data strongly suggest a model by which USF2 functionally interacts with YY1 blocking its inhibitory activity, in favour of C/EBPβ transactivation. Further investigation into the interactions between these three proteins revealed that phosphorylation of C/EBPβ influences the DNA occupancy of YY1 and favours the interaction between USF2 and YY1. This phosphorylation process has several implications in the CFTR transcriptional process, thus evoking an additional layer of complexity to the mechanisms influencing CFTR gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2051440733,"Dps proteins are found almost ubiquitously in bacterial genomes and there is now an appreciation of their multifaceted roles in various stress responses. Previous studies have shown that this family of proteins assemble into dodecamers and their quaternary structure is entirely critical to their function. Moreover, the numbers of dps genes per bacterial genome is variable; even amongst closely related species - however, for many genera this enigma is yet to be satisfactorily explained. We reconstruct the most probable evolutionary history of Dps in Streptomyces genomes. Typically, these bacteria encode for more than one Dps protein. We offer the explanation that variation in the number of dps per genome among closely related Streptomyces can be explained by gene duplication or lateral acquisition, and the former preceded a subsequent shift in expression patterns for one of the resultant paralogs. We show that the genome of S. coelicolor encodes for three Dps proteins including a tailless Dps. Our in vivo observations show that the tailless protein, unlike the other two Dps in S. coelicolor, does not readily oligomerise. Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses combined with expression studies indicate that in several Streptomyces species at least one Dps is significantly over-expressed during osmotic shock, but the identity of the ortholog varies. In silico analysis of dps promoter regions coupled with gene expression studies of duplicated dps genes shows that paralogous gene pairs are expressed differentially and this correlates with the presence of a sigB promoter. Lastly, we identify a rare novel clade of Dps and show that a representative of these proteins in S. coelicolor possesses a dodecameric quaternary structure of high stability."
https://openalex.org/W2134397699,"A fragmentary cervico-pectoral lateral spine and partial humerus of an ankylosaur from the Early Cretaceous (early Valanginian) of Gronau in Westfalen, northwestern Germany, are described. The spine shows closest morphological similarities to the characteristic cervical and pectoral spines of Hylaeosaurus armatus from the late Valanginian of England. An extensive comparison of distal humeri among thyreophoran dinosaurs supports systematic differences in the morphology of the distal condyli between Ankylosauria and Stegosauria and a referral of the Gronau specimen to the former. The humerus fragment indicates a rather small individual, probably in the size range of H. armatus, and both specimens are determined herein as ?Hylaeosaurus sp.. A short overview of other purported ankylosaur material from the Berriasian-Valanginian of northwest Germany shows that, aside from the material described herein, only tracks can be attributed to this clade with confidence at present."
https://openalex.org/W2036442203,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have shown great promise in cancer therapeutics. SANT75, a novel compound we previously designed to specially inhibit the Smoothened (SMO) protein in the Hh pathway, has greater inhibitory potency than many of commonly used Hh inhibitors. However, preclinical studies of SANT75 revealed water insolubility and acute toxicity. To overcome these limitations, we developed a liposomal formulation of SANT75 and investigated its antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. We encapsulated SANT75 into PEGylated liposome and the mean particle size distribution and zeta-potential (ZP) of liposomes were optimized. Using the Shh-light2 cell and Gli-GFP or Flk-GFP transgenic reporter zebrafish, we confirmed that liposome-encapsulated SANT75 inhibited Hh activity with similar potency as the original SANT75. SANT75 encapsulated into liposome exerted strong tumor growth-inhibiting effects in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the liposomal SANT75 therapy efficiently improved the survival time of tumor-bearing mice without obvious systemic toxicity. The pathological morphology and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that liposomal SANT75 induced tumor cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor angiogenesis as assessed by CD31 and down-regulated the expression of Hh target protein Gli-1 in tumor tissues. Our findings suggest that liposomal formulated SANT75 has improved solubility and bioavailability and should be further developed as a drug candidate for treating tumors with abnormally high Hh activity."
https://openalex.org/W2020493742,"We conducted a survey of adults in Kotohira, a town of about 10,000 people located in the Nakatado District of Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. The survey was distributed to 8184 individuals, and effective responses were received from 3863 persons (response rate, 47.2%) during the survey period. Results regarding numbness and pain showed numbness alone in 7.7%, pain alone in 7.2%, both numbness and pain in 6.0%, and neither numbness nor pain in 79.6%. Spine and spinal cord damage was reported present by 5.4%, and absent by 94.6%. Analysis using the Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire, with comparison between subjects reporting both numbness and pain in the extremities and subjects with either numbness or pain alone, showed lower scores for in Short-Form Health Survey subscales (physical functioning, role [physical, emotional], bodily pain, vitality, and mental health). Subjects with numbness alone generally reported no disability in daily life. In a secondary survey, analysis of neurological findings by specialists identified 6 cases of “pain following spinal cord damage” in which spinal cord-related pain developed in the hands or feet. This represented 0.15% of the survey population starting from the primary survey."
