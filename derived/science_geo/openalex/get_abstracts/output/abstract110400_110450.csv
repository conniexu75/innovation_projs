https://openalex.org/W1980906872,"Normal processing of the amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP) results in secretion of a soluble 4-kilodalton protein essentially identical to the amyloid beta protein (A beta) that forms insoluble fibrillar deposits in Alzheimer's disease. Human neuroblastoma (M17) cells transfected with constructs expressing wild-type beta APP or the beta APP717 mutants linked to familial Alzheimer's disease were compared by (i) isolation of metabolically labeled 4-kilodalton A beta from conditioned medium, digestion with cyanogen bromide, and analysis of the carboxyl-terminal peptides released, or (ii) analysis of the A beta in conditioned medium with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that discriminate A beta 1-40 from the longer A beta 1-42. Both methods demonstrated that the 4-kilodalton A beta released from wild-type beta APP is primarily but not exclusively A beta 1-40. The beta APP717 mutations, which are located three residues carboxyl to A beta 43, consistently caused a 1.5- to 1.9-fold increase in the percentage of longer A beta generated. Long A beta (for example, A beta 1-42) forms insoluble amyloid fibrils more rapidly than A beta 1-40. Thus, the beta APP717 mutants may cause Alzheimer's disease because they secrete increased amounts of long A beta, thereby fostering amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1560179018,"Jasplakinolide, a naturally occurring cyclic peptide from the marine sponge, Jaspis johnstoni, has both fungicidal and antiproliferative activity. We now report that this peptide is a potent inducer of actin polymerization in vitro. The peptide has a much greater effect on Mg(2+)-actin than on Ca(2+)-actin. Competitive binding studies using rhodamine-phalloidin suggest that jasplakinolide binds to F-actin competitively with phalloidin with a dissociation constant of approximately 15 nM. This compares favorably to the previously reported IC50 of 35 nM for the antiproliferative effect of jasplakinolide on PC3 prostate carcinoma cells. The binding curve suggests that nearest neighbor positive cooperativity influences the binding of jasplakinolide (and perhaps also phalloidin) to F-actin. These results imply that jasplakinolide may exert its cytotoxic effect in vivo by inducing actin polymerization and/or stabilizing pre-existing actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2038718814,"Recordings from monkey primary visual cortex (V1) were used to test a model for the visually driven responses of simple cells. According to the model, simple cells compute a linear sum of the responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. In addition, each simple cell's linear response is divided by the pooled activity of a large number of other simple cells. The cell membrane performs both operations; synaptic currents are summed and then divided by the total membrane conductance. Current and conductance are decoupled (by a complementary arrangement of excitation and inhibition) so that current depends only on the LGN inputs and conductance depends only on the cortical inputs. Closed form expressions were derived for fitting and interpreting physiological data. The model accurately predicted responses to drifting grating stimuli of various contrasts, orientations, and spatiotemporal frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W1990997051,"A line of transgenic mice was generated that contains an insertional mutation causing a phenotype similar to human autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Homozygotes displayed a complex phenotype that included bilateral polycystic kidneys and an unusual liver lesion. The mutant locus was cloned and characterized through use of the transgene as a molecular marker. Additionally, a candidate polycystic kidney disease (PKD) gene was identified whose structure and expression are directly associated with the mutant locus. A complementary DNA derived from this gene predicted a peptide containing a motif that was originally identified in several genes involved in cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2024966528,"Septic shock results from excessive stimulation of the host immune system, especially macrophages, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, which resides on the outer membrane of bacteria. Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the tyrphostin AG 126 family protect mice against LPS-induced lethal toxicity. The protection correlates with the ability of these agents to block LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide in macrophages as well as LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha in vivo. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect correlated with the potency of AG 126 to block LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a p42MAPK protein substrate in the murine macrophage."
https://openalex.org/W2088135902,"Halogenation of an iron porphyrin causes severe saddling of the macrocyclic structure and a large positive shift in the iron(III)/(II) redox couple. Although pre-halogenated iron(II) porphyrins such as Fe(TFPPBr8) [H2TFPPBr8, beta-octabromo-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-porphyrin] are relatively resistant to autoxidation, they rapidly reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. These and related reactivity studies suggest that catalysis of alkane oxygenation by Fe(TFPPBr8)Cl occurs through a radical-chain mechanism in which the radicals are generated by oxidation and reduction of alkyl hydroperoxides."
https://openalex.org/W2024023167,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) delivers cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they bind to nascent class 1 histocompatibility molecules. Class 1-peptide complexes are then displayed at the cell surface for recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Immunoprecipitation of either TAP or class 1 molecules revealed an association between the transporter and diverse class 1 products. TAP bound preferentially to heterodimers of the class 1 heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin, and the complex subsequently dissociated in parallel with transport of class 1 molecules from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The TAP-class 1 complexes could also be dissociated in vitro by the addition of class 1-binding peptides. The association of class 1 molecules with TAP likely promotes efficient capture of peptides before their exposure to the lumen of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1580813094,"The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) of skeletal osteoclasts was found to partially dephosphorylate the bone matrix phosphoproteins osteopontin (OPN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). TRAP also partially dephosphorylated metabolically [32P]PO4-labeled OPN as well as BSP, whereas comparable amounts of either alkaline phosphatase or prostatic acid phosphatase, at their respective pH optima, were ineffective, indicating a certain preference of TRAP for these phosphoprotein substrates. It has previously (Flores, M., Norgard, M., Heinegard, D., Reinholt, F. P., and Andersson, G. (1992) Exp. Cell Res. 201, 526-530) been shown that osteoclasts bind to OPN as well as to BSP coated onto glass. We can now show that the partially dephosphorylated proteins no longer support osteoclast binding. These results indicate that the secretion of TRAP from osteoclasts into the resorption area could exert a regulatory influence on the attachment of the cells to the bone surface. This could imply roles in the development of ruffled borders and/or in the regulation of osteoclast motility on the bone surface."
https://openalex.org/W1513222164,"Abstract The sodium-calcium exchanger (NCE) plays a critical role in diverse processes in many different tissues including heart, nerve, and kidney. Surprisingly, the NCE is encoded by a single gene. We have isolated and sequenced a rat renal NCE clone, denoted F1, that was identical to previous rat NCEs, except for two unique sequences: one in the 5'-untranslated region and the other at a site of alternative splicing in the coding sequence. To explore these regions further, we examined NCE transcripts in several tissues using rapid amplification of cDNA 5'-ends and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Three species were identified each with a different 5'-end exon spliced to a common NCE core at nucleotide -34 in the 5'-untranslated region. Based on Northern analysis, each of these species had a unique tissue distribution. Whereas the F1 5'-end variant was abundantly expressed only in kidney, a second variant was expressed mostly in heart, and the third variant was expressed ubiquitously elsewhere. Investigation of the region of alternative splicing in the coding sequence also revealed tissue-specific expression of five major species. These findings indicate that the NCE expression is controlled and regulated under the influence of different promoters in a tissue-specific fashion. Therefore, we propose that the structural complexity of the single NCE gene allows it to respond independently to the unique demands of different environments."
https://openalex.org/W1503135238,"Abstract A novel benz[a]anthracene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P450EF), which is very active in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism, has been purified from C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts (Pottenger, L. H., Christou, M., and Jefcoate, C. R. (1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 286, 488-497). P450EF was shown to be immunologically unrelated to the major known P-450 families. A 4.9-kilobase (kb) cDNA encoding P450EF has been isolated from a lambda ZAP cDNA expression library generated from mRNA of TCDD-induced C3H10T1/2 cells. This cDNA comprises 175-base pair (bp) 5'-noncoding, 1629-bp open reading, and about 3100-bp 3'-noncoding sequence. A SmaI fragment of the 4.9-kb cDNA hybridized to a 5.2-kb mRNA species equally induced by benz[a]anthracene (10 microM) and TCDD (10 nM) in C3H10T1/2 cells, consistent with the involvement of the Ah receptor in this induction process. The deduced amino acid sequence (543 amino acids), the longest of any known cytochrome P-450, exhibits 41 and 38% identity to mouse CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, respectively, and less but substantial similarity (30-33% identity) to many members of the CYP2 family. There are five extended regions of > or = 50% identity to CYP1A1 as follows: (a) 51-118; (b) 199-222; (c) 326-343 (I-helix, O2-binding threonine); (d) 357-430; and (e) 460-487 (heme-binding cysteine). These sequence relationships suggest that P450EF is a member of a new CYP1B subfamily (mouse CYP1B1). Hybridization of mRNA and immunoblot analyses of microsomes both demonstrated beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) inducibility of Cyp1b-1 expression in C3H mouse lung, liver, and uterus although at lower levels relative to Cyp1a-1. The mobility of the beta-NF-inducible immunoreactive liver protein was significantly higher than that of the CYP1B1 protein detected in mouse lung, uterus, and C3H10T1/2 cells. Compared with the beta-NF-induced uterus, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced uterine fibroblasts exhibited 10-20-fold higher levels of CYP1B1, suggesting that stromal fibroblasts are a major source of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2001469156,"The TATA-binding protein TBP appears to be essential for all transcription in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which suggests that its function was established early in evolution. Archaebacteria constitute a kingdom of organisms distinct from eukaryotes and eubacteria. Archaebacterial gene regulatory sequences often map to TATA box-like motifs. Here it is shown that the archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei expresses a protein with structural and functional similarity to eukaryotic TBP molecules. This suggests that TBP's role in transcription was established before the archaebacterial and eukaryotic lineages diverged and that the transcription systems of archaebacteria and eukaryotes are fundamentally homologous."
https://openalex.org/W1518243624,"It is shown that the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) has an obligate requirement for copper. The MMO activity in the particulate fractions obtained from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) cells is found to increase with increasing copper content of the membranes. The enzyme activity from membranes obtained from cells grown at low copper levels can be stimulated further by the addition of Cu(II) ions to the assay medium. The membrane-bound copper ions can exist in both Cu(II) and Cu(I) forms. EPR and magnetic susceptibility characterizations of the membranes indicate the presence of an exchange-coupled trinuclear Cu(II) cluster when the bulk of the copper ions is oxidized. However, the functional form of the enzyme is the reduced or partially reduced form. The copper ions in the membrane fractions as isolated often exhibit a high level of reduction. An EPR spectrum with one unpaired electron spin delocalized over three copper nuclei has been observed for the two-electron reduced trinuclear copper cluster. The high correlation between the copper level in the membranes and enzymatic activity as well as the high reactivity of the reduced copper clusters toward dioxygen strongly indicate that the membrane-bound copper ions constitute the active sites of the pMMO."
https://openalex.org/W1511482991,"Osteoclasts are multinucleate giant cells that play key roles in bone resorption. To identify genes predominantly expressed in osteoclasts, we screened a cDNA library of osteoclasts with cDNA probes of osteoclasts and alveolar macrophages. Clones specifically hybridizing to the osteoclast probe were isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of one such clone, F17, was found to share significant similarity with the sequences of human and mouse matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) cDNA. By isolation and sequencing of the full-length cDNA, F17 was revealed to encode the rabbit counterpart of MMP-9. By Northern blotting, messenger RNA for MMP-9 was found to be highly and predominantly expressed in isolated osteoclasts when compared with its level in alveolar macrophages and other tissues. By gelatin zymography, gelatinase activity was detected in conditioned medium of isolated osteoclasts, suggesting that MMP-9 is secreted by isolated osteoclasts. Expression of MMP-9 was also observed in in vivo osteoclasts in metacarpal bones of newborn rabbits by in situ hybridization. These facts suggest that MMP-9 is one of the major proteases produced by osteoclasts and possibly plays a role in osteoclastic bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1538233442,"Recombinant human progelatinase B and a COOH terminally truncated version, pro-delta426-688 gelatinase B have been prepared from a myeloma cell expression system. Both proenzymes could be processed to active forms by stromelysin-1 to give an NH2 terminus of Phe88, or by treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate resulting in an NH2-terminal Met75. The kinetics of activation using either treatment was not affected by removal of the enzyme COOH-terminal domain. The specific activities of both gelatinase B and delta426-688 gelatinase B, activated using either method, were found to be similar using either a quenched fluorescent peptide or gelatin as the substrate. Fibroblast monolayers were shown to mediate processing of both progelatinases at similar rates in the presence of either plasminogen or prostromelysin-1. Active wild-type gelatinase B was inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) -1 at a much faster rate than TIMP-2. COOH-terminal truncation of either enzyme or inhibitor gave a marked reduction in the rate constant for TIMP-1 inhibition but had no effect on the rate of TIMP-2 binding. It can be concluded that the COOH-terminal domain of progelatinase B is not involved in autolytic or cellular activation and does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. However, COOH-terminal domain interactions between active gelatinase B and TIMP-1 significantly enhance the rate of complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1486581764,"Protein kinase play important roles in the growth and differentiation of cells. We have isolated cDNA clones from the human megakaryocytic cell line CMK11-5 that encode a novel protein kinase, which we call SPRK (src-homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proline-rich kinase). The gene sequence predicts an 847-amino acid protein kinase with a unique domain arrangement. An amino-terminal glycine-rich region is followed by an SH3 domain and a kinase domain that is similar to both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Adjacent to the kinase domain are two closely spaced leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs and a stretch of basic amino acids that resembles karyophilic nuclear localization signals. The COOH-terminal half of SPRK is basic, and proline accounts for 24% of the COOH-terminal 216 amino acids. The sprk gene is widely expressed as a 4-kilobase transcript in adult and fetal human tissues. Transfection of 293 cells with a vector encoding an epitope-tagged SPRK results in the expression of a 95-kDa protein. The epitope-tagged SPRK becomes phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in an in vitro kinase assay, whereas SPRK variants with point mutations in the predicted ATP-binding site fail to become phosphorylated. These data indicate that SPRK has serine/threonine kinase activity. The SH3 domain of SPRK is interrupted by a unique 5-amino acid insert whose location in the SH3 consensus sequence is the same as that of the inserts found in the SH3 domains of neuronal SRC and of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1598201397,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR).CD3 complex contains several distinct but related signal transduction modules termed motifs: one each in the cytoplasmic domains of CD3-gamma, -delta, and -epsilon chains and three in the CD3-zeta polypeptide (zeta A, zeta B, and zeta C). Cross-linking of individual motifs expressed in chimeric molecules leads to early and late T cell activation events. Although the activated T cell receptor associates with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, the sites of interaction with kinases and other potential effector molecules have not been fully mapped. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) preferentially associated with the zeta chain membrane proximal motif zeta A. Maximal PI 3-kinase/zeta A association occurred following TCR.CD3 activation and was dependent upon phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues in zeta A. The association of PI 3-kinase was specific for zeta A and could be ranked zeta A >> zeta C > zeta B. Phosphorylation of the zeta A motif on tyrosine residues occurred in response to TCR.CD3 cross-linking in vivo. These results indicate that T cell activation leads to assembly of an intracellular signaling complex: recruitment of a tyrosine kinase, phosphorylation of zeta A, and association of PI 3-kinase. These data also support a model in which different Reth motifs of the TCR.CD3 complex recruit distinct signal transduction molecules. Thus, the subdomains of the T cell antigen receptor zeta chain may serve different roles during T cell maturation and antigen-driven activation."
https://openalex.org/W1676276742,"The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene seems to be essential for establishment of viral infection, and the X gene product, HBx, transactivates virus and host genes through a wide variety of cis-elements, whereas regulation of HBx has not been fully understood. We found that transactivation-negative HBx mutants truncated at the C-terminal portion specifically repressed the HBx transactivation in trans. The ability to trans-repress the HBx transactivation is confined to the N-terminal third of HBx. Transactivation-positive constructs of HBx were divided into two groups by their sensitivity to trans-repression due to the presence of the N-terminal third. Thus the regulatory domain, the N-terminal third, is separated from the transacting domain and responsible for the negative regulations, the trans-repression and sensitivity to X trans-repression. A possible direct association between the HBx regulatory domains was tested by far-Western blotting using purified fused forms of HBx proteins. The regulatory domain was found to associate preferentially with the full HBx or the regulatory domain, but not with the transacting domain. Taken together, it is possible that HBx has a self-regulatory mechanism that avoids excessive HBx transactivation and is important for regulation of X gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1582577880,"Cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments, recognizable as a DNA ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis, is usually considered as the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that this internucleosomal cleavage is preceded by the formation of large fragments of DNA of > or = 700, 200-250, and 30-50 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length. Using isolated thymocyte nuclei, we now demonstrate that the formation of these large fragments is Mg(2+)- but not Ca(2+)-dependent. Further degradation of > or = 460- and 200-250-kbp fragments to 30-50-kbp fragments but not oligonucleosomal cleavage is also Mg(2+)-dependent but is facilitated by Ca2+. In contrast, formation of oligonucleosomal fragments does not occur in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+ alone but requires the presence of both cations. These results support the hypothesis that the formation of these large fragments and the subsequent internucleosomal cleavage are distinct steps in the degradation of DNA in apoptosis in thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1543209415,"Halocyanin, a small blue copper protein, was isolated from the haloalkaliphilic archaeon Natronobacterium pharaonis. The NH2 terminus was not accessible to Edman degradation. About 70% of the amino acid sequence was determined by protein sequence analysis. The sequence information of two peptides was used for cloning and sequencing the halocyanin gene (hcy). The open reading frame codes for 489 base pairs, which account for a protein with 163 amino acids and a molecular mass of 17,223 Da. The discrepancy between this value and the molecular mass of 15,456 +/- 1.5 Da for the copper-free protein determined by electrospray mass spectrometry can be explained by a post-translational processing of the gene product. The NH2-terminal sequence of the open reading frame contains a motif that is characteristic for prokaryotic lipoproteins. Assuming a similar processing for halocyanin, Cys at position 25 of the primary transcript would be modified by a diphytanyl (glycerol)diether. Subsequently, the precursor is cleaved by a signal peptidase II-like protease and then acetylated at its NH2-terminal alpha-amino group. These modifications would yield a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 15,456 Da. A comparison of the primary structure of halocyanin with a number of other blue copper proteins places it into the plastocyanin-related group."
https://openalex.org/W1548869612,"The fruR gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes the regulatory protein FruR, was cloned in the pT7-5 expression vector so as to overproduce a protein tagged with 6 histidine residues. By using a one-step chromatographic procedure, FruR was purified to near-homogeneity. Analysis of the protein under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions indicated that it is a tetramer with a molecular mass of about 150 kilodaltons. The positions of interference between FruR and the operator of the acetate operon were examined. The number and nature of the nucleotides essential for FruR binding were determined by several different techniques: base methylation with dimethyl sulfate, base removal by formic acid and hydrazine, uracil interference, and hydroxyl radical footprinting. It was observed that FruR asymmetrically binds to a 16-base pair DNA sequence located 170 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start point of the ace operon."
https://openalex.org/W1526559406,"Abstract A peptide representing the NH2-terminal (33 amino acid residues) of the fusion protein (F) of Sendai virus, as well as its Gly12-->Ala12 mutant, were synthesized, fluorescently labeled, and spectroscopically and functionally characterized. Peptide-induced vesicle fusion was demonstrated by a combination of increased visible absorbance, lipid mixing assay, and electron microscopy. Both peptides, with the mutant peptide being significantly more potent, were shown to induce membrane fusion and bilayer perturbation of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. These results are consistent with a previous study that showed that a similar mutation in the homologous NH2-terminal segment of simian virus 5 greatly enhanced syncytium formation (Horvath, C. M., and Lamb, R. A. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 2443-2455). Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed similar high alpha-helical contents of both peptides in methanol and in trifluoroethanol. Using fluorescently labeled peptide analogues we found that (i) the peptides' membrane partition coefficients are in the range of 10(5) M-1; (ii) the NH2 terminus of the wild-type peptide is located within the lipid bilayer, whereas that of the variant peptide lies on the surface; and (iii) both peptides tend to self-associate in their membrane-bound state. The results support a model in which an alpha-helical secondary structure and self-aggregation of peptides are necessary conditions for membrane fusion. The observed differences in the peptides' fusogenic abilities are hypothesized to result from differences in the peptides' degree of penetration into the membrane, induction of membrane destabilization, and ability to cause vesicles to aggregate. The data support Sendai virus-cell fusion models in which the fusion peptide plays a crucial role in fusion induction by destabilizing the bilayer and by triggering the association of viral fusion protein molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2018659750,"Two major goals for the design of new catalysts are the facilitation of chemical transformations and control of product outcome. An antibody has been induced that efficiently catalyzes a cationic cyclization in which an acyclic olefinic sulfonate ester substrate is converted almost exclusively (98 percent) to a cyclic alcohol. The key to the catalysis of the reaction and the restriction of the product complexity is the use of antibody binding energy to rigidly enforce a concerted mechanism in accord with the design of the hapten. Thus, the ability to direct binding energy allows the experimenter to dictate a reaction mechanism which is an otherwise difficult task in chemistry. New catalysts for cationic cyclization may be of general use in the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds leading to multi-ring molecules including steroids and heterocyclic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1658399278,"The orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TF I) fully prevented not only the activation of the oxytocin gene by retinoic acid and thyroid hormone but also completely repressed the estrogen-dependent stimulation in transfected P19 EC cells. DNase I footprinting showed that the COUP-TF I protein bound to the 5'-flanking region of the oxytocin gene at the site of the distal composite hormone response element, which mediates the responses to estrogen, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormone. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using this composite hormone response element as probe showed that COUP-TF I and the estrogen receptor competed for binding but did not form a heterodimer. The binding by COUP-TF I was stronger than the binding of the estrogen receptor. Thus, the mechanism of repression involves occupancy of integrated binding sites. By mutagenesis of the composite hormone response element, the COUP-TF I binding site and the estrogen response element could be separated, resulting in functional dissociation of the repressive action of COUP-TF I and the induction by estrogen. The results show that repression of gene expression by COUP-TF I is not limited to receptors that act through heterodimerization but also extends to the homodimer-forming estrogen receptor in a context-dependent manner. This interaction between COUP-TF I and the estrogen receptor may provide a physiological mechanism of selective antagonism of gene regulation by estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W1529483913,"Interaction between the inhibitory subunit (P gamma) and catalytic subunits of cGMP phosphodiesterase is essential for the regulation of cGMP phosphodiesterase in vertebrate rod photoreceptors. P gamma phosphorylation in vitro has been studied using a kinase which is extracted from amphibian rod outer segments. Various chromatographies of the kinase preparation using ionic exchange, gel filtration, and heparin-Sepharose columns indicate that a kinase with M(r) 70,000 is responsible for the P gamma phosphorylation. The kinase does not require any of the known activators for protein kinases but is inhibited by cGMP in a concentration-dependent manner. Together with analysis by laser-desorption mass spectrometry, measurement of 32P radioactivity in phosphorylated P gamma indicates that P gamma extracted with GTP-bound transducin alpha subunit is not phosphorylated and that a phosphate is incorporated into more than 80% of the P gamma by the kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis, sequencing of phosphorylated peptides derived from phosphorylated P gamma, and phosphorylation of synthetic peptides indicate threonine 22 in P gamma is phosphorylated by the kinase. Phosphorylated P gamma has a higher inhibitory activity for active cGMP phosphodiesterase than non-phosphorylated P gamma. These data suggest that threonine 22 in P gamma is phosphorylated by a specific kinase and that the P gamma phosphorylation governs the interaction between P gamma and catalytic subunits of cGMP phosphodiesterase in vertebrate rod photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1596432366,"In amphibian rod photoreceptor membranes, P gamma, an inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase, is phosphorylated by a protein kinase when P gamma is complexed with the guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-bound alpha subunit of transducin (GTP gamma S.T alpha). Five different experiments support the conclusion that the phosphorylated P gamma loses its interaction with GTP gamma S.T alpha. These observations include 1) detection of the inhibitory effect of the GTP gamma S.T alpha.P gamma complex on cGMP phosphodiesterase activity after P gamma in the complex is phosphorylated in a system reconstituted from isolated components, 2) no stimulating effect of GTP gamma S.T alpha on the phosphorylated P gamma-inhibited cGMP phosphodiesterase in the reconstituted system, 3) physical release of phosphorylated P gamma from GTP gamma S.T alpha in the reconstituted system, 4) no inhibitory effect of phosphorylated P gamma on both GTP hydrolysis by T alpha and GTP gamma S/GDP exchange on T alpha in the reconstituted system, and 5) no enhanced activity of cGMP phosphodiesterase by GTP gamma S.T alpha in rod outer segment membranes after incubation of the membranes with the kinase preparation in the presence of ATP. Together with our data that P gamma released with GTP.T alpha is not phosphorylated, and that phosphorylated P gamma inhibits more effectively cGMP phosphodiesterase activity than nonphosphorylated P gamma (Tsuboi, S., Matsumoto, H., Jackson, K. W., Tsujimoto, K., Williams, T., and Yamazaki, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15016-15023), these observations suggest that, after P gamma is released with GTP.T alpha from catalytic subunits of cGMP phosphodiesterase, P gamma complexed with GTP.T alpha is phosphorylated by a kinase. Then, the phosphorylated P gamma is released from GTP.T alpha and binds to active cGMP phosphodiesterase to inhibit the cGMP hydrolysis. It is suggested that in some G-protein-dependent signal transduction systems G-protein-activated effector may be phosphorylated with a specific kinase and that phosphorylation of the effector results in the turnoff of signal transduction without GTP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1658246671,"The mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase active site of the heterodimeric vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme was previously localized to the carboxyl-terminal third of the large subunit, D1R, associated with the small subunit, D12L (Cong, P., and Shuman, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16424-16429; Higman, M. A., Bourgeois, N., and Niles, E. G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16430-16437). A plasmid was constructed which directs the coexpression of the carboxyl terminus of the D1R subunit from amino acids 498 to 844 and the D12L subunit in Escherichia coli. The mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase catalytic activity in the isolated domain was found to be kinetically equivalent to that present in the intact enzyme. Through mobility shift and ultraviolet photolinkage analyses, both domains were shown to bind RNA in a saturable fashion. RNA binding was localized predominantly to the large subunit, but a low level of linkage of RNA to D12L was also observed. A low, but reproducible, level of mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity was detected in the isolated D1R498-844 subunit demonstrating that the active site resides solely within the large subunit of the capping enzyme. This activity is enhanced 30- to 50-fold by the association of the D12L subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1537485370,"Work from several laboratories indicates that guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (GTP-binding proteins) are required for intracellular vesicular transport. In a previous report we presented evidence indicating that one or more heterotrimeric G proteins regulate fusion between endosomes (Colombo, M. I., Mayorga, L. S., Casey, P. J., and Stahl, P. D. (1992) Science 255, 1695-1697). We now report on experiments showing that Gs plays a role in endosome fusion. We have used several reagents known to modulate Gs function including (i) peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of G protein-coupled receptors and peptides that mimic interaction of receptors with G proteins, (ii) anti-G protein antibodies, and (iii) cholera toxin. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the third cytoplasmic loop of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor which putatively interact with G alpha s inhibited endosomal fusion. The inhibitory effect of these peptides was prevented by a short preincubation of endosomes with guanosine-5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or by phosphorylating the peptide with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The involvement of Gs in endosome recognition and/or the fusion process was assessed by testing an antibody against the COOH terminus of G alpha s. Anti-G alpha s IgG completely abolished fusion between endosomes. Lastly, preincubation of endosomal vesicles with cholera toxin abrogated fusion in the presence of NAD, whereas no effect was observed in the absence of the cofactor. Taken together these findings indicate a role for Gs in either the mechanism or the regulation of fusion among endosomes. These results raise the possibility that signal transduction through cytoplasmic domains of receptors may participate in the regulation of endocytic trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1499833641,"To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the resolution of Holliday junctions by Escherichia coli RuvC protein, we studied biochemical properties of the protein using various synthetic DNA junctions as model substrates. RuvC cleaves not only a four-way junction but also three-way junctions efficiently. The central core of homology in the junction is essential for the substrates to be cleavable by RuvC. Although the divalent cations are essential for the endonuclease activity, RuvC efficiently forms specific complexes with four-way junctions in the absence of the cations, irrespective of the presence of homologous core sequences. By using T7 endonuclease I as a probe, we studied the topology of the substrate junctions used in our study. The results suggest that RuvC cleaves the three-way junctions with homology core when they become four-way conformers. From the present studies, we propose that RuvC initially binds mostly nonproductively to four-way junctions, which does not require divalent metals, and subsequently cleaves the junctions by a mechanism dependent on a divalent cation and a particular topological conformer that is induced by the sequences at the mobile junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1602864649,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a multifunctional cytokine that regulates a variety of biological functions, signals through a heteromeric receptor complex of the type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. The type II receptor, a transmembrane serine-threonine kinase, was cloned based on its ability to directly bind TGF-beta. Recently, a number of candidate type I TGF-beta receptors have been isolated. Although only one of these transmembrane kinases (R4) has been shown to mediate TGF-beta-dependent gene activation, others bind TGF-beta when overexpressed in COS cells. Consequently, it has been postulated that the diversity of TGF-beta responses is generated through the association of distinct type I receptors with the type II TGF-beta receptor, thus creating receptor complexes of differential signaling capacities. In contrast to this model, we demonstrate that stable expression of only the R4 type I TGF-beta receptor in a mutant cell line lacking endogenous type I TGF-beta receptor was able to complex with the endogenous type II TGF-beta receptor and restore the effects of TGF-beta on inhibition of cell proliferation and activation of specific genes, regardless of which of the three mammalian isoforms of TGF-beta was used as the ligand. Therefore, R4 acts as a fully functional type I TGF-beta receptor, and the differential effects of TGF-beta are likely mediated by a single receptor complex consisting of R4 and the type II receptor."
https://openalex.org/W119538708,"The flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) are a family of enzymes that contain putative FAD- and NADPH-binding domains within the first 200 residues of their N termini. The cDNAs encoding these enzymes contain an area of relatively high identity over the 5' half of the coding region. Rabbit genomic DNA was probed under low stringency conditions, with a mixture of 5' cDNA fragments encoding rabbit FMO1, FMO2, or FMO5. Bands associated specifically with FMO1, FMO2, or FMO5 were resolved by analysis at high stringency with individual probes. Several bands were detected that could not be assigned to FMO1, FMO2, or FMO5. The behavior of the 5' probes at low versus high stringency was used to facilitate the isolation of cDNAs corresponding to the unknown DNA bands. A cDNA library was constructed from rabbit liver mRNA and screened under low stringency hybridization conditions (30 degrees C, 50% formamide, 1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS) with the mixture of 5' FMO1, FMO2, and FMO5 cDNA probes. A total of 157 clones was detected. Of these, 117 clones remained under high stringency hybridization conditions (65 degrees C, 50% formamide, 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS) and were identified as FMO1 (95 clones) or FMO5 (22 clones). Of the 40 remaining clones, 36 were characterized by sequence analysis as encoding FMO3, previously identified at the protein level by Ozols (Ozols, J. (1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 290, 103-115) as a second rabbit liver FMO. Four clones were shown to encode an FMO not previously described for the rabbit, FMO4. No clones encoding FMO2 were isolated from the liver library. Sequence analysis revealed that FMO3 and FMO4 are 56% identical, and analysis of genomic DNA indicated that each is encoded by a single gene. Message distribution was tissue-, species-, and form-specific. The properties of FMO3 cDNA expressed in Escherichia coli were found to be more similar to those of FMO1 than FMO2, but to differ significantly from both. Rabbit genomic DNA was probed under conditions of low stringency with a mixture of 5' cDNA fragments encoding all five FMO forms and produced results consistent with the possibility of one additional FMO."

E., Harris, T. J. R., Murphy, G., and Reynolds, J. J. (1985) Nature 318, 66-69). We found that adult T-cell leukemia cell lines infected with HTLV-1 also express high levels of a TIMP-1 transcript. A viral transactivator of HTLV-1, Tax1, in a human T-cell line (Jurkat), was sufficient to stimulate transcription of the TIMP-1 gene. Deletion and mutation analysis of the TIMP-1 gene promoter showed that the AP-1 binding site in the 38-base pair sequence conserved between the human and mouse genes was essential for activation by Tax1. The transactivator of HTLV-2 also stimulated the promoter through the same cis-element. The reported growth-promoting activity of TIMP-1 against erythroid cells and potentially against HTLV-1-infected T-cells may modulate the clinical course of adult T-cell leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1495817474,"Substance P binds to and activates the neurokinin-1 receptor with high affinity, thereby modulating several neuronal pathways including pain transmission and neurogenic inflammation. Several high affinity non-peptide antagonists have recently been described. To elucidate the molecular interactions specific for binding to the neurokinin-1 receptor, site-directed mutagenesis has been utilized to identify amino acid residues that interact directly with antagonists. Glutamine 165 in the fourth transmembrane segment was shown to be critical for the binding of CP-96,345 but not SR140333. Analysis of quinuclidine analogs suggests that glutamine 165 interacts with the C-3 heteroatom in this class of antagonists, probably through a hydrogen bond. Glutamine 165 also plays a minor role in the binding of peptides and RP67580. In contrast, serine 169 was determined to be critical for the binding of RP67580. These data indicate that residues 165 and 169 in the fourth transmembrane segment, along with residues in the fifth, sixth, and seventh transmembrane segments as demonstrated previously, form the non-peptide antagonist binding site in the neurokinin-1 receptor. Furthermore, the antagonist binding site overlaps with the binding site for peptide agonists in the fourth and seventh transmembrane segments."
https://openalex.org/W1518270369,"To assess the structural and functional significance of the N helix (residues 3-13) of avian recombinant troponin C (rTnC), we have constructed NHdel, in which residues 1-11 have been deleted, both in rTnC and in the spectral probe mutant F29W (Pearlstone, J. R., Borgford, T., Chandra, M., Oikawa, K., Kay, C. M., Herzberg, O., Moult, J., Herklotz, A., Reinach, F. C., and Smillie, L. B. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 6545-6553). Comparison of the far- and near-UV CD spectra (+/- Ca2+) of F29W and F29W/NHdel and titration of the Ca(2+)-induced ellipticity and fluorescence changes indicates that the deletion has little effect on the global fold of the molecule but reduces the Ca2+ affinity of the N domain, but not the C domain, by 1.6-1.8-fold. Comparisons of the mutants NHdel, F29W, and F29W/NHdel with rTnC have been made using several functional assays. In reconstituted troponin-tropomyosin actomyosin subfragment 1 and myofibrillar ATPase systems, both F29W and NHdel have significantly reduced Ca(2+)-activated enzymatic activities. These effects are cumulative in the double mutant F29W/NHdel. On the other hand, maximal isometric tension development in Ca(2+)-activated reconstituted skinned fibers is not affected with F29W and NHdel, although the Ca2+ sensitivity of NHdel in this system is markedly reduced. We conclude that both mutations, NHdel and F29W, are functionally deleterious, possibly affecting interactions of the N domain with troponin I and/or T."
https://openalex.org/W1602139212,"Abstract Identification of the nucleotide binding site in peptide synthetases has been approached by affinity labeling of tyrocidine synthetase 1 with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate. Binding was accompanied by irreversible inhibition of the ATP-dependent phenylalanine activation reaction and was prevented in the presence of MgATP2-. The reaction obeyed pseudo first-order rate kinetics and was accelerated by Mg2+. Complete inhibition corresponded to incorporation of 2.3 mol of fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC)/mol of protein. Upon protection by MgATP2-, about 1 mol of FITC is still incorporated; however, this does not affect activity. The modified synthetase was extensively fragmented by tryptic digestion and the labeled fragments isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two peptides, DHQVKIR and LDKMPLTPNDKIDR, have been identified by sequencing, and the FITC conjugate of the former peptide has been detected by laser desorption mass spectrometry. The labeled residues, Lys-422 and Lys-505, are located within highly conserved segments of this new class of synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1498838285,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied forms of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and related G protein-coupled receptors. beta ARK is one of the best characterized members of a growing family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases. In this article we report the isolation and structural organization of the human beta ARK gene. The gene spans approximately 23 kilobases and is composed of 21 exons interrupted by 20 introns. Exon sizes range from 52 bases (exon 7) to over 1200 bases (exon 21), intron sizes from 68 bases (intron L) to 10.8 kilobases (intron A). The splice sites for donor and acceptor were in agreement with the canonical GT/AG rule. Functional regions of beta ARK are described with respect to their location within the exon-intron organization of the gene. Primer extension and RNase protection assays suggest a major transcription start site approximately 246 bases upstream of the start ATG. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking/promoter region reveals many features characteristic of mammalian housekeeping genes, i.e. the lack of a TATA box, an absent or nonstandard positioned CAAT box, high GC content, and the presence of Sp1-binding sites. The extraordinarily high GC content of the 5'-flanking region (> 80%) helps define this region as a CpG island that may be a principal regulator of beta ARK expression."
https://openalex.org/W1546470740,"Precise localization within the chloroplast of the membrane-bound enzymes involved in heme and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways is of central importance for better understanding the regulation of the carbon flow into these two pathways. In this study we examine the localization of ferrochelatase activity within mature pea chloroplasts. Our results provide evidence that chloroplast ferrochelatase is associated only with thylakoid membranes. The presence of ferrochelatase in chloroplast thylakoids emphasizes the role of this membrane system in chloroplast protoheme biosynthesis. Furthermore, these results raise the possibility that heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis are compartmentalized in two distinct membrane systems within mature chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1542570359,"In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, two nuclear genes are involved in the premature death syndrome associated with a site-specific deletion of the mitochondrial DNA: a mutant allele of the AS1 gene, encoding the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein S12, and an uncharacterized gene closely linked to the mating-type locus. We describe here the cloning and the sequencing of the wild-type and two mutant alleles of the AS1 gene. The P. anserina S12 protein belongs to the bacterial S19 ribosomal protein family and shows 72% identity with the S15 human ribosomal protein. Transformation experiments have shown that the AS1-4 mutation itself is responsible for the premature death phenotype and that it corresponds to a Gly to Asp change in the highly conserved COOH-terminal part of the protein. Use of antibodies directed against S12 did not permit detection of the mutant ribosomal protein inside the mitochondria. However, cross-reactions were observed with at least one mitochondrial ribosomal protein displaying a higher molecular weight than S12. The mitochondrial protein does not seem to be a by-product of the AS1 gene but is more likely the mitochondrial homologue of S12. These results strongly suggest that the mutant S12 protein acts indirectly to promote the mitochondrial deletion, via the cytoplasmic translation."
https://openalex.org/W1592218319,"The presence of a cysteine residue(s) near the active site of acylpeptide hydrolase was suggested by inactivation of the enzyme with sulfhydryl-modifying agents and by the substantial protection against inactivation afforded by the competitive inhibitor acetylmethionine. 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) titrations of the native and the denatured enzyme together with analysis for cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation showed that the enzyme contained 12 free SH groups and three disulfide bonds/monomer. Chemical modification with radiolabeled iodoacetamide led to the labeling of Cys-30 and Cys-64 suggesting that one or both of these Cys residues are close to the active site. Modification of one or both of them probably inhibits the enzyme either because of a distortion of the active site or because the adducts present a barrier to the efficient diffusion of substrates into and products out of the active site. Studies on the mechanism of action of acylpeptide hydrolase have employed p-nitrophenyl-N-propyl carbamate as a potent active site-directed inhibitor. Enzyme inactivation, which follows pseudo first-order kinetics, is diminished by the competitive inhibitor acetylmethionine. The inhibited enzyme slowly regains activity at a rate that is increased in the presence of the nucleophile hydroxylamine. A general mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate is supported by evidence for the formation of acetyl-alanyl hydroxamate during hydrolysis of acetyl-alanine p-nitroanilide in the presence of hydroxylamine. The effect on Vmax and Km during this reaction indicate that hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate is rate-limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1534326625,"The vaccinia virus H4 gene encodes an essential subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme encapsidated within virus particles (Ahn, B., and Moss, B. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3536-3540; Kane, E. M., and Shuman, S. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 5752-5762). The role of this protein in transcription of viral early genes was revealed by the effects of affinity-purified anti-H4 antibody on discrete phases of the early transcription reaction in vitro. Anti-H4 specifically prevented the synthesis of a 21-nucleotide nascent RNA chain but had no impact on elongation of the 21-mer RNA by preassembled ternary complexes. Inhibition of initiation but not elongation was also observed with affinity-purified anti-D6 antibody directed against the 70-kDa subunit of the vaccinia early transcription initiation factor (ETF). Native gel mobility-shift assays showed that anti-H4 prevented the NTP-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase to the preinitiation complex of ETF bound at the early promoter. Two species of ternary complexes could be resolved by native gel electrophoresis. Addition of anti-H4 to preformed complexes elicited a supershift of both ternary species but not of the preinitiation complex. Supeshift by anti-D6 revealed that the more rapidly migrating species of ternary complex did not contain immunoreactive ETF. Loss of ETF from the ternary complex was time-dependent. Thus, whereas the H4 protein was a stable constituent of the elongation complex, ETF was dissociable. We suggest that H4 functions as a molecular bridge to ETF and thereby allows specific recognition of early promoters by the core RNA polymerase. H4 is unlike bacterial sigma factor in that it remains bound to polymerase after the elongation complex is established."
https://openalex.org/W1547415503,"Abstract We have investigated a mechanism of the regulation of mucin core polypeptide (MUC1) gene expression, which is induced by a soluble stimulatory factor, in KM12C human colon carcinoma cells. Conditioned media from normal human colon tissues elevated the level of expression of MUC1 mRNA. Transcriptional activation of the MUC1 gene was analyzed by transient expression of MUC1-CAT reporter plasmids containing the 5'-flanking sequence of the MUC1 gene fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. A region between base pairs -531 and -520 of the 5'-flanking sequence of the MUC1 gene was sufficient for the induction of CAT activity by normal colon conditioned medium (NCCM). Mutagenesis of 3 base pairs within the region corresponding to sequence -531 to -517 from ACAGGGAGCGGTTAG to ACAGGGAGATTTTAG substantially decreased the induction of CAT activity by NCCM. Nuclear extracts from untreated or NCCM-treated KM12C cells were tested for their interaction with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to this sequence. A specifically retarded band was identified after electrophoretic analysis. The quantity or mobility of this band was not changed by NCCM treatment. When an oligonucleotide with three point mutations was used as a competitor, the retarded band remained at the same position. This element (positions -531 to -520), which we call the responsive mucin element, does not contain any sequence that corresponds to previously described cis-acting elements. A protein component complexed with this sequence was identified with a molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1575376514,"Recently, a mutation substituting Leu for Ser323 in the alpha-subunit of the human insulin receptor has been identified in an insulin-resistant patient. The Leu323 mutation leads to a severe impairment in insulin binding without significantly altering the processing or cell surface expression of the receptor. In order to study how alpha beta half-receptors interact to form the insulin-binding site, we cotransfected NIH-3T3 cells with two insulin receptor cDNA constructs: a truncated insulin receptor lacking the C-terminal 43 amino acids (delta 43) and the full-length Leu323 mutant receptor. A clonal cell line from cotransfected cells expresses a hybrid receptor consisting of a Leu323 half-receptor and a delta 43 half-receptor. We demonstrate that the Leu323-delta 43 hybrid receptor binds insulin with high affinity. Furthermore, by cross-linking 125I-insulin to immobilized hybrid receptors, we show that only the alpha beta delta half of the hybrid receptor binds insulin. Since the isolated half-insulin receptor has low affinity for insulin, this suggests that the addition of even a non-binding alpha-subunit can result in high affinity binding to the holoreceptor (alpha alpha mut beta delta beta). Both beta and beta delta-subunits of the Leu323-delta 43 hybrid receptor are phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro in an insulin-dependent manner, suggesting an intramolecular transphosphorylation mechanism and that the presence of the Leu323 mutant receptor that lacks an intrinsic high affinity binding site does not prevent the associated beta-subunit from functioning either as a tyrosine kinase or as a phosphate acceptor in the hybrid insulin receptor molecule (alpha alpha mut beta delta beta). Furthermore, we show that the hybrid receptor can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in response to insulin and can be coimmunoprecipitated together with IRS-1 by anti-IRS-1 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1576753320,"The mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity of the heterodimeric vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme was previously mapped to the carboxyl-terminal 396 amino acids of the large subunit, D1R. This activity is enhanced 30- to 50-fold by the association of the the small subunit, D12L (Higman, M. A., Christen, L. A., and Niles, E. G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14974-14981). Irradiation with ultraviolet light specifically photolinks S-[methyl-3H]S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the large subunit of both the intact capping enzyme and a methyltransferase subdomain, which consists of the D12L subunit associated with the carboxyl-terminal 346 amino acids of the D1R subunit. The extent of linkage was shown to be dependent on the length of incubation, intensity of ultraviolet light, and the concentration of both active enzyme and substrate. The covalent modification was inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, a known competitive inhibitor of the mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity, demonstrating specific photolabeling of the active site. Sequence-specific chemical cleavage of the photolinked methyltransferase domain with mild acid or cyanogen bromide revealed linkage of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to two regions of the large subunit. Analysis of the products of cyanogen bromide and hydroxylamine cleavage mapped the photolinked fragments to amino acids 499 to 579 and 806 to 844 of the D1R subunit. Photolinkage of AdoMet to D1R498-844 was shown to be unaffected by the association of the small subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1542181688,"We have isolated genomic clones which encode the promoter and flanking region of human nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (MHC)-A. The sequence of this region shows many features typical of a housekeeping gene; there is no TATA element and no functional CAAT box. The GC content is high, having an average GC content of 74% in the 600 base pairs (bp) surrounding the transcriptional start sites, and multiple GC boxes (putative Sp1 binding sites) are present. A number of nucleotide sites are utilized for the initiation of transcription. Promoter activity was monitored using luciferase as a reporter following transient transfection into NIH 3T3 cells. Analysis of 5‘ and 3‘ deletion mutants in the promoter region defines the core promoter as extending from nucleotide -112 to +61, where +1 is a major transcriptional start site. An essential sequence for core promoter activity resides in the 36-bp region from -77 to -112 which includes a single potential AP-2 binding site and a single potential Sp1 binding site. The region just downstream from the transcriptional start site (between +62 and +257) was found to be involved in cell type-specific activation of nonmuscle MHC-A gene expression. The increase in luciferase activity due to this proximal downstream region is approximately 15-fold in NIH 3T3 cells, but no increase was observed in C2C12 myotubes and neuroblastoma cells. This 196-bp region, which consists of 100 bp from exon 1 and 96 bp from intron 1, functions in a position- and orientation-dependent manner. Quantitation of luciferase mRNA content driven by the MHC-A promoter, using both competitive polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection assays, revealed that the increase seen in luciferase mRNA due to the 196-bp fragment is approximately 5-fold in NIH 3T3 cells. This only accounts for about one-third of the total increase seen in luciferase activity (protein amounts). Thus, this proximal downstream region appears to activate gene expression in NIH 3T3 cells via both pretranslational (transcription and/or mRNA stability) and translational mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1675229736,"Human vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts express a cell-surface degradative pathway for the multifunctional mediator histamine, which employs a receptor for the metabolic enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO) and results in cellular accumulation of the final metabolite methylimidazoleacetic acid. We demonstrate recognition and regulatory properties of DAO receptors as a function of cellular environmental conditions. Fast and slow ligand binding receptor populations bind DAO at 4 degrees C maximally in 1 and 7 h, respectively; upon warming cells to 37 degrees C both populations participate in degradative uptake of histamine accumulated as methylimidazoleacetic acid. Bound DAO is displaced by heparin with 24-fold greater potency than dextran sulfate, implicating structural specificity of heparin-like glycosaminoglycan moieties as a critical factor in initial receptor/enzyme interaction at fast and slow sites. Receptor-bound DAO is retained under mildly acidic conditions characteristic of early to mid endocytic intracellular compartments and thus could recycle to the plasma membrane intact after internalization. DAO initially bound to receptors in whole cells is retained through cell disruption/membrane fractionation procedures, but DAO binds poorly to isolated membrane fractions or presolubilized receptors, suggesting that the geometry of DAO binding components is not readily maintained upon cell disruption unless DAO is already bound. Cells down-regulate their complement of DAO receptors upon prolonged exposure to DAO. In cells plated at high density, half of the bound DAO becomes nondisplaceable by heparin within 15 min at 37 degrees C, a time consistent with receptor internalization, whereas cells plated at low density retain all bound DAO in a heparin-sensitive state. The protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate modulates DAO receptor number by 35% and total histamine degradative uptake by > 2-fold. Thus this pathway is subject to regulation at the levels of DAO receptor numbers, their state of cell-surface display, and additional cellular elements of the degradative pathway with which the DAO receptors interface."
https://openalex.org/W1574643997,"In this study, we addressed the question of whether carcinogens affected the expression of interleukin-1 alpha (IL1 alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL6) genes and the production of the relative proteins. Primary cultures of human monocytes were exposed to the alkylating agents mitomycin C (Mit C), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), and ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) and tested for the production of IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, and IL6 proteins, as well as for the expression of IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, and IL6 transcripts. The production of IL1 beta and IL6 was significantly augmented by all the three chemicals after 24-48 h of treatment. IL1 alpha was also increased by Mit C and MMS. By Northern blotting analysis, the increased expression of IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, and IL6 genes was shown to occur at 30 min of Mit C and MMS treatment and to decline after 8 h. Similarly, EMS up-regulated the expression of IL1 beta and IL6 genes. The mutagen-mediated increase in interleukin transcripts did not require de novo protein synthesis, and it was due to the enhanced half-life of IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, and IL6 mRNAs rather than to the increased rate of gene transcription. These results suggest that carcinogens, in addition to causing DNA mutations and rearrangements, may also affect cell growth and differentiation by enhancing the expression of cytokine genes."
https://openalex.org/W1596092732,"Abstract The MAT-C1 subline of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma has highly stable, branched microvilli and immobile cell surface receptors. A membrane- and microfilament-associated 58-kDa protein (p58) in the MAT-C1 microvilli has been implicated in the stabilization of the microvilli and microfilament-membrane interactions. This protein is associated with a high M(r) glycoprotein complex containing the (proto)oncogene p185neu and other signal transduction components in a putative microfilament-associated signal transduction particle. Amino acid sequences were obtained from two trypsin peptides of p58. Screening a MAT-C1 cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide derived from the larger peptide and polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA ends permitted the isolation of overlapping cDNAs encoding the 427-amino acid open reading frame of p58. In vitro transcription and translation using a full-length cDNA gave a protein of approximately 55 kDa, which reacts with anti-p58 antiserum and reconstitutes into a complex with actin and glycoproteins from the membrane-microfilament interaction site. When COS-7 cells were transfected with the full-length cDNA, p58 was localized in a punctate distribution. In addition, the transfected cells exhibited fewer microfilament cables than untransfected neighboring cells. The amino acid sequence showed a surprising similarity to mammalian retroviral Gag proteins and included regions corresponding to p15, p12 and the N-terminal 80% of p30. Comparisons of p58 and the corresponding regions of the Gag proteins for Moloney murine leukemia virus indicated that about 60% of their amino acid residues were identical. These studies suggest that p58 is the product of an endogenous retroviral gene whose expression as a cellular protein alters the properties of the tumor cell to provide a selective advantage for tumor growth in the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1596956735,"We have previously shown that both Smg GDP dissociation stimulator (GDS) and mammalian Cdc25 (mCdc25) stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of Ki-Ras and that Smg GDS is active only on the post-translationally lipid-modified form of Ki-Ras, whereas mCdc25 is active on both the lipid-modified and unmodified forms but is more active on the lipid-modified form. In the present study, we compared more detailed kinetic properties of Smg GDS and mCdc25 by use of the lipid-modified form of Ki-Ras as a common substrate. Both Smg GDS and mCdc25 stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ki-Ras and formed the stable binary complex with Ki-Ras. In the presence of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S), the stable ternary complex of Smg GDS-GTP gamma S-Ki-Ras was produced, whereas GTP gamma S induced the dissociation of mCdc25 from mCdc25-Ki-Ras complex, yielding GTP gamma S-Ki-Ras. mCdc25 stimulated the dissociation of GDP from both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of Ki-Ras, whereas Smg GDS was far less active on the membrane-bound form than on the soluble form. Moreover, Smg GDS translocated the GTP gamma S-bound form of membrane-bound Ki-Ras to the soluble fraction as the stable ternary complex of Smg GDS-GTP gamma S-Ki-Ras, whereas mCdc25 did not show this activity. These results suggest that Smg GDS and mCdc25 play different roles in the regulation of Ki-Ras."

The Km for lactosylceramide varied 6-fold among these molecular species of lactosylceramide, but there was a poor correlation between the Km for a particular molecular species and the activity of Lac-Cer alpha 2,3-ST for that molecular species. The Km for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid also varied depending on the molecular species of lactosylceramide used as substrate, and there was a good correlation between the Km of Lac-Cer alpha 2,3-ST for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid and the activity of the enzyme. Kinetic studies indicate that the reaction mechanism of LacCer alpha 2,3-ST is a sequential, Ordered Bi Bi system. From considerations of the effects of the structure of the lactosylceramide molecular species on the Vmax and Km for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, it is likely that LacCer alpha 2,3-ST first binds lactosylceramide and then CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid and that the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the release of the product GM3."

An analysis of the equilibrium association constants (Keq) indicates that eIF-4B binding is not affected by the m7GTP cap structure or the AUG. eIF-4B is insensitive to hairpin structures within the oligoribonucleotide. The binding site size is approximately 18 bases. The binding of oligoribonucleotide to eIF-4B as a function of pH, temperature, and ionic strength is also described. The pH-dependent binding showed an increase in binding with increasing pH in contrast to the sharp pH optimum observed for cap binding protein eIF-4E (Carberry, S. E., Darzynkiewicz, E., and Goss, D.J. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 1624-1627). Assuming all tryptophan residues contribute to the observed fluorescence, iodide quenching showed that 8(+/- 1) out 9 of eIF-4B's tryptophan residues are on the surface of the eIF-4B protein. A specific anion effect of Cl- on eIF-4B binding to oligoribonucleotide was found when comparing the ionic strength effect of KC2H3O2 and KCl."
https://openalex.org/W1513766256,"Reaction of the single cysteine residue in each subunit of cyanase with certain SH reagents gives an active decameric derivative that dissociates reversibly to an inactive dimer derivative (Anderson, P. M., Johnson, W. V., Korte, J. J., Xiong, X., Sung, Y.-c., and Fuchs, J. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5674-5680). Reaction of mixed disulfide dimer derivatives of cyanase with dithiothreitol at 0 degree C results in formation of a disulfide bond between the subunits in the dimer. The disulfide dimer was inactive and did not associate to a decamer; the intersubunit disulfide bond could not be formed when the dimers were associated as a decamer. The two SH groups apparently are in close proximity to each other in the dissociated dimer but not when the dimer is associated to a decamer. Substitution of glycine for the cysteine residue or of tyrosine, asparagine, glycine, valine, or leucine for the single histidine residue in each subunit gave mutant enzymes that were active. However, H113N, H113Y, and C83G were unstable at low temperature and/or ionic strength, dissociating reversibly to an inactive dimer. Efficient reassociation required the presence of bicarbonate or cyanate analog. The results are consistent with a proposed single site per subunit model explaining apparent half-site binding of substrates and the requirement of decameric structure for activity."
