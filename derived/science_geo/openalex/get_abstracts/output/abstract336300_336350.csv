No other nucleotide is effective. Certain chelators can partially simulate the effect of nucleotides. The feeding response is elicited only at an osmotic pressure close to that of blood, and requires the presence of sodium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2051671621,"Field observations suggested that subterranean termites might follow a concentration gradient of attractive material to find decaying wood. Laboratory cultures of the brown rot fungus, Lenzites trabea Pers. ex. Fr., on pine blocks formed a material attractive to the eastern subterranean termites, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kol.) and R. virginicus Banks, and a Costa Rican termite, Nasutitermes columbicus (Holmgren). Such a potent termite attractant may be useful in termite surveys and control."

The pH of the medium was a critical factor in differentiation. On this medium, excised barley embryos developed more rapidly than embryos remaining in vivo, or embryos grown on media containing coconut milk."
https://openalex.org/W2032793603,"The umbrella pine, Sciadopitys verticillata S. and Z., a native Japanese conifer species and the only present member of the genus Sciadopitys, has become rapidly restricted in its geographic distribution since the beginning of intensified human activities. In Japan the genus was more widely distributed throughout the Pliocene and in the postglacial hypsithermal and slightly later times (R IIIa). In other parts of the world the genus has not appeared in the fossil record since the early Pleistocene. Conservation of this species is needed."

Identical results were produced with new clones. A reconsideration of the relationships and classification of this organism is now essential."

On 10 May 1961 a radar signal was beamed at the planet Venus, and for the first time in history the return echo was detected within a few minutes. A new value for the Astronomical Unit has been determined. The data indicate that Venus rotates slowly and that it is a better radio reflector than the moon."
https://openalex.org/W1973097100,"Vegetative terminals of azalea (Rhododendron spp.) plants of varying ages initiated flower buds promptly after application of the chemical growth retardants, tributyl-2,4-dichlorobenzylphosphonium chloride (phosfon) and (2-chloroethyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CCC), as soil drenches. This response occurred under environmental conditions which prevented or limited flower bud initiation in untreated plants. Normal flowering followed exposure of the treated plants to dormancy-breaking cool storage."

The diageotropic response also occurred in far-red, red, orange, and green light, while positive geotropism resulted only if blue light was present."
https://openalex.org/W2168295158,"Abundant detrital crystalline mineral grains have been found in layered Muong Nong-type indochinite tektites from Nong Sapong, northeastern Thailand. These grains are an integral part of some tektite layers, and their presence furnishes strong presumptive evidence that indochinites, as well as other tektite groups in which layered specimens occur, formed from surficial earth materials."

Carbon dioxide was well controlled, oxygen was slowly increased, and nitrogen was decreased in the chamber. Photosynthesis can support life in a hostile environment for extended periods of time."

https://openalex.org/W2035310236,"Although the moisture content of the placenta and pericarp of tomato fruits older than 15 days never dropped below about 94 percent, the seeds dehydrated to approximately 50 percent moisture as these organs developed and matured. There was a loss in the total amount, as well as the percentage, of water per seed. Part of this dehydration was mediated by the seeds themselves and part appeared to be due to other portions of the fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2169914081,The chances of spacing children by the rhythm method are experimentally and theoretically analysed. Let q be the probability that a nonpregnant fertile female can go through 1 specified monthly cycle without conceiving. If there is no coitus during this cycle then q is 1; if there is coitus q is less than 1. p is taken from Potters equation and defined as the monthly risk of pregnancy; q then is equal to 1-p. It was shown that to achieve an even chance of spacing the birth of the next child 2 1/2 years from the birth of the last one the woman must secure a q of 97% of better. It is estimated that one needs 93% for the monthly security factor q with the rhythm method; this is consistent with about 3-4 acts of coitus per cycle if the fertile period is only 12 hours. However use of The rhythm method depends on close observation of a number of cycles and most couples practising this method cannot go through such observation without encountering pregnancy first. Therefore this method is likely to fail with many couples particularly couples with more children since the menstrual pattern becomes more and more changeable with repeated pregnancies. What is needed is an accurate ovulation-prediction test and research into the natural temporary sterility of the male partner.

As revealed by measuring the color in Hunter values, growth in high potassium and low nitrogen concentrations resulted in less reddish and more bluish roses, while cultivation in a low nitrogen concentration, irrespective of the N/ K ratio, resulted in roses which were more lightly colored than those grown in high concentrations of nitrogen and potassium. The results were statistically significant at the 1 percent probability level."
