https://openalex.org/W2004409810,"A method is reported whereby aqueous solutions containing weak beta emitters are dispersed as stable emulsions in liquid scintillator counting solutions. This permits the routine counting, with about 10-percent efficiency, of large numbers of samples containing tritium. Self-absorption does not present a problem when less than 5 percent aqueous phase is present."

After intravenous infusion in dogs there were no significantchanges in blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory movements. There were drops in platelet and white cell count, and there was an increase in bloodsugar level. Powerful fibrinolytic phenomena wereobserved."

Respondent salivary conditioning was found to occur during operant leverpressing conditioning, the occurrences of the two conditioned responses being positively correlated."
https://openalex.org/W1995124840,Study of the relative strength of the masculine component in a series of males reveals a significant association with their differential smoking habits. Weakness of the masculine component is significantly more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers and most frequent in the heavier smokers.

https://openalex.org/W130294352,"The importance of controlling deoxyribonuclease action during the isolation of deoxyribonucleic acid has been taken for granted since the work of McCarty and Avery (1) on pneumococcus transformation. Citrate or eth 1 y enediaminetetraacetate has been widely used to control DNase 1,’ and it is generally assumed that maintenance of a neutral pH effectively eliminates DNase II action (3). The present paper deals with some observations on mouse spleen DNase which indicate that the latter assumption is essentially correct at relatively high salt concentration, but that the action of DNase II becomes significant at neutral pH when the concentration of salt is reduced sufficiently. Previous findings (4) that extracts of mouse spleen exhibited maximal DNase action at pH 5 in 0.005 to 0.01"

https://openalex.org/W2066755479,"IN an earlier study1 on the inheritance of dieldrin resistance in Lucilia cuprina, involving a cross between susceptible females and a single resistant male, F2 and back-cross ratios, obtained by employing the discriminating dose technique2,3, indicated that dieldrin resistance in this insect can be explained in terms of a single gene. Information is now presented from reciprocal crosses between resistant and susceptible strains. The discriminating dose method was again utilized, with the results shown in Tables 1 and 2. The data from the F2 and back-cross ratios suggest a simple Mendelian interpretation, even though the F1 and F2 data conform to a polygenic pattern, namely, intermediate resistance in F1 progeny with both parental types in the F2."

https://openalex.org/W2080540761,Past studies have characterized the structure of tobacco mosaic virus particles by a variety of methods. In the present report the screw dislocation theory of crystal growth is applied to the formation of tobacco mosaic virus particles. The growth mechanism is shown to account for the rodlike morphology. It is also deduced that the biosynthetic process occurs at the growth step at the end of a particle.
https://openalex.org/W2103976151,"Thyroid hormone inhibitors are for the most part nonselective, acting primarily to inhibit thyroxine (T$ formation within the thyroid gland itself. One notable exception to this rule, however, is the inhibitor n-butyl-4-hydroxy-3,5-diiodobenzoate. Wilkinson and Maclagan (1) have suggested that this compound acts as an analogue inhibitor, preventing the deiodination of thyroxine to an active hormone triiodothyronine. This belief is based on studies of the O2 uptake responses of animals to thyroxine and triiodothyronine under the influence of BHD.l Roche et al. (2) have suggested, however, that BHD functions as an antithyroid substance by virtue of its ability to increase the metabolic destruction of the thyroid hormone. More recent evidence (3) appears to favor the thesis of Wilkinson and Maclagan. However, the final role of BHD as an antithyroid compound has not been clearly delineated. In view of the wide range of thyroid effects it is somewhat surprising that BHD has been evaluated as an antithyroid agent only with respect to OZ uptake. One interesting relationship surprising that BHD has been evaluated only as an antithyroid agent with respect to O2 uptake. One interesting relationship which has not been investigated with respect to BHD action is the conversion of p-carotene to vitamin A. Baumann and Johnson (4) in 1947 appeared to show unequivocally that the thyroid status of an experimental animal had a direct bearing on the conversion of p-carotene to liver vitamin A. Since that time, however, conflicting reports (5, 6) have rendered this area less well characterized than previously believed. This present work was undertaken with the hope that if the thyroid effects observed by Baumann and Johnson could be substantiated, the thyroid&carotene-vitamin A relationship might be used as a metabolic “testing ground” for the evaluation of the mode of action of BHD. Moreover, the responses to BHD might provide fundamental information as to the mode of action of the thyroid hormone in this metabolic area."

https://openalex.org/W2416046582,"NUMEROUS investigations have been made of the transaminase system in bacteria, and these have been reviewed by Meister1. The only reference to the transaminase activity in Shigellae appears to be the one mentioned by Lichstein and Cohen2 on a strain of Shigella dysenteriae (Shiga)."

https://openalex.org/W1975450734,"GLUCOSE is carried to its metabolic sites directly by plasma water and only indirectly by red blood cells. Accordingly, the intravenous glucose tolerance test would convey greater information if it were reported in terms of plasma glucose concentration. Yet whole blood is currently used in such determinations. Whole blood contains glucose in both red blood cells and plasma, and since the transport between them is moderately slow the concentrations are generally different when blood glucose-levels are rapidly changing. For example, if plasma water glucose concentration is suddenly raised from 100 to 200 mgm. per cent, data of Bowyer and Widdas1 indicate that it would take 17 min. for the glucose concentration in the red blood cell water to reach 190 mgm. per cent."
https://openalex.org/W2016716866,"HOMOZYGOUSLY DDT-resistant strains of Musca domestica
1 and ‘Dieldrin’-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae
2 have been developed in a single generation by the application of discriminating dosages which are lethal to susceptible and hybrid phenotypes in heterogeneously resistant strains of these insects. Selection experiments with chlordane on Musca domestica also imply that pure resistant lines follow one generation of selection with heterogeneous resistant strains3."

As there was no mention in the literature to the physiological activity of the santoninfree, Artemesia monosperma, Del.1, it was deemed of interest to investigate this common Egyptian desert plant for any possible anthelminthic properties. It was decided that investigations should be made in vitro to determine the effects of some preparations of the plant on both Ascaris and the intestine, and to show whether it possesses a vermicidal or vermifugal property."
