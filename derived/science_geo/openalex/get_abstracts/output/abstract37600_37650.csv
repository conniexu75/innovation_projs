https://openalex.org/W2007169317,"Identification of complementary DNAs encoding the human glucocorticoid receptor predicts two protein forms, of 777 (alpha) and 742 (beta) amino acids, which differ at their carboxy termini. The proteins contain a cysteine/lysine/arginine-rich region which may define the DNA-binding domain. Pure radiolabelled glucocorticoid receptor, synthesized in vitro, is immunoreactive and possesses intrinsic steroid-binding activity characteristic of the native glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2066735646,"D2 dopamine receptors in the putamen of living human subjects were characterized by using the selective, high-affinity D2 dopamine receptor antagonist carbon-11-labeled raclopride and positron emission tomography. Experiments in four healthy men demonstrated saturability of [11C]raclopride binding to an apparently homogeneous population of sites with Hill coefficients close to unity. In the normal putamen, maximum binding ranged from 12 to 17 picomoles per cubic centimeter and dissociation constants from 3.4 to 4.7 nanomolar. Maximum binding for human putamen at autopsy was 15 picomoles per cubic centimeter. Studies of [11C]raclopride binding indicate that clinically effective doses of chemically distinct neuroleptic drugs result in 85 to 90 percent occupancy of D2 dopamine receptors in the putamen of schizophrenic patients."

https://openalex.org/W2089845502,"The interrelation between the secretion of two hypophysiotropic peptides, growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) and somatostatin (SRIF), in the generation of episodic growth hormone (GH) secretion was inferred from direct measurements of immunoreactive GRF and immunoreactive SRIF concentrations in the hypophysial-portal plasma of the rat. Secretion of immunoreactive GRF was found to be episodic, with maximal concentrations present during periods of expected GH secretory episodes. Secretion of immunoreactive GRF was accompanied by a moderate reduction in portal plasma levels of immunoreactive SRIF. Passive immunoneutralization of SRIF was associated with increased concentrations of immunoreactive GRF in hypophysial-portal plasma. On the basis of these observations, it appears that each GH secretory episode is initiated by pulsatile secretion of immunoreactive GRF into the portal circulation, which is preceded by or is concurrent with a moderate reduction of inhibitory tone provided by portal immunoreactive SRIF. These experiments provide direct insights into central and adenohypophysial mechanisms by which GRF and SRIF interact to generate episodic secretion of GH."
https://openalex.org/W2152214802,"Translocational intermediates of precursor proteins of ATPase F1β subunit and cytochrome c1 across mitochondrial membranes were analyzed using two different approaches, transport at low temperature and transport after binding of precursor proteins to antibodies. Under both conditions precursors were partially transported into mitochondria in an energy-dependent manner. They were processed by the metalloprotease in the matrix but a major proportion of the polypeptide chains was still present at the outer face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We conclude that transfer of precursors into the inner membrane or matrix space occurs through “translocation contact sites”; precursor polypeptides to F1β and cytochrome c1 enter the matrix space with the amino terminus first; and a membrane potential is required for the transmembrane movement on an amino-terminal “domain-like” structure but not for completing translocation of the major part of the polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2141752248,"To investigate the significance of silent gene loci for pilus antigenic variation in N. gonorrhoeae, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the major silent locus, pilS1. The pilS1 locus contains six tandem pilus gene copies linked by a 39 bp repeat sequence also present in the expression loci. All silent copies lack the common N-terminal coding sequence of pilin, containing instead variant sequence information that constitutes a semivariable (SV) and a hypervariable (HV) domain. The SV and HV domains are interspersed with short, strictly conserved (C) regions flanking small cassettes of variable sequence information. It appears that such minicassettes from silent copies can be duplicated and transferred to other silent or expression genes by means of gene conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2089102363,Cell surface molecules of eukaryotic cells have been considered to be integrated into the membrane bilayer by a transmembrane protein sequence. The Thy-1 antigen of rodent thymocytes and brain was the first eukaryotic membrane molecule for which biochemical data clearly suggested membrane integration via a nonprotein tail. Direct evidence is now presented showing that a glycophospholipid structure is attached to the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue and that 31 carboxyl-terminal amino acids predicted from the Thy-1 complementary DNA sequence are not present in the mature glycoprotein. These experimental results raise questions concerning signaling across a cell membrane since antibodies to Thy-1 can stimulate T lymphocytes to release lymphokines and undergo cell division.

https://openalex.org/W1529662354,"Many enzymes, represented by yeast glutamine synthetase, are inactivated and degraded in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), oxygen, and catalytic amounts of iron salts. The roles of DTT and iron can be replaced by ascorbate and copper, respectively. Experimental data suggest that reactive oxygen species, likely hydroxyl radicals, are generated locally around irons bound at specific sites on enzymes, and these species are responsible for the inactivation and degradation. Since many biochemicals are contaminated with metal salts in quantities sufficient for some hydroxyl radical formation to occur, the possibility of oxidative modification and degradation should be considered when an enzyme is exposed to DTT."
https://openalex.org/W1544390057,"A nonlysosomal alkaline protease which degrades the oxidatively modified form of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat and mouse liver acetone powders. Its molecular weight was determined to be 300,000 by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration but results of further studies using high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration suggest a value of 650,000. Examination of the subunit structure by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed multiple bands of molecular weights between 22,000 and 34,000. The alkaline protease was inhibited by thiol reagents. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin partially inhibited the protease. The inhibition by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was prevented by dithiothreitol, and alpha 1-antitrypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor did not inhibit. No inhibition was observed with metalloprotease inhibitors. The alkaline protease is active over a broad range of pH with optimum activity for the degradation of oxidized glutamine synthetase around pH 9.0. Its activity is not stimulated by MgATP. A study of the products of insulin B chain degradation demonstrated major cleavage sites at Gln13-Ala14, Leu15-Tyr16, Cys(SO3H)19-Gly20, Gln4-His5, and Leu17-Val18. Based on its endopeptidase activity and its inhibitor specificity, the alkaline protease should be classified as a cysteine proteinase. It appears to be distinct from previously described proteinases and is likely involved in nonlysosomal mechanisms of intracellular protein turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1985392531,"Clathrin-coated membranes are intimately associated with a variety of protein transport processes in eukaryotic cells, yet no direct test of clathrin function has been possible. The data presented demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not require clathrin for either cell growth or protein secretion. Antiserum to the yeast clathrin heavy chain has been used to isolate a molecular clone of the heavy chain gene (CHC1) from a library of yeast DNA in lambda gt11. Clathrin-deficient mutant yeast have been obtained by replacing the single chromosomal CHC1 gene with a disrupted version of the cloned DNA. Cells harboring a nonfunctional chc1 allele produce no immunoreactive heavy chain polypeptide, and vesicles prepared from mutant cells are devoid of clathrin heavy and light chains. Although clathrin-deficient cells grow two to three times more slowly than normal, secretion of invertase occurs at a nearly normal rate. Therefore protein transport through the secretory pathway is not obligately coupled to the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1485802709,"The neuropeptide somatostatin inhibits hormone release from GH4C1 pituitary cells via two mechanisms: inhibition of stimulated adenylate cyclase and a cAMP-independent process. To determine whether both mechanisms involve the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein Ni, we used pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates Ni and thereby blocks its function. Pertussis toxin treatment of GH4C1 cells blocked somatostatin inhibition of both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-stimulated cAMP accumulation and prolactin secretion. In membranes prepared from toxin-treated cells, somatostatin inhibition of VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was reduced and 125I-Tyr1-somatostatin binding was decreased more than 95%. In contrast, pertussis toxin did not affect the biological actions or the membrane binding of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. These results indicate that ADP-ribosylated Ni cannot interact with occupied somatostatin receptors and that somatostatin inhibits VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase via Ni. To investigate somatostatin's cAMP-independent mechanism, we used depolarizing concentrations of K+ to stimulate prolactin release without altering intracellular cAMP levels. Measurement of Quin-2 fluorescence showed that 11 mM K+ increased intracellular [Ca2+] within 5 s. Somatostatin caused an immediate, but transient, decrease in both basal and K+-elevated [Ca2+]. Consistent with these findings, somatostatin inhibited K+-stimulated prolactin release, also without affecting intracellular cAMP concentrations. Pertussis toxin blocked the somatostatin-induced reduction of [Ca2+]. Furthermore, the toxin antagonized somatostatin inhibition of K+-stimulated and VIP-stimulated secretion with the same potency (ED50 = 0.3 ng/ml). These results indicate that pertussis toxin acts at a common site to prevent somatostatin inhibition of both Ca2+- and cAMP-stimulated hormone release. Thus, Ni appears to be required for somatostatin to decrease both cAMP production and [Ca2+] and to inhibit the actions of secretagogues using either of these intracellular messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1566117661,"Abstract The polypeptide composition of the NO-3-sensitive H+-ATPase of vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) vesicles isolated from red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage root was investigated by affinity labeling with [alpha-32P]3-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate [( alpha-32P]BzATP) and [14C]N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide [( 14C]DCCD). The photoactive affinity analog of ATP, BzATP, is a potent inhibitor of the tonoplast ATPase (apparent KI = 11 microM) and the photolysis of [alpha-32P]BzATP in the presence of native tonoplast yields one major 32P-labeled polypeptide of 57 kDa. Photoincorporation into the 57-kDa polypeptide shows saturation with respect to [alpha-32P]BzATP concentration and is blocked by ATP. [14C]DCCD, a hydrophobic carboxyl reagent and potent irreversible inhibitor of the tonoplast ATPase (k50 = 20 microM) labels a 16-kDa polypeptide in native tonoplast. The tonoplast ATPase is purified approximately 12-fold by Triton X-100 solubilization and Sepharose 4B chromatography. Partial purification results in the enrichment of two prominent polypeptides of 67 and 57 kDa. Solubilization, chromatography, and sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of tonoplast labeled with [alpha-32P]BzATP or [14C]DCCD results in co-purification of the 57- and 16-kDa labeled polypeptides with ATPase activity. It is concluded that the tonoplast H+-ATPase is a multimer containing structurally distinct BzATP- and DCCD-binding subunits of 57 and 16 kDa, respectively. The data also suggest the association of a 67-kDA polypeptide with the ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1565514826,"Higher plant cells have one or more vacuoles important for maintaining cell turgor and for the transport and storage of ions and metabolites. One driving force for solute transport across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) is provided by an ATP-dependent electrogenic H+ pump. The tonoplast H+-pumping ATPase from oat roots has been solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified 16-fold by Sepharose 4B chromatography. The partially purified enzyme was sensitive to the same inhibitors (N-ethylmaleimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonic acid, and NO-3) as the native membrane-bound enzyme. The partially purified enzyme was stimulated by Cl- (Km(app) = 1.0 mM) and hydrolyzed ATP with a Km(app) of 0.25 mM. Thus, the partially purified tonoplast ATPase has retained the properties of the native membrane-bound enzyme. [14C]DCCD labeled a single polypeptide (14-18 kDa) in the purified tonoplast ATPase preparation. Two major polypeptides, 72 and 60 kDa, that copurified with the ATPase activity and the 14-18-kDa DCCD-binding peptide are postulated to be subunits of a holoenzyme of 300-600 kDa (estimated by gel filtration). Despite several catalytic similarities with the mitochondrial H+-ATPase, the major polypeptides of the tonoplast ATPase differed in mass from the alpha and beta subunits (58 and 55 kDa) and the [14C] DCCD-binding proteolipid (8 kDa) of the oat F1F0-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2000659885,"Efficient utilization of the early SV40 poly(A) site in vivo requires sequences between 5 bp and 18 bp downstream of the cleavage site. We have used a HeLa nuclear extract to examine the sequence requirements for in vitro cleavage. DNA segments containing the SV40 poly(A) site were cloned into an SP6 vector. SP6 RNAs, accurately cleaved and polyadenylated, were detected by primer extension. Cleavage was enhanced by the presence of a cap on the primary transcript, and was inhibited by the addition of 10 microM 7meGpppG. In close agreement with the in vivo results, efficient processing at the poly(A) site in vitro required the specific downstream sequences in the SP6 RNA transcript. These experiments indicate that the sequence in the RNA precursor downstream of the cleavage site, shown to be important for efficient processing in vivo, is recognized in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1484051880,"Abstract gamma-Interferon (IFN-gamma) is a well characterized lymphokine known to regulate many mononuclear phagocyte functions, including expression of class I and class II major histocompatibility complex genes. The second component of complement (C2) and factor B are major histocompatibility complex class III gene products synthesized in mononuclear phagocytes. Recombinant IFN-gamma increased the synthesis of C2 and factor B in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes and in murine fibroblasts transfected with cosmid DNA bearing the human C2 and factor B genes. In both cell types the increases in C2 and factor B protein synthesis were detected at concentrations of IFN-gamma less than 1 unit/ml and the regulation of each was pretranslational. The IFN-gamma-induced increases in C2 and factor B mRNA did not require new protein synthesis. In primary cultures of human monocytes, the kinetics of induction of C2 and factor B synthesis differed, but in the transfected L-cells the kinetics were similar, suggesting differences in transduction of the IFN-gamma signal, transcriptional, and/or post-transcriptional events in the two cell types. The small size of the factor B 5' flanking region, which is bounded by the 3' terminus of the IFN-gamma-regulated C2 gene, provides a well defined region to probe the structural basis for IFN-gamma regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1497616291,"Pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase was solubilized with Triton X-100 from human jejunal mucosal brush borders and purified approximately 5,000-fold using organomercurial affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and gel filtration. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme in the Triton micelle was estimated as 700,000 using Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie stain demonstrated two polypeptide bands at 145,000 and 115,000 daltons. The purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of 7.2, was maximally active at pH 5.5, and was stable above pH 6.5 and at temperatures up to 65 degrees C for at least 90 min. Human jejunal brush-border pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase is an exopeptidase which liberated [14C]Glu as the sole labeled product of PteGlu2[14C]Glue (where PteGlun represents pteroylpolyglutamate), failed to liberate a radioactive product from PteGlu2[14C]GluLeu2, and released all possible labeled PteGlun products during incubation with Pte[14C]GluGlu6 with the accumulation of Pte[14C]Glu. PteGlu2, PteGlu3, and PteGlu7 were substrates, each with Km = 0.6 microM, whereas PteGlu was a weak inhibitor of the hydrolysis of PteGlu3 with Ki = 20 microM. Components of the pteroyl moiety, Glu, and short chain Glun in alpha or gamma linkages were not inhibitory. The enzyme was activated by Zn2+ or Co2+. The properties of brush-border pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase are different from those described for the soluble intracellular pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase in other species and in human mucosa, yet are consistent with previous data on the process of hydrolysis of PteGlun in the intact human intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1493102428,"The sulfated glycans in the tunic of Styela plicata differ from the glycosaminoglycans of animal tissues and also from the sulfated polysaccharides isolated from marine algae. The ascidian glycans occur primarily as three fractions that differ markedly in molecular weight and chemical composition. The high molecular weight fraction encompasses a broad range of molecular weights but is chemically homogeneous and contains an unusual amount of galactose. The 20,000 molecular weight polysaccharide is rich in galactose and glucose while the 8,000 molecular weight fraction is rich in amino sugars and contains the neutral hexoses galactose, glucose, and mannose. All fractions contain large amounts of sulfate esters. The ascidians polysaccharides can be extracted from the tissue by proteolytic enzyme or by guanidine hydrochloride solutions. The high molecular weight fraction is preferentially extracted by papain while guanidine hydrochloride removes mainly the low molecular weight polysaccharides. We speculate that these sulfated glycans are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the tunic, in analogy with the glycosaminoglycans of vertebrate connective tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2041788158,"In rat hippocampal pyramidal cells tested in situ by iontophoresis of several neurotransmitters, ethanol significantly enhanced excitatory responses to acetylcholine and inhibitory responses to somatostatin-14 but had no statistically significant effect on excitatory responses to glutamate or inhibitory responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid or, in preliminary tests, to norepinephrine or serotonin. The effects of ethanol on responses to acetylcholine and somatostatin-14 may provide insight into synaptic mechanisms underlying the behavioral consequences of ethanol intoxication."
https://openalex.org/W1601623158,"The yeast nuclear gene ATP2 encodes a F1-ATPase beta-subunit protein of 509 amino acids with a predicted mass of 54,575 daltons. In contrast to the ATPase beta-subunit proteins determined previously from Escherichia coli and various plant sources, the yeast mitochondrial precursor peptide contains a unique cysteine residue within its immediate amino terminus. Expression of an in-frame deletion in ATP2 between residues 28 and 34 to eliminate this single cysteine residue located near the processing site of the matrix protease does not prevent the in vivo delivery of the subunit to mitochondria or its assembly into a functional ATPase complex. Thus, the import F1 beta-subunit into mitochondria does not require a covalent modification of the type utilized for the secretion of the major lipoprotein from E. coli. In addition, analysis of the level of the major F1-ATPase subunits in mitochondria prepared from an atp2- disruption mutant demonstrates that the in vivo import of these catalytic subunits is not dependent on each other. These data and additional studies, therefore, suggest that the determinants for mitochondrial delivery reside within the amino terminus of the individual precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1538239556,"Treatments that enhance the latent ATPase activity of the chloroplast coupling factor (CF1) also induce hypersensitivity of the gamma subunit toward trypsin. A number of different gamma subunit cleavage products are formed (Moroney, J. V., and McCarty, R. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5910-5914). We have compared the gamma cleavage products of membrane-bound and isolated CF1, activated either by reduction of the gamma disulfide bond or by removal of the epsilon subunit. The gamma subunit of isolated CF1 lacking the epsilon subunit was cleaved to a 27,000-Da species. The same cleavage site became exposed following energy-dependent conformational changes in the membrane-bound enzyme. Activation by reduction of the gamma disulfide bond also exposed this site. However, the gamma subunit of reduced CF1 was cleaved rapidly at an additional site and trypsin treatment gave rise to a 25,000-Da gamma species. The small peptide generated by the second cleavage contains one of the cysteinyl residues of the reduced disulfide bridge of gamma. This peptide dissociates from the enzyme and can be isolated by gel filtration. The close proximity of the trypsin cleavage sites to the disulfide bond of gamma is discussed with respect to the effects of tryptic cleavage on the ATPase activity of CF1. The data indicate that structural changes in a limited region of the gamma subunit strongly influence the catalytic properties of both soluble and membrane-bound CF1."
https://openalex.org/W1966553359,"The availability of a clone containing two linked immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes located 15.8 kb apart has allowed us to study the functional capabilities of the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer element in its normal chromosomal context. In plasmacytoma J606 the 3' VH gene is joined to D and J gene segments, located within 1.7 kb of the heavy chain enhancer, and expressed; the 5' VH gene is 17.5 kb from the enhancer in J606 DNA. Run-on transcription in isolated nuclei demonstrated specific transcription of the 5' VH gene in J606 that was 60% that of the expressed 3' VH gene. No other enhancer elements are detectable closer to the 5' VH gene than the known heavy chain enhancer. Thus, the heavy chain enhancer appears to be capable of activating transcription of a VH promoter located 17.5 kb away and of activating two tandem VH promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1555683736,"The mesogloea collagen of a primitive animal, the jellyfish Stomolophus nomurai, belonging to the class Scyphozoa in the Coelenterata, was studied with respect to its chain structure. Most of the mesogloea collagen was solubilized by limited digestion with pepsin and isolated by selective precipitation at 0.9 m NaCl in 0.5 M acetic acid. Upon denaturation, the pepsin-solubilized collagen produced three distinct alpha chains, alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3, in comparable amounts which were separable by CM-cellulose chromatography. The nonidentity of these alpha chains was confirmed by amino acid and carbohydrate analyses and peptide mapping. Furthermore, the introduction of intramolecular cross-links into native molecules by formaldehyde yielded a large proportion of gamma 123 chain with chain structure alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3, as judged by chromatographic behavior and peptide maps. We concluded that mesogloea collagen is comprised of alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 heterotrimers and is chemically like vertebrate Type V collagen. On the other hand, sea anemone mesogloea collagen from the class Anthozoa was previously reported to comprise (alpha)3 homotrimers (Katzman, R. L., and Kang, A. H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5486-5489). On the basis of these findings, we assume that alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 heterotrimers arose in evolution with the divergence of Scyphozoa and Anthozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1663580765,"Synthesis of glycoprotein A, the major surfactant-associated protein, was demonstrated in Type II epithelial cells isolated from rat lung. Predominant, secreted forms migrated as glycoproteins with asparagine-linked, complex-type oligosaccharides (32,000-36,000 daltons, pI 4.2-4.8). Primary in vitro translation products of the glycoprotein migrated as five distinct proteins of approximately 26,000 daltons which were processed by pancreatic microsomal membranes in vitro to 30,000-34,000-dalton, endoglycosidase F-sensitive forms. These in vitro processed forms of glycoprotein A co-migrated with intracellular forms immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled, Type II cells. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine-labeled cells demonstrated rapid synthesis of endoglycosidase H-sensitive precursors of 34,000 daltons, pI 4.7-4.8, which were neither secreted from Type II cells nor detected in surfactant from alveolar lavage. These high-mannose forms were slowly processed to more acidic, endoglycosidase H-resistant, neuraminidase-sensitive forms. At between 10 and 180 min, fully sialylated or other endoglycosidase H-resistant forms were a minor fraction of intracellular glycoprotein A. After 16 h, intracellular glycoproteins A were primarily present as endoglycosidase H-resistant forms. Secretion of mature, sialylated, glycoprotein A was first detected 1 h after labeling, and was also readily detected after 16-24 h chase period. Tunicamycin, which blocks N-linked protein glycosylation, resulted in synthesis of three major 26,000-dalton proteins which co-migrated with the nonglycosylated, surfactant-associated proteins A1 present in surfactant from alveolar lavage and with the major in vitro translation products of rat lung poly(A+) mRNA. Tunicamycin inhibited secretion of glycoprotein A. Swainsonine, which inhibits Golgi alpha-mannosidase II, completely inhibited synthesis of the fully sialylated molecule. Swainsonine produced forms of glycoprotein A which were both neuraminidase- and endoglycosidase H-sensitive and were readily secreted. Monensin, an ionophore that alters protein transport, markedly inhibited intracellular sialylation and secretion. These studies demonstrate that pulmonary Type II cells rapidly synthesize and process surfactant-associated glycoprotein A precursors to endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms, which are slowly sialylated prior to secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1604510628,"Isolated chloroplast coupling factor 1 ATPase is known to retain about 1 mol of tightly bound ADP/mol of enzyme. Some experimental results have given evidence that the bound ADP is at catalytic sites, but this view has not been supported by observations of a slow replacement of the bound ADP when CaATP or MgATP is added. The experiments reported in this paper show why a slow replacement of ADP bound at a catalytic site can occur. When coupling factor 1, labeled with tightly bound [3H]ADP, is exposed to Mg2+ or Ca2+ prior to the addition of MgATP or CaATP, a pronounced lag in the onset of ATP hydrolysis is observed, and only slow replacement of the [3H]ADP occurs. Mg2+ or Ca2+ can induce inhibition very rapidly, as if an inhibited form of the enzyme results whenever the enzyme with tightly bound ADP encounters Mg2+ or Ca2+ prior to ATP. The inhibited form can be slowly reactivated by incubation with EDTA, although some irreversible loss in activity is encountered. In contrast, when MgATP or CaATP is added to enzyme depleted of Mg2+ and Ca2+ by incubation with EDTA, a rapid onset of ATP hydrolysis occurs and most of the tightly bound [3H]ADP is released within a few seconds, as expected for binding at a catalytic site. The Mg2+-induced inhibition of both the ATPase activity and the lack of replacement of tightly bound [3H] ADP can be largely prevented by incubation with Pi under conditions favoring Pi addition to the site containing the tightly bound ADP. Our and other results can be explained if enzyme catalysis is greatly hindered when MgADP or CaADP without accompanying Pi is tightly bound at one of the three catalytic sites on the enzyme in a high affinity conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1538342687,"Modifications of the catalytic beta subunits of the chloroplast ATPase (CF1-ATPase) are reported which support the proposal that all three subunits participate sequentially during catalysis. The beta subunits of the CF1-ATPase are sufficiently homogeneous to allow detection of their derivatization with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) or the substrate analog 2-azido-ATP by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing. Whether the DCCD reacts with the same beta subunit that tightly binds ATP has not been known. Our results show that when CF1-ATPase is covalently labeled with 2-azido-ATP followed by reaction with DCCD, different beta subunits are labeled. The DCCD labeling does not stop catalytic cooperativity of the CF1-ATPase and allows slow enzyme turnover. When the DCCD-modified enzyme catalyzes 2-azido-ATP cleavage and the enzyme with tightly bound nucleotide is photolyzed, both DCCD-modified and unmodified subunits are randomly labeled by the azido nucleotide. This result is as expected if during the catalytic cycle one beta subunit with unique properties is replaced by another subunit that gains these properties. The participation of all three subunits in the catalytic cycle is suggested by the apparent retention of catalytic cooperativity by the two remaining subunits after one subunit has already catalyzed 2-azido-ATP cleavage and been labeled."
https://openalex.org/W1588274201,"Nuclear envelopes contain a nucleoside triphosphatase. Hydrolysis of ATP or GTP by this enzyme parallels energy-dependent efflux of poly(A)-containing mRNA from nuclei in vitro. Nucleoside triphosphatase has been purified from highly purified preparations of nuclear envelopes from rat liver by three successive affinity steps. The essentially homogeneous enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 as checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and displays a rather broad substrate specificity. ATP and GTP are hydrolyzed at nearly equal rates, whereas UTP and CTP are only half as active as substrates. For optimal activity, a one-to-one ratio of a divalent cation (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+) and the nucleoside triphosphate substrate, an alkaline pH and a temperature of 34 degrees C are required. In contrast to the enzyme associated with nuclear envelopes which is stimulated by synthetic poly(A) and the poly(A) segment of the natural poly(A)-containing mRNA, homogeneous nucleoside triphosphatase is unable to be modulated by this polynucleotide species."
https://openalex.org/W293563055,"The regulation of the rate of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and arsenylation was studied at two external free Ca2+ concentrations. The rate of arsenate-stimulated respiration in absence of added ADP was not affected by external 10(-9) and 10(-6) M Ca2+ levels or carboxyatractyloside, while state 3 respiration was profoundly modified. In addition, the kinetic analysis showed that the rate of arsenylation in the presence of ADP was more efficient (Vm/Km ratio 3.5 times higher) in the catalytic process than phosphorylation. Therefore, this suggests that the activity of the ATP/ADP carrier is importantly controlled by Ca2+. The evaluation of the control in phosphorylation showed that the flux-control coefficients (Ci) exerted by the ATP/ADP carrier (ranged between 0.23 and 0.48) and the ATP synthase (0.05-0.57) were modified in a reciprocal way by Ca2+ and Pi concentrations. This suggests that these two enzymes are coupling sequentially through a common intermediate, the intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio. Other important steps controlling phosphorylation were the b-c1 complex (Ci = 0.30) and the cytochrome oxidase (Ci = 0.23) but they were not modified by Ca2+. It was also found that the main step controlling arsenylation was the ATP synthase (Ci = 0.74). The increment in the inorganic arsenate concentration induced a diminution in the control exerted by the ATP synthase (from 0.73 to 0.56). The results suggest that Ca2+ and Pi (or inorganic arsenate) could be regulated by ATP synthesis through an activating effect on ATP/ADP carrier and/or ATP synthase."

The precursor to the rat liver mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine carbamyltransferase (Mr = approximately 40,000), was efficiently imported by rat heart mitochondria in vitro and processed to mature protein. Import of the precursor to a second matrix enzyme, carbamyl-phosphate synthetase I (Mr = approximately 165,000), could not be demonstrated. However, a 33-kDa hybrid protein, bearing the precarbamyl-phosphate synthetase I signal sequence (38 amino acids) and 55 amino acids from the amino terminus of the mature enzyme, followed by the carboxyl-terminal 209 amino acids of ornithine carbamyltransferase, was imported and processed under identical conditions. The topogenic function of the preornithine carbamyltransferase signal sequence (32 amino acids) was confirmed by constructing a hybrid protein bearing the signal sequence and five amino acids of mature enzyme, followed by 250 amino acids of the cytosolic enzyme of Escherichia coli, asparagine synthetase; the hybrid was transported to the matrix compartment of heart mitochondria where processing, albeit incorrect, took place. A hybrid asparagine synthetase bearing the pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase signal sequence plus 28 amino acids of mature ornithine carbamyltransferase, however, was imported and processed with apparent fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W1583926261,"The gorgonian coral Pseudoplexaura porosa contains a lipoxygenase capable of converting exogenous arachidonic acid into (8R)-8-hydroperoxy-5,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. The (8R)- (or 8-L-) configuration in this product, opposite to that observed in previously reported 8-lipoxygenase products, was determined unambiguously by comparison of oxidative ozonolysis fragments with authentic malic acid-derived standards. Extracts from the coral contained no detectable prostaglandins (PGAs, PGBs, PGEs, or PGFs). Although arachidonic acid represents one of the most abundant of the common fatty acids found in the phospholipid and total lipid fractions of P. porosa, products ascribable to the arachidonic acid 8-lipoxygenase pathway ((8R)-8-hydroperoxy-5,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, the corresponding alcohol 8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, further transformation products) have not yet been identified in the coral extracts. The physiological significance of the 8-lipoxygenase in this species remains a matter for speculation."
https://openalex.org/W1565751394,"Selective enrichment of clathrin-coated membranes by anticlathrin immunoadsorption was used to examine the internalization of receptor-ligand complexes through coated pits. Using Staphylococcus aureus-anticlathrin antibody and [35S]methionine-labeled KB cells, the kinetics of association of the epidermal growth factor (EGF-R) and transferrin receptors (TF-R) with coated membranes were directly examined. The accumulation of EGF-R in coated pits at the cell surface was dependent upon EGF binding. EGF-R then passed sequentially through a compartment which did not react with anticlathrin antibody and a second clathrin-coated compartment. The EGF-R was degraded in lysosomes with a half-life of approximately 41-55 min. The tumor promoter, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, appears to mimic the action of EGF in inducing EGF-R accumulation in coated pits at the cell surface and receptor internalization. In contrast to the results with EGF-R, the TF-R was found in clathrin-coated membranes in the presence or absence of TF, and the concentration of TF-R in clathrin-coated membranes did not significantly change with time. The method presented should be of great utility for examining the biochemical changes that occur during the receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting of ligands and receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1552100326,"The kinetic parameters and some enzymatic characteristics of human platelet and chicken gizzard transglutaminases were determined. Activity of the transglutaminases was regulated by calmodulin. These enzymes co-isolated with alpha-actinin and were dissociated from alpha-actinin by gel filtration and absorption onto a calmodulin affinity column. Silver-stained polyacrylamide gels showed that the protein peak eluted by EGTA from this column contained polypeptides of Mr approximately 58,000 and 63,000. The transglutaminases required Ca2+ for incorporation of monodansylcadaverine into casein and actin substrates. Activity was enhanced 3-fold by calmodulin with a biphasic effect, showing stimulation at 10-200 nM and inhibition at concentrations higher than 300 nM. In the presence of 200 nM calmodulin, half-maximal transglutaminase stimulation was obtained with 2.5 microM free [Ca2+]. Chlorpromazine inhibited calmodulin enhancement of the transglutaminases. Activity of the transglutaminases was independent of proteolytic activation, since inhibitors for Ca2+-dependent proteases failed to inhibit filamin cross-linking. For comparison, factor XIIa, a plasma and platelet transglutaminase, required both Ca2+ and thrombin for activation and was insensitive to calmodulin. The cross-linking pattern of fibrin, fibrin monomers, and fibrinogen by the calmodulin-regulated transglutaminases showed, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, disappearance of fibrinogen alpha-chains with no decrease of beta- and gamma-chains or formation of gamma-gamma dimers. By autoradiography, cross-linked products of 125I-fibrinogen revealed heavily labeled high molecular weight polymers and polypeptides of Mr 98,000, 116,000, and 148,000; the latter appeared to be a transient species. However, when fibrin, fibrin monomers, and fibrinogen were used as factor XIIIa substrates, gamma-gamma dimers and alpha-polymers were formed. Formation of gamma-gamma dimers was slower with fibrinogen than with fibrin. Iodoacetamide blocked activity of factor XIIIa but not of the calmodulin-regulated transglutaminases."
https://openalex.org/W1671577927,"Abstract We have studied the binding of collagen fibers with platelet proteins using affinity chromatography on collagen-Sepharose. Only few proteins from platelet lysate were trapped by this column. When denatured collagen (gelatin) was used as the affinity ligand, the major protein did not bind and was identified as platelet Factor XIII by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and enzymic activity. This is zymogen form of transglutaminase, which corresponds to the a subunit of the coagulation factor in plasma. Immunoglobulins specific for platelet Factor XIII obtained from antiserum raised against plasma Factor XIII were able to initiate platelet aggregation by themselves, in strong contrast to nonspecific antibodies. This specific immunoglobulin-mediated platelet aggregation required the presence of Ca2+. It was inhibited by aspirin and prostacyclin, but not by specific inhibitors for other agonists. These data suggest the possibility that the zymogen form of Factor XIII is located on the surface of platelets and may play key role as the receptor for collagen-induced platelet aggregation."

The cholinesterase is found in coated vesicles of presumed endocytic origin following DFP treatment and perfusion for 3 min with galactosylated cholinesterase, a ligand for the asialoglycoprotein recpetor. Highly enriched populations of endocytic and exocytic coated vesicles can be separated by use of a novel cholinesterase mediated density shift technique. The two coated vesicle classes have very similar polypeptide compositions but differ significantly in the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1541572927,"The total amount of bound exchangeable and nonexchangeable adenine nucleotides in Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (BF1) was determined; three exchangeable nucleotides were assessed by equilibrium dialysis in a [14C]ADP-supplemented medium. When BF1 was purified in a medium supplemented with ATP, a stoichiometry of nearly 6 mol of bound nucleotides/mol of enzyme was found; three of the bound nucleotides were ATP and the others ADP. When BF1 was filtered on Sephadex G-50 in a glycerol medium (Garrett, N.E., and Penefsky, H.S. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6640-6647), bound ADP was rapidly released, in contrast to bound ATP which remained firmly attached to the enzyme. Upon incubation of BF1 with [14C]ADP, the bound ADP rather than the bound ATP was exchanged. Of the three [14C]ADPs which have bound to BF1 by exchange after equilibrium dialysis, one was readily lost by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50; the loss of bound [14C]ADP was markedly reduced by incubation of BF1 with aurovertin, a specific ligand of the beta subunit which is known to increase the affinity of the beta subunit for nucleotides (Issartel, J.-P., and Vignais, P. V. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 6591-6595). Upon photoirradiation of BF1 with [alpha-32P]2-azido-ADP, only the beta subunit was labeled; concomitantly, bound ADP was released, but the content in bound ATP remained stable. These results suggest that specific sites located on the three beta subunits bind nucleotides in a reversible manner. Consequently, the tightly bound ATP of native BF1 would be located on the alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1572303377,"Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase is irreversibly inhibited by the active site-directed inhibitor 3-chloropropionyl-CoA. Enzyme modification has been postulated to involve alkylation of an active site cysteinyl sulfhydryl group. DEAE-Sephadex chromatography of tryptic digests prepared from enzyme inactivated using chloro[14C]propionyl-CoA suggested that bound radioactivity is localized on one peptide. Specificity of the modification was further demonstrated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, which was used to isolate the radioactively labeled peptide in a chemically homogeneous form. Automated gas-phase Edman degradation techniques have been employed to confirm the assignment of cysteine as the inhibitor's target residue and to elucidate the sequence of amino acids which flank the 14C-carboxyethylated cysteine: Glu-Ser-Gly-Asn-Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Gly-Ile-Asp-Thr-(Thr)- Asn-Ala-S-[14C]carboxyethylcysteine-Tyr-Gly-Gln-Thr-(Ala). These data represent the first assignment of active site structure for hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1520753273,"We and others have suggested previously that the binding of somatostatin to its receptors in the pancreas is regulated by not only somatostatin analogs but also cholecystokinin analogs in proportion to their known biological potencies. To clarify the precise mechanism by which unrelated peptides modulate somatostatin binding, the effect of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), or a synthetic diacylglycerol analog, 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), on [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin binding to pancreatic acinar cell membranes was examined. Pretreatment of pancreatic acini for 120 min at 37 degrees C with 100 ng/ml TPA maximally reduced subsequent labeled somatostatin binding to acinar membranes. The inhibitory effect of TPA on the somatostatin binding was dependent on the dose used or the time and temperature of pretreatment. These effects of TPA were almost mimicked by the treatment of acini with OAG. Scatchard analysis of [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin binding demonstrated that the decrease in the labeled somatostatin binding induced by TPA or OAG pretreatment was due to the decrease in the maximum binding capacity without a significant change in the binding affinity. A specifically labeled single band of Mr = 90,000 obtained with a photoaffinity cross-linking study indicates that the somatostatin-binding sites are the same somatostatin receptor as previously described. Moreover, the intensity of the Mr = 90,000 band was dramatically decreased when acini were treated with increasing concentrations of TPA, a finding consistent with TPA-induced decrease in binding capacity. Such an inhibitory effect of TPA was abolished when pretreatment of acini with TPA was performed in the presence of Ca2+-chelating compounds such as EDTA and EGTA or phospholipid-interacting drugs such as chlorpromazine and tetracaine. Interestingly, the combined treatment of TPA and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 caused synergistic inhibition of the subsequent labeled somatostatin binding to acinar membranes, although Ca2+ ionophore itself almost failed to affect the somatostatin binding. These results suggest, therefore, that TPA or OAG can modulate somatostatin binding to its receptors on rat pancreatic acinar cell membranes, presumably through activation of Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C); and the activated protein kinase C and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization presumably act to modulate the pancreatic acinar somatostatin receptors synergistically."
https://openalex.org/W1581174167,"CAD, is a multidomain polypeptide, with a molecular weight of over 200,000, that has glutamine-dependent carbamyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase activity as well as regulatory sites that bind UTP and 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. The protein thus catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and controls the activity of the pathway in higher eukaryotes. Controlled proteolysis of CAD isolated from Syrian hamster cells, cleaves the molecule into seven major proteolytic fragments that contain one or more of the functional domains. The two smallest fragments, which had molecular weights of 44,000 and 40,000, corresponded to the fully active dihydroorotase (DHO) and aspartate transcarbamylase (ATC) domains, respectively, but the larger fragments have not been previously characterized. In this study, enzymatic assays of partially fractionated digests and immunoblotting with antibodies specifically directed against the purified ATC domain, the purified dihydroorotase domain and an 80-kDa fragment of the putative carbamyl-phosphate synthetase domain established the precursor-product relationships among all of the major proteolytic fragments of CAD. These results indicate that 1) only the intact molecule had all of the functional domains, 2) a species with a molecular weight of 200,000 was produced in the first step of proteolysis which had glutamine-dependent carbamyl-phosphate synthetase and dihydroorotase activity, but neither aspartate transcarbamylase activity nor the antigenic determinants present on the isolated ATC domain, and 3) cleavage of the 200-kDa species produced a species, with a molecular mass of 150,000 which lacked both aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase domains. This 150-kDa species, containing the postulated carbamyl-phosphate synthetase, glutamine, and regulatory (UTP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate) domains, had two elastase-sensitive sites that divided this region of the polypeptide chain into 10-, 65-, and 80-kDa segments. The location of the functional sites on these segments has not yet been established. The immunochemical analysis also revealed the existence of possible precursors of the stable aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase domains, suggesting that the chain segments connecting the functional domains of CAD are extensive and that the overall size of the intact polypeptide chain has been underestimated. On the basis of these studies we have proposed a model of the domain structure of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W1533387169,"Photophosphorylation and ATPase activities were restored to beta-less Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores by their reconstitution with purified beta-subunits of either R. rubrum F1-ATPase (Rr beta) or Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (Ec beta). In the homologous reconstituted system both activities were restored to the same extent, whereas in the hybrid system ATP synthesis was restored to about 10% when the hydrolysis was restored to 200%. This difference in rates of synthesis and hydrolysis was not due to any general uncoupling effect of Ec beta leading to an increased membrane permeability to protons, because with both hybrid and homologous systems an identical light-induced quenching of quinacrine fluorescence was observed. They differed, however, in ATP-driven quenching of quinacrine fluorescence, which was much lower in the hybrid system. These results suggest that the hybrid has a decreased capacity for proton-translocation through the membrane-bound Fo channel during ATP hydrolysis, and probably also during ATP synthesis. The very high ATPase activity of the hybrid system indicates that it might enable the released protons to leak to the outside medium rather than to move inside through the Fo channel. The activities restored by Rr beta and Ec beta exhibit a similar sensitivity to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but different sensitivities to oligomycin and to an anti-E. coli F1 (EcF1) antibody. Oligomycin inhibited only the homologous R. rubrum system whereas anti-EcF1 was a much more effective inhibitor of the hybrid system. It is therefore concluded that Rr beta plays a role, that the Ec beta cannot fulfill, in conferring oligomycin sensitivity to the RrFo X F1-ATP synthase-ATPase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1590401092,"For the purpose of developing a transglutaminase inhibitor which could be effective in physiological and pharmacological studies, a series of phenylthiourea derivatives of alpha, omega-diaminoalkanes were designed, synthesized, and evaluated kinetically as inhibitors of transglutaminases. A homologous series of compounds of the structure phenylthiourea-(CH2)n-NH2, where n = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, were tested for the inhibition of both guinea pig liver transglutaminase-catalyzed amine incorporation into various glutamine-containing substrates and plasma transglutaminase (factor XIIIa)-catalyzed amine incorporation into fibrin and fibrin cross-linking. It was found that the inhibitory activity of the compounds increases with increasing number of methylene groups in the side chain up to a maximum of n = 5. A further increase in the length of the methylene side chain to n = 6 results in decreased activity. The Ki value (4.9 X 10(-5) M) of 1-(5-aminopentyl)-3-phenylthiourea (PPTU) (n = 5) for the inhibition of guinea pig transglutaminase-catalyzed amine incorporation into the B chain of oxidized insulin is in close agreement to its Km(app) value (7.1 X 10(-5) M) obtained using 14C-labeled PPTU. PPTU was also found to be a potent inhibitor of plasma transglutaminase-catalyzed fibrin cross-linking. The finding that the specificity of the alkylamines for inhibition is correlated with the length of their methyl side chains is compatible with those reported for aliphatic amines and monodansylcadaverine analogues (where dansyl is 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl). The phenylthiourea derivatives, however, are far less toxic in mice than monodansylcadaverine as indicated by their LD50 values: PPTU, 400 +/- 25 mg/kg; and monodansylcadaverine, 160 +/- 20 mg/kg."
https://openalex.org/W1479683232,"Priming human fibroblasts with low levels (100 units/ml) of homologous interferon (IFN) prior to induction of gene expression with poly(rI.rC) results in the accumulation of 5-10-fold higher levels of IFN-beta 1 mRNA when compared to induced but nonprimed cells. By run-on transcription assay we have determined that this increase results mainly from increased transcription rate of the IFN-beta 1 gene. We have also shown that priming leads to elevated cytoplasmic steady state levels of two additional RNA species which initiate at the major IFN-beta 1 mRNA initiation site and extend beyond the polyadenylation site for the IFN-beta 1 0.9-kilobase mRNA. Located next to the 3' end of the IFN-beta 1 gene we have also identified a novel poly(rI.rC)-induced gene which like the IFN-beta 1 gene is highly activated in cells primed with IFN prior to poly(rI.rC) induction. However, the expression of another poly(rI.rC)-induced gene located on a different chromosome is only slightly affected by the priming procedure used here. We postulate that IFN priming acts specifically on certain genes rather than by a general potentiation of poly(rI.rC) induction."
https://openalex.org/W1559425444,"Fresh serum and retinoids induce the expression of tissue transglutaminase in cultured mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. Analogues of cyclic AMP, such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP levels enhance the induction. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP alone has little effect on transglutaminase expression, but it increases the sensitivity of macrophages to low concentrations of either serum or retinoic acid. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP potentiates the transglutaminase-inducing activity of both free retinoic acid and retinoic acid bound to the serum retinol-binding protein. Pretreating macrophages with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or retinoic acid does not prime the cells to respond to the other agent; instead, both agents must be present simultaneously to obtain the synergistic induction of transglutaminase. Our studies suggest that the modulation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels may have pronounced effects on retinoic acid-induced gene expression in myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1647544735,"The permeability of neuronal membranes to Ca2+ is of great importance for neurotransmitter release. The temporal characteristics of Ca2+ fluxes in intact brain neurons have not been completely defined. In the present study 45Ca2+ was used to examine the kinetics of Ca2+ influx and efflux from unstimulated and depolarized rat brain neurons in culture. Under steady-state conditions three cellular exchangeable Ca2+ pools were identified in unstimulated cells: 1) a rapidly exchanging pool (t1/2 = 7 s) which represented about 10% of the total cellular Ca2+ and was unaffected by the presence of Co2+, verapamil, or tetrodotoxin; 2) a slowly exchanging pool (t1/2 = 360 s) which represented 42% of the total cellular Ca2+ and was inhibited by Co2+, but not by verapamil or tetrodotoxin; 3) a very slowly exchanging pool (t1/2 = 96 min) which represented 48% of the total cell Ca2+ was observed only in the prolonged efflux experiments. The rate of exchange of 45Ca2+ in the unstimulated cells was dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (half-saturation at 70 microM). Depolarization of the neurons with elevated K+ causes a rapid and sustained 45Ca2+ uptake. The cellular Ca2+ content increased from 56 nmol/mg protein in unstimulated cells to 81 nmol/mg protein during 5 min of depolarization. The kinetics of the net 45Ca2+ uptake by the stimulated neurons was consistent with movement of the ion with a first order rate constant of 0.0096 s-1 (t1/2 = 72 s) into a single additional compartment. The other cellular Ca2+ pools were apparently unaffected by stimulation. The stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake was inhibited by Co2+ and by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil but not by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin. Ca2+ uptake into this compartment was dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (half-saturation at 0.80 mM Ca2+). Predepolarization of the cells with high K+ for 10-60 s prior to the addition of the radioactive calcium did not alter the rate of 45Ca2+ incorporation into the stimulated cells. It is concluded that the rapidly exchanging, the slowly exchanging, and the depolarization-induced Ca2+ pools observed in intact brain neurons are physically as well as kinetically distinct from each other. In addition, the depolarization-induced component observed in stimulated cells represents movement of the Ca2+ ions through a single class of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. These Ca2+ channels are inhibited by Co2+ ions and by verapamil and are not inactivated during depolarization of the brain neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1572286245,"The possible presence of ATP-driven H+ translocase activity in isolated rat parotid secretory granules has been examined by several approaches. First the transmembrane pH difference measured by either [14C] methylamine or [3H]acetate distribution is not substantially affected by ATP in the presence of membrane-permeating anions. Second, despite a low intrinsic H+ permeability of parotid granule membranes, only a small variably detectable inside-positive transmembrane potential is observed (by altered distribution of radioactive ions) when ATP is added in the absence of permeant anions. Third, ATP-induced lysis of parotid granules is minor and appears to be independent of ATP hydrolysis. Finally, ATP-hydrolase activity of the parotid granule fraction is not stimulated by an H+ ionophore, nor is it susceptible to inhibition by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole at a concentration which decreases the measured ATPase of purified chromaffin granule membranes by more than 80%. These findings suggest that this exocrine secretory granule type, which is characterized by storage of a heterogeneous mixture of secretory proteins, exhibits H+ pump activity which is at most a small fraction of that observed in biogenic amine storage granules of neural and endocrine tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1593162178,"Urocanase from Pseudomonas putida becomes inactive in growing and resting cells and, as shown previously, is activated by the direct absorption of ultraviolet light. In this study, we describe the activation of urocanase by energy transfer from triplet indole-3-aldehyde, generated in the peroxidase-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid. The activation was time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent. The involvement of reactive oxygen intermediates was excluded by the lack of effect of appropriate quenchers and traps. Triplet quenchers, in contrast, reduced the level of activation. Photoexcited rose bengal, a triplet species of a different nature and origin, was also effective in promoting activation. These results demonstrate a potential mechanism of urocanase regulation not dependent on an environmental source of light, but rather brought about by an enzymically generated excited species."
https://openalex.org/W1594165220,"Chloroplast ATPase complex is activated by illumination in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol. ATPase complex which has been activated without dithiothreitol catalyzes ATP hydrolysis which is insensitive to stimulation by NH4Cl and is highly sensitive to medium pH. Addition of dithiothreitol during illumination results in an increase in the stimulating effect of NH4Cl on ATP hydrolysis and a decrease in pH sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis. With increasing time in the dark, the ability of NH4Cl to stimulate ATP hydrolysis decreases and the effect of pH on the ATP hydrolysis increases. The onset of resistance to NH4Cl stimulation and the increase in sensitivity to pH are accelerated by ADP and the acceleration is inhibited by Pi. ATP hydrolysis restores NH4Cl sensitivity and renders the activity more resistant to pH. These results suggest that active chloroplast ATPase complex converts its state reversibly from the NH4Cl-insensitive and highly pH-sensitive one to the NH4Cl-sensitive and relatively pH-insensitive one. The conversion from the former to the latter requires both sulfhydryl compound and energy."
https://openalex.org/W1594210443,"Abstract The regulation of ATP hydrolysis and Pi-ATP exchange reactions by ATP, ADP, Mg2+, and phosphate was studied in liposomes containing F0-F1 obtained from bovine heart submitochondrial particles by solubilization with lauryl dimethylamino oxide as described previously (Dreyfus, G., Celis, H., and Ramirez, J. (1984) Anal. Biochem. 142, 215-220). A simultaneous analysis of ATP hydrolysis and the Pi-ATP exchange reactions showed that the ratio of hydrolysis/exchange is close to one when the ATP concentration is in the lower micromolar range. In this preparation ADP stimulates the Pi-ATP exchange reaction and depresses ATP hydrolysis. The exchange reaction is almost abolished when ADP is removed from the medium by an ATP-regenerating system. Mg2+ in millimolar concentrations stimulates Pi-ATP exchange, and at the same time decreases ATP hydrolysis; accordingly, the hydrolysis/exchange ratio depends on the concentration of Mg2+. Inorganic phosphate also controls this ratio, a lower ratio being observed at high phosphate concentrations. The Pi-ATP exchange reaction, but not ATP hydrolysis, depends on the concentration of medium phosphate. These results indicate that the kinetic characteristics of this F0-F1 preparation are modified by Mg2+, ATP, and phosphate."
