https://openalex.org/W1986364668,Plants and algae resistant to the commonly used s-triazine herbicides display a wide spectrum of cross-resistance to other herbicides that act in a similar manner. Analysis of uniparental mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardi showed that three different amino acid residues in the 32-kilodalton thylakoid membrane protein can be independently altered to produce three different patterns of resistance to s-triazine and urea-type herbicides. These results clarify the molecular basis for herbicide resistance and cross-resistance. Two of the mutations do not alter normal electron transport and thus may have applications of agronomic interest.
https://openalex.org/W1997734147,"The mode of degradation of various halogenated compounds in isolated pure cultures and the disposition of the degradative genes have been studied. In many cases the degradative genes are found to be clustered on plasmids and appear to be under positive control. Genetic selection in vivo and genetic manipulations in vitro have allowed construction of strains having wider biodegradative potentials than their natural counterparts. Molecular cloning of the degradative gene clusters for halogenated compounds in vectors with a broad host range also allows the transfer of such genes to a large number of Gram-negative bacteria. The application of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T)-degrading microorganisms has demonstrated the effectiveness of this strain in removing large amounts of 2,4,5-T from contaminated soil within a short period, and such soil has been shown to support the growth of plants normally sensitive to low concentrations of 2,4,5-T. The two major challenges that must be addressed in the near future are the development of appropriate microbial technology for the decontamination of soil containing hazardous halogenated compounds, and the promulgation of appropriate regulations to ensure the safety and well-being of the public during the application of genetically improved strains in an open environment."

Previous experimental data have suggested that changes in the biochemistry and morphology of the aerobic muscle during cold acclimation might increase its output of mechanical power. The present experiments show that, because of these changes, carp can swim faster at low temperature using only their aerobic muscle, which results in an increase in their sustainable swimming speed. By modifying their musculature, cold-blooded animals can achieve some independence from the effects of seasonal changes in environmental temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2005413889,"New techniques that have been used to obtain a continuous ice core through the whole 416-meter thickness of the Ross Ice Shelf at Camp J-9 have demonstrated that the bottom 6 meters of the ice shelf consists of sea ice. The rate of basal freezing that is forming this ice is estimated by different methods to be 2 centimeters of ice per year. The sea ice is composed of large vertical crystals, which form the waffle-like lower boundary of the shelf. A distinct alignment of the crystals throughout the sea ice layer suggests the presence of persistent long-term currents beneath the ice shelf."
https://openalex.org/W2157149051,"The mean global increase in thermal radiation received at the surface of the earth as a consequence of a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide content is calculated to be 2.28 watts per square meter. Multiplying this forcing function by the atmosphere's surface air temperature response function, which has recently been determined by three independent experimental analyses to have a mean global value of 0.113 K per watt per square meter, yields a value of </= 0.26 K for the resultant change in the mean global surface air temperature. This result is about one order of magnitude less than those obtained from most theoretical numerical models, but it is virtually identical to the result of a fourth experimental approach to the problem described by Newell and Dopplick. There thus appears to be a major discrepancy between current theory and experiment relative to the effects of carbon dioxide on climate. Until this discrepancy is resolved, we should not be too quick to limit our options in the selection of future energy alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2073375195,"In addition to multifaceted lateral compound eyes, most insects possess three frontal eyes called ocelli. Each ocellus has a single lens, as does the vertebrate eye. The ocelli of some flying insects, locusts and dragonflies, have been shown to function as horizon detectors involved in the visual stabilization of course. In a walking insect, the desert ant Cataglyphis, it is now shown that the ocelli can read compass information from the blue sky. When the ant's compound eyes are occluded and both sun and landmarks are obscured, the ocelli, using the pattern of polarized light in the sky as a compass cue, help in guiding the ant back home."
https://openalex.org/W2061164978,"Pressure-volume-temperature relations for water at the depth of the magma chamber at 21 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise suggest that the maximum subsurface temperature of the geothermal fluid is about 420 degrees C. Both the chemistry of the discharging fluid and thermal balance considerations indicate that the effective water/rock ratios in the geothermal system are between 7 and 16. Such low ratios preclude effective metal transport at temperatures below 350 degrees C, but metal solubilization at 400 degrees C and above is effective even at such low ratios. It is proposed that the 420 degrees C fluid ascends essentially adiabatically and in the process expands, cools, and precipitates metal sulfides within the upper few hundred meters of the sea floor and on the sea floor itself."
https://openalex.org/W2047904195,"Some noctuid winter moths fly at near 0°C by maintaining an elevated (30° to 35°C) thoracic muscle temperature. Geometrid winter moths sustain themselves in free flight at subzero muscle temperatures. However, the temperature characteristics of citrate synthase and pyruvate kinase from both of these different kinds of moths and from a sphinx moth that flies with a muscle temperature of 40°C are nearly identical. Furthermore, mass-specific rates of energy expenditure of both kinds of winter moths are also similar at given thoracic temperature (near 0°C). The geometrids that are able to fly with a thoracic temperature near 0°C do so largely because of unusually low wing-loading, which permits a low energetic cost of flight."

https://openalex.org/W2162769899,"How did Mr. Rockefeller come to be interested in medical research, is a question that has often been asked, and its answer may well serve as an introduction to our remarks. Several years ago a close personal friend first suggested this as an important field in philanthropy and one as yet wholly neglected in this country. The discovery of diphtheria antitoxin made a deep impression on his mind. He was much interested in this great achievement and in its beneficent results, and it was the presentation of the facts connected with this discovery, with the explanation of the steps by which it was reached, which I think finally crystallized his thought to establish an institute the purpose of which should be to further such beneficent work for humanity. Once convinced of the need, the next question was, Could such work as this be done in this country? Mr. Rockefeller was"
