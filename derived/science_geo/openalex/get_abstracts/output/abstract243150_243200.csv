https://openalex.org/W2156933633,"Estrogen plays an essential physiologic role in reproduction and a pathologic one in breast cancer. The completion of the human genome has allowed the identification of the expressed regions of protein-coding genes; however, little is known concerning the organization of their cis-regulatory elements. We have mapped the association of the estrogen receptor (ER) with the complete nonrepetitive sequence of human chromosomes 21 and 22 by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with tiled microarrays. ER binds selectively to a limited number of sites, the majority of which are distant from the transcription start sites of regulated genes. The unbiased sequence interrogation of the genuine chromatin binding sites suggests that direct ER binding requires the presence of Forkhead factor binding in close proximity. Furthermore, knockdown of FoxA1 expression blocks the association of ER with chromatin and estrogen-induced gene expression demonstrating the necessity of FoxA1 in mediating an estrogen response in breast cancer cells."

Testing of nuclear weapons resulted in a dramatic global increase in the levels of the isotope 14C in the atmosphere, followed by an exponential decrease after 1963. We show that the level of 14C in genomic DNA closely parallels atmospheric levels and can be used to establish the time point when the DNA was synthesized and cells were born. We use this strategy to determine the age of cells in the cortex of the adult human brain and show that whereas nonneuronal cells are exchanged, occipital neurons are as old as the individual, supporting the view that postnatal neurogenesis does not take place in this region. Retrospective birth dating is a generally applicable strategy that can be used to measure cell turnover in man under physiological and pathological conditions.

Retrospective birth dating is a generally applicable strategy that can be used to measure cell turnover in man under physiological and pathological conditions. Many cells have a shorter life span than the organism and are continuously replaced. Cells exposed to a harsh environment, such as in the skin or intestine, are often very short lived. In other tissues there may be less cell turnover under physiological conditions, but regeneration may be activated in response to injury. For many cell types, however, it is largely unknown whether they turn over at all once development is completed. Cell generation is often studied by analysis of molecular markers of proliferation. This provides a good view of the number of cells in cycle at a given time, but it does not provide insight into the number of mature cells that are generated or added to the tissue. Administration of labeled nucleotides such as 3H-thymidine or BrdU allows prospective labeling of newborn cells and can reveal the generation and integration of mature cells in an organ. It is, however, difficult to detect rare events, and there are several technical caveats with a risk of both false positive and negative results, leaving room for controversy (Nowakowski and Hayes, 2000Nowakowski R.S. Hayes N.L. New neurons: extraordinary evidence or extraordinary conclusion?.Science. 2000; 288: 771Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Rakic, 2002aRakic P. Adult neurogenesis in mammals: an identity crisis.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 614-618PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is not possible to retrospectively determine cell turnover in collected material, and the toxicity of labeled nucleotides limits its use for studies in man. Much of our view on cell turnover in the adult human body is inferred from studies in rodents, which in most cases are only a few months old at the time of analysis. This may not be an ideal model for man, who can live for a century and can potentially have a greater need to replace cells over the life span. Although it may be easy to conceptualize that, for example, a neuron in the brain can live for months, is it possible for the same cell type to be maintained and function for many decades? Whether a specific cell type is exchanged, and at what rate, is a fundamental question that may have important implications for how we view the human body under physiological and pathological conditions. Alterations in cell turnover are a key feature in several diseases, such as decreased erythrocyte production in aplastic anemia or increased keratinocyte turnover in psoriasis. Distorted cell turnover has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, for example decreased neurogenesis in depression (Duman, 2004Duman R.S.

Myocardial aging and senescence: where have the stem cells gone?.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but it has remained controversial and difficult to study. Much of the impetus in stem cell research and regenerative medicine is fueled by the prospect of promoting cell replacement. Stimulating blood-cell production with erythropoietin or G-CSF are successful and established therapies (Richard and Schuster, 2002Richard S. Schuster M.W. Stem cell transplantation and hematopoietic growth factors.Curr. Hematol. Rep. 2002; 1: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that similar pharmacological therapies may be developed to influence cell replacement in other organs (Ding and Schultz, 2004Ding S.

Without knowing if a specific cell type is renewed in the healthy or pathological situation, it remains uncertain whether it may be realistic and rational to modulate this process. The lack of methods to study cell turnover in man prompted us to develop a novel strategy to approach this issue. Inspired by 14C-dating in archeology, we sought to develop a way to retrospectively determine the age of cells without the need for delivering any chemical to the individual prior to the analysis. 14C levels on earth have remained relatively constant over long time periods, and the radioactive decay of the isotope is used to retrospectively date biological material in archeology. The resolution in modern time is poor due to a half-life of 5730 years. However, extensive above ground testing of nuclear weapons between the mid 1950s and early 1960s resulted in the generation of large quantities of 14C (Figure 1A ), which rapidly distributed evenly in the atmosphere around the globe (De Vries, 1958De Vries H. Atomic bomb effect: variation of radiocarbon in plants, shells, and snails in the past 4 years.Science. 1958; 128: 250-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Nydal and Lovseth, 1965Nydal R. Lovseth K. Distribution of radiocarbon from nuclear tests.Nature. 1965; 206: 1029-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since the test ban treaty in 1963, there has been no high-yield, above-ground, nuclear detonation leading to significant 14C production (Levin and Kromer, 2004Levin I. Kromer B. The tropospheric 14CO2 level in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere (1959–2003).Radiocarbon. 2004; 46: 1261-1272Google Scholar). Thus, the levels have dropped thereafter exponentially, not primarily because of radioactive decay, but due to diffusion and equilibration with the oceans and the biosphere (Figure 1A), resulting in a slope decreasing 50% approximately every 11 years after 1963 (Levin and Kromer, 2004Levin I. Kromer B. The tropospheric 14CO2 level in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere (1959–2003).Radiocarbon. 2004; 46: 1261-1272Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the drastically altered atmospheric 14C levels in modern times to develop a strategy to retrospectively birth date cells in the human body. We use this method to address whether cortical neurons are renewed in the adult human brain and find that these neurons are as old as the person, arguing against adult neurogenesis in this region. This is a generally applicable strategy that can be used to analyze cell turnover in man under physiological and pathological conditions. 14C in the atmosphere reacts with oxygen and forms CO2, which enters the biotope through photosynthesis. Our consumption of plants, and of animals that live off plants, results in 14C levels in the human body paralleling those in the atmosphere with a short lag for seasonal growing and harvest cycles (Harkness, 1972Harkness D.D. Further investigations of the transfer of bomb 14C to man.Nature. 1972; 240: 302-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Libby et al., 1964Libby W.F. Berger R. Mead J.F. Alexander G.V. Ross J.F. Replacement rates for human tissue from atmospheric radiocarbon.Science. 1964; 146: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Most molecules in a cell are in constant flux, with the unique exception of genomic DNA, which is not exchanged after a cell has gone through its last division. The level of 14C integrated into genomic DNA should thus reflect the level in the atmosphere at any given time point, and we hypothesized that determination of 14C levels in genomic DNA could be used to retrospectively establish the birth date of cells in the human body. Atmospheric 14C levels have been monitored over time at several locations. As there may be some local variation in 14C levels in different geographical regions, we first established the atmospheric levels of 14C in recent years in the geographical region of the studied population. We dissected year rings from Swedish pine from 1962 to present, as well as several rings from the pre-bomb time. The 14C content of each tree ring was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. A tree ring is laid down annually and the cellulose is not changed thereafter, thus giving an accurate reflection of the 14C levels in the atmosphere for a specific year. The levels in Sweden closely matched the mid-latitude northern hemisphere levels (Figures 1B and 1C, Supplemental Table S1), in line with the rapid distribution of 14C in the atmosphere. Since our local data closely corresponded to the extensive material of mid-latitude northern hemisphere measurements collected in Germany (Levin and Kromer, 2004Levin I. Kromer B. The tropospheric 14CO2 level in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere (1959–2003).Radiocarbon. 2004; 46: 1261-1272Google Scholar), we related all our following analyses to these data. We next asked whether cells generated at different time points had 14C levels in genomic DNA that correspond to the time they were generated. The sensitivity of accelerator mass spectrometry is rapidly increasing, and 14C levels can today accurately be established with samples containing as little as 30 μg carbon, which corresponds to genomic DNA from 15 million cells. It is critical when extracting the genomic DNA for this application to keep contamination with non-DNA carbon sources to a minimum and not to introduce exogenous carbon that could be isolated with the DNA and thus skew the analysis. We therefore modified established DNA-extraction protocols to minimize the risk of carbon contamination (see Experimental Procedures). DNA samples were analyzed for purity in several ways; in addition to spectrophotometric analysis, the contents of all samples were analyzed by HPLC and the amount of total carbon (12C, 13C, and 14C) was determined during graphite preparation for isotope analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry. The knowledge of the amount of DNA (with a known proportion of the mass accounted for by carbon) and total carbon in each sample allows very sensitive detection of carbon contamination, irrespective of the source, and any sample in which the total carbon content was higher than calculated from the amount of DNA was excluded from further analysis. Depletion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by irradiation results in the rapid loss of leukocytes, demonstrating their short life span. We analyzed 14C levels in DNA from nucleated blood cells, representing a population of cells known to be newborn. The measured 14C values were compared to the recorded atmospheric levels to establish at which time point they corresponded. The strategy to establish the age of a cell population by relating 14C concentrations in genomic DNA to atmospheric levels is schematically depicted in Figures 2A and 2B . The levels of 14C in leukocyte DNA did indeed correspond to the contemporary atmospheric levels at the time when the sample was taken (Figures 2C and 2D). We next asked whether cells generated at a known time point much earlier could be accurately dated. To this end, we analyzed DNA from early postnatal brain tissue collected many years earlier. Since the tissue was from postmortem infants, there is a narrow timeframe when the cells could have been generated. 14C levels in DNA from early postnatal brain tissue corresponded to the time shortly after birth (Figures 2E and 2F), in line with brain cells being born both prenatally (mostly neurons) and postnatally (mainly glial cells, which form the majority). This analysis of cells generated at known time points confirms that 14C levels in DNA can be used to establish when cells are born. We next birth dated cells in different adult organs. We selected intestine, skeletal muscle, and two brain regions, based on the assumption that these tissues have different rates of cell turnover. Intestinal epithelial cells have an average life span of about 5 days (Marshman et al., 2002Marshman E. Booth C. Potten C.S. The intestinal epithelial stem cell.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), whereas many nonepithelial cells in the gut are likely to be long lived. There is thought to be very little cell replacement in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. All tissues contain blood, but nucleated cells only account for about 1/1000 of cells in peripheral blood, and their effect on the average age of cells in an organ will be negligible. 14C birth dating revealed that the average age of cells in the intestine (jejunum) is 10.7 ± 3.6 years (mean ± SD from three individuals of average age 34.8 years; Figure 3). We quantified the proportion of epithelial cells to other cells in histological sections of jejunum and found that in average 42% ± 3% (n = 5 individuals) of all cells in the specimen were epithelial. Assuming that all epithelial cells are contemporary, the average age of the nonepithelial cells is 15.9 years. Measurement of the level of 14C in DNA from intercostal skeletal muscle from two individuals (37 and 38 years old) indicated an average age of 15.1 years. The average age of cells in the gray matter of the cerebellum was almost as old as the individual (born at the age of 2.9 ± 1.2 years, Table 1), whereas cells from the occipital-cortex gray matter were substantially younger (Figure 3), indicating more cell turnover in the cerebral cortex than in the cerebellum. Analysis of multiple samples from the same individuals revealed a precision of ±2 years (1 SD) for the dating procedure and a high degree of reproducibility between individuals (Table 1).Table 1Resolution and Reproducibility of Retrospective Birth DatingCaseDOB of PersonnΔ14C% Mean (SD)Cell Birth Date (SD)Average Birth Date of Cell after DOBND0141968.24462 ± 951972.6 ± 3.34.4ND0041972.610382 ± 421975.1 ± 1.92.5ND0091973.217357 ± 481976.2 ± 1.53ND0021973.84373 ± 41975.4 ± 0.81.6Average (SD)2.9 ± 1.2ND0171952.02−8.91955.0 ± 1.53ND0181953.430.51955.8 ± 1.22.4ND0071955.02−8.51955.5 ± 0.20.5ND0081958.123811962.6 ± 2.24.5Average (SD)2.6 ± 1.7Accelerator mass spectrometer analysis of genomic DNA from cerebelli from individuals born after (upper half) or before (lower half) the nuclear bomb tests. n indicates the number of independent analyses of different samples for each individual.

The cell birth date is the time point when the measured Δ14C corresponded to the atmospheric value. The resolution before the nuclear bomb tests is in general very poor, with the exception of the years just before the testing. DOB is date of birth. An average cell age slightly younger than the individual, as seen for cerebellum, could reflect that the generation of cells continued for a short time postnatally and then stopped, or that most cells were generated before birth but a subpopulation of cells turned over in adulthood. These two possibilities can be distinguished by analyzing tissue from individuals born before the nuclear bomb tests, as schematically depicted in Figure 4A . The strategy to birth date cells builds on the steep slope of 14C decline in the atmosphere after the nuclear bomb tests, and the resolution in time before the bomb tests is very poor. However, the low levels of 14C before the bomb pulse makes the detection of a small population of cells born during or after the bomb tests especially sensitive, and we determined that we could detect such a population constituting down to 1% of the total cell population. Analysis of individuals born pre-bomb demonstrated 14C levels in cerebellar gray matter that correspond to atmospheric levels prior to 1955 (Figure 4; Table 1). The cerebellar gray matter consists of approximately 92% neurons (Supplemental Figure S1), thus these data reflect primarily the average neuronal age. This indicates that cerebellar neurogenesis is completed in the postnatal period and also that there is limited turnover of glial cells. The analysis of 14C in genomic DNA gives an average age of cells in a tissue. Most tissues are complex and composed of many cell types, and in order to study the potential turnover of a specific cell type, we wanted to separate cells prior to analysis. We focused on the human brain since there is little known about the potential turnover of neurons, and alterations in neurogenesis have been implicated in human disease. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against specific cell-surface epitopes is commonly used to purify distinct cell types. However, the complex morphology of neurons makes it difficult to isolate intact cells from brain tissue. This, together with the lack of pan-neuronal cell surface proteins, prompted us to modify this strategy and instead sort cell nuclei. Nuclei were first isolated from dissociated tissue and then incubated with directly conjugated antibodies to NeuN (Figures 5A–5F ), a well-established neuron-specific epitope mainly localized to the nucleus (Mullen et al., 1992Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. NeuN, a neuronal specific nuclear protein in vertebrates.Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enabled FACS isolation of neuronal nuclei with high specificity (Figures 5G and 5H). Re-analysis of sorted nuclei revealed that we could obtain >99% neuronal nuclei. A significant advantage of the method to sort nuclei, rather than whole cells, is that the nuclear sorting is less sensitive to post-biopsy or post-mortem interval and, most importantly, works equally well on fresh tissue and frozen archival material. This makes it possible to study material already collected in biobanks. Contrary to the long-standing dogma that neurons cannot be generated in the adult brain, it is now firmly established that neurogenesis continues in discrete brain regions throughout life in all studied mammals (Altman and Das, 1965Altman J.

The establishment of a strategy for the retrospective birth dating of cells together with FACS isolation of neuronal nuclei makes it possible to study neuronal turnover in the adult human brain. Technical difficulties have contributed to conflicting data regarding the distribution and extent of adult neurogenesis in experimental animals. One of the most controversial issues is whether neurogenesis persists in the cerebral cortex. Studies in several species have indicated that this may occur under physiological or pathological conditions (Chen et al., 2004Chen J. Magavi S.S. Macklis J.D.

Induction of neurogenesis in the neocortex of adult mice.Nature. 2000; 405: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have failed to detect adult cortical neurogenesis (Kornack and Rakic, 2001Kornack D.R. Rakic P. Cell proliferation without neurogenesis in adult primate neocortex.Science. 2001; 294: 127-130Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that some positive results were due to technical shortcomings, including unspecific labeling with BrdU or mistaken colocalization due to low-resolution microscopy (Kornack and Rakic, 2001Kornack D.R. Rakic P. Cell proliferation without neurogenesis in adult primate neocortex.Science. 2001; 294: 127-130Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar, Nowakowski and Hayes, 2000Nowakowski R.S. Hayes N.L.

Neurogenesis in adult primate neocortex: an evaluation of the evidence.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Perhaps the strongest indication of adult cortical neurogenesis under physiological conditions, from a technical point of view, comes from electron microscopic detection of [3H]thymidine neurons in the occipital cortex of the rat (Kaplan, 1981Kaplan M.S. Neurogenesis in the 3-month-old rat visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1981; 195: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to retrospectively determine the age of neurons in the adult human occipital cortex, to establish whether there is any appreciable addition of neurons in this brain region postnatally. 14C levels in unsorted total occipital cortex showed an average age substantially younger than the individual, pointing to cell turnover (Figure 3, Figure 6). To specifically analyze the age of neurons and nonneuronal cells, we isolated NeuN-positive and -negative cells by flow cytometry. 14C levels in NeuN-positive neurons from individuals born after the bomb pulse demonstrated levels corresponding to the average age of the cells being as old as the individual (Figures 6A and 6B). We can currently establish the age of a cell population with a precision of ±2 years, and the time of birth of the individual was within this error margin in all measurements of NeuN-positive neurons from occipital cortex. The NeuN-negative cells, which are mainly glial cells, were substantially younger (Figures 6A and 6B). We additionally analyzed cells from individuals born before the bomb pulse, which provides a very sensitive measure of postnatal cell turnover. The 14C levels in genomic DNA from NeuN-positive neurons corresponded to those in the atmosphere prior to the nuclear bomb tests (Figures 6C and 6D), which suggests that adult neurogenesis does not occur in this region. Cell turnover may be necessary under physiological or pathological conditions to maintain certain organs, yet our knowledge regarding this process in most human tissues is scarce due to a lack of means to study this process. We describe here a general strategy to study cell renewal in man. The dramatic increase in atmospheric 14C levels and the subsequent exponential decline have resulted in different amounts of 14C being integrated into the DNA of cells depending on the time point the DNA was synthesized. We all therefore have a date-mark in our DNA, and we show here that this can be used to establish the age of cells. Most molecules in a cell are in constant flux, and DNA is likely to be the most stable molecule after a cell has undergone its last mitosis. It is important to consider the stability of DNA for the validity of the current technique since turnover of nucleotides in the absence of cell division would give a false impression of a cell population being younger than its actual age. DNA damage, followed by nucleotide exchange, mainly occurs during DNA replication (Nouspikel and Hanawalt, 2002Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. DNA repair in terminally differentiated cells.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Since DNA repair during cell division will not influence the current analysis, it is most important to consider the potential turnover of DNA in very rarely dividing or postmitotic cells. DNA repair in postmitotic cells is limited to transcribed genes, and untranscribed DNA in terminally differentiated cells, including human neurons, does not appear to be repaired even after massive experimental damage (Nouspikel and Hanawalt, 2002Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. DNA repair in terminally differentiated cells.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange, even in transcribed DNA, appears limited in terminally differentiated cells. The mutation rate of transcribed genes in rarely dividing human lymphocytes has been measured using different techniques and estimated to be 1.4–2/109 per day and locus, which corresponds to 5.2–7.3/105 events over a century (Bridges, 1997Bridges B.A. DNA turnover and mutation in resting cells.Bioessays. 1997; 19: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Green et al., 1995Green M.H.

Res. 1996; 357: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since these frequencies are obtained for transcribed genes, the rate is likely to be substantially lower in total DNA. Thus, available data indicate extremely little nucleotide turnover in rarely dividing and postmitotic cells, well below levels that would influence the current method. Our finding that cerebellar cells and cortical neurons have 14C levels corresponding to the time of birth of the person corroborates that nucleotide exchange in postmitotic cells is very limited and below the detection level with the method employed. Another source of carbon exchange in the genome is methylation, which constitutes an important mechanism in transcriptional regulation (Bird, 2002Bird A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4996) Google Scholar). Methylation is restricted to cytosine residues 5′ to guanosine in CpG stretches, and"
https://openalex.org/W2053298425,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation is induced by many receptor and intracellular oncogenic proteins commonly activated in cancer, rendering molecular targeting of VEGF expression a complex challenge. While VEGF inducers abound, only two major transcription activators have been identified for its promoter: hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3). Both HIF-1 expression and Stat3 activity are upregulated in diverse cancers. Here, we provide evidence that Stat3 is required for both basal and growth signal-induced expression of HIF-1. Moreover, induction of VEGF by diverse oncogenic growth stimuli, including IL-6R, c-Src, Her2/Neu, is attenuated in cells without Stat3 signaling. We further demonstrate that Stat3 regulates expression of Akt, which is required for growth signal-induced HIF-1 upregulation. Targeting Stat3 with a small-molecule inhibitor blocks HIF-1 and VEGF expression in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, tumor cells' in vivo angiogenic capacity induced by IL-6R, which simultaneously activates Jak/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways, is abrogated when Stat3 is inhibited. Activation of Stat3 signaling by various growth signaling is prevalent in diverse cancers. Results presented here demonstrate that Stat3 is an effective target for inhibiting tumor VEGF expression and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138992813,"How peroxisomes are formed in eukaryotic cells is unknown but important for insight into a variety of diseases. Both human and yeast cells lacking peroxisomes due to mutations in PEX3 or PEX19 genes regenerate the organelles upon reintroduction of the corresponding wild-type version. To evaluate how and from where new peroxisomes are formed, we followed the trafficking route of newly made YFP-tagged Pex3 and Pex19 proteins by real-time fluorescence microscopy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Remarkably, Pex3 (an integral membrane protein) could first be observed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it concentrates in foci that then bud off in a Pex19-dependent manner and mature into fully functional peroxisomes. Pex19 (a farnesylated, mostly cytosolic protein) enriches first at the Pex3 foci on the ER and then on the maturing peroxisomes. This trafficking route of Pex3-YFP is the same in wild-type cells. These results demonstrate that peroxisomes are generated from domains in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2154979992,"We investigated the molecular events involved in the long-lasting reduction of adipose mass by the selective CB1 antagonist, SR141716. Its effects were assessed at the transcriptional level both in white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues in a diet-induced obesity model in mice. Our data clearly indicated that SR141716 reversed the phenotype of obese adipocytes at both macroscopic and genomic levels. First, oral treatment with SR141716 at 10 mg/kg/d for 40 days induced a robust reduction of obesity, as shown by the 50% decrease in adipose mass together with a major restoration of white adipocyte morphology similar to lean animals. Second, we found that the major alterations in gene expression levels induced by obesity in WAT and BAT were mostly reversed in SR141716-treated obese mice. Importantly, the transcriptional patterns of treated obese mice were similar to those obtained in the CB1 receptor knockout mice fed a high-fat regimen and which are resistant to obesity, supporting a CB1 receptor-mediated process. Functional analysis of these modulations indicated that the reduction of adipose mass by the molecule resulted from an enhanced lipolysis through the induction of enzymes of the beta-oxidation and TCA cycle, increased energy expenditure, mainly through futile cycling (calcium and substrate), and a tight regulation of glucose homeostasis. These changes accompanied a significant cellular remodeling and contributed to a reduction of the obesity-related inflammatory status. In addition to a transient reduction of food consumption, increases of both fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure induced by the molecule summate leading to a sustained weight loss. Altogether, these data strongly indicate that the endocannabinoid system has a major role in the regulation of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2097899984,"Neurons in the developing mammalian brain are generated from progenitor cells in the proliferative ventricular zone, and control of progenitor division is essential to produce the correct number of neurons during neurogenesis. Here we establish that Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are required for proper mitotic-spindle orientation of neural progenitors in the developing neocortex. Interfering with Gβγ function in progenitors causes a shift in spindle orientation from apical-basal divisions to planar divisions. This results in hyperdifferentiation of progenitors into neurons as a consequence of both daughter cells adopting a neural fate instead of the normal asymmetric cell fates. Silencing AGS3, a nonreceptor activator of Gβγ, results in defects similar to the impairment of Gβγ, providing evidence that AGS3-Gβγ signaling in progenitors regulates apical-basal division and asymmetric cell-fate decisions. Furthermore, our observations indicate that the cell-fate decision of daughter cells is coupled to mitotic-spindle orientation in progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2018955638,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from regions with high dietary exposure to aflatoxins and endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) often contain a specific mutation at codon 249 in TP53 (249ser; AGG to AGT, Arg to Ser). This mutation is also detectable in circulating cell-free DNA from the plasma of HCC patients and healthy subjects in these regions. We have examined the joint effect of plasma 249ser and HBV infection in a case–control study design involving 348 control, 98 cirrhotic, and 186 HCC participants from The Gambia, West Africa, an area of high HCC incidence. The 249ser mutation was detected in 3.5% of controls, 15.3% of cirrhotics, and 39.8% of HCC cases (adjusted odds ratios (OR): 4.83, (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71–13.7) for cirrhosis and 20.3 (8.19–50.0) for HCC). HBsAg positivity along with plasma 249ser was observed in 45/183 (24.6%) HCC cases compared to only one (0.3%) control. Risk for HCC was associated with markers of HBV alone (OR: 10.0, 95% CI: 5.16–19.6), 249ser alone (OR: 13.2, 95% CI: 4.99–35.0), and both markers present (OR: 399, 95% CI: 48.6–3270). These results suggest a multiplicative effect on HCC risk resulting from the mutational effect of aflatoxin on TP53, as monitored by detection of plasma 249ser, with concomitant chronic infection with HBV."

Proper execution of this developmental fate choice during immune responses is critical to host defense and, when misregulated, leads to susceptibility to infectious microbes and to allergic and autoimmune diseases. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation and real time reverse transcription PCR we identify the Polycomb family histone methyltransferase EZH2 as the enzyme responsible for methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 at the Il4-Il13 locus of TH1 but not TH2 cells, implicating EZH2 in the mechanism of Il4 and Il13 transcriptional silencing. Differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells toward the T helper 1 (TH1) and T helper 2 (TH2) fates involves the transcriptional repression and enhancement, respectively, of Il4 and Il13, adjacent chromosome 11 genes encoding the canonical TH2 cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-13.

Acting on instructions issued by cells of the innate immune system, naïve CD4 T cells commit to effector cell fates specifically tailored to address the confronting class of pathogens and the constraints of infected host tissue environments. The best characterized of these fates are called T helper 1 (TH1) 1The abbreviations used are: TH, T helper; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; H3, histone 3; H3K9/14ac, H3 with acetylated lysine 9 and lysine 14; H3K4me2, H3 with dimethylated lysine 4; H3K9me2, H3 with dimethylated lysine 9; H3K9me3, H3 with trimethylated lysine 9; H3K27me3, H3 with trimethylated lysine 27; HMT, histone methyltransferase; HS, DNase I hypersensitive site; IL, interleukin; IP, immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription. and T helper 2 (TH2), distinguished primarily by their non-overlapping patterns of cytokine gene expression potential. Il4 and Il13, adjacent genes on chromosome 11, encode the canonical TH2 cytokines responsible both for promoting immune responses against extracellular pathogens and, when misregulated, causing allergic and autoimmune diseases (1Moss R.B. Moll T. El-Kalay M. Kohne C. Soo Hoo W. Encinas J. Carlo D.J. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2004; 4: 1887-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Heritable states of transcriptional repression and enhancement of these genes during TH1 and TH2 development, respectively, are associated with developmentally programmed chromatin structural changes at the Il4-Il13 locus. The molecular nature of these changes, the cis-acting regulatory elements that coordinate them, and the relationship of these changes to Il4 and Il13 transcriptional potential are not well understood. The flexible amino termini of nucleosomal histones harbor multiple residues that can undergo a variety of post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Combined with the octameric structure of the nucleosomal core, this flexible modification system harbors tremendous combinatorial diversity and information-coding potential (the so-called histone code) that can endow discrete genetic intervals with specific functional properties (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6726) Google Scholar). Along a given interval, factors recruited to specific regulatory elements can create heritable patterns of histone modification that, in turn, can influence the transcriptional behavior of associated genes by creating or destroying binding platforms for transcriptional activators and repressors, nucleosome remodeling, and chromatin-packaging machinery (3Khorasanizadeh S. Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Histone H3, for example, can undergo a variety of post-translational modifications that can be classified as transcription-associated (acetylated lysine 9/lysine 14 (H3K9/14ac), dimethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me2), and phosphorylated serine 10) and silence-associated (dimethylated and trimethylated lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) and trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3)) (for review see Ref. 4Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Thirteen clusters of DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs) have been mapped at the Il4-Il13 locus of TH2 cells. Based upon lineage specificity and activation dependence, these can be classified as TH2-specific/constitutive (HSV, HSIII, HSII, HSI, HS0, HSS1, HSS2, HS2, and HS1), TH2-specific/activation-dependent (HSVa), and naïve/TH1/TH2-shared/constitutive (HSIV and HSS3) (see Fig. 2, top). Although useful as a roadmap of potential regulatory elements at the Il4-Il13 locus, DNase I hypersensitivity alone is insufficient to reveal functional regulatory elements and their modes of action at each stage of effector T cell development. For example, the transcriptional states of Il4 and Il13 in naïve CD4 T cells and TH1 cells are permissive and silent, respectively, despite sharing identical patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity at the Il4-Il13 locus (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 6Baguet A. Bix M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analysis of locus-wide patterns of histone modification provides an avenue to discern the developmental stages at which specific HS-containing regions act to modulate Il4 and Il13 transcriptional permissiveness. A recent survey of transcription-associated H3 modifications revealed the occurrence of H3K4me2 near the TH2-specific/constitutive HSV in naïve CD4 T cells but not in TH1 cells. Thus, the HSV-containing region is implicated in the maintenance of Il4 and Il13 transcriptional permissiveness at the naïve CD4 T cell stage, even though hypersensitivity at HSV is not yet detectable in these cells (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 6Baguet A. Bix M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Missing still from this emerging picture of the sequence of chromatin structural events at the TH2 cytokine locus in developing TH1 and TH2 cells is the nature and dynamic distribution of transcriptional silence-associated histone modifications. EZH2 and SUV39 are histone methyltransferases (HMTs) with in vivo specificity for H3 lysine 27 and H3 lysine 9, respectively (7Schotta G. Lachner M. Peters A.H. Jenuwein T. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163–169): 22-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SUV39, together with heterochromatin protein 1 with binding specificity for methylated H3 lysine 9, has been shown to be critical in the formation of heterochromatin (7Schotta G. Lachner M. Peters A.H. Jenuwein T. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163–169): 22-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EZH2, a member of the Polycomb group, occurs in a number of multisubunit complexes with other Polycomb group members including EED (embryonic ectoderm development). A Polycomb group complex containing the eponymous Polycomb has binding affinity for methylated H3 lysine 27 and appears to be involved in the repression of euchromatic genes (4Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). EZH2 is expressed in lymphocytes and has been shown to play a critical role in B lymphopoiesis (8Su I.H. Basavaraj A. Krutchinsky A.N. Hobert O. Ullrich A. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Its role in T cell biology is not known. Here, we report the analysis of repressive H3 modifications at the Il4-Il13 locus during effector T cell development. Our data demonstrate that, in naïve CD4 T cells and TH1-primed but not TH2-primed cells, lysine 27-methylated H3 occurs selectively at HSIV and HSS3, the only two lineage-nonspecific hypersensitive sites at the Il4-Il13 locus. TH1-specific silencing of Il4 and Il13 correlates with elevated levels of H3K27me3 at HSIV and the subsequent spreading of H3K27me3 into flanking regions. Furthermore, we show that EZH2 associates with HSIV and HSS3 in naïve, TH1, and, unexpectedly, TH2 cells. Together, our results suggest that developmentally regulated H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase activity of EZH2 constitutively bound at HSIV and HSS3 is responsible for specifying/maintaining Il4 and Il13 transcriptional silence in TH1 cells. Cell Lines—NIH/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum). Naïve T Cell Purification—Combined lymph node and spleen cell suspensions generated from 4–6 week BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME; housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were subjected to two sequential AutoMACS purification steps. First, CD4 T cells were obtained by negative selection using a CD4 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, catalog number 130-090-860). Next, CD4+CD62LHi cells were isolated by positive selection from CD4 T cells stained with anti-CD62L MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, catalog number130-049-701). The purity of CD4+CD62LHi T cells, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, was ≥ 97%. TH1 and TH2 Cultures—Primary TH cultures were initiated with naïve CD4 T cells prepared as described above. Splenic antigen-presenting cells, prepared by complement-mediated lysis using anti-Thy1 (J1j; American Type Culture Collection) and a combination of rabbit and guinea pig complements, were given 3000 rads prior to use. TH cell cultures were seeded at a ratio of 1:5 (T cell/antigen-presenting cell) with anti-TCRβ (H57-597; 2.5 μg/ml), anti-CD28 (37N; 1 μg/ml), and recombinant human IL2 (10 units/ml). In addition, TH1 cultures contained recombinant mouse IL12 (40 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and anti-IL4 (11B11; 40 μg/ml), whereas TH2 cultures contained recombinant mouse IL4 (300 units/ml; kindly provided by William Paul), anti-IL12 (C17.8; 10 μg/ml) and anti-interferon-γ (Xmg; 10 μg/ml). Cultures were harvested on day 4 and rested in IL2 (10 units/ml) for 2 days prior to recovery for analysis or for initiation of a second round of priming. Resting cells were activated by a 4-h culture with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (5 ng/ml) and ionomycin (250 ng/ml). Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—RNA was isolated free of contaminating genomic DNA using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Random hexamer-primed cDNA was generated using the Superscript II RNase H– reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen; catalog number 18064-014). Real time PCR reactions were performed and analyzed on a Stratagene MX4000. The PCR reaction buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH8.3), 50 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.3% Me2SO, 0.0025% SYBR Green I solution (Molecular Probes; catalog number S-7563), 50 nm each primer (Supplemental Fig. 1 in the on-line version of this article), and 2 units/reaction Hot Start Taq polymerase (Qiagen) per 25-μl reaction. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s. CT values for no reverse transcriptase controls were at least four times higher than experimental samples, corresponding to <6% background. More often, no reverse transcriptase background was <0.8%. For a given cDNA, relative abundance of each target was normalized to Hprt according to the formula 2–ΔCT, where ΔCT = CTARGETT – CHPRTT. Hprt-normalized target signals were expressed relative to expression in NIH3T3 according to the formula 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = ΔCSAMPLET – ΔCNIH3T3T. Thus one arbitrary unit corresponds to the relative level of a given target in NIH3T3. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—DNA recovered from an aliquot of sheared chromatin was used as the “input” sample. The remaining chromatin was pre-cleared with protein A- and protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology; catalog numbers 16-156 and 16-266) and then incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C (anti-H3K9/14ac, catalog number 06-599 and anti-H3K4me2, catalog number 07-030 from Upstate Biotechnology), both used at 2 μg/ml; anti-H3K9me3 (sera 4861) and anti-H3K27me3 (sera 6523, number 3200; Ref. 15Perez-Burgos L. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Kauer M. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 234-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), both used at 3 μg/ml; and anti-EZH2 (9Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), used at 1:500. Input DNA and DNA recovered after immunoprecipitation (IP) were quantified using PicoGreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Equivalent masses of IP and input DNA were compared by real time PCR as described above for RT-PCR with the following modifications. Taq polymerase was from Qiagen (Hot Start), and cycling conditions were 94 °C for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s. Data are presented as the ratio of IP to input CT values. For analysis of centromeric repeats, end point PCR analysis was performed to compare equivalent masses of input and IP DNA. PCR products were subjected to 3- or 4-fold serial dilution and separated by gel electrophoresis. Transcriptional Response of TH1- and TH2-primed Naïve CD4 T Cells—Using real time RT-PCR, we characterized the 4-hour phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-induced transcriptional response of the clustered Kif3a, Il4, Il13, and Rad50 genes in one-round and two-round TH1- and TH2-primed (TH1R1, TH1R2, TH2R1, and TH2R2) CD4 T cells (Fig. 1). For developing TH2 cells, transcription of Il4 and Il13 increased whereas that of Ifnγ decreased with each successive round of priming. The reciprocal pattern was observed for developing TH1 cells. Interestingly, Il13 expression consistently decreased in TH1R1 cells and then reappeared at low levels in TH1R2 cells. Though still, to date, unexplained, this Il13 effect was highly reproducible and consistent with observations made by others. 2M. Kubo and A. Rao, personal communications. Previously, we demonstrated that Il4 transcriptional permissiveness was maintained at naïve CD4 T cell levels 48 h after the onset of TH1 priming (6Baguet A. Bix M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Together with our current results demonstrating transcriptional silence of Il4 in one-round TH1-primed cells (Fig. 1), we conclude that transcriptional repression of Il4 requires between 2 and 4 days of TH1-priming. Consistent with a previous report (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), expression of Kif3a and Rad50 was ∼2–3-fold higher in TH2-primed versus TH1-primed cells (Fig. 1). However, unlike Il4 and Il13, Kif3a and Rad50 expression did not increase further in TH2R2 cells, demonstrating, as shown previously (6Baguet A. Bix M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), that the genes flanking Il4 and Il13 are insulated from the regulatory events governing the Il4-Il13 locus. Repressive H3 Modifications in TH1- and TH2-primed Cells— One previous study has described the occurrence of H3K9me at the Il4-Il13 locus of TH1 cells, suggesting that this modification might be involved in the transcriptional silencing of Il4 and Il13 (10Grogan J.L. Wang Z.E. Stanley S. Harmon B. Loots G.G. Rubin E.M. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6672-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we purified naïve CD4 T cells from young BALB/c mice and cultured them for two rounds in TH1-priming conditions. Primed cells were harvested and processed for ChIP using an antibody highly specific for H3 trimethylated on lysine 9. Using real time PCR, we measured the relative enrichment of specific target sequences in equivalent amounts of DNA obtained from unprecipitated and precipitated chromatin. PCR primer pairs targeted 17 locations at the Il4-Il13 locus, sampling elements known to be functionally (11Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A.

A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although in TH1R2 cells control major centromeric repeat sequences displayed enrichment for H3K9me3 (Fig. 2B; see Ref. 14Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), at the Il4-Il13 locus no H3K9me3 enrichment was detected (Fig. 2A). Centromeric repeat sequences were not enriched in chromatin precipitated with antibodies to H3K9/14ac (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with antibodies to H3K9me2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the transcriptional silence of Il4 and Il13 in TH1-primed cells does not involve H3 lysine 9 methylation. As the anti-H3K9me antibody used in the previous study may have cross-reacted with H3K27me (10Grogan J.L. Wang Z.E. Stanley S. Harmon B. Loots G.G. Rubin E.M. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6672-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Perez-Burgos L. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Kauer M. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 234-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we decided to perform ChIP analysis of TH1-primed cells with an antibody highly specific for H3K27me3 (15Perez-Burgos L. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Kauer M. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 234-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TH1R1 cells displayed two prominent peaks of H3K27me3 enrichment centered on HSIV and HSS3, respectively (Fig. 2C). TH1R2 cells showed, in addition to these peaks, increased H3K27me3 levels across the entire Il4-Il13 locus, extending at least from HSV downstream of Il4 to HS2 upstream of Il13 (Fig. 2D). This increase was specific insofar as H3K27me3 was at or below background levels at the G6pd locus in both TH1R1 and TH1R2 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the initial report of H3K9me at the Il4-Il13 locus was likely due to cross-reactivity of antibodies that failed to distinguish between H3 methylation on lysine 9 and lysine 27, residues with very similar sequence contexts (16Wang Y. Fischle W. Cheung W. Jacobs S. Khorasanizadeh S. Allis C.D. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163–169): 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that, during the development of TH1 cells, H3K27me3 occurs initially at HSIV and HSS3 and subsequently spreads to surrounding regions of the locus. To determine whether any aspect of the H3K27me3 pattern was TH1-specific, as would be predicted for a histone modification involved in Il4 and Il13 transcriptional silence, we used the H3K27me3-specific antibody in ChIP analysis of developing TH2 cells. In contrast to TH1-primed cells, TH2R1 and TH2R2 cells displayed significantly lower and almost undetectable H3K27me3 levels, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B), despite exhibiting strong signals at the control MyoD locus (Fig. 3C). The low level of H3K27me3 that was detectable in one-round TH2-primed cells localized predominantly to HSS3 and could not be found in surrounding regions (Fig. 3A). A faint signal was observed at HSIV in TH2R1 cells but was no longer detectable in TH2R2 cells. As was the case in TH2R2 cells, no H3K27me3 enrichment was detected across the entire Il4-Il13 locus of the TH2 clone D10.G4 despite strong signals at the control MyoD locus (data not shown). Repressive H3 Modifications in Naïve CD4 T Cells—The occurrence of H3K27me3 at HSIV and HSS3 (HS sites that are shared among TH1, TH2, and naïve CD4 T cells) in TH1R1 and TH2R1 cells prompted us to investigate whether H3K27me3 might pre-exist in naïve CD4 T cells. To test this possibility, we isolated naïve CD4 T cells from spleen and lymph nodes of young BALB/c mice and performed quantitative ChIP analysis for H3K27me3. Indeed, H3K27me3 was detected in naïve CD4 T cells in a pattern similar to that of TH1R1 cells, focused in two peaks at HSIV and HSS3 but absent from surrounding regions of the locus (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the HSS3 peak was significantly higher in naïve CD4 T cells than in TH1-primed cells, suggesting greater involvement of this putative regulatory element early in the development of CD4 effector cells. This result demonstrates that low level Il4 and Il13 transcriptional permissiveness in naïve CD4 T cells is compatible with the occurrence of H3K27me3 at HSS3 (and, perhaps, to a much lower level at HSIV). EZH2 Binds to HSIV and HSS3 in Naïve TH1- and TH2-primed Cells—The only known HMT capable in vivo of trimethylating H3 lysine 27 is the Polycomb family protein EZH2 (17Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Apart from the inactive X chromosome in XX female cells, physiological targets of EZH2 binding have only recently been described and have not yet been verified functionally (18Kirmizis A.

To test whether H3 lysine 27 trimethylation at the Il4-Il13 locus might be catalyzed by EZH2, we asked whether it binds in vivo to the Il4-Il13 locus. We used an EZH2-specific antibody to perform quantitative ChIP analysis of naïve CD4 T cells and TH1R2 and TH2R2 cells. In TH1R2 cells we detected peaks of EZH2 binding that coincided precisely with the locations of maximal H3K27me3 enrichment at HSIV and HSS3 (Fig. 5B). No EZH2 binding was detected in the regions surrounding HSIV and HSS3 (Fig. 5B), where H3K27me3 was detected at lower levels in TH1R2 cells (Fig. 2D). A similar binding pattern was also detected in naïve CD4 T cells, correlating quantitatively with the increased magnitude of H3K27me3 enrichment at HSS3 (Figs. 4 and 5A). Surprisingly, in TH2R2 cells, where H3K27me3 was no longer detectable at the Il4-Il13 locus, we still detected strong EZH2 binding at HSIV and HSS3 (Figs. 3B and 5C). Together, these results demonstrate that EZH2 binds constitutively to HSIV and HSS3 in naïve CD4 T cells and in TH1R2 and TH2R2 cells. In naïve CD4 T cells and TH1-primed cells, quantitative and spatial correlations of EZH2 binding and H3K27me3 abundance are consistent with EZH2 being the HMT responsible for H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. The persistence of HSIV- and HSS3-bound EZH2 in TH2R2 cells where H3K27me3 is no longer detectable is consistent with developmental regulation of EZH2 activity at a post-chromatin binding step or with the involvement of a novel H3 lysine 27-specific HMT. Finally, the TH1-specific appearance of H3K27me3 in the regions surrounding HSIV and HSS3 may indicate that EZH2 can interact transiently with these regions, perhaps processively by tracking or by looping from points of nucleation at HSIV and HSS3 (21Spilianakis C.G. Flavell R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Repressive H3 Modifications in a Fibroblast Cell Line—The fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 does not express Il4 or Il13 and lacks all known DNase I hypersensitive sites at the Il4-Il13 locus, including HSIV and HSS3 (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). At the Il4-Il13 locus the transcription-associated H3 modification phosphoserine 10, found broadly distributed in TH2-primed cells and the TH2 clone D10.G4, does not occur in NIH3T3 (6Baguet A. Bix M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, despite strong signals for each at the control G6pd locus, no H3K9/14ac and H3K4me2 occurred across the Il4-Il13 locus of NIH3T3, (Fig. 6, A–C). To assess whether transcriptional silence of Il4 and Il13 in a non-T cell lineage would be associated with the same pattern of repressive chromatin modifications detected in TH1-primed CD4 T cells, we analyzed NIH3T3 by quantitative ChIP for the occurrence of H3K9me3. Despite control signals at major centromeric repeat sequences, we detected no H3K9me3 across the Il4-Il13 locus (Fig. 6, D and E). Similar results were obtained for H3K27me2 (data not shown). These results were confirmed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown). Thus, the constitutive transcriptional silence of Il4 and Il13 in fibroblast lineage cells appears to involve neither H3K27me3 nor H3K9me3, suggesting lineage-specific epigenetic mechanisms for the maintenance of Il4 and Il13 transcriptional silence. Knowing the chemical nature of post-translational histone modifications associated with Il4 and Il13 gene silencing as well as the responsible catalytic enzymes is important for understanding the mechanisms by which heritable transcriptional states are developmentally specified at the Il4-Il13 locus. In this report we exploited antibodies with proven specificity for distinct transcriptional silence-associated H3 modifications in ChIP analyses to demonstrate that the principal H3 modification associated with TH1-dependent silencing is the trimethylation of lysine 27 and not of lysine 9. The striking localization of H3K27me3 to HSIV and HSS3 suggests that elements containing these sites function either together or separately as transcriptional silencers in TH1 cells. Indeed, deletion of one of them (HSIV) prevents efficient silencing of Il4 in TH1-primed cells (23Ansel K.M. Greenwald R.J. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Monticelli S. Interlandi J. Djuretic I.M. Lee D.U. Sharpe A.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that the Polycomb family H3 lysine 27-specific HMT EZH2 binds to HSIV and HSS3, suggesting it is likely to be responsible for trimethylating H3 lysine 27 at the TH2 cytokine locus. Located in phylogenetically conserved regions of the TH2 cytokine locus, HSIV and HSS3 are unique in being the only two DNase I hypersensitive sites that occur in TH1, TH2, and naïve CD4 T cells. Our data demonstrate that they are also the only sites at the TH2 cytokine locus to display EZH2 binding in all three lineages, suggesting that this binding is the basis for their shared DNase I hypersensitivity. The level of H3K27me3 enrichment at HSS3 and HSIV was much higher in naïve CD4 T cells than in developing TH2 cells, suggesting a progressive loss of H3K27me3 that was essentially complete after two rounds of priming. This loss may be due to the activity of an as yet unidentified H3 lysine 27 demethylase or perhaps progressive dilution of the H3K27me3 mark through successive cell cycle rounds in the absence of maintenance H3 lysine 27 methylation. The pattern in developing TH1 cells was more complex, comprising an increase and decrease at HSIV and HSS3, respectively, such that in TH1R1 cells comparable H3K27me3 levels occur at both sites. In TH1R2 cells H3K27me3 at HSIV and HSS3 remains and appears to have spread into flanking regions. However, interactions between EZH2 and flanking regions must be transient, as EZH2 binding was not detectable. Alternatively, H3K27me3 in flanking regions is dependent upon an unidentified H3 lysine 27-specific HMT. The feature that correlates best with the TH1-dependent silencing of Il4 and Il13 is the developmental elevation of H3K27me3 levels initially at HSIV and subsequently in flanking regions, both of which are observed only in TH1-primed cells. Contrary to previous reports (10Grogan J.L. Wang Z.E. Stanley S. Harmon B. Loots G.G. Rubin E.M. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6672-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we did not detect H3 lysine 9 methylation at the TH2 cytokine locus of TH1 cells. Because both H3 lysine 9 and H3 lysine 27 occur in an identical sequence motif (ARKS), a likely explanation for the discrepancy is that the antibody used in the earlier study cross-reacted with the H3 methylated on lysine 27, which had spread from HSIV and HSS3 to the Il4 promoter region. Alternatively, H3K9me may occur only in the mature stage of TH1 development represented by the TH1 clone analyzed by Grogan et al. (10Grogan J.L. Wang Z.E. Stanley S. Harmon B. Loots G.G. Rubin E.M. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6672-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In TH2R2 cells, HSIV and HSS3 contain bound EZH2 but no H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. This result is consistent with either EZH2 not being responsible for HSIV and HSS3 H3 lysine 27 trimethylation or with the HMT activity of EZH2 being regulated independently of chromatin binding. We support the latter interpretation. First, in naïve CD4 T cells and in TH1 cells EZH2 is observed to bind specifically at HSIV and HSS3, precisely the locations where peak H3K27me3 enrichment occurs. Second, in naïve CD4 T cells and TH1 cells there is a strong correlation between the degree of EZH2 binding and H3K27me3 enrichment. Finally, following polyclonal stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionophore, CD4 T lymphocytes harboring a homozygous targeted deletion inactivating the Ezh2 gene rapidly lose all detectable nuclear H3K27me3, suggesting that EZH2 is responsible for most if not all H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation. 3S. Tarakhovsky and I. Su, personal communication of unpublished data. One possible mechanism for regulating the activity of EZH2 independently of its chromatin binding is through developmental regulation of cofactors capable of influencing the HMT activity of EZH2. Consistent with this possibility, EZH2 is known to occur in at least two distinct multisubunit complexes (PRC2 and PRC3) along with another Polycomb family member, EED (9Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Alternative translation initiation generates four distinct EED isoforms that feature differentially truncated amino termini (9Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Depending on the isoform of its EED partner, EZH2 has been shown in vitro to switch its substrate specificity from H3 lysine 27 to histone 1 (H1) lysine 26 or to become unable to mediate methylation of either substrate (9Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, EZH2 that remains bound to HSIV and HSS3 in TH2-primed cells may have acquired a new EED partner that prevents H3 lysine 27 methylation, thereby preventing transcriptional silencing. Alternatively, the TH2-specific absence of H3K27me3 may arise from H1 recruitment shown in in vitro biochemical studies to prevent the H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase activity of EZH2 (9Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In somatic cell lineages, distinct biochemical pathways may execute facultative and constitutive gene silencing. The textbook example of facultative heterochromatin is the inactive X chromosome in female somatic cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the process of X inactivation involves H3 lysine 27 methylation (24Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. de la Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y. Science. 2003; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). By contrast, constitutive heterochromatin at telomeres and centromeres involves principally H3 lysine 9 methylation (25Schotta G. Ebert A. Krauss V. Fischer A. Hoffmann J. Rea S. Jenuwein T. Dorn R. Reuter G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing of Il4 and Il13 is facultative in CD4 T lymphocytes and constitutive in fibroblasts. From this perspective it is interesting to note that transcriptional silence of Il4 and Il13 was accompanied by H3 lysine 27 methylation in CD4 T lymphocytes but not in fibroblasts (Fig. 6 and data not shown). This difference may be indicative of a more general phenomenon in which, for a given cell lineage, constitutive silencing and facultative silencing are functionally segregated to different biochemical pathways, with the establishment of only the latter (facultative silencing) involving H3 lysine 27 methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis is the absence of H3K27me3 from the constitutively silenced muscle-specific gene MyoD in fibroblast lineage cells (data not shown). The occurrence of H3K27me3 at the MyoD locus of CD4 T cells (Fig. 3E) is not necessarily inconsistent with this hypothesis, as it has been reported that hematopoietic cells can trans-differentiate into muscle (22Cao B. Zheng B. Jankowski R.J. Kimura S. Ikezawa M. Deasy B. Cummins J. Epperly M. Qu-Petersen Z. Huard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the principle H3 modification associated with TH1-dependent silencing is trimethylation of lysine 27 initially at HSIV and subsequently in regions flanking HSIV and HSS3, consistent with the known role of HSIV as a transcriptional silencer in TH1 cells. We also demonstrate that the Polycomb family H3 lysine 27-specific HMT binds to HSIV and HSS3, suggesting that it is likely to be responsible for trimethylating H3 lysine 27 at the TH2 cytokine locus and, hence, is an important mediator of Il4 and Il13 gene silencing.

https://openalex.org/W1984018823,"<h2>Summary</h2> The archetypal human tumor suppressor p53 is considered to have unique transactivation properties. The assumption is based on the fact that additionally identified human p53 isoforms lack transcriptional activity. However, we provide evidence for the existence of an alternatively spliced p53 isoform (Δp53) that exerts its transcriptional activity independent from p53. In contrast to p53, Δp53 transactivates the endogenous <i>p21</i> and <i>14-3-3σ</i> but not the <i>mdm2</i>, <i>bax</i>, and <i>PIG3</i> promoter. Cell cycle studies showed that Δp53 displays its differential transcriptional activity only in damaged S phase cells. Upon activation of the ATR-intra-S phase checkpoint, Δp53, but not p53, transactivates the Cdk inhibitor <i>p21</i>. Induction of p21 results in downregulation of cyclin A-Cdk activity and accordingly attenuation of S phase progression. Data demonstrate that the Δp53-p21-cyclin A-Cdk pathway is crucial to facilitate uncoupling of repair and replication events, indicating that Δp53 is an essential element of the ATR-intra-S phase checkpoint."

Like plant phytochromes, most bacteriophytochromes studied so far contain a two-component histidine kinase motif at their C termini. However some exceptions occur such as the bacteriophytochromes of the photosynthetic bacteria Bradyrhizobium (BrBphP) and Rps. palustris (denoted here RpBphP1), which do not possess a histidine kinase motif but an S-box domain that might be involved in protein-protein interactions (8Giraud E.

This photosynthetic apparatus is composed of a photochemical reaction center and of light-harvesting (LH) complexes. The photosynthetic apparatus of Rps. palustris presents the peculiarity of possessing several peripheral LH complexes, encoded by distinct pucBA genes (13Tadros M.H. Waterkamp K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The relative proportion of these LH complexes varies according to the light environment (14Evans M.B. Hawthornthwaite A.M.

Some of these complexes present two distinct optical transitions absorbing around 800 and 850 nm in the near infrared. They are named LH2 (or B800-850 LH2) to differentiate them from the LH1 complexes, which present a single broad absorption band around 870 nm. A novel type of LH, recently characterized and designated LH4 (or B800 LH2), is expressed under low light intensity and presents a single absorption band in the near infrared centered at 800 nm (15Hartigan N.

The recent sequencing of the complete genome of Rps. palustris strain CGA009 revealed, in addition to RpBphP1, the unexpected presence of five other putative bacteriophytochrome genes scattered over the genome (16Larimer F.W.

This suggests that this bacterium has developed a sophisticated and complex network of photoreceptors for its adaptation to light environment. Four of these bacteriophytochromes genes, RpBphP1 (rpa1537), RpBphP2 (rpa3015), RpBphP3 (rpa3016), and RpBphP4 (rpa1490), are located close to photosynthesis genes. The RpBphP1 gene is found inside the photosynthesis gene cluster, and, as already stated, its product controls the synthesis of the RC-LH1 core complexes (8Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The RpBphP4 gene is located close to the pucBAe genes encoding one of the LH2 complexes. Remarkably, the RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 genes are organized in tandem downstream the pucBAd encoding the apoproteins of the LH4 complexes. Two other genes coding for LH complexes (the pucBAc genes rpa3009 and rpa3010) are located upstream the pucBAd genes. However, one of them, pucAc, contains a frameshift mutation and has been annotated as a pseudogene (16Larimer F.W. Chain P. Hauser L. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Do L. Land M.L. Pelletier D.A.

To better understand the role and function of these bacteriophytochromes in the adaptation of Rps. palustris to changes in its light environment, we initiated their systematic study at the genetic and biochemical level. Of particular interest are the two bacteriophytochromes, RpBphP2 and RpBphP3. What is the significance of the tandem organization of the two bacteriophytochromes genes? Do these two bacteriophytochromes possess different properties? Are these two bacteriophytochromes involved in the regulation of the closely located pucBAd genes or in different regulatory processes? In this report, we show by combining genetics, biochemical and biophysical approaches that the bacteriophytochrome RpBphP3 possesses unusual photochemical properties and works in tandem with RpBphP2 to regulate the synthesis of the LH4 complexes.

Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown under semiaerobic conditions for 72 h at 30 °C on Petri dishes filled with 40% Sistrom-agar medium and sealed with tape. The cells were subjected to continuous illumination provided by a series of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths between 590 and 875 nm. Each LED illuminated a 3.5 cm2 area. The half-peak bandwidth was below 25 nm for all wavelengths. Irradiance was adjusted between 1 and 200 μmol of photon/m2/s. Expression and Purification of Rpa3014, RpBphP2, RpBphP3, and Rpa3017 Proteins—The rpa3014, RpBphP2, RpBphP3, and rpa3017 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of Rps. palustris CEA001 using primers designed to add appropriate restriction sites for expression as His6-tagged versions in pBAD/HisB expression vector (Invitrogen). To reconstitute in vivo the RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 holobacteriophytochromes, the hmuO gene from Bradyrhizobium ORS278 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to add a ribosome binding site upstream the gene and restriction site for insertion in the previous constructions pBAD::RpBphP2 and pBAD::RpBphP3. The recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli LMG194 and purified as described previously (11Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.-M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays—Protein kinase reaction was performed as described previously (9Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For autophosphorylation experiments, the bacteriophytochromes RpBphP2 or RpBphP3 were either dark-adapted formorethan 1 h or pre-illuminated with saturating red light (705 nm) at 30 °C. The kinase reactions were initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP, and the resulting mixtures were subjected to a further 1-h darkness condition or illumination. At this stage, the reactions were stopped by addition of the buffer used for the SDS-PAGE assay and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. For the phosphotransfer experiments, the RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP during 1 h in the dark or under 705 nm light and for an additional 10 min with equal amount of Rpa3014 or Rpa3017 or a mixture of Rpa3014 and Rpa3017. 32P-Labeled products were quantified by using a Typhoon Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 Mutant Strains—For the construction of the RpBphP2 null mutant, a 1.4-kb PstI fragment inside the RpBphP2 gene was deleted and replaced by the lacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5 (17Kokotek W. Lotz W. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The RpBphP3 null mutant was obtained by the deletion of a 0.5-kb SalI fragment inside the RpBphP3 gene and replacement by the lacZ-Kmr cassette. These constructions were introduced in the pJQ200 suicide vector (18Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and delivered by conjugation into the Rps. palustris CEA001 strain as described (11Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.-M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double recombinants were selected on sucrose and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Absorbance Spectra Measurements—Absorbance spectra of purified RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 bacteriophytochromes were recorded with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Bacteriophytochrome spectra were recorded either in the dark or under continuous illumination at 645, 705, or 750 nm provided by LEDs with an irradiance of 15 μmol of photon/m2/s. Light-induced absorbance changes were performed with a laboratory-built spectrophotometer similar to the one developed by Joliot et al. (19Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chimie Physique. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar). The absorption level is sampled using 2-μs monochromatic flashes given from 1 ms to several seconds after actinic excitation. Actinic illumination was provided by a Xenon flash (2 μs). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements have been performed at room temperature using a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer. To perform the photoinduced transition of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3, excitation light was provided by 645-, 705-, or 750-nm LEDs with an irradiance of 15 μmol of photon/m2/s. For the measurement of the excitation spectra (2-nm slit bandwidth), the fluorescence was detected at 730 nm (10-nm slit bandwidth). For the emission spectra (2-nm slit bandwidth), the excitation was set at 400 nm (10-nm slit bandwidth). Measurements of the variation of the fluorescence yield were performed at 400 nm for the excitation wavelength (10-nm slit bandwidth) and 730 nm for the emission wavelength (2-nm slit bandwidth). Light-induced FTIR Difference Spectra Measurements—Light-induced FTIR difference spectra were recorded at 10 °C at 4 cm-1 resolution, with a Bruker 66 SX spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam splitter and nitrogen-cooled MCT-A detector. The FTIR samples consisted in 10 μl of a solution of bacteriophytochrome at a concentration of ≈200 μm, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, deposited between two calcium fluoride windows sealed with silicon grease to avoid sample dehydration. The samples were subjected to successive light cycles, applying 705 nm light to generate Pfr (or Pnr) and 750 or 645 nm light to restore the Pr form of RpBphP2 or RpBphP3, respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Holobacteriophytochromes—The RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 genes belong to the same putative operon, which includes three other putative response regulator genes (rpa3014, rpa3017, and rpa3018) (Fig. 1A). This operon is found upstream the pucBAd genes encoding the apoproteins of the light-harvesting complexes LH4. Sequence analysis reveals that the RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 proteins are highly homologous, with 54% of sequence identity and 76% similarity. In contrast, they present only 30-35% sequence identity with the other bacteriophytochromes of Rps. palustris. These two bacteriophytochromes display the classical bacteriophytochrome architecture with an N-terminal CBD and a C-terminal histidine kinase domain (Fig. 1B). To prove that RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 encode functional bacteriophytochromes, they were co-expressed with the heme oxygenase gene (required for chromophore synthesis) in E. coli and subsequently purified. Gel electrophoresis and zinc fluorescence (not shown) demonstrated that the biliverdin molecule was covalently bound in both proteins as previously reported for bacteriophytochromes of various bacterial species (8Giraud E.

A. 2002; 99 (11628-11163)Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (data not shown) indicate that the Cys residues of the N terminus, located at position 16 and 28 for RpBphP2 and RpBphP3, respectively, are necessary for attachment of chromophore and are likely to be the site of attachment based upon their position and the previous data from the bacteriophytochrome Agp1 of Agrobacterium (20Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99 (11628-11163)Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Absorption and Photochemical Properties—Unexpectedly, the purified RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 bacteriophytochromes present slightly different colors (Fig. 2A). The absorption spectra of dark-adapted samples of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 are typical of the Pr form with a main band centered at 710 and 705 nm, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). Both RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 behave as usual bacteriophytochromes assuming a Pr ground state after dark adaptation. This behavior is at variance to that reported for the first bacteriophytochrome (RpBphP1) studied in Rps. palustris, which was shown to be stable under its Pfr form (8Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.-M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presence of two bacteriophytochromes which differ by their dark-adapted state has also been reported in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (21Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this bacterium, the ground state of the bacteriophytochrome AtBphP1 is the Pr state, whereas the Pfr form of AtBphP2 corresponds to its dark-adapted state (21Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon illumination with a 705-nm light of RpBphP2 (Fig. 2C), a typical Pr/Pfr transition is observed with the partial bleaching of the main absorption band and appearance of a broad band centered at 750 nm (Fig. 2C). Illumination with a 750-nm light restores the dark-adapted spectrum. Dark reversion from the Pfr to the Pr state is a slow process, which requires several tens of minutes (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, illumination with the 705-nm light on a dark-adapted sample of RpBphP3 (Fig. 2D) leads to a large decrease of the main absorption band at 705 nm, but no concomitant absorption band develops in the infrared region. In addition, the shoulder at 650 nm of the Pr form, which corresponds to the vibrational transition of the S1 state, is not bleached. On the contrary, a minor increase in absorption is observed in this wavelength region. This suggests that the 705-nm illumination has induced a new form characterized by an absorption band centered around 650 nm. In agreement with this hypothesis, a fast and near complete reversion to the dark-adapted state is observed when the 705-nm illumination is followed by excitation with a 645-nm light (Fig. 2D). In the absence of 645-nm illumination, reversion to the dark-adapted state is very slow. Total dark reversion requires more than 2 h (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Dark reversion of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 after a 705 nm illumination. Absorbance changes occurring in the dark after a 705-nm illumination have been measured at 705 nm and compared with samples dark-adapted for 3 h. A, RpBphP2; B, RpBphP3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The near complete reversion of RpBphP3 to the dark-adapted state by the 645-nm light (Fig. 2D) implies a large difference in quantum yield for the two photoreversible reactions. This difference in quantum yield between the two forms of RpBphP3 is also evidenced by the measurement of the initial rate of Pr formation per absorbed photon upon illumination by a 645-nm light, which is ∼6-fold faster than the one measured for the photoconversion under 705-nm illumination (Fig. 2B). This behavior is different from that observed for RpBphP2 where the initial rates of the phototransformation of Pr into Pfr and of Pfr into Pr are similar (Fig. 2B). Note that these initial rate measurements, determined in the first 2 s of illumination, are not affected by the dark reversion of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3, which takes several tens of minutes in both cases (Fig. 3). The ratio between these initial rates is therefore a good estimate of the ratio of the quantum efficiencies of the photoconversion of the two photoconvertible states. To determine the absolute absorption spectra of the two photoconvertible forms of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3, we have used the following method. The steady-state spectrum S1(λ) obtained under illumination at a given wavelength, λ1, is a mixture of the spectra SA(λ) and SB(λ) of the two pure photoconvertible forms, with relative weights α(λ1) and [1 - α(λ1)], respectively, S1(λ)=α(λ1)SA(λ)+[1-α(λ1)]SB(λ)(Eq. 1) The steady-state condition implies ρAα(λ1)SA(λ1)=ρBSB(λ1)[1-α(λ1)](Eq. 2) where the ρs stand for the quantum efficiencies for the conversion into the other form. From Equation 1, SB(λ)=[S1(λ)-α(λ1)SA(λ)]/[1-α(λ1)](Eq. 3) and from Equation 2, SB(λ1)=α(λ1)1-α(λ1)ηSA(λ1)(Eq. 4) where η = ρA/ρB. Making λ = λ1 in Equation 3 and equating with Equation 4, one obtains the relation between α and η, α(λ1)=S1(λ1)SA(λ1)1(1+η)(Eq. 5) If SA(λ) (dark-adapted spectrum) and S1(λ) (under steady-state illumination at λ = λ1) are known, then α(λ1) is a unique function of the ratio of quantum efficiencies η = ρA/ρB. Thus, the determination of SB(λ) requires one additional information that may be (i) an independent measurement of ρ or (ii) the acquisition of a steady-state spectrum under actinic illumination at another wavelength λ2. The first method was applied to both RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 bacteriophytochromes. The measurement of η ≈ 1 for RpBphP2 (Fig. 2B), implies that the S705 spectrum of Fig. 2C is contributed by α (705) ≈ 30% of the Pr form. The corresponding SB(λ) spectrum, i.e. the absorption spectrum of the Pfr form is shown in Fig. 4A. For RpBphP3, using η ≈ 6 (Fig. 2B), we found that the S705 spectrum of Fig. 2D is contributed by α(705) ≈ 50% of the Pr form. Using method (ii) for RpBphP2 with the spectra obtained under steady-state illumination at λ1 = 705 nm and λ2 = 645 nm (Fig. 2D), we confirmed a value 6 of for η. The pure SB(λ) spectrum of RpBphP3 shown in Fig. 4B. The absorption spectra of the pure Pr and Pfr forms of RpBphP2 are typical of bacteriophytochromes described so far (8Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Bhoo S.-H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, the dark-adapted state of RpBphP3 is similar in shape to the Pr state of RpBphP2, i.e. a classical Pr spectrum. On the other hand, the light-induced state of RpBphP3 absorbs maximally at 650 nm. The absorption spectrum of this state is similar in shape to the Pfr state of RpBphP2 but blue-shifted by 95 nm (Fig. 4B). Because of its peak location, we name this new spectral form Pnr for pigment absorbing in the near red. In conclusion, RpBphP3 presents unusual photochemical properties in terms of both quantum yield for photoconversion and wavelength position of the Pnr state. Chromophore Conformation and Transient States—The new optical properties of the short wavelength state of RpBphP3 poses the problem of the biliverdin conformation in this state and the dark-adapted state. High similarities can be found between the dark-adapted state of RpBphP3 and the classical Pr state of RpBphP2 and accordingly between the classical Pfr state and the new Pnr state of RpBphP3. A first argument comes from the almost identical absorption spectra of the two dark-adapted states of these bacteriophytochromes (Fig. 4). A second argument is the observation that the dark-adapted states of both RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 are fluorescent. The fluorescence excitation spectra of RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 closely match their respective absorption spectra, and the emission spectra are centered at 725 and 720 nm, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, a large fluorescence decrease occurs upon 705 nm illumination in both cases. This is shown in Fig. 5, C and D where the fluorescence yield of both bacteriophytochromes have been measured in the dark or under 705-nm illumination. The decreases in fluorescence yield, ∼65 and 45% for RpBphP2 and RpBphP3, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D), correspond nicely to the amounts of Pfr and Pnr states formed under such illumination (Fig. 2). The non-fluorescent character of the new Pnr state of RpBphP3 is a typical property of the “classical” Pfr form of phytochromes (22Sineshchekov V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 125-164Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A third argument comes from the comparison of the FTIR difference spectra recorded with both bacteriophytochromes. The Pfr - Pr FTIR difference spectrum recorded with RpBphP2 (Fig. 6A) presents a striking similarity to that observed for the plant phytochrome (23Foerstendorf H. Benda C. Gärtner W. Storf M. Scheer H. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14952-14959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Foerstendorf H. Mummert E. Schäfer E. Scheer H. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10793-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for which ZZZ to ZZE isomerization in C15 of phytochromobilin was demonstrated using NMR spectroscopy. The occurrence of common infrared bands at 1653/1643-1638, 1248, 1118, 960-958/947 cm-1 and especially at 1595/1583 cm-1 in the Pnr-Pr and Pfr-Pr spectra recorded with RpBphP3 or RpBphP2 strongly supports that Z to E isomerization also occurs around the C15=C16 double bond for RpBphP3. Previous studies on phytochromes using chromophores chemically modified at ring D or 18O-labeled at ring A have shown that the contributions of the carbonyl group of ring A lie above 1730 cm-1, whereas those of ring D are at 1710-1696 cm-1 (24Foerstendorf H.

https://openalex.org/W2012855182,"The Gram-positive, rod-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis efficiently binds and internalizes transforming DNA. The localization of several competence proteins, required for DNA uptake, has been studied using fluorescence microscopy. At least three proteins (ComGA, ComFA, and YwpH) are preferentially associated with the cell poles and appear to colocalize. This association is dynamic; the proteins accumulate at the poles as transformability develops and then delocalize as transformability wanes. DNA binding and uptake also occur preferentially at the cell poles, as shown using fluorescent DNA and in single-molecule experiments with laser tweezers. In addition to the prominent polar sites, the competence proteins also localize as foci in association with the lateral cell membrane, but this distribution does not exhibit the same temporal changes as the polar accumulation. The results suggest the regulated assembly and disassembly of a DNA-uptake machine at the cell poles."
https://openalex.org/W2119777333,"Src kinases are activated and relocalize to the cytoplasm during mitosis, but their mitotic function has remained elusive. We describe here a novel mitotic substrate of src kinases. Trask (transmembrane and associated with src kinases) is a 140 kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein unrelated to currently known protein families. Src kinases phosphorylate Trask in vitro and mediate its mitotic hyperphosphorylation in vivo. Trask associates with both yes and src, is localized to the cell membrane during interphase, and undergoes cytoplasmic relocalization during mitosis. Overexpression of Trask leads to cell rounding and a loss of adhesion phenotype. Consistent with a function in cell adhesion, Trask interacts with a number of adhesion and matrix proteins including cadherins, syndecans, and the membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1), and is proteolytically cleaved by MT-SP1. Trask is unique among cell adhesion molecules in that it is under cell cycle regulation and thus links src kinases with the mitotic regulation of cell adhesion. This suggests a potential pathway by which hyperactive src kinases in tumors can deregulate adhesion signaling and mediate the metastatic phenotype."

In the presence of cyt c, the decrease of pH induced an increase in vesicle turbidity and mean diameter resulting from vesicle fusion as determined by a rapid decrease in the excimer/monomer ratio of 2-(10-(1-pyrene)-decanoyl)-phosphatidylcholine (PyPC). N-acetylated cyt c and protamine, a positively charged protein, increased vesicle turbidity in a pH-independent manner, whereas albumin did not affect PCPECL vesicle turbidity. pH-dependent turbidity kinetics revealed a role for cyt c-ionizable groups with a pKa(app) of ∼7.0. The carbethoxylation of these groups by diethylpyrocarbonate prevented cyt c-induced vesicle fusion, although cyt c association to vesicles remained unaffected.

In fact, these amino acid residues belong to clusters of positively charged amino acids that lower the pKa. Thus, at low pH, protonation of these invariant and highly conserved amino acid residues produced a second positively charged region opposite to the Lys-72 and Lys-73 region in the cyt c structure.

The detachment of cyt c from the mitochondrial membrane involves reversible interaction of the protein with the lipid bilayer. Therefore, the nature and specificity of the interaction of cyt c with lipid bilayers have been a focus of several studies (13Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys.

Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions have been found to be important factors in the association of cyt c with phospholipid membranes (19Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 20Tuominen E.K. Wallace C.J. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 370: 671-6784Crossref Google Scholar). Studies conducted with model systems have indicated the existence of two different cyt c sites, A and C, which are responsible for the association with lipid bilayers (19Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol.

Site A is an electrostatically interacting site constituted of basic residues in cyt c, probably Lys-72 and Lys-73. Site C is another lipid-binding site in cyt c with a high affinity to protonated acidic phospholipids. The invariant Asn-52 in horse heart cyt c has been assigned as the amino acid residue that binds to protonated acidic phospholipids via hydrogen bonds (19Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol.

Whatever the site involved in the interaction of cyt c with the phospholipid head group, one phospholipid acyl chain can be accommodated within a hydrophobic channel of the protein. In cyt c, this channel is lined by hydrophobic amino acid residues and leads from the surface of the protein to the heme crevice. In this regard, the cyt c amino acid residues Lys-72 and Lys-73 (site A) are located at one side of the channel opening, whereas Asn-52 (site C) is located at the opposite side. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies (21Zucchi M.R. Nascimento O.R. Faljoni-Alario A. Prieto T. Nantes I.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 370: 671-6784Crossref Google Scholar) have shown a clear correlation between the nature of the lipid acyl chain and the spin states of cyt c interacting with different types of lipid membranes.Kostrzewa et al. (24Kostrzewa A. Pali T. Froncisz W. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6066-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) determined the membrane location of spin-labeled cyt c using paramagnetic agents and found that this protein does not penetrate the membrane's interior and that the electrostatic interaction occurs on the side where Lys-86, Lys-87, and Lys-72 are located (7Sugawara T. Lewen A Gasche Y. Yu F Chan P.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1997-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Kostrzewa A. Pali T. Froncisz W. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6066-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, on the external surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane the clusters of positively charged amino acid side chains (site A) are important for the recognition and binding of the cyt c reductase and oxidase (13Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 346: 261-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Therefore, the assignment of the cyt c sites that interact with the membrane and neighboring respiratory proteins continues to pose a challenge. In this regard, the occurrence of cyt c-mediated fusion of phospholipid vesicles suggests the existence of at least two sites for cyt c attachment to membranes (26Lee S. Kim H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we present results of cyt c-mediated vesicle fusion that suggest the existence of one more site for electrostatic interaction of cyt c with acidic phospholipids involving the amino acid residues Lys-22 and Lys-27.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—Cyt c (horse heart, type III), acid-modified (N-acetylated) cyt c, HEPES, egg yolk phosphatidylethanolamine, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, bovine heart cardiolipin (CL), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE), 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamin acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, (Ile-7)-angiotensin III acetate salt, and ACTH fragment 18-39 were purchased from Sigma. 2-(10-(1-Pyrene)-decanoyl)-phosphatidylcholine (PyPC) was supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene OR).Preparation of Liposomes—Lipids were first dissolved in chloroform, which was evaporated with N2 gas. The lipid residue was kept under reduced pressure for at least 2 h, after which it was hydrated by adding cold 5 mm HEPES buffer. After the addition of buffer, the mixture was stirred with a vortex and sonicated at on ice in 30-s bursts with 1-min cooling intervals using a microtip-equipped Thornton ultrasonic processor at an output of 60 watts. Liposome preparations were centrifuged at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to precipitate the titanium released by the sonicator tip.Electronic Absorption Spectrometry and Turbidity—Electronic absorption and turbidity measurements were conducted in a photodiode spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD) by using quartz cuvettes of 1-cm light path and a slit of 0.5 nm.pH Dependence of Cyt c-promoted Vesicle Fusion—The kinetics of vesicle fusion was monitored continuously by the increase in turbidity at 480 nm by using a Shimadzu model MultiSpec 1501 photodiode array spectrophotometer. Vesicles alone, without cyt c, were used as blanks.pKa Measurements—The pKa values of the prototropic groups influencing vesicle fusion were determined by measuring the pH-dependent turbidity increase. The data on turbidity increase (Δturbidity at 480 nm) as a function of pH were analyzed according to Equation 1. Δturbidity=lim1⋅10(pH−pKa)10(pH−pKa)+1(Eq.1) Determination of Mean Zeta Average Diameters (Dz) and Zeta Potentials (ζ) for Vesicles in the Presence or Absence of Cyt c—At 25 °C Dz and ζ were determined by dynamic light scattering and laser-Doppler microelectrophoresis, respectively, using a ZetaPlus-ZetaPotential Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY) equipped with a 570-nm laser and dynamic light scattering at 90° for particle sizing (27Grabowski E.F. Morrison I.D. Dahneke B. Measurements of Suspended Particles by Quasi-elastic Light Scattering. Wiley Interscience, New York1983: 199-236Google Scholar). Particle size (Dz) and ζ were mean values calculated from at least 10 independent measurements with S.D. <5% from the mean. ζ was determined in pure water from electrophoretic mobility μ and Smoluchowski's equation ζ = μη/ϵ, where η is the medium viscosity and ϵ the medium dielectric constant. The final lipid concentration varied from 0.25 to 1.0 mm.Vesicle Fusion Detected by PyPC—For fluorescence measurements, aliquots of small unilamellar 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and heart cardiolipin (PCPECL; 50:30:20% mol) vesicles containing PyPC (7% mol) were added to identical unlabeled PCPECL vesicles to a final ratio of 1:10 labeled/unlabeled vesicles. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 30 °C using a F-2500 Hitachi fluorescence spectrometer.Carboxyethylation of Cyt c by Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)—Samples of 100 μm cyt c in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, or in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.25, were reacted with 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 9-, 15-, 25-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess DEPC at room temperature for 1 min. The samples were then dialyzed for 2 h before subjecting them to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry analysis.MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—All linear, reflectron (not shown), and post-source decay (not shown) spectra were acquired on an Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro mass spectrometer that can operate in linear mode or in reflectron mode using a harmonic reflectron that increases resolution and sharpens time focusing. The accelerating voltage was set at 20 kV. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution (5 mg/ml) of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamin acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5 μl of the mixture was loaded onto the stainless steel MALDI slides for analysis. Cyt c was digested by trypsin. Prior to MALDI-TOF analysis, the supernatant containing tryptic peptide was dried by vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in 10 μl of water. An equal volume of the peptide solution was mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (prepared such as described above), and 0.5 μl of the 8-pmol peptide solution was loaded onto the stainless steel MALDI slides for analysis. The external calibration for the linear mode was performed before analysis with bovine cyt c. Reflectron mode calibration was conducted using (Ile-7)angiotensin III acetate salt and ACTH fragment 18-39. The data were analyzed using the Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro software. Sequencing of cyt c tryptic peptides was made with Ettan CAF™ MALDI sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSEffect of pH on the Instability of Mitochondrial Mimetic PCPECL Vesicles Promoted by Cyt c—Fig. 1A shows the effect of pH on the cyt c-promoted colloidal instability of mitochondrial mimetic PCPECL vesicles. The turbidity kinetic mediated by cyt c was carried out over a pH range of 6.2-7.4. This pH range was chosen because it is expected in the mitochondrial intermembrane space under different conditions such as respiring and coupled mitochondria or in the presence of respiratory inhibitors or uncoupling compounds (28Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar, 29Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992Google Scholar). The drop in pH from 7.4 to 6.2 promoted a corresponding increase in the sample's turbidity, as indicated by the arrow (Fig. 1A). The kinetic data did not fit to the first order equation Δturbidity =Δturbidity∞[1 - e-k,t)] (figure not shown). The log(Δturbidity) versus log(time) plot revealed that the increase in vesicle turbidity followed a multiphasic process (Fig. 1B). In fact, this observation is expected because, during the course of the fusion process, the size and radius of the curvature of the liposomes are changing. These results indicate that in-depth physico-chemical studies of this process should yield the basic mechanism of fusion of the PCPECL vesicles mediated by cyt c.Fig. 2 shows the effect of pH on the turbidity of PCPECL (closed circle) and PCPEPG (closed triangle) vesicles after 10 min of interaction with cyt c over a pH range of 1.5-9.0. PCPEPG was used here for purposes of comparison with PCPECL to discard the possible formation of hexagonal phase Hii mediated by cyt c as a consequence of its interaction with CL (30De Kruijff B. Cullins P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the absence of cyt c and at a pH below 2.5, instability of PCPECL (Fig. 2, open circle) and PCPEPG (open triangle) vesicles occurred because of the protonation of phosphate moieties in acidic phospholipids. Above pH 2.5, vesicles were stable, and instability was detected only upon the addition of cyt c (Fig. 2, closed circle and closed triangle). An analysis of the pH curves in the presence of cyt c reveals two transitions. The first transition, around pH 3.0, suggests that the native cyt c structure was crucial to induce vesicle fusion because it was close to the cyt c acid transition (15Wuthrich K. Aviram I. Schejter A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 253: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Antalik M. Sedlak E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pKa value for the second transition was obtained by fitting pH data to Equation 1 by non-linear regression analysis, yielding values of 6.95 ± 0.08 and 7.19 ± 0.01 in the presence of PCPECL and PCPEPG vesicles, respectively.FIGURE 2Effect of pH on the turbidity at 480 nm of the medium containing PCPECL vesicles (open circles), PCPECL vesicles plus 4μm cyt c (solid circles), PCPEPG vesicles (open triangles), and PCPEPG vesicles plus 4 μm cyt c (solid triangles). The turbidity was determined 10 min after incubation at 30 °C. Experiments were carried out at with 0.25 mm lipids containing 50% DPPC, 30% DPPE, and 20% CL or phosphatidylglycerol. The medium was acidified and alkalized by the addition of HCl and NaOH, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As expected, the increased turbidity of the sample mediated by cyt c was associated with an increase of the mean vesicle size, as shown by photon correlation spectroscopy (TABLE ONE). In the absence of cyt c, the decrease in pH led to a minor change in the mean size of the vesicles. However, in the presence of cyt c, decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 6.2 led to a dramatic increase in the mean vesicle size (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEEffect of pH on the diameter of PCPECL liposomes Experimental conditionaExperiments were carried out under the following conditions: 10 mm HEPES, 30 °C, 4 μm cyt c in the presence of 0.25 mm liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (50%), phosphatidylethanolamine (30%), and CL (20%) pH 7.4 pH 6.8 pH 6.2 nm nm nm PCPECL 61.1 ± 0.3bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample 69.9 ± 0.2bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample 76.2 ± 1.0bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample PCPECL + cyt c 54.0 ± 0.4bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample 104.0 ± 2.5bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample 1030.4 ± 17.8bThe error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the samplea Experiments were carried out under the following conditions: 10 mm HEPES, 30 °C, 4 μm cyt c in the presence of 0.25 mm liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (50%), phosphatidylethanolamine (30%), and CL (20%)b The error value refers to the value obtained by the measurement and not to the vesicles diameter in the sample Open table in a new tab The Cause of Cyt c-promoted Turbidity Increase in PCPECL Vesicles—To determine whether fusion or aggregation was responsible for the cyt c-promoted colloidal instability of PCPECL vesicles, changes in the vesicles' average size were compared with a decrease in the excimer/monomer (E/M) ratio of PyPC present in PCPECL vesicles, which were mixed with unlabeled vesicles in the presence or absence of cyt c. Similarly to what was observed in small unilamellar egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing 7 mol % PyPC (33Schenkman S. Araujo P.S. Dijkman R. Quina F.H. Chaimovich H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), control experiments demonstrated that the E/M ratio of PCPECL vesicles containing 7 mol % PyPC in PCPECL was unaffected by dilution, remaining virtually unchanged after 2 h of incubation at two pH values, 6.2 and 7.4, in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled PCPECL vesicles (not shown). The addition of cyt c to a mixture of 7 mol % PyPC-labeled and unlabeled small unilamellar vesicles caused the E/M ratio to drop from 0.25 to 0.13 at pH 6.2 (Fig. 3). At pH 7.4 the E/M ratio remained constant as a function of time and equal to 0.25 after the addition of the same amount of cyt c (Fig. 3). The insert compares the kinetic curves of the cyt c-promoted E/M ratio decrease for PyPC in PCPECL vesicles at pH 7.4 and 6.2.FIGURE 3Effect of cyt c on the fluorescence emission spectra of small unilamellar PCPECL vesicles containing 7 mol % PyPC. Vesicles (0.05 mm PCPECL; labeled/unlabeled = 1:10) incubated at 30 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer with 0.9 μm cyt c for 378 s at pH 6.2 and pH 7.4. The inset shows the temporal variation of E/M at pH 6.2 (solid circle) and pH 7.4 (open circle).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Assignment of the pKa Values to Specific Ionizable Groups—At this point a question was raised. Was the pKa value of 6.95, obtained in the presence of PCPECL, or the value of 7.19, measured in the presence of PCPEPG vesicles, related to the ionization of phospholipid head groups or to the amino acid residues of the protein? If the first possibility was correct, the ζ potential of the PCPECL vesicles should have varied significantly over the pH range of 6.2-7.4, indicating a decrease in the negative charge density at the vesicle surface due to protonation of phosphate moieties. In a pH range of 6.2-7.4, PCPECL vesicles containing 20% CL did not display a significant variation in ζ potential, which remained practically constant at -100 mV. In PCPECL vesicles containing cyt c, the ζ potential was also constant but at -50 mV over the same pH range, indicating that cyt c was electrostatically attached to the vesicles. Therefore, the electrostatic interaction of cyt c with PCPECL vesicles occurs below this protein's pI (10.5), but fusion should be dependent on the ionization of specific amino acid side chains, suggesting specificity of cyt c to promote the fusion of PCPECL vesicles in a pH-dependent manner. Fig. 4 compares the ability of two basic proteins (cyt c, lines a and d, and protamine, lines b and c) and one acidic protein (serum albumin, lines e and f) to promote PCPECL vesicle fusion in a pH-dependent manner. Protamine exhibited the same efficiency at pH 7.4 and 6.2 (Fig. 4, lines b and c, respectively) to promote colloidal instability in PCPECL vesicles, whereas serum albumin failed to promote instability at these pH values (lines e and f, respectively). The decrease in PCPECL vesicle fusion promoted by the increase of the pH was substantial only with cyt c.FIGURE 4Comparison of the ability of cyt c, protamine, and serum albumin to induce fusion of PCPECL vesicles. The experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of 0.25 mm PCPECL and the following proteins at 4 μm : cyt c at pH 6.2 (a); protamine at pH 7.4 (b); protamine at pH 6.2 (c); cyt c at pH 7.4 (d); serum albumin at pH 7.4 (e); and serum albumin at pH 6.2 (f). Experiments were carried out with 0.25 mm lipids containing 50% DPPC, 30% DPPE, and 20% CL in 10 mm HEPES buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Considering the possibility that the pKa of ∼7.0 is attributable to cyt c amino acid residues, imidazole groups of histidine emerged as the probable ionizable residues. However, clusters of lysine residues in which the proximity of positively charged groups led to significantly reduced pKa values should not be discarded. An analysis of the cyt c structure revealed a cluster of positively charged residues encompassing Lys-22, Lys-25, Lys-27, His-26, and His-33 in a region on the opposite side of sites A (Lys-72 and Lys-73) and C (Asn-52). In this region, the side chains of lysine residues are confluent, possibly favoring the decrease of the pKa values in their lateral side chains. Therefore, this region is a probable site of interaction with acidic phospholipids at pH 6.2, but not at pH 7.4, at which these residues should be deprotonated. Interestingly, the side chains of Lys-72 and Lys-73 residues are divergent at site A, suggesting a high pKa value for these side chain amino groups. This possibility was checked by carbethoxylation of cyt c with DEPC at different pH values and also at different protein/DEPC ratios. Fig. 5, left section, shows how the pH (5.6-8.0) in which cyt c was treated with DEPC in 3-fold molar excess affects the efficiency of cyt c to mediate PCPECL vesicle fusion at pH 6.2 (open circle). This result was compared with the pH curve for PCPECL vesicle fusion mediated by native cyt c over the same pH range (Fig. 5, closed circle in the right section). The right side in Fig. 5 shows that the pronounced effects of pH on turbidity changes induced by cyt c (closed circles) were in striking contrast to the almost complete absence of a pH effect for N-acetylated cyt c (open diamonds). The pKa value of 6.75 ± 0.07 obtained for the effect of pH in which cyt c was treated with DEPC 1:3 (open circles) was close to the pKa value (6.95 ± 0.08) for native cyt c-mediated PCPECL vesicle fusion. These results suggest that contrary to N-acetylation, which blocked all cyt c lysine residues, the carbethoxylation of cyt c blocked ionizable groups with a pKa of around pH 7.0 involved in the interaction with lipid bilayers responsible for the fusion process.FIGURE 5Effect of carbethoxylation and N-acetylation on the ability of cyt c to induce PCPECL vesicle fusion.

Based on these results, we assessed the potential of eEPCs to enhance vascularization and limit organ dysfunction after ischemia in syngenic and xenotypic organisms. The angiogenic potential of eEPCs was evaluated in chronic ischemic rabbit hindlimbs after regional application by retroinfusion. eEPC treatment improved limb perfusion, paralleled by an increase in capillary density and collateral blood vessel number. Systemic eEPC infusion into mice after ischemic cardiac insult increased postischemic heart output measured by a marked improvement in left ventricle developed pressure and both systolic and diastolic functions. In vitro, eEPCs strongly induced vascular outgrowths from aortic rings. To address the molecular basis of this intrinsic angiogenic potential, we investigated the eEPC transcriptome. Genome-wide Affymetrix GeneChip analysis revealed that the eEPCs express a wealth of secreted factors known to induce angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and organogenesis that may contribute to the eEPC-mediated beneficial effects. Our findings show that eEPCs induce blood vessel growth and cardioprotection in severe ischemic conditions providing a readily available source to study the mechanisms of neovascularization and tissue recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2067449053,"The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins is widely involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and oncogenesis. Many Wnt signaling genes are upregulated and activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Less is known concerning acute leukemia. One subtype of acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a t(1;19) chromosomal translocation resulting in a fusion protein E2A–Pbx1 that promotes transformation and leukemogenesis. Wnt16 has been shown to be targeted by E2A–Pbx1. We performed a differential gene expression array in acute leukemia cell lines displaying or not displaying the t(1;19) translocation. We found that Wnt16 and many Wnt signaling-related genes were upregulated in the translocation-containing cells. As two isoforms of Wnt16, Wnt16a and Wnt16b, have been recently identified, we demonstrated by using RT–PCR and Western blot that Wnt16b (and not Wnt16a) is overexpressed in t(1;19)-containing cell lines. We then directly addressed the role played by both isoforms in this type of leukemia. Using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) and an anti-Wnt16 antibody, we showed that targeted-Wnt16b inhibition leads to apoptotic cell death. We also demonstrated that Wnt16b mediates its effect through the canonical Wnt pathway involving dishevelled-2, β-catenin and survivin. We thus propose that Wnt16 plays an important role in leukemogenesis, raising its therapeutic interest."
https://openalex.org/W2025410816,"We have found that two DNA repair/recombination proteins localize differentially to the cell poles in competent Bacillus subtilis cells. RecA protein colocalized with competence protein ComGA, and its polar localization largely depended on ComGA and ComK activity, while RecN oscillated between the poles in a minute time frame, independent of any competence factor. Oscillation of RecN arrested upon addition of external DNA, suggesting that an interaction with incoming single-stranded (ss) DNA favors the localization of RecN at the pole containing the competence machinery. In agreement with this model, purified RecN protein showed ATP-dependent binding to ssDNA. Addition of DNA resulted in the formation of RecA threads emanating from the competence machinery. Our data show that in competent bacteria there exists a specifically positioned and dynamic ssDNA binding apparatus that accepts ssDNA taken up through the polar competence machinery and processes ssDNA for recombination with chromosomal DNA via extended RecA filaments."

To investigate the mechanism of EphA7 downregulation in colorectal cancer, we examined the methylation status of the 5′CpG island around the translation start site in five colon cancer cell lines using restriction enzymes, methylation-specific PCR, and bisulfite sequencing and found evidence of aberrant methylation. The expression of EphA7 in colon cancer cell lines was restored after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Analysis of methylation status in totally 75 tumors compared to clinicopathological parameters revealed that hypermethylation of colorectal cancers was more frequent in male than in female (P=0.0078), and in moderately differentiated than in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (P=0.0361). There was a tendency that hypermethylation in rectal cancers was more frequent than in colon cancers (P=0.0816). Hypermethylation was also observed in colorectal adenomas. This is the first report describing the downregulation of an Eph family gene in a solid tumor via aberrant 5′CpG island methylation. It provides the evidence that EphA7 gene is involved in human colorectal carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2030874893,"Molecular motors actively transport many types of cargo along the cytoskeleton in a wide range of organisms. One class of cargo is localized mRNAs, which are transported by myosin on actin filaments or by kinesin and dynein on microtubules. How the cargo is kept at its final intracellular destination and whether the motors are recycled after completion of transport are poorly understood. Here, we use a new RNA anchoring assay in living Drosophila blastoderm embryos to show that apical anchoring of mRNA after completion of dynein transport does not depend on actin or on continuous active transport by the motor. Instead, apical anchoring of RNA requires microtubules and involves dynein as a static anchor that remains with the cargo at its final destination. We propose a general principle that could also apply to other dynein cargo and to some other molecular motors, whereby cargo transport and anchoring reside in the same molecule."

Substitutions at the 2-position (Cl or CF3) did not alter inhibitory activity, whereas N10-substitutions with derivatives having acetyl (20B) or morpholino (12B) side chain lost activity compared with propyl or butyl substituents (7B and 14B). Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of IGF-I stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation (Ser-2448 and Ser-2481), phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389), and ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235/236) in Rh1, Rh18, and Rh30 cell lines. The two most potent compounds 10-[4′-(N-diethylamino)butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine (10B) and 10-[4′-[(β-hydroxyethyl)piperazino]butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine (15B) (in vitro, IC50 ∼1-2 μm) were studied further. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation correlated with inhibition of its kinase activity as determined in vitro after immunoprecipitation. Akt inhibitory phenoxazines did not inhibit the activity of recombinant phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, PDK1, or SGK1 but potently inhibited the kinase activity of recombinant Akt and AktΔPH, a mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology domain. Akt inhibitory phenoxazines blocked IGF-I-stimulated nuclear translocation of Akt in Rh1 cells and suppressed growth of Rh1, Rh18, and Rh30 cells (IC50 2-5 μm), whereas “inactive” derivatives were ≥10-fold less potent inhibitors of cell growth. In contrast to rapamycin analogs, Akt inhibitory phenoxazines induced significant levels of apoptosis under serum-containing culture conditions at concentrations of agent consistent with Akt inhibition. Thus, the cellular responses to phenoxazine inhibitors of Akt appear qualitatively different from the rapamycin analogs. Modeling studies suggest inhibitory phenoxazines may bind in the ATP-binding site, although ATP competition studies were unable to distinguish between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.

The design and development of small molecules that specifically inhibit the kinase activity of Akt and its signal transduction pathway in cancer cells are thus attractive approaches for the development of new cancer therapeutic agents. Currently, considerable effort is being placed into the development of novel specific inhibitors of Akt. The compounds include a number of phosphatidylinositol (PI) analogs (26Hu Y. Qiao L. Wang S.

Some of these N10-substituted phenoxazines demonstrated significant cytotoxicity per se (hence were not studied further), whereas several derivatives enhanced vincristine toxicity in cells with undetectable levels of P-glycoprotein. From these results, we concluded that at least part of the activity of some of these phenoxazine MDR modulators is mediated through an unknown, but P-glycoprotein-independent, mechanism. As it is now established that Akt signaling protects against cellular stress, including cytotoxic agents, we have investigated whether phenoxazine derivatives inhibit Akt and induce apoptosis. We screened a number of phenoxazine derivatives for their effects on Akt activation in cells derived from pediatric cancers. From among these compounds, we report the identification of a small group of novel lead compounds, which at low micromolar concentrations specifically block Akt activation and downstream signaling to substrates such as mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, and ribosomal protein S6 (S6). These agents do not affect activation of the upstream kinases, PDK-1, PI 3-kinase, or other kinases downstream of ras such as Erk-1/2. Furthermore, at low micromolar concentrations, under normal growth conditions, these small molecule inhibitors induce apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. All the chemicals and supplies were obtained from standard commercial sources unless otherwise indicated. Wortmannin was purchased from Calbiochem. Phenoxazine derivatives were prepared in pure form according to our procedures published previously (37Thimmaiah K.N. Horton J.K. Seshadri R. Israel M. Houghton J.A. Houghton P.J. J. Med.

Each inhibitor was dissolved in Me2SO before being added to culture medium (final concentration 0.1%). Cell Lines and Growth Conditions—The human cell lines Rh1, Rh18, and Rh30 have been described (41Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Rh1, Rh18, or Rh30 cells were grown in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For serum-free experiments, cells were cultured in modified N2E (MN2E) medium (DMEM/F-12; 1:1 mixture) supplemented with 1 μg/ml human holotransferrin, 30 nm sodium selenite, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 30 nm vitamin E phosphate, and 50 μm ethanolamine. Cells in MN2E medium containing 5 μg/ml bovine fibronectin (Sigma) were plated and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cellular Screening for Inhibitors—Rh1, Rh18, or Rh30 cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106/10-cm plate in serum-free medium for overnight attachment. Cells were exposed to 0.1% Me2SO or each of the phenoxazine derivatives for 1 h and then stimulated with IGF-I (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), placed on ice, and lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing one Complete™ mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatants was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce). For the analysis of Akt, Erk-1/2, mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, and GSK-3, equivalent amounts of protein were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After a 1-h incubation in 1× TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% blocking reagent (skim milk) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at room temperature, the wet nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with the appropriate antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies (Waltham, MA) at the dilutions indicated: rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated Ser-473 or Thr-308 of Akt (dilution 1:1000); rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated Thr-202/Tyr-204 of Erk-1/2 (dilution 1:1000); rabbit polyclonal anti-serum specific for the phosphorylated Ser-2448 or Ser-2481 of mTOR (dilution 1:1000); rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated Thr-389 of p70 S6 kinase (dilution 1:4000); rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated Ser-235/236 of S6 (dilution 1:1000); or rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated Ser-21/9 of GSK-3α/β (dilution 1:1000). The secondary antibody was the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution, 1:10,000). Immunoreactive protein was visualized by using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on each gel, all immunoblots were treated with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7; 2% SDS; and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C and then incubated with one of the appropriate antibodies as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody to Akt (dilution 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse monoclonal antibody to β-tubulin (dilution 1:2000; Sigma). The secondary antibodies and detection of bound antibody were as described above. Determination of Cellular Akt Kinase Activity—Rh1 cells were seeded in serum-free medium at a density of 4 × 106 per 10-cm plate. After 24 h, cells were exposed to Me2SO (0.1%) or phenoxazine at 5 μm for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with ± IGF-I (10 ng/ml) for 10 min and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1% Triton X-100; 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate; 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1 mm leupeptin) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 17,500 × g at 4 °C. The volumes of the supernatants were adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein (150 μg); the supernatants were then incubated with immobilized (cross-linked) anti-Akt antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted and washed twice in ice-cold cell lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm Na3VO4; and 10 mm MgCl2). The pellets were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of a GSK-3 fusion protein, which served as the substrate. After the suspensions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 6% SDS; 30% glycerol; 150 mm dithiothreitol; and 0.03% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody. In Vitro Inhibition of Recombinant Akt, AktΔPH, and SGK1—In vitro kinase assays were performed using active recombinant full-length Akt1/PKBα (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), active recombinant Akt lacking the pleckstrin homology domain, Akt1ΔPH (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or active recombinant SGK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, 10 ng of recombinant enzyme in 25 μl of 1× kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm Na3VO4; and 10 mm MgCl2), was mixed with 2.5 μl of Me2SO or phenoxazine derivative (5 μm). Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h at which time 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein, which served as the substrate, was added followed by ATP (200 μm) to each reaction mixture. After the suspensions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 6% SDS; 30% glycerol; 150 mm dithiothreitol; and 0.03% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody. Competition Experiments with ATP and Phenoxazines—Concentrations of compound 15B were prepared as 10× stocks in Me2SO ranging from 25 μm to 50 mm to give a final reaction concentration range of 2.5 μm to 5 mm. An ATP master mix was prepared containing 0.75 μl of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences NEG302H), 0.5 μl of 10 mm ATP, and 1.25 μl of 1× kinase buffer for each sample. An enzyme/substrate master mix was prepared containing 10 μl of 1× kinase buffer, 5 μl of Akt peptide substrate (670 ng/μl) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and 5 μl of active Akt (10 ng/μl) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted from stock using 1× kinase buffer. The reactions were set up by adding 2.5 μl of the phenoxazine to the bottom of the tube followed by the addition of 2.5 μl of ATP mix near the bottom of the tube. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of the enzyme/substrate master mix. After the master mix was added to all of the tubes, the samples were placed at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation the samples were centrifuged briefly and spotted onto phosphocellulose in the same order as the addition of the master mix. After 2 min these samples were added to a beaker with 0.75% phosphoric acid in the same order as above. The samples were washed for 5 min three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid followed by 5 min in acetone. The squares were then placed on Whatman paper and allowed to dry. The radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Molecular Modeling—Structures of inhibitors were built, and energy was minimized by using SYBYL 6.9.1 two-dimensional modeling software (version 6.9.1, Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). The GOLD program (version 2.1.2) (42Jones G. Willet P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar) from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, UK, was used to dock the inhibitors into the ATP site of Akt, the three-dimensional coordinates of which were imported from the Protein Data Bank (code 1O6K). GOLD uses a genetic algorithm to explore ligand conformational flexibility. The program also optimizes the torsion angles of serine and threonine hydroxyl groups as well as lysine NH+3 groups to achieve limited receptor flexibility. The ATP site was defined as residues lying within 15 Å of Thr-292. Up to 10 different docking solutions were obtained for each molecule, the docking being terminated when the top three solutions were within a root mean square deviation of ≤1.5. Photoaffinity Labeling of Recombinant Akt—The photoaffinity labeling experiments were performed on ice in MES buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.1) using 200 ng of recombinant active Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 20 μm 8-azidoadenosine 5′-[α-32P] triphosphate (8N3[α-32P]ATP) (Altcorp) in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. All of the samples, including samples containing phenoxazine 15B (200 μm), were incubated on ice for 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, 8N3[α-32P]ATP was added and allowed to bind for 1 min. In the sample containing ATP (200 μm or 1 mm), the ATP was premixed with 8N3[α-32P]ATP prior to its addition to the reaction. Immediately after binding, the samples were photocross-linked using a handheld model UVLS-28 (UVP) UV lamp set at 254 nm at a distance of 4 cm from the sample surface for 1 min. After cross-linking, 15 μl of 3× SDS sample loading buffer was added to each sample. The entire sample was electrophoresed on a 4-20% Tris glycine gel followed by one rinse with H2O and overnight fixation (50% MeOH, 40% H2O, 10% acetic acid). After fixation the gel was washed two times for 30 min with H2O. The bands were detected using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To verify even loading of Akt, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma). PI 3-Kinase Assay—20 ng of recombinant p110γ enzyme (AG Scientific, San Diego, CA), Me2SO (5 μl), phenoxazine derivative (5 μm), or wortmannin (5 μm) were placed on ice for 1 h in 100 μl of 1× kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 100 mm NaCl; and 5 mm MgCl2). 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) was then added to each sample, and the incubation was continued on ice for an additional 15 min. ATP (final concentration of 25 μm containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) was added to each sample, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of 6 n hydrochloric acid. The sample was vortexed, and the lipids were extracted into 300 μl of MeOH/CHCl3 (1:1) mixture. After mixing gently and spinning at 10,000 × g for 5 min, 50 μl of the organic phase was spotted onto a silica-coated TLC plate (EMD Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA) and developed using a solvent system containing CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). The TLC plate was allowed to dry, and the bands were analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). PDK1 Kinase Assays—In vitro PDK1 activity assays were performed using a PDK1 assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with a slight modification of the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 ng of recombinant PDK1 enzyme, Me2SO (5 μl), or phenoxazines (5 μm) were incubated in 80 μl of 1× PDK assay dilution buffer on ice. After 1 h, 100 ng of SGK1 was added to each sample and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. The samples were transferred to a 30 °C water bath and incubated for an additional 15 min. Then SGK1 substrate peptide (245 μm) followed by ATP (40 μm containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added, and the reaction mixture was gently vortexed. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with a gentle vortexing every 2 min. Samples were centrifuged, and 40 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto the center of a PE 81 phosphocellulose paper square. After 30 s, the filter was washed four times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and twice with acetone. The filter was drained and transferred into a scintillation vial to which 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added. The amount of incorporated radioactivity into the substrate was determined by scintillation counting. The assay for SGK1 kinase activity was performed as described above for the PDK1 assay. Translocation of Akt in Rh1 Cells—Rh1 cells (2 × 105 per chamber) were grown on 2-well glass chamber slides (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in serum-free medium containing fibronectin"
https://openalex.org/W1985428858,"The hormone relaxin has been shown to cause coronary vasodilation and to prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury in rodents. This study provides evidence that relaxin, used as an adjunctive drug to coronary reperfusion, reduces the functional, biochemical, and histopathological signs of myocardial injury in an in vivo swine model of heart ischemia/reperfusion, currently used to test cardiotropic drugs for myocardial infarction. Human recombinant relaxin, given at reperfusion at doses of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 microg/kg b.wt. after a 30-min ischemia, caused a dose-related reduction of key markers of myocardial damage (serum myoglobin, CK-MB, troponin T) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis (caspase 3, TUNEL assay), as well as of cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction (myofibril hypercontraction). Compared with the controls, relaxin also increased the uptake of the viability tracer 201Thallium and improved ventricular performance (cardiac index). Relaxin likely acts by reducing oxygen free radical-induced myocardial injury (malondialdehyde, tissue calcium overload) and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment (myeloperoxidase). The present findings show that human relaxin, given as a drug to counteract reperfusion-induced cardiac injury, affords a clear-cut protection to the heart of swine with induced myocardial infarction. The findings also provide background to future clinical trials with relaxin as adjunctive therapy to catheter-based coronary angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction."

https://openalex.org/W2077847170,"We present evidence that Notch4ICD attenuates TGF-beta signaling. Cells expressing the activated form of the Notch4 receptor (ICD4) were resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Notch4ICD was found to bind to Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 but with higher affinity to Smad3. Deletion analysis showed that binding of Smad3 to ICD4 was mediated by its MH2 domain and was not dependent on the presence of the RAM23 region in ICD4. Using two TGF-beta/Activin reporter luciferase assays, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that ICD4 and ICD4 deltaRAM23 inhibit Smad-binding element and 3TP luciferase reporter activity and PAI-1 gene expression. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells express Notch4ICD (ICD4) and are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Blockage of Notch4 processing to ICD4 by gamma-secretase inhibitor renders MCF-7 cells sensitive to growth inhibition by TGF-beta. The interplay between these two signaling pathways may be a significant determinant during mammary tumorigenesis."

Here we show that exposure of hippocampal neurons to ethanol increases the internalization of the NR2A but not NR2B subunit of the NMDAR via the endocytic pathway. We further observed that ethanol exposure results in NR2A endocytosis through the activation of H-Ras and the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Src. Importantly, ethanol treatment alters functional subunit composition from NR2A/NR2B- to mainly NR2B-containing NMDARs.

Sci. 2003; 1003: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NMDARs are heteromeric ligand-gated ion channels composed of an obligatory NR1 subunit and regulatory NR2A-D and NR3 subunits (2Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The NMDAR subunits can undergo lateral movement between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, as well as internalization from, or forward trafficking to, the plasma membrane (7Prybylowski K. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9673-9676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, prolonged inhibition of NMDAR activity results in the redistribution of the subunits from extrasynaptic to synaptic sites (9Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 2002; 34: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Synaptic activity and long-term potentiation increase the forward trafficking of NMDAR subunits (10Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and glycine has been reported to prime the NMDAR subunits for internalization (12Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). NMDAR function can be regulated by changes in the phosphorylation state of the subunits via the activation of kinases or phosphatases (13Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also control the movement of NMDAR subunits to and from the plasma membrane. For example, activation of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, and the consequent phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit, increases forward trafficking of the receptor (14Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fyn kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR plays a role in the dopamine D1 receptor-mediated redistribution of NMDAR subunits from intracellular to postsynaptic compartments (15Dunah A.W. Sirianni A.C. Fienberg A.A. Bastia E. Schwarzschild M.A. Standaert D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Conversely, tyrosine dephosphorylation of the NR2A subunits leads to the internalization of the subunits, resulting in the rundown of channel activity (16Vissel B. Krupp J.J. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that H-Ras-mediated inhibition of Src kinase activity prevents the phosphorylation and membrane retention of NR2A subunits (17Thornton C. Yaka R. Dinh S. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23823-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We, and others, reported that the activity of the NMDAR in the presence of ethanol is modulated via changes in the phosphorylation state of the subunits (18Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Alvestad R.M. Grosshans D.R. Coultrap S.J. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Browning M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11020-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Yaka R. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3623-3632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMDARs have been implicated in mediating ethanol-associated phenotypes such as tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, craving and relapse, and intoxication (5Krystal J.H. Petrakis I.L. Mason G. Trevisan L. D'Souza D.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 99: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 6Krystal J.H. Petrakis I.L. Krupitsky E. Schutz C. Trevisan L. D'Souza D.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1003: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which the actions of ethanol on the NMDAR underlie these phenotypes are not well understood. Because changes in the phosphorylation state of NMDAR subunits are important for both the trafficking of NMDARs and the actions of ethanol, we hypothesized that the modulation of NMDAR activity by ethanol may be due to changes in the trafficking of the subunits of the receptor. We found that, in the hippocampus, acute exposure to ethanol specifically increases the internalization of the NR2A subunit via ethanol-mediated activation of H-Ras. Importantly, as a consequence of the NR2A internalization, the remaining NR2B-containing NMDARs are predominant in mediating the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the presence of ethanol.

Dexamethasone and phosphatase inhibitor were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and ketamine was purchased from Abbott Laboratories (North Chicago, IL). L(tk–) cells stably transfected with NR1 plus NR2A or NR1 plus NR2B were a generous gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme, and PSD-95-GFP cDNA was a gift from Dr. David Bredt (UCSF). Tat-peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) was synthesized by Syn Pep (Dublin, CA). The purity of the peptide was >90%, and the integrity was determined by mass spectroscopy. Mice—C57BL/6J, Src+/– (B6.129S7-Srctm1Sor) and Fyn–/– (B6.129S7-Fyntm1Sor) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Fyn–/– mice were mated in-house with C57BL/6J mice to generate Fyn+/– mice, which were subsequently mated to generate Fyn–/– and their corresponding Fyn+/+ littermates. Similarly, Src+/– littermates were mated in-house to generate Src+/– and their corresponding Src+/+ littermates. The genotypes of the mice were determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail tissue. The mean age of animals used for biochemical studies was 10–12 weeks. Experimental protocols involving the use of vertebrate animals were approved by the Gallo Research Center subcommittee on Research Animal Care and met National Institutes of Health guidelines. Preparation of Tat-H-Ras Dominant Negative (DN) Fusion Protein— pTAT-H-Ras DN was expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli as previously described (17Thornton C. Yaka R. Dinh S. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23823-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—L(tk–) were cultured on 100-mm plates. When cells reached 75% confluency, they were transfected with 5 μg of PSD95-GFP cDNA using Lipofectamine Plus in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the expression of the NMDAR subunits NR1 plus NR2A or NR1 plus NR2B was induced with 1 mm dexamethasone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mm ketamine as previously described (21Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Atack J.R. Barton C. Cockett W. Cook S.M. Gilbert E. Hutson P.H. McKernan R.M. Myers J. Ragan C.I. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After 3 days of induction, the cross-linking or immunoprecipitation studies were conducted. Homogenates were obtained as described in a previous study (17Thornton C. Yaka R. Dinh S. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23823-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The expression of NR1 and PSD-95 was routinely verified (data not shown). Preparation of Hippocampal Slice Homogenates—Transverse hippocampal slices (250 μm) were prepared from 10- to 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Slices were allowed to recover for 90 min in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 containing (in mm): 126 NaCl, 1.2 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.4 CaCl2, 18 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose. Following recovery, slices were treated with aCSF (control) or ethanol at room temperature, after which the slices were rinsed in cold aCSF, and used either for cross-linking experiments, for Ras activity assay, or for immunoprecipitation. In experiments using Tat-H-Ras DN or the Tat-peptide, the slices were pretreated with either aCSF (control) or 2 μm Tat-H-Ras DN or Tat-peptide for 2 h at room temperature, followed by ethanol treatments. Cross-linking Studies—Cross-linking was performed as described previously (22Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Sci. STKE. 2002; 137: PL8Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Following treatment, the slices were placed in cold aCSF in the presence or absence of 2 mg/ml of the cross-linking reagent BS3 for 45 min at 4 °C while shaking. Slices were then rinsed three times with cold aCSF containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), followed by sonication in cold homogenization buffer (10% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Data are expressed as the ratio of normalized surface expressed or internalized receptors to the total receptor levels. Chymotrypsin experiments were performed as described previously (22Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Sci. STKE. 2002; 137: PL8Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Following recovery, slices were treated with aCSF or 0.5 mg/ml chymotrypsin at 32 °C for 5 min. The chymotrypsin reaction was stopped by three washing steps in aCSF containing 2 mm AEBSF (a chymotrypsin inhibitor), followed by sonication in cold homogenization buffer (10% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Ras Activity Assay—The treated hippocampal homogenates (250 μg) were incubated with 15 μl of Raf-1-Ras binding domain glutathione S-transferase-agarose for 45 min at 4 °C while rotating, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were then washed three times with lysis/wash buffer (provided by the manufacturer), resuspended in 2× sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot with pan anti-Ras antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—The treated slices were homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 1% deoxycholate, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors and (in mm): 250 sucrose, 20 Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 EDTA and 10 EGTA. 500 μg of the protein was diluted with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100 and (in mm): 150 NaCl, 10 Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, and 0.2 sodium orthovanadate) and incubated with 5 μg of the appropriate antibody, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads. The beads were extensively washed, re-suspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5–10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the specific primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection was obtained followed by enhanced chemiluminescent reaction (Amersham Biosciences), and processed using the Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Results were quantified by Image 1.61 (National Institutes of Health). Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological recordings were performed in C57BL/6J mice ranging from P21 to P26. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated as per the University of California, San Francisco animal care guidelines. Horizontal sections of the hippocampus (230–300 μm) were prepared with a vibratome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). Slices were placed in a holding chamber and allowed to recover for at least 1 h before being placed in the recording chamber and superfused with aCSF saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and containing (in mm): 119 NaCl, 1.6 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl2 (for EPSCs), or 0.01 MgCl2 (for field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs)), 2.5 CaCl2, 26.2 NaHCO3 and 11 glucose. Picrotoxin (100 μm) was added to block γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission, and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (for EPSCs) or 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (for fEPSPs) (10 μm) was added to block α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalepropionate (AMPA)/kainate receptors. Cells were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made using an Axopatch 1D or a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Electrodes (3.5–5.0 MΩ) contained (in mm): 120 cesium methane sulfonate, 20 HEPES, 0.4 EGTA, 2.8 NaCl, 5 TEA-Cl, 2.5 MgATP, and 0.25 NaGTP (pH 7.2–7.3), buffer at 270–285 mosm. Series resistance (10–30 MΩ) and input resistance were monitored on-line with a 4-mV depolarizing step (50 ms) given just after every afferent stimulus. Recordings from the CA1 region of the hippocampus were obtained with a bipolar stimulating electrode that was placed 100–300 μm rostral to the recording electrode and was used to stimulate excitatory afferents at 0.1 Hz. Neurons were voltage-clamped at +40 mV to evoke NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. At this potential, NMDARs have a maximal open probability, and the Mg2+ block is removed. EPSCs were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5–10 kHz, and collected on-line using Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments). NMDAR example traces were constructed by averaging 20 EPSCs (200 s) elicited at +40 mV during baseline, ethanol application, drug application, or drug application with ethanol. To calculate the decay time (τ), Igor Pro software was used to fit exponential decay curves to averaged NMDAR-mediated EPSCs using the formula: y = A1exp(–invTau1*x) + A2exp(–invTau2X). fEPSPs were recorded using a MutliClamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments) with whole-cell patch pipettes filled with 1 m NaCl and 25 mm HEPES. To evoke fEPSPs, Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents in hippocampal CA1 region were stimulated with 0.1-Hz pulses using steel bipolar microelectrodes at intensities adjusted to produce an evoked response that was 50% of the maximal recorded fEPSP for each recording. fEPSPs were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and collected on-line using with pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments). NMDAR traces were constructed by averaging 6 fEPSPs (1 min) during the whole recordings. Statistical Analysis—For biochemistry experiments, results were obtained from at least three different animals as indicated in the figure legends. For electrophysiology experiments, n values represent the number of individual slices from at least three individual animals as indicated in the figure legends. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (biochemistry) or S.E. (electrophysiology) and were analyzed using a Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by a Newman-Keuls posthoc test. Acute Ethanol Exposure Results in NR2A Subunit Internalization—To investigate whether acute ethanol treatment alters the surface expression of the NMDAR subunits, we utilized the membrane-impermeable cross-linking agent BS3. The cross-linker produces high molecular weight aggregates of the surface receptors that cannot enter the SDS-PAGE gel, and therefore the intracellular pool of receptors can be quantified (22Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Sci. STKE. 2002; 137: PL8Google Scholar). Incubation of hippocampal slices with ethanol (100 mm) did not alter the membranal localization of the NR2B subunit (Fig. 1a, left, lanes 2 versus 4) but led to a significant increase in the intracellular level of NR2A, which was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in surface expression of the subunit (Fig. 1a, right, lanes 2 versus 4). These changes were not due to alteration in the expression level of NR2A (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 versus 3). To confirm that the ethanol-mediated effect on the subcellular localization of the NMDARs is specific for the NR2A subunit, we repeated the cross-linking experiments in mouse L(tk–) cell lines that stably express either the NR2A plus NR1 or NR2B plus NR1 under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter (21Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Atack J.R. Barton C. Cockett W. Cook S.M. Gilbert E. Hutson P.H. McKernan R.M. Myers J. Ragan C.I. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To ensure that the NMDARs were properly compartmentalized, the cells were also transiently transfected with the scaffolding protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). As shown in Fig. 1b, ethanol exposure resulted in an increase in the internalized pool of the NR2A (Fig. 1b, right, lanes 2 versus 4), but not NR2B (Fig. 1b, left, lanes 2 versus 4) subunits. In addition, no change was observed in the surface expression of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR, or the GluR1 subunit of the AMPAR (Fig. 1, c and d, lanes 2 versus 4). Next, we determined whether the ethanol-mediated NR2A internalization could still be detected at lower concentrations of ethanol and whether the effect could be reversed upon ethanol washout. We found that ethanol concentrations as low as 25 mm induced the reduction in the surface expression of the subunit and a corresponding increase in the immunoreactivity of the subunit in the intracellular compartment (Fig. 1e, lanes 2 versus 4 and 6). This change in the subcellular localization of NR2A was not observed after ethanol was treated for 15 min, and then washed out from the slice preparation, and the slices were allowed to recover for an additional 15 min (Fig. 1f, lanes 4 versus 6). Finally, we confirmed our results using another independent method. Following aCSF or ethanol treatment, the slices were treated with the serine protease, chymotrypsin, which is excluded from the interior of the cell due to its large size. Therefore, chymotrypsin cleaves the surface receptors, and only the intracellular pool of receptors is then detected by Western blot analysis (22Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Sci. STKE. 2002; 137: PL8Google Scholar). This method has previously been used to show long-term potentiation-mediated changes in surface expression of the NMDAR subunits (10Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1g (lanes 2 versus 4), we demonstrate that ethanol exposure significantly increased the internalization of the NR2A subunits, however, ethanol had no effect on the surface or intracellular levels of NR2B (data not shown). Taken together, our results show that in hippocampal slice preparation, ethanol treatment results in the specific internalization of the NR2A subunit of the NMDARs. Ethanol Exposure Increases the Association between the NR2A Subunit and the AP-2 Adaptor Protein Complex—The intracellular tails of the NR2 subunits contain internalization motifs that mediate clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis (23Lavezzari G. McCallum J. Lee R. Roche K.W. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine if ethanol exposure potentiates the endocytic pathway to internalize NR2A subunits, we tested whether in the presence of ethanol, the subunit interacts with adaptin β2 (a component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) involved in clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis). Similar to glycine, which was recently shown to prime the receptor for internalization (12Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a, lane 3), exposure to ethanol (100 mm, 15 min) significantly increased the association of adaptin β2 with NR2A and vice versa (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 versus 2). To address the question of specificity of adaptin interaction with the NR2A, we conducted similar studies in the mouse L(tk–) cells that express either the NR1 plus NR2A (Fig. 2b, left) or NR1 plus NR2B (Fig. 2b, right) subunits together with PSD-95. Ethanol treatment resulted in an increase in the association of NR2A with adaptin β2 (Fig. 2b, left, bottom panel), but no change in NR2B-adaptin association was observed (Fig. 2b, right, bottom panel). Finally, to determine if the association with adaptin β2 is specific for an NMDAR subunit, we tested whether ethanol alters the association of adaptin β2 with the AMPAR subunit GluR1, and the brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor subunit TrkB, and found no change in the interaction between these proteins and adaptin β2 (Fig. 2c, middle and low panels). These results suggest that ethanol treatment caused the recruitment of the endocytic machinery to the NMDAR, leading to NR2A endocytosis. Ethanol-mediated Increase in Ras Activity Is Necessary for NR2A Endocytosis—Next, we determined the mechanism for ethanol-mediated NR2A internalization. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of NR2A subunits can lead to the internalization and rundown of NMDAR activity (16Vissel B. Krupp J.J. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and we recently observed that the surface expression of the NR2A but not the NR2B subunit is negatively regulated via the association of the small GTP-binding protein H-Ras with Src kinase, and consequent inhibition of Src activity (17Thornton C. Yaka R. Dinh S. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23823-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both Src and H-Ras are important regulators of NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity (24Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 25Manabe T. Aiba A. Yamada A. Ichise T. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Katsuki M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that, in the presence of ethanol, NR2A is internalized as a result of H-Ras activation and the subsequent inhibition of Src activity that prevents the tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunit. To measure H-Ras activity, we determined the level of GTP-bound active Ras association with the Raf-1-Ras binding domain, in the presence or absence of ethanol. Similar to KCl treatment (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 versus 3), which increases Ras activity, ethanol exposure (100 mm, 15 min) increased Ras-GTP levels by at least 2-fold over the control (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 versus 2), suggesting that ethanol treatment elevates total Ras activity. The Ras activity assay does not differentiate between the Ras family members (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras). However, because in the adult mouse brain, H-Ras expression is two to five times higher than the other isoforms (27Leon J. Guerrero I. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we assume that at least part of the Ras activity detected in the presence of ethanol is that of H-Ras. We reasoned that if H-Ras activity is important for NR2A internalization, then inhibiting H-Ras should prevent the actions of ethanol on NR2A endocytosis. To inhibit H-Ras activity, we transduced the dominant negative form of H-Ras (H-Ras DN) into hippocampal slices using the Tat fusion protein transduction system (28Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The H-Ras DN sequesters the guanine nucleotide exchange factors necessary for Ras activation and thereby inhibits the activation of endogenous Ras (29Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). First, we determined whether Tat-H-Ras DN inhibits the ethanol-mediated increase in endogenous Ras activity. As shown in Fig. 3b (lanes 2 versus 3), preincubation of hippocampal slices with 2 μm Tat-H-Ras DN decreased endogenous Ras activity, but the Tat-peptide (2 μm), which was used as a control, did not (Fig. 3b, lanes 2 versus 4). Next, measured the association of the NR2A subunits to adaptin β2 in the absence or presence of Tat-H-Ras DN. Tat-H-Ras DN alone had no effect on the interaction between NR2A and adaptin β2 or vice versa (Fig. 3c, lane 3); however, Tat-H-Ras DN blocked the ethanol-mediated association of adaptin β2 with NR2A or vice versa (Fig. 3c, lanes 2 versus 4), and ethanol-mediated internalization of the NR2A subunits (Fig. 3d, lanes 4 versus 8). Taken together, these results suggest that the ethanol-mediated activation of H-Ras is required for NR2A internalization.

https://openalex.org/W1986682972,"The regulated oscillation of protein expression is an essential mechanism of cell cycle control. The SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases is involved in this process by targeting cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation by the proteasome, with the F-box subunit of the SCF specifically recruiting a given substrate to the SCF core. Here we identify NIPA (nuclear interaction partner of ALK) as a human F-box-containing protein that defines an SCF-type E3 ligase (SCF(NIPA)) controlling mitotic entry. Assembly of this SCF complex is regulated by cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA, which restricts substrate ubiquitination activity to interphase. We show nuclear cyclin B1 to be a substrate of SCF(NIPA). Inactivation of NIPA by RNAi results in nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1 in interphase, activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity, and premature mitotic entry. Thus, SCF(NIPA)-based ubiquitination may regulate S-phase completion and mitotic entry in the mammalian cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2023911475,"Type I interferons (IFNs) play critical roles in the host defense by modulating the expression of various genes via the IFN-dependent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) transcription factors. Previous studies established that IFNα/β activates NF-κB to promote cell survival through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which involves serine phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. We now describe a second pathway by which IFNs activate NF-κB that is independent of IκB degradation. This pathway involves NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and results in IFNα/β-induced processing of the p100/NF-κB2 precursor into p52. IFNα/β stimulates NF-κB DNA binding and NF-κB-dependent transcription. Whereas expression of NIK and TRAF2 constructs causes NF-κB activation, expression of dominant negative NIK and TRAF2 constructs blocks IFN-promoted NF-κB activation and IFN-stimulated κB-dependent transcription and IFNα/β-induced processing of the p100/NF-κB2 precursor into p52. In contrast, PI3K does not mediate IFNα/β-induced p100 processing, although PI3K is involved in the pathway resulting in IκBα degradation. Moreover, whereas IFN promotes cell survival in lymphoblastoid cells, expression of dominant negative NIK and TRAF2 constructs enhances IFN-induced apoptosis. Our results for the first time place NIK and TRAF2, previously shown to function in TNF signaling, within the IFN signal transduction pathway. Thus, IFN induces NF-κB activation to mediate IFN-dependent cell survival signals through a ""canonical"" pathway of IκBα proteolysis mediated by PI3K/Akt and a ""noncanonical"" pathway of p100 processing mediated by NIK/TRAF."
https://openalex.org/W2057902837,"DNA double strand breaks in mammalian cells are primarily repaired by homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ may either be error-free or mutagenic with deletions or insertions at the joint. Recent studies showed that DNA ends can also be joined via microhomologous sequences flanking the break point especially when proteins responsible for NHEJ, such as Ku, are absent. Microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ) is always accompanied by a deletion that spans one of the two homologous sequences and the intervening sequence, if any. In this study we evaluated several factors affecting the relative contribution of MHEJ to DNA end joining using nuclear extracts and DNA substrates containing 10-bp repeats at the ends. We found that the occurrence of MHEJ is determined by the relative abundance of nuclear proteins. At low DNA/protein ratios, an error-free end-joining mechanism predominated over MHEJ. As the DNA/protein ratio increased, MHEJ became predominant. We show that the nuclear proteins that contribute to the inhibition of the error-prone MHEJ include Ku and histone H1. Treatment of extracts with flap endonuclease 1 antiserum significantly reduced MHEJ. Addition of a 17-bp intervening sequence between the microhomologous sequences significantly reduced the efficiency of MHEJ. Thus, this cell-free assay provides a platform for evaluating factors modulating end joining.

In mammalian cells there are two major pathways for the repair of DSBs, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Homologous recombination repairs DNA DSBs by using an extensively homologous sequence as a DNA template. NHEJ, which is highly efficient in mammalian cells, joins two broken ends without the requirement for extended homology. NHEJ can either be error-free or mutagenic with deletions or insertions at the joint (1Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Proteins known to be involved in NHEJ include the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKCS), Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV (for reviews, see Refs. 1Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar and 2Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The joining of DNA termini by NHEJ is initiated by the binding of the Ku heterodimer and subsequent association with DNA-PKCS (3Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In addition to protecting DNA ends to which it binds, the DNA-PK complex may also facilitate their alignment and ligation by recruiting the XRCC4·ligase IV complex. However, alternative NHEJ processes that are independent of DNA-PKCS·Ku and the DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 complexes have been implicated in mammalian cells (4Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E.

This evidence is indicative of a Ku-independent, error-prone pathway for DSB repair. Analysis of junctions formed in Ku80-deficient cells showed extensive deletions of nucleotides at DNA ends that were likely mediated by microhomology. This microhomology-driven, error-prone end joining also occurred in mammalian cells that are deficient for the other classical NHEJ proteins XRCC4 (7Kabotyanski E.B. Gomelsky L. Han J.O. Stamato T.D. Roth D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5333-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and ligase IV (10Smith J. Riballo E. Kysela B. Baldeyron C. Manolis K. Masson C. Lieber M.R.

Collectively these studies indicate that there exists a separate, microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ) pathway that does not require DNA-PKCS·Ku and DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 complexes as does the classical NHEJ pathway. In addition to these studies using linear DNA substrates, microhomologies were observed at deletion break points at the HPRT gene in primary human fibroblasts (13Morris T. Thacker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1392-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and at the Aprt gene in hamster cells (14Miles C. Meuth M. Mutat.

Tischfield, unpublished observation. after exposure to ionizing radiation, indicating that MHEJ contributes to radiation-induced genomic alterations at endogenous gene loci. Deletions generated via MHEJ are also characteristic of single strand annealing (SSA), an error-prone homologous recombination repair pathway identified for yeast and mammalian cells (15Stark J.M. Pierce A.J. Oh J. Pastink A. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9305-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Sugawara N. Paques F. Colaiacovo M. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Goldfarb T. Studamire B. Alani E. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9315-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). SSA can be preferentially initiated when a DSB lies between two direct repeat sequences. SSA is assumed to proceed by a series of steps including (a) the generation of single strands adjacent to the break and its extension to the repeated sequences such that the complementary strands can anneal to each other, (b) annealing of single strands at homology patches, (c) removal of unpaired flap strands by endo- and/or exonucleases, (d) DNA polymerase-mediated filling in of gaps, and (e) sealing of remaining nicks by a DNA ligase (17Sugawara N. Ira G. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This process results in a deletion of one of the repeats and the sequence between the repeats and thus, like MHEJ, is always mutagenic. Although some components required for SSA have been identified in yeast (18Sugawara N. Goldfarb T. Studamire B. Alani E. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9315-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as well as in mammalian cells (15Stark J.M. Pierce A.J. Oh J. Pastink A. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9305-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether or not MHEJ and SSA are processed by common DNA repair components. It should be noted that whereas longer DNA repeats are used in the studies of SSA, repeats involved in MHEJ are typically a few base pairs in length. Although deficiency of proteins required for classical NHEJ has been shown to shift end joining to MHEJ in mammalian cells, a systematic study of the factors that modulate the choice between the two pathways has been lacking. We postulated that both nuclear proteins and the DNA sequence context in which DSBs arise may dictate the route of their repair. In this study, we developed a cell-free DNA end-joining assay to evaluate the relative contribution of MHEJ to DNA end joining under various conditions. We found that Ku70/80 heterodimer and histone proteins are required for accurate joining of DNA ends and that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) protein is involved in the error-prone MHEJ pathway. The efficiency of MHEJ is also affected by the size of repeats as well as the proximity of repeats. Nuclear Protein Extract Preparation—Human cell line HTD114 (19Shao C. Gupta P.K. Sun Y. Sahota A.

WI38 normal diploid human fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the medullary cavities of femurs with phosphate-buffered saline using a 25-gauge needle. The isolation and culture of mouse primary fibroblast cells has been described elsewhere (20Shao C. Deng L. Henegariu O. Liang L. Raikwar N. Sahota A. Stambrook P.J. Tischfield J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The cells were harvested and washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described by Jessberger and Berg (22Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal.

Nature. 2002; 420: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for the construction of linear end-joining substrates with microhomology at both ends was used with modifications. Briefly the end-joining substrate pUC18PD1/4 was created by ligating oligonucleotides PD1 (5′-AGCTACCATCCTACAGCGCTCG-3′) and PD2 (5′-CTAGCAGCGCTGTAGGATGGT-3′) between the HindIII and XbaI sites of pUC18 (Invitrogen) followed by insertion of oligonucleotides PD3 (5′-GATCGATATCCTACAGCTGG-3′) and PD4 (5′-AATTCCAGCTGTAGGATATC-3′) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. After cleavage with the restriction enzymes Eco47III and EcoRV, the 2.7-kb linear DNA has a 10-bp direct repeat (ATCCTACAGC) at both ends (Fig. 1A). DNA End-joining Assays—Linearized DNA was incubated with nuclear protein extract in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was at 14 °C for 2 h. DNA products were deproteinized, purified, and separated by electrophoresis through 0.6% agarose gels. The intensity of DNA bands was quantified by using a Kodak Gel Logic 100 imaging system and Kodak 1D image analysis software. The efficiency of end joining was calculated as the percentage of end-joined product (dimer and multimers, such as trimer and tetramer) as a fraction of total DNA in the reaction (monomer, dimer, and multimers). All DNA end-joining experiments were repeated at least twice. Experiments with histone H1 protein were carried out by incubation of various amounts of calf thymus histone H1 protein (Roche Applied Science) and nuclear extract with DNA substrate at 14 °C for 2 h. The relative contribution of MHEJ using the 10-bp microhomology was determined by PCR amplification of the junction of rejoined ends followed by XcmI digestion. The sequences of the primers are: forward, 5′-AACCTCTGACACATGCAGCT-3′; and reverse, 5′-TTAATGCAGCTGGCACGACA-3′. Digestion of PCR products (∼600 bp) with XcmI gave rise to a 400- and a 200-bp fragment if the 10-bp microhomology mediated joining of the DNA ends, resulting in an XcmI site (CCAN9TGG) at the junction (Fig. 1A). Restriction fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel. The intensity of the undigested and XcmI-digested fragments was quantified using a Kodak Gel Logic 100 imaging system and Kodak 1D image analysis software. The relative contribution of the 10-bp microhomology-mediated end joining of the DNA substrate was calculated as the percentage of the XcmI-digested fragments of total PCR products (sum of the undigested and XcmI-digested fragments). Sequencing of the Junctions of the End-joined Products—After the gel image was acquired, the XcmI-undigested band was cut from the agarose gel and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified DNA was cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Individual clones were then sequenced on a Beckman CEQ8000 DNA sequencer. Study of the Involvement of FEN1 in MHEJ—Mouse monoclonal antibody against FEN1 was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc. (Littleton, CO). Nuclear extract from mouse bone marrow (1.2 μg of total protein) was incubated for 30 min on ice with dilutions of FEN1 antiserum and then was incubated with 440 ng of linear DNA at 14 °C. After a 1-h incubation, DNA end-joined products were analyzed with agarose gel electrophoresis and PCR. The End-joining Assay—The NHEJ process requires no homology at the DNA ends, and the products formed either are perfectly rejoined or carry deletions and/or insertions at the joints. MHEJ, on the other hand, involves two direct repeats and causes deletions that span one of the two direct repeats and the intervening sequence, if any. In this study we developed a cell-free DNA end-joining assay to evaluate the relative contribution of MHEJ in DNA end joining. Plasmid pUC18PD1/4 DNA was linearized by restriction enzymes so that it had a 10-bp direct repeat at both ends (Fig. 1A). This linearized DNA was then incubated with nuclear protein extracts. The total end-joining activity was reflected by the appearance of linear dimers and multimers that were separated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel (Fig. 1B). Self-circularization was undetectable under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Rejoining catalyzed by MHEJ using the 10-bp repeat generates an XcmI restriction enzyme site at the joint. No other joining reaction can create such a restriction site (Fig. 1A). Following the end-joining reaction, a 600-bp DNA fragment containing the end-joined junction was amplified by PCR using the ligated DNA as templates. As shown in Fig. 1C, digestion of the 600-bp fragment by XcmI resulted in three bands: the 600-bp product from intact DNA and the 400- and 200-bp products from digested DNA (lane 1). Although incubation of nuclear extract and DNA substrate resulted in XcmI digestion (Fig. 1C, lane 1), the 600-bp product derived from in vitro ligation catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase, as expected, was resistant to XcmI digestion (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Thus, the relative intensity of cleaved and uncleaved fragments after XcmI digestion reflects the activity of nuclear extract in catalyzing MHEJ mediated by the 10-bp repeat. Relative Abundance of Nuclear Protein Regulates the Pathways of End Joining—Linearized pUC18PD1/4 DNA was incubated for 2 h at 14 °Cinthe presence of nuclear protein extracts prepared from human HTD114 cells to detect the total end-joining activity. We observed that this DNA end-joining activity was affected by the relative abundance of DNA to total protein extract. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the amount of DNA/protein was 10:20, 10:10, or 50:10 (ng/μg), no dimers or multimers were visible (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). When the DNA/protein amount was 50:1 (ng/μg), ∼36% of the input linear monomer DNA molecules were joined to form linear dimers and multimers (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The emergence of dimers and multimers in the presence of 1 μg, but not 10 μg, of protein with the same amount of substrate DNA (50 ng) suggests that although nuclear proteins were required for DNA end joining, an excessive amount of proteins may have inhibitory effects. Consistent with this notion, when the DNA/protein ratio was increased to 500:1 (ng/μg), more end-joined products were formed (Fig. 2, lane 8, higher intensity of dimers and multimers), although joining efficiency relative to the total substrate DNA was decreased to about 10% (Fig. 2A, lane 8). To determine the relative contribution of MHEJ to the end-joining reactions shown above, we PCR-amplified the ligated DNA products using primers flanking the end-joined junction and subsequently digested the PCR products with XcmI. It should be noted that after PCR amplification we only detected products that had been joined in head-to-tail orientation (600 bp). PCR products in head-to-head or tail-to-tail orientation (400 or 800 bp) were not detected. Products joined in head-to-head and tail-to-tail orientations, if any, may be poor substrates for PCR as they may form “hairpin” structures. With the 10:20 (ng/μg) DNA/protein ratio, we could barely observe the XcmI-digested products (Fig. 2B, lane 1), indicating that the most end-joined products formed were not via MHEJ. With the DNA/protein ratio of 10:10 (ng/μg), end-joined products indicative of MHEJ were visible (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When the DNA/protein ratio was further increased, MHEJ became predominant (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, and 5). Similar results were obtained with nuclear proteins prepared from human WI38 fibroblast cells, mouse primary fibroblast cells, splenic T cells, and bone marrow cells (data not shown). We noted that lower DNA/protein ratios (10:20, 10:10, and 50:10 ng/μg) produced a single sharp XcmI-resistant band (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3), whereas higher DNA/protein ratios (50:1 and 500:1 ng/μg) generated some XcmI-resistant products of smaller sizes that were suggestive of deletions (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). To determine the nature of such end-joined products, we cloned gel-purified XcmI-resistant PCR products into TOPO TA cloning vector and transformed Escherichia coli to produce single clones suitable for sequence analysis. Because each clone was derived from one specific PCR fragment and represented one particular end-joined product, the actual abundance of a junction from the end-joining reaction would be reflected by the frequency of specific sequences detected. As shown in Table I, all eight clones of end-joined products generated at the lower DNA/protein ratio (10:20 ng/μg) had perfect end joining. In contrast, only one of the 12 clones (8%) of end-joined products formed at high DNA/protein ratio (50:1 ng/μg) showed perfect end joining, the others (92%) showed deletions at the end-joined junction, and five of the latter (42%) apparently used microhomology of two or more nucleotides to mediate end joining. Strikingly all products with deletions had a 17-bp sequence (italic letters in Table I), which is identical to the sequence between Eco47III and EcoRV restriction sites in pUC18PD1/4 plasmids and, therefore, were probably derived from incomplete digestion by EcoRV during linearization (Fig. 1A). Still such substrates accounted for only a very small fraction of total DNA substrates. The effect of this 17-bp “cap” on the activity of MHEJ was further studied as described below.Table IError-free and error-prone end joining pathways are modulated by relative abundance of nuclear proteinb The deleted sequences are indicated by capital letters, and the flanking sequences are in lower case.

Direct repeats are underlined. The symbol “▾” denotes the ends of two joined DNA molecules. Italic letters represent the sequence of the fragment that was not removed by EcoRV digestion during the linearization of pUC18PD1/4. Taken together, our data show that when DNA substrates overwhelm nuclear proteins, DNA ends become unprotected and are exposed to exonuclease-mediated degradation. Such ends are more likely to be rejoined through an error-prone end-joining pathway either with or without the involvement of microhomology, both resulting in deletions. A relatively small amount of DNA substrate was probably protected from exonuclease attack by the presence of nuclear proteins and was rejoined by the error-free end-joining pathway. Ku and Histone H1 Inhibit MHEJ—We hypothesized that the protection of DNA ends in our assay may involve the heterodimeric Ku70/80 complex, which has been reported to protect DNA ends from nucleases (25Downs J.A. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). If this notion is true, it can be expected that in the absence of Ku proteins, DNA substrates will be more likely processed by the error-prone MHEJ pathway regardless of the abundance of other nuclear proteins applied. Indeed at lower DNA/protein ratios (10:4 and 50:4 ng/μg) the XcmI-sensitive products were significantly increased in nuclear extracts prepared from Ku70-deficient mouse fibroblast cells as compared with nuclear extracts from Ku70 wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). At 10:4 ng/μg DNA/protein ratio the averages for the percentage ± S.D. of the XcmI-sensitive products were 57 ± 3 and 88 ± 1% in Ku70 wild-type and Ku70-deficient cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). At 50:4 ng/μg DNA/protein ratio the averages were 73 ± 3 and 93 ± 1% in Ku70 wild-type and Ku70-deficient cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). We also observed that histone H1, a linker histone protein that protects DNA from degradation by nucleases (26Brown D.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), inhibits MHEJ at a higher DNA/protein ratio (100:1 ng/μg). As shown in Fig. 4A, the overall end-joining efficiency was significantly decreased from 32 to 4% by addition of 3 μg of histone H1. XcmI digestion of PCR products of joined DNA showed that 3 μg of histone H1 decreased the frequency of the 10-bp-mediated end joining by about 4-fold (26 versus 99% in the control) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, addition of 3 μg of histone H1 suppressed MHEJ by about 32-fold. We sequenced the XcmI-resistant PCR products (Fig. 4, lane 6) to investigate whether histone H1 had influenced the accuracy of end joining. The sequencing data, shown in Table II, revealed that 50% (12 of 24) of such products were from perfect end joining. Because only about 8% (1 of 12) of the XcmI-resistant PCR products were from perfect end joining when histone H1 was not added, even at a lower DNA/protein ratio (50:1 ng/μg) (Table I) the percentage of perfect end joining would presumably be smaller than 8% at the higher DNA/protein ratio (100:1 ng/μg) in the absence of histone H1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the addition of histone H1 suppresses error-prone end joining.Table IIHistone H1 reduces error-prone end joiningTable IIHistone H1 reduces error-prone end joiningb The deleted sequences are indicated by capital letters, and the flanking sequences are in lower case.

FEN1, but Not Mismatch Repair Proteins, Is Required for MHEJ—Single-stranded flaps formed from broken DNA ends were proposed to be the intermediates of MHEJ (27Gottlich B. Reichenberger S. Feldmann E. Pfeiffer P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Such flaps were removed either by exonucleases or by endonucleases such as the structure-specific FEN1 (28Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To determine whether FEN1 contributes to the MHEJ activity, we preincubated 1.2 μg of nuclear protein extract prepared from mouse bone marrow cells with monoclonal antibody raised against mouse FEN1 before initiating the end-joining assay. Although the end-joining efficiency was not significantly reduced by the addition of 1 μg of anti-FEN1 antibody (21 versus 23% in the control), it was reduced by about 4-fold (6 versus 23% in the control) when 4 μg of antibody was added (Fig. 5A). Addition of antibody against mouse exonuclease 1, on the other hand, did not affect the end-joining efficiency (data not shown). XcmI digestion of PCR products of joined DNA showed that the addition of FEN1 antibody reduced the relative activity of MHEJ using the 10-bp repeat by about 2-fold (78 versus 37% in control) (Fig. 5B). Taking into consideration the 4-fold decrease in overall end-joining efficiency, FEN1 antibody caused an 8-fold decrease in MHEJ mediated by the 10-bp repeat, suggesting that FEN1 is required for MHEJ. It has been reported that mismatch repair proteins, such as MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, are required for SSA in yeast (18Sugawara N. Goldfarb T. Studamire B. Alani E. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9315-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine whether they are required for MHEJ in mammalian cells, we performed an end-joining assay with nuclear extracts isolated from MLH1-, MSH3-, or MSH6-deficient mouse primary cells. We found that such nuclear extracts were as efficient as those from wild-type cells in catalyzing MHEJ (data not shown). Thus, mismatch repair proteins are not required for MHEJ. Reduction of MHEJ by Intervening Sequence between Repeats—We envisaged that the process of MHEJ would include formation of single strands at each end and a search for a homologous match between the single strands. Thus, we studied how the proximity of repeat sequences and the length of such a repeat would affect the MHEJ efficiency. We used only Eco47III to obtain linearized pUC18PD1/4, thus leaving a 17-bp cap or spacer next to one of the 10-bp repeats (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 6A, at higher DNA/protein ratio (300:1 ng/μg), the 17-bp spacer reduced the end-joining efficiency"
https://openalex.org/W1995305079,"By yeast two-hybrid screening we have identified interaction partners for the intracellular C-terminal tail of the human and rodent somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5). Interactions with the PDZ domain-containing proteins PIST and PDZK1 are mediated by the PDZ ligand motif at the C terminus of the receptor; in case of the human and mouse (but not the rat) receptors, a slight sequence variation of this motif also allows for binding of the peroxisomal receptor PEX5. PIST is Golgi-associated and retains SSTR5 in the Golgi apparatus when coexpressed with the receptor; PDZK1 on the other hand associates with the SSTR5 at the plasma membrane. Endogenous SSTR5 in the neuroendocrine AtT-20 tumor cell line is colocalized with PIST in the Golgi apparatus. On a functional level, removal of the PDZ ligand motif of the receptor does not interfere with agonist-dependent internalization of the receptor or its targeting to a Golgi-associated compartment; however, recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane after washout of the agonist is inhibited, suggesting that the PDZ-mediated interaction of SSTR5 is required for postendocytic sorting.

In recent years it has been appreciated that the signaling and the subcellular distribution of G-protein-coupled receptors may be influenced by proteins that interact with the intracellular regions of the receptors, most notably the C termini (1Kreienkamp H.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Marin P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Several interactions have been mapped to the membrane proximal domain of the C terminus, including the so-called helix 8, which encompasses the palmitoylation motifs found in most receptors of the rhodopsin-related type I family (3Whistler J.L.

These contacts especially involve proteins that act in the postendocytic, intracellular sorting of multiple receptors, i.e. the sorting nexin SNX1, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor and the G-protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein GASP. A second type of interactions involves the distal C termini of GPCRs, 4The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CFTR; cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PEX5, Peroxin 5.

PDZ domain proteins frequently act as scaffold molecules because of their multiple protein interaction motifs (6Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Thus this type of interaction has the potential to target a receptor to specific subcellular domains and into specific signaling complexes. Interaction of the β1-adrenergic receptor with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, for example, is believed to anchor this receptor at the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses (7Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The interaction of the parathyroid hormone receptor with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor/EBP-50 on the other hand physically links the receptor to phospholipase Cβ, thereby shifting the second messenger response from adenylate cyclase activation to the hydrolysis of phospholipids (8Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We have recently initiated a search for intracellular interaction partners for the various members of the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) family (9Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Schwärzler A. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9557-9562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are five SSTR subtypes in mammalian species, which form a rather homogeneous subfamily within the larger family of GPCRs, as they all preferentially couple to inhibitory, pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and exhibit common intracellular coupling patterns such as inhibition of adenylate cyclase (11Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and activation of GIRK potassium channels (12Kreienkamp H.J. Hönck H.H. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, SSTR1 was detected on the axon terminals of hypothalamic neurons extending to the median eminence (13Helboe L. Stidsen C.E. Moller M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4938-4945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SSTR4 was found on dendrites in hippocampal neurons (14Schreff M. Schulz S. Handel M. Keilhoff G. Braun H. Pereira G. Klutzny M. Schmidt H. Wolf G. Höllt V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3785-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SSTR3 is localized to neuronal cilia in the rodent brain (15Handel M. Schulz S. Stanarius A. Schreff M. Erdtmann-Vourliotis M. Schmidt H. Wolf G. Höllt V. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 909-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The SSTR5 is of particular pharmacological relevance as this receptor subtype regulates growth hormone secretion from the pituitary as well as insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (16Bruns C. Weckbecker G. Raulf F. Lübbert H. Hoyer D. CIBA Found Symp. 1995; 190 (Discussion 101-110): 89-101PubMed Google Scholar, 17Strowski M.Z. Parmar R.M. Blake A.D. Schaeffer J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the AtT20 cell line, a widely used model for the regulation of hormone release by somatostatin, SSTR2 is present at the cell surface whereas SSTR5 is largely confined to the trans-Golgi-network (TGN, Ref. 18Sarret P. Esdaile M.J. McPherson P.S. Schonbrunn A. Kreienkamp H.J. Beaudet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8029-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we identify the PDZ domain proteins PIST and PDZK1 as intracellular binding partners of the SSTR5. Our data indicate that these proteins determine the intracellular sorting of the receptor; in particular, the PDZ-mediated interactions of SSTR5 appear to regulate targeting of the receptor from the Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A cDNA fragment coding for the C-terminal, intracellular domain of the human SSTR5 (amino acids 324–364) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pAS2 vector (BD Biosciences). This bait plasmid was cotransformed together with a pretransformed human brain Matchmaker cDNA library in pACT-2 (BD Biosciences) into the CG1945 yeast strain. Clones growing in the absence of Leu, Trp, and His were picked, and their phenotypes were confirmed by β-galactosidase assay and retransformation. Plasmids from positive candidates were isolated and sequenced. Fusion Proteins and Antibodies—Expression of GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins and purification using glutathione-Sepharose (AP Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were performed as described by the manufacturers. Guinea pig anti-PIST antiserum was generated using a His6-fusion protein of PIST (amino acids 120–455; custom antiserum generation by Biogenes GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The rabbit anti-serum against the C terminus of the rat SSTR5 has been described before (19Stroh T. Kreienkamp H.J. Beaudet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 412: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG and anti-myc were from Sigma, and anti-T7 was from Novagen. Expression Constructs—The mouse SSTR5 cDNA was kindly provided by Wolfgang Meyerhof (Potsdam, Germany). Expression constructs for SSTR5 were generated by cloning PCR fragments coding for the cDNAs of human, rat, and mouse SSTR5 into a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which encodes an N-terminal T7-epitope tag (20Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Meyerhof W. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23769-23774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The full-length coding regions of PIST and PEX5 (Peroxin 5), as well as residues 15–478 of human PDZK1 were cloned into pEGFP-C1. Full-length rat PDZK1 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from rat kidney and expressed as fusion with the myc-epitope tag in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) per culture dish on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged (10 min; 20, 000 × g) to remove insoluble matter. For immunoprecipitation of T7-tagged SSTR5, 20 μl of T7-antibody-Sepharose (Novagen) were added to the supernatant fraction and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After washing, all precipitated complexes were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Pull-down Assays—GST fusions were prepared and left on glutathione beads (10 μg of protein for individual experiment). These beads were incubated with 10 μg of His6-tag fusion protein in 500 μl of TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween) for 2 h at 4°C. Samples were precipitated by centrifugation, and supernatants were removed. After extensive washing of the beads with TBS-T, input, supernatant, and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-His6-antibody. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected HEK293 cells growing on poly-d-lysin-coated glass cover slips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min at room temperature. After blocking (5% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0,1% Triton X-100 in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature cells were incubated with anti-T7 or anti-myc antibodies (diluted 1:5000 in 1% normal goat serum, 0,1% Triton X-100 in TBS) or anti-golgin (diluted 1:500 in 1% normal goat serum, 0,1% Triton X-100 in TBS) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 1 h of incubation with Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in TBS). Immunostaining was visualized by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 410 microscope as described (20Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Meyerhof W. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23769-23774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Nehring R.B. Roosterman D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. AtT20 cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and rinsed thoroughly (2 × phosphate-buffered saline, 2 × TBS, pH 7.4). Subsequent to preincubation for 20 min in blocking buffer (3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS) cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of the primary antibodies diluted in TBS containing 0.5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 (rabbit-anti-SSTR5 1:500, guinea pig anti-PIST 1:1000). Following three rinses in TBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat-anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 488 and goat-anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated to Alexa 594 (both from Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 in TBS. Controls included omission of either one of the primary antibodies and incubation with both secondary antibodies to control for possible cross-reactivities. To assess the effect of stimulation on the interaction of PIST and SSTR5 in the AtT20 cell line, cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, HEPES 20 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1.0% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glucose before stimulation for various periods of time (0–30 min) with the same buffer containing 20 nm d-[Trp8]SRIF prior to fixation and immunostaining as described. After rinsing, the coverslips were mounted using Aquapolymount (Polysciences) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Single optical sections through the region of the nucleus were acquired. Image processing was carried out using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser software and Adobe Photoshop release 6.0. By yeast two-hybrid screening in various cDNA libraries derived from human or rat tissues, we identified three putative interaction partners of the intracellular C-terminal tails of human and rodent SSTR5 (TABLE ONE). PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with Tc10 (PIST, also known as GOPC or CAL; Refs. 21Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a PDZ domain protein that is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, was found to be a potential interaction partner of the human as well as the rat SSTR5. Besides the PDZ domain, PIST consists of two coiled-coil motifs, the second of which is interrupted by a leucine zipper. A deletion analysis demonstrated that the interaction between PIST and SSTR5 is mediated by the PDZ domain (TABLE ONE). We also identified the PDZ domain protein from kidney (PDZK1), a protein with four PDZ domains, which is expressed in kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas (24Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). PDZK1 also interacted with the C termini of both rat and human receptors. The third protein we identified, PEX5, also known as the peroxisomal receptor, does not contain a PDZ domain but contains a set of seven tetratricopeptide repeats. Via these repeats, PEX5 has been shown to identify C-terminal target sequences of proteins destined for sorting into peroxisomes. The consensus sequence for binding to PEX5 is S/C/A-K/R/H-L/M-stop (25Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), which is similar to the consensus sequence for binding of C-terminal sequences to type I PDZ proteins (X-S/T-X-Φ-stop, where Φ is a large and hydrophobic residue; see Ref. 6Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar for review). The sequence comparison in TABLE ONE shows that only the human but not the rat SSTR5 fits to the consensus sequence for PEX5; also the mouse receptor C-terminal should bind PEX5, as the C-terminal residue is leucine in mouse, compared with isoleucine in rat SSTR5. This was confirmed by a pull-down assay with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the mouse SSTR5 C terminus (data not shown). Thus the mouse and human receptors, which conform to the consensus sequence for PEX5 binding, do bind PEX5, whereas the rat receptor does not correspond to the consensus and consequently lacks binding to PEX5. On the other hand, both rat and human receptors bind PIST and PDZK1 in a typical PDZ domain-mediated manner.TABLE ONEIdentification of interaction partners for the SSTR5 C-terminal tail A, baits used for yeast two-hybrid screening.

Targets obtained from the yeast two-hybrid system were tested by retransformation into yeast strain CG1945 using either the empt bait vector (pAS2) or bait vector containing the C-terminal sequences of rat or human SSTR5.

Specific interactions were in all cases confirmed in vitro by pull-down assays using purified fusion proteins. GST fusions of the C terminus of the rat and human SSTR5, as well as GST alone, were prepared and left on the glutathione matrix. Potential interacting partners were prepared as His6-tagged fusions and incubated with the GST matrices. After washing and elution by SDS sample buffer, all three proteins, PIST, PDZK1, and PEX5 (as well as an apparent degradation product of PIST) were detected in the eluate from the human SSTR5-GST matrix but not in the eluate from the control GST matrix (Fig. 1A). In addition, PDZK1 and PIST also bound to the rat SSTR5-GST matrix, whereas the PEX5 did not, further confirming the species-specific interaction of SSTR5 with this protein seen in the yeast two-hybrid system. In the case of PDZK1, we used this pull-down assay to further map the region of PDZK1 that interacts with the SSTR5. For this purpose, constructs coding for parts of PDZK1 were used to express the corresponding His6-tagged fusions and used in the pull-down assay with the human SSTR5-GST fusion. Only those fusion proteins that contained the third PDZ domain were bound by SSTR5-GST in this assay, strongly indicating that interaction between SSTR5 and PDZK1 is mediated by this domain (Fig. 1B). We generated stable HEK-derived cell lines expressing the epitope-tagged mouse SSTR5; these cells, or normal HEK cells, were subsequently transfected with PEX5-EGFP, PDZK1-, or PIST-EGFP (or EGFP as a control) expression vectors. Cells were lysed and, after immunoprecipitation of the receptor from cell lysates using the T7 antibody, precipitates were analyzed for the presence of the receptor and interacting proteins by Western blotting. In all cases, receptor and interacting proteins were detected strongly in precipitates, and precipitation of PEX5, PIST, and PDZK1 was dependent on the presence of the mSSTR5 in transfected cells (Fig. 2, A–C). In the case of PIST, we also analyzed the requirement for the PDZ ligand motif at the C terminus of the receptor by deleting the last eight residues in the expression construct (Fig. 2D). When PIST was coexpressed with this receptor construct in HEK cells, it could no longer be precipitated with the receptor, further confirming that the interaction between SSTR5 and PIST is mediated by a PDZ-type interaction involving the receptor C terminus. Further analysis was devoted to the PDZ domain-containing proteins PDZK1 and PIST only, because their interactions appeared stronger than that of PEX5 (Figs. 1 and 2) and were not limited to the human system. The subcellular distribution of expressed proteins was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. As expected, the receptor was found at the cell surface when expressed alone (Fig. 3A). PIST exhibited a Golgi/TGN-like staining pattern, as has been described before (e.g. Ref. 26Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PDZK1 was found at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A); this is presumably because of the interaction of PDZK1 with membrane-associated protein of 17 kDa (MAP17; Ref. 27Gisler S.M. Pribanic S. Bacic D. Forrer P. Gantenbein A. Sabourin L.A. Tsuji A. Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Biber J. Murer H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1733-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When PIST was transfected into mSSTR5-expressing cells, it was again localized to a Golgi-like structure; however, the distribution of the mSSTR5 changed dramatically, as most of the protein was now found in an intracellular compartment overlapping with the distribution of PIST (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the mSSTR5s receptor, which lacks the PDZ ligand motif, was not affected by PIST coexpression and was found at the cell surface (Fig. 3C). Transfection of a PDZK1 expression plasmid into the mSSTR5-expressing cell line changed neither the distribution of the receptor nor that of the PDZ protein, as both remained colocalized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D). Thus it appears that the presence of PDZ domain proteins influences the subcellular targeting of the receptor. To determine whether these findings were relevant to cells that express endogenous SSTR5, we investigated the localization of SSTR5 and PIST in mouse pituitary AtT20 cells, which express SSTR5 and have been frequently used to study the effects of somatostatin on hormone secretion. Immunolocalization of endogenous SSTR5 using a polyclonal antibody raised against the receptor C terminus showed that SSTR5 is localized in an intracellular compartment, previously identified as the TGN by virtue of its immunostaining for syntaxin-6 (18Sarret P. Esdaile M.J. McPherson P.S. Schonbrunn A. Kreienkamp H.J. Beaudet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8029-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Costaining with the PIST antibody raised in guinea pig showed that a large proportion of the SSTR5 signal overlaps with the fluorescence for PIST, suggesting that both proteins reside and interact in the Golgi/TGN in AtT20 cells (Fig. 4, A–C). We also treated these cells with SST for various periods of time, to see whether SST signaling would affect the distribution of the receptor. However, the localization of SSTR5 immunoreactivity did not change dramatically under these conditions, although some SSTR5-immunoreactive material was visible throughout the cytoplasm after 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 4, D and E). Expression of the truncated mutant mSSTR5s in these cells indicated that the intracellular localization of the endogenous receptor is due to the C-terminal PDZ ligand motif, as the truncated receptor was localized to the plasma membrane, with little or no intracellular staining (Fig. 4F). Finally, to investigate the functionality of the interaction of the receptor with PDZ domain proteins, we examined the effect of PDZ domain deletion on SSTR5 receptor trafficking. It has been widely documented that SSTR5 and many other GPCRs are internalized after prolonged agonist treatment (28Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Nehring R.B. Roosterman D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When HEK cells expressing the mSSTR5 were treated with an agonist for 30 min, almost the entire immunoreactivity for the receptor was redistributed from the plasma membrane into an intracellular location, which could be identified as the Golgi compartment, as it costained with the Golgi-specific marker Golgin-97 (Fig. 5A). Washout of the agonist (including an acid wash procedure to disrupt agonist/receptor interaction) and subsequent incubation in normal medium led to recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane. When this procedure was performed on the mSSTR5s mutant receptor, which lacks the PDZ binding motif, the receptor was similarly internalized into a Golgi-like structure, indicating that the PDZ interaction is not required for internalization. However, the truncated receptor completely lacked the ability to be recycled to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). Stimulation of cells coexpressing PIST led to a similar picture for the wild type mSSTR5, as it was found largely in the Golgi (Fig. 5C, as seen before in the absence of agonist, Fig. 3). In the presence of PDZK1, on the other hand, some internalization of the receptor was observed, but this remained rather incomplete. In cells that showed internalization, PDZK1 did comigrate with the receptor into an intracellular compartment (Fig. 5c). We also analyzed the influence of PIST coexpression on receptor recycling; here it became evident that the overexpressed PIST prevented a complete recycling of the mSSTR5. Thus PIST retains the receptor in the Golgi apparatus independently of its agonist-treated status. All mammalian somatostatin receptor subtypes, with the exception of a splice variant of SSTR2 (29Vanetti M. Kouba M. Wang X. Vogt G. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), contain a potential C-terminal PDZ ligand motif; even the closest known homologs in invertebrates, the Drostar receptors for allatostatin C from Drosophila melanogaster (30Kreienkamp H.J. Larusson H.J. Witte I. Roeder T. Birgül N. Hönck H.H. Harder S. Ellinghausen G. Buck F. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39937-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), do contain such a motif. So far our studies have indicated that all SSTRs differentially interact with C-terminal binding partners, and these interactions may link the receptors to specific subcellular locations and signaling pathways (9Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Schwärzler A. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9557-9562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain motif of SSTR5 from mouse and man is unique as it also conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the peroxisomal receptor PEX5, and this protein has consequently been pulled out in our yeast two-hybrid screen. In fact, analysis of SSTR5 sequences on a peroxisomal targeting data base (see Ref. 31Neuberger G. Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Hartig A. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggests that the human and mouse receptors should be targeted to peroxysomes because of this motif. Although we did detect a physical interaction between SSTR5 and PEX5 in transfected HEK cells, we have not obtained evidence for peroxisomal targeting of SSTR5 in these cells but found the receptor at the plasma membrane instead (data not shown). This suggests that additional factors besides the C-terminal motif are required to target a membrane protein to peroxisomes. On the other hand it may mean that PEX5 participates in so far unknown signaling events. Nevertheless, we have focused our work mainly on the PDZ-type interactions of the SSTR5, which could not only be investigated for human and mouse SSTR5 but also for the rat subtype. Our data demonstrate a quite robust interaction between SSTR5 and the PDZ domains of PIST (which occurs at the level of the Golgi apparatus) and of PDZK1 (which occurs at the plasma membrane). The SSTR5 is in this respect most similar to two regulators of chloride conductance, chloride channel 3b and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), both of which also interact with PIST and PDZK1 through their C-terminal PDZ ligand motifs (26Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, CFTR does also interact with the PDZ domain of Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor (32Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 33Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas the human SSTR5 does not (5Heydorn A. Sondergaard B.P. Ersboll B. Holst B. Nielsen F.C. Haft C.R. Whistler J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54291-54303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chloride channel 3b is found in the Golgi similar to PIST, whereas the CFTR resides at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (e.g. Ref. 26Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the possible role of the PDZ ligand motif is unclear in the case of the CFTR due to conflicting evidence in the literature. The C-terminal interaction may be of pathological importance, as two studies suggested that the lack of the PDZ ligand motif leads to intracellular accumulation and mistargeting of the CFTR, similar to that observed in cystic fibrosis patients (34Moyer B.D. Duhaime M. Shaw C. Denton J. Reynolds D. Karlson K.H. Pfeiffer J. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol.

This was however contradicted by other studies that suggested a role of the PDZ interaction in the regulation of chloride transport activity instead (36Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Benharouga M. Sharma M. So J.

(38Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpressed PIST targets the CFTR for lysosomal degradation. Here we show that the PDZ ligand motif in the C terminus of the SSTR5 determines its intracellular location; the C-terminally truncated receptor is localized at the plasma membrane of AtT-20 cells, unlike its wild type counterpart, which is found mostly in the Golgi apparatus. Golgi localization is specific to the SSTR5, whereas the SSTR2 which is expressed in the same cells (and which does not bind PIST), is found at the plasma membrane under resting conditions (18Sarret P. Esdaile M.J. McPherson P.S. Schonbrunn A. Kreienkamp H.J. Beaudet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8029-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal motif in postendocytic sorting is similar to that of the PIST/PDZK1 binding motif in the CFTR, as lack of this motif leads to a defect in receptor recycling (35Swiatecka-Urban A. Duhaime M. Coutermarsh B. Karlson K.H. Collawn J. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Langford G. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40099-40105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although for CFTR the additional interaction of the C terminus with the Na+exchanger regulatory factor PDZ domain may contribute to recycling to the plasma membrane (as has been observed also for the β2-adrenergic receptor, Ref. 39Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we have no evidence for additional proteins (besides PDZK1 and PIST) binding to the SSTR5 C terminus, suggesting that the relative contributions of PIST and PDZK1 may determine the postendocytotic fate of the receptor. Interestingly, Gage et al. (40Gage R.M. Matveeva E.A. Whiteheart S.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have recently provided evidence that type I PDZ ligands are sufficient to promote rapid recycling of the β2-adrenergic receptor independent of their ability to bind to Na+/H+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor. As we could not detect endogenous PDZK1 in HEK cells (data not shown), we currently favor a model where the receptor is sorted to the Golgi compartment after internalization independently of its PDZ ligand motif. PIST recognizes the endocytosed receptor in the Golgi/TGN and directs its sorting back to the plasma membrane. Via its coiled-coil domain, PIST associates with syntaxin-6, a SNARE protein that is involved in trafficking between endosomes and the TGN and might therefore assist in the proper sorting of membrane proteins such as the SSTR5 (22Charest A. Lane K. McMahon K. Housman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 41Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. J. Biol.

In this respect, PIST might be a general sorting molecule for a wide variety of transmembrane proteins ranging from GPCRs (SSTR5 and the β1-adrenergic receptor; Ref. 43He J. Bellini M. Xu J. Castleberry A.M. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50190-50196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to cell adhesion molecules (44Hassel B. Schreff M. Stübe E.M. Blaich U. Schumacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40136-40143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to ion channels (chloride channel 3b) or their associated proteins such as stargazin (45Cuadra A.E. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Bredt D.S. Chetkovich D.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7491-7502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PDZK1 also recognizes multiple types of membrane proteins. This is in contrast to proteins such as GASP or the β-arrestins, which so far appear to be specifically devoted to the postendocytic sorting of GPCRs only. Rapid recycling of the SSTR5 and targeting to the membrane from intracellular stores has been described previously (46Stroh T. Jackson A.C. Sarret P. Dal Farra C. Vincent J.P. Kreienkamp H.J. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that stimulation of cell surface receptors promotes targeting of reserve receptors from the Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane (46Stroh T. Jackson A.C. Sarret P. Dal Farra C. Vincent J.P. Kreienkamp H.J. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that intracellular sorting events governed by the interactions with PIST and/or PDZK1 may contribute to delivery of receptors to the cell surface “on demand.” One such signal might be transduced by the small GTPase Tc10, which, in its activated form, leads to translocation of PIST to the plasma membrane (47Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3731-3739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We tried to assess whether somatostatin itself might be the signal to bring the SSTR5 to the cell surface in AtT-20 cells, either by activation of SSTR2 or the residual plasma membrane associated SSTR5. Although we did observe only little translocation to the cell surface, further work will be needed to address this, as the presence of SST will immediately lead also to further internalization. Nevertheless we expect that controlled delivery of receptor to the cell surface might have a strong influence on the ability of somatostatin to regulate growth hormone secretion from the pituitary or insulin secretion from the pancreas. We thank Hans-Hinrich Hönck and Agata Blaszczyk-Wewer for excellent technical assistance and Stefan Schumacher (Charite, Berlin) for PIST constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2053369836,"The c-Src tyrosine kinase has been implicated to play an integral role in modulating growth factor receptor, integrin and steroid receptor function. One class of steroid receptors that c-Src modulates is the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). Although there is strong biochemical evidence supporting a role for c-Src in ERalpha signaling, the consequence of this association is unclear at the biological level. To explore the significance of c-Src in ERalpha signaling, we studied the development of various reproductive organs that are dependent on ERalpha in c-Src-deficient mice. We show that the loss of the c-Src tyrosine kinase correlates with defects in ductal development as well as in uterine and ovarian development. Genetic and biochemical analyses of c-Src-deficient mammary epithelial cells also revealed defects in the ability of mammary epithelial cells to activate a number of signaling pathways in response to exogenous estrogen stimulation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that c-Src plays a role in ERalpha signaling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2070280444,"Gene translocations that repress the function of the Runx1 transcription factor play a critical role in the development of myeloid leukemia. In this report, we demonstrate that Runx1 precisely regulates c-fms (CSF-1 receptor) gene expression. Runx1 controlled expression by binding to multiple sites within the mouse c-fms gene, allowing interaction between promoter and downstream enhancer elements. The runx1 and c-fms genes showed an identical pattern of expression in mature macrophages. Runx1 expression was repressed in CSF-1 stimulated, proliferating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and significantly increased in quiescent, CSF-1 starved cells. The RAW264.7 and Mono-Mac-6, macrophage-like cell lines expressed low levels of Runx1 and both showed growth arrest and cell death with ectopic expression of Runx1. The EM-3 cell line, which represents an early myeloid progenitor cell line, showed growth arrest with Runx1 expression in the absence of any detectable changes in cell differentiation. These findings suggest that Runx1 regulates growth and survival of myeloid cells and provide a novel insight into the role of Runx family gene translocations in leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2158127821,"Gap-junctional channels (connexin oligomers) are large-diameter aqueous pores formed by head-to-head association of two gap-junctional hemichannels, one from each of the adjacent cells. Profound hearing loss of genetic origin is common, and mutations of connexin 26 (Cx26) are the most frequent cause of this disorder. The Cx26 R75W mutant has been associated with disruption of cell-to-cell communication and profound hearing loss, but the mechanism of the gap-junctional defect is unknown. Here, we show that Cx26 R75W forms gap-junctional hemichannels that display altered voltage dependency and reduced permeability, and which cannot form functional gap-junctional channels between neighboring cells. The R75W phenotype is dominant at the gap-junction channel but not at the hemichannel level. Therefore, the absence of gap-junctional communication caused by R75W expression is due to defective gap-junction formation by functional hemichannels."
https://openalex.org/W2070961294,"The membrane-anchored MMP-regulator RECK is down regulated in many solid tumors; the extent of RECK down regulation correlates with poor prognosis. Forced expression of RECK in tumor cells results in suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Studies on the roles and the mechanisms of regulation of the RECK gene during normal development may therefore yield important insights into how the malignant behaviors of tumor cells arise and how they can be controlled. Our previous studies indicate that mice lacking RECK die around E10.5 with reduced tissue integrity. In the present study, we have found that in later stage wild-type embryos, RECK is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscles, especially in the areas where the myoblast differentiation factor MRF4 is expressed. Consistent with this finding, the RECK-promoter is activated by MRF4 in cultured cells. In contrast, a myoblast determination factor MyoD suppresses the RECK-promoter. Myoblastic cells lacking RECK expression give rise to myotubes at higher efficiency than the cells expressing RECK, indicating that RECK suppresses myotube formation.

Although this enzyme is essential for biogenesis, and therefore an interesting target for herbicide design, no structural information is available. MGD monomers share sequence similarity with MURG, a bacterial glycosyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of N-acetyl-glucosamine on Lipid 1. Using the x-ray structure of Escherichia coli MURG as a template, we computed a model for the fold of Spinacia oleracea MGD. This structural prediction was supported by site-directed mutagenesis analyses. The predicted monomer architecture is a double Rossmann fold. The binding site for UDP-galactose was predicted in the cleft separating the two Rossmann folds. Two short segments of MGD (〈β2–α2〉 and 〈β6–β7〉 loops) have no counterparts in MURG, and their structure could not be determined. Combining the obtained model with phylogenetic and biochemical information, we collected evidence supporting the 〈β2–α2〉 loop in the N-domain as likely to be involved in diacylglycerol binding. Additionally, the monotopic insertion of MGD in one membrane leaflet of the plastid envelope occurs very likely at the level of hydrophobic amino acids of the N-terminal domain.

Membranes of plant plastids have a unique lipid composition. Whereas phospholipids are the major polar lipids of cellular membranes, plastids contain up to 80% galactosylglycerolipids, i.e. 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(β-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol (called monogalactosyldiacylglycerol or MGDG) 3The abbreviations used are: MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol-sn-glycerol; DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; MGD, MGDG synthase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; UDP-gal, UDP-galactose; MGlcDG, 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol; MGDG, 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(β-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol; MURG, UDP-α-d-(N-acetyl)-glucosamine:N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide)pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol-4β-d-(N-acetyl)-glucosaminyl transferase. and 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol (called digalactosyldiacylglycerol or DGDG) (1Douce R.

Because chloroplast thylakoids constitute the largest membrane surface in photosynthetic plants and algae, galactosylglycerides are considered as the most abundant polar lipids in the biosphere (3Gounaris K.

MGDG is generated by transfer of a β-galactosyl moiety from a water-soluble UDP-α-d-galactose (UDP-Gal) donor onto the sn-3 position of the hydrophobic 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) acceptor (4Ferrari R.A.

This reaction is catalyzed by a UDP-α-d-galactose:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-β-d-galactosyltransferase or MGDG synthase (TABLE ONE).

The Biochemistry of Plant Lipids: Structure and Function. 9. Academic Press, New York1987: 215-274Google Scholar). However, synthesis of MGDG in cyanobacteria is a two-step process (9Feige G.B.

As soon as the first MGDG synthase (csMGD1) was molecularly characterized in cucumber (Cucumis sativa), the search for potential cyanobacterial homologues was conducted (11Shimojima M. Morikawa S. Maeda K. Tohya Y. Miyazawa T. Mikami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, based on the primary sequences, no gene candidate for cyanobacterial galactolipid synthesis could be identified (TABLE ONE). It is possible that the MGDG synthetic machinery is phylogenetically unrelated between cyanobacteria and eukaryotes. The picture is likely more complicated, because the MGDG synthase evolution cannot be fully traced in eukaryotes either. A collection of MGDG synthase (MGD) genes is now well established in Angiosperms, molecularly characterized in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) (12Miège C. Maréchal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) (13Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Planta. 2004; 219: 450-458PubMed Google Scholar). TABLE ONE gives a summary of what is currently known about MGDG synthases and related enzymes involved in glycolipid syntheses. MGD orthologues have been identified in the moss Physcomitrella patens, the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Prototheca wickerhamii, and the red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae. In the case of glaucophytes like Cyanophora paradoxa, whose plastids preserved a cyanobacterial peptidoglycan wall, it is not clear yet if MGDG is synthesized owing to a one-enzyme or a two-enzyme process. In eukaryotes that contain complex plastids inherited from a secondary endosymbiosis (Euglenids, Chlorarachniophytes, Cryptomonads, Haptophytes, Heterokonts, Dinoflagellates, and Apicomplexa) (7Keeling P.J. Archibald J.M. Fast N.M. Palmer J.D. Science. 2004; 306: 2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), MGD orthologues could only be found in a Heterokont, the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. In Euglenids (Euglena gracilis) or Apicomplexans for which we have abundant genomic information (Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii) no MGD candidate gene could be identified using classic bioinformatic tools. Lack of MGD orthologue in these organisms is surprising, because chloroplastic galactolipid syntheses could be assessed in Euglena (15Matson R.S. Fei M. Chang S.B. Plant. Physiol. 1970; 45: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (16Maréchal E. Azzouz N. De Macedo C.S. Block M.A. Feagin J.E. Schwarz R.T. Joyard J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because fold is more conserved than sequence by evolution, three-dimensional structure comparison is a powerful means to establish relatedness of proteins (17Jones D. Thornton J J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), even in the absence of sequence similarity. Some clues to comprehend galactolipid synthesis in cyanobacteria, glaucophytes, euglenids, or apicomplexans might therefore benefit from the knowledge of the molecular structure of Angiosperm MGD. Synthesis of MGDG is a key process for the biogenesis of plastid membranes, particularly for thylakoid expansion (12Miège C. Maréchal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Douce R.

Mol. Life. Sci. 2003; 60: 1591-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis mutants containing half the normal MGDG amount are consistently severely affected, with defects in chloroplast development, impairment of photosynthesis, and an overall chlorotic phenotype. MGDG is the substrate for another essential lipid, DGDG (20Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Benning C. Ohta H. J. Biol.

In addition to plastid membranes, MGDG synthesis is therefore essential for the biogenesis of most cell membranes. Taken together, the roles played by MGDG are vital and imply that MGD enzymes are potent targets for herbicide screening (26Nishiyama Y. Hardré-Liénard H. Miras S. Miège C. Block M.A. Revah F. Joyard J. Maréchal E. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MGD three-dimensional structure would also be an important starting point to dissect the MGD molecular mechanism and orientate the rational design of herbicide candidates. In Angiosperms, MGDG production is restricted to the two membranes of the envelope that surrounds plastids (27Douce R. Science. 1974; 183: 852-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol.

Our current knowledge about MGDG synthase function, structure, and membrane topology is established from the enzymatic activity of purified chloroplast envelope from spinach (30Maréchal E. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 289: 5788-5798Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 31Maréchal E. Miège C. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol.

Takamiya K. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, synthesis of MGDG is catalyzed by a family of three proteins (atMGD1, atMGD2, and atMGD3) of which activity and subcellular targeting to plastid were analyzed in depth (13Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Maréchal E.

Unfortunately, our attempts to crystallize MGD proteins from either of these models, spinach or Arabidopsis, after functional expression in Escherichia coli (26Nishiyama Y. Hardré-Liénard H. Miras S. Miège C. Block M.A. Revah F. Joyard J. Maréchal E. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were unsuccessful. Glycosyltransferases have been hierarchically classified on the basis of sequence similarities and stereochemistry of the reactions (32Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Despite their number and functional diversity, glycosyltransferases fall into two major protein fold superfamilies named GT-A and GT-B, respectively (32Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 33Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This classification is constantly evolving and updated (CAZy classification available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) (34Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 307-308PubMed Google Scholar). From sequence alignments and fold recognition, MGD enzymes are members of the GT-B superfamily. The closest homologues of MGD proteins were found to be MURG glycosyltransferases (11Shimojima M. Morikawa S. Maeda K. Tohya Y. Miyazawa T. Mikami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), with whom they are classified in the GT-28 family of the CAZy systematics. To date the GT-28 family does only contain one three-dimensional structure, i.e. that of E. coli MURG (ecMURG) (35Ha S. Walker D. Shi Y. Walker S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 36Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). MURG catalyzes the last intracellular step in bacterial and cyanobacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, i.e. transfer of an N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl from a UDP-α-d-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) donor onto lipid 1 (TABLE I). For both MGD and MURG activities, a β-glycosyl moiety is transferred from a UDP-α-sugar donor to a hydrophobic acceptor, after an (α→β) inversion of the anomeric configuration of the sugar (TABLE I). It is therefore tempting to suppose that MGD from algae and plants derived from a MURG sequence of the ancestral symbiotic cyanobacteria. Here, we used the ecMURG structure as a template for secondary structure comparison and fold prediction. This approach was combined with enzymological data and phylogenetical comparisons to deduce molecular models for spinach soMGD1 and Arabidopsis atMGD1, atMGD2, and atMGD3, focusing particularly on the active site. The soMGD1 model was then challenged and sustained by site-directed mutagenesis analyses. Materials—Unlabeled and 14C-labeled (11.0 GBq.mmol-1) UDP-Gal were obtained from Sigma and New England Nuclear, respectively. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DAG), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, phosphatidylglycerol, and CHAPS were purchased from Sigma. Wild-type soMGD1 Expression Vector and Site-directed Mutagenesis via PCR—The soMGD1 sequence used in this study was inserted in NdeI-BamHI cloning site of the pET-y3a vector (12Miège C. Maréchal E.

The full-length wild-type (WT) soMGD1 refers to the coding sequence truncated of its predicted chloroplastic transit peptides (12Miège C. Maréchal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), i.e. from leucine 99 to alanine 522. Mutations were introduced into the cloned soMGD1 by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble). Recombinant Wild-type and Mutated soMGD1 Functional Expression in E. coli at 28 °C —Isolated colonies of transfected E. coli (BL21-DE3) were inoculated in LB medium (2.5 ml, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin) and grown at 37 °C. When A600 reached 0.5, the cell suspension was transferred to 15 ml of LB medium (100 μg/ml carbenicillin) and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.5. Cells were then transferred to 400 ml of LB medium (100 μg/ml carbenicillin) and grown until A600 reached 0.5. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was subsequently added to induce soMGD1 expression, and the suspension was incubated at 28 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. Detergent Solubilization of Wild-type and Mutated soMGD1 and Purification by Hydroxyapatite Chromatography —All the operations were carried out at 4 °C.

Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1991; 313: 521-528Google Scholar). The column was washed with 2 ml of buffer A. The matrix-bound soMGD1 wild-type and mutated proteins were eluted with 2 ml of 500 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 in buffer A. Fractions were collected and used for enzymatic assays and protein determination. MGDG Synthase Enzymatic Assay—Enzyme activity was assayed in mixed micelles at 25 °C (30Maréchal E. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol.

The mixture was mixed vigorously and kept 30 min at 25 °C for equilibration of mixed micelles. The reaction was then started by addition of 1 mm UDP-[14C]galactose (37 Bq.μmol-1) and stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The lipids were subsequently extracted (38Bligh E.G.

Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity of the 14C-labeled MGDG ultimately produced was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Activity is expressed in micromoles of incorporated galactose.h-1.mg protein-1. MGD and MURG Sequences—In this study, twelve MGD and eight MURG sequences were used as reference sets for sequence analyses and structure model predictions. Each sequence is given with its accession reference in the source data base. Annotated MGD sequences from representative Angiosperms, i.e. eight in dicots, S. oleracea, soMGD1 (CAB56218); A. thaliana, atMGD1 (BAB12042), atMGD2 (T52269), and atMGD3 (BAB12041); C. sativa, csMGD1 (AAC49624.1), Nicotiana tabacum, ntMGD1 (BAB11980), and Glycine max, gmMGD1 (BAB11979); and two in the monocot O. sativa, osMGD1 (BAD33425) and osMGD2 (XM_481404), were obtained via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, February of 2005). Full-length sequence from the moss P. patens, ppMGD was deduced from clustered expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences (Php_AX155049, Php_dbEST_Id: 10946475_Frame-2 and Php_AX150691_Frame-3) obtained via the Moss Genome Initiative web site (www.leeds.moss.ac.uk, August of 2004). Partial sequence from the green alga C. reinhardtii MGD, crMGD (partial, C_21260001) was obtained via the ChlamyDB website (www.chlamy.org/chlamydb.html). Partial sequence from the non-photosynthetic green alga P. wickerhamii, pwMGD (partial, AAV65358) was obtained via the NCBI website. Annotated MGD sequence from the red alga C. merolae, cmMGD (#3974) was obtained via the Cyanidioschyzon Genome Project web site (merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). The three MGD sequences from the diatom T. pseudonana, tpMGD1 (full-length; Thp_grail.23.172.1 and Thp_newV2.0.genewise.23.85.1), tpMGD2 (partial, Thp_grail. 120.10.1), and tpMGD3 (partial, genewise.89.116.1) were obtained via the DOE Joint Genome Institute (genome.jgi-psf.org/thaps1/thaps1.home.html). The MURG sequences of seven bacteria, i.e. E. coli, ecMURG (CAA38867), Bacillus subtilis, bsMURG (P37585), Mycobacterium avium, maMURG (NP_960831), Vibrio vulnificus, vvMURG (Q7MNV1), Listeria innocua, liMURG (NP_471475), Lactococcus lactis, llMURG (NP_267745), and Bartonella bacilliformis, bbMURG (AAT38530), and one cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, syMURG (NP_442963), were down-loaded from the NCBI web site. These sequences were obtained by BLASTP similarity searches and selected for their representation of prokaryotic phylogenetic diversity. Phylogenetic Reconstruction—MGD and MURG phylogeny was inferred from the 22 sequences described under “Materials and Methods.” Distance between sequences was computed using the TULIP methods (39Bastien O.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Alignment was achieved with the Smith-Waterman method and the BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix, using the Biofacet package from Gene-IT, France (41Codani J.J. Comet J.P. Aude J.C. Glémet E. Wozniak A. Risler J.L. Hénaut A. Slonimski P.P. Methods Microbiol. 1999; 28: 229-244Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We computed estimated z-scores with 2000 sequence shuffling (39Bastien O. Aude J.C.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Tree topology was generated using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (43Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Homology Modeling—Homology modeling of soMGD1 was based on the crystal structure of ecMURG (36Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) using sequence alignment described in this report. α-Helix and β-strand distributions in the MGD sequences were predicted with several secondary structure prediction servers (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/ and www.npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin) (44Kelley L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2090958174,"Differences in the expression of cell surface proteins between a normal prostate epithelial (1542-NP2TX) and a prostate cancer cell line (1542-CP3TX) derived from the same patient were investigated. A combination of affinity chromatographic purification of biotin-tagged surface proteins with mass spectrometry analysis identified 26 integral membrane proteins and 14 peripheral surface proteins. The findings confirm earlier reports of altered expression in prostate cancer for several cell surface proteins, including ALCAM/CD166, the Ephrin type A receptor, EGFR and the prostaglandin F2 receptor regulatory protein. In addition, several novel findings of differential expression were made, including the voltage-dependent anion selective channel proteins Porin 1 and 2, ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) and Scavenger receptor B1. Cell surface protein expression changed both qualitatively and quantitatively when the cells were grown in the presence of either or both interferon INFα and INFγ. Costimulation with type I and II interferons had additive or synergistic effects on the membrane density of several, mainly peripherally attached surface proteins. Concerted upregulation of surface exposed antigens may be of benefit in immuno-adjuvant-based treatment of interferon-responsive prostate cancer. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that differences in the expression of membrane proteins between normal and prostate cancer cells are reproducibly detectable following vectorial labelling with biotin, and that detailed analysis of extracellular-induced surface changes can be achieved by combining surface-specific labelling with high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2014813829,"Maspin is a mammary serine protease inhibitor or serpin with tumor suppressive and antiangiogenic activity that inhibits tumor motility, invasion and metastasis, at least by its actions on cell membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Previous studies documented that the quinazoline-derived alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin affects the attachment and migration of prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of maspin overexpression on the apoptotic/antiadhesion response of prostate cancer cells to doxazosin. The response of maspin-overexpressing clones of human prostate cancer cells DU-145 to doxazosin was evaluated by determining cell viability, apoptosis and cell proliferation on the basis of the trypan blue exclusion assay/methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Hoechst staining and caspase-3 activation, and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor betaRII (TGFbetaRII), Smad4 (a TGFbeta intracellular effector) and bax expression was evaluated at the mRNA and protein level using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The effect of doxazosin on cell attachment of maspin-expressing prostate cancer cells was evaluated on collagen- and fibronectin-coated plates. Cell migration was assessed using the wounding assay. In response to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, DU-145-maspin expressing cells undergo apoptosis, via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerasecleavage and caspase-3 activation. DU-145-maspin cells exhibited higher sensitivity to doxazosin and an earlier temporal activation of caspase-3. The number of apoptotic cells detected in response to doxazosin was significantly higher compared to the neo control (P<0.0001). Doxazosin resulted in dramatic downregulation of the 189 isoform of VEGF in maspin transfectants, while a fivefold induction of Smad4 mRNA expression was detected in those cells after 24 h of treatment. Maspin overexpression in prostate cancer cells resulted in an increased ability to attach to ECM-coated plates, and doxazosin treatment considerably antagonized this effect by decreasing the attachment potential to collagen and fibronectin. The present study supports the ability of maspin to enhance the apoptotic threshold of prostate cancer cells to the quinazoline-based alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin. These findings may have therapeutic significance in the development of antiangiogenic targeting by doxazosin and derivative agents for advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2105792935,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the ligand for two unrelated cellular receptors, TrkA and p75NTR, and acts as a mediator in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system.

In vivo, neurotrophins are secreted as immature progrowth factors, which contain N-terminal propeptides, whose potential function in neurotrophin signaling has been extensively debated recently (for a review, see Ref. 1Ibanez C. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 284-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pro-neurotrophins undergo maturation by cleavage with prohormone convertases, releasing mature neurotrophins with approximate molecular masses of 13 kDa per monomeric unit (for review, see Ref. 2Shooter E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 601-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that are characterized by the cystine knot fold (3McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These mature forms are dimeric in solution (∼26 kDa). Neurotrophins exert their effects on both neural and non-neural cells through interaction(s) with plasma membrane-bound receptors. In this fashion, they promote survival, differentiation, mitosis, and cell death, depending on the nature and context of the targets and their stage in development (4Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). They are also unusual among growth factors in that they interact with and activate two distinct classes of receptors that are structurally unrelated. One group, the receptor-tyrosine kinase family (Trk), which has three distinct genes in higher vertebrates encoding the A, B, and C subforms (as well as products of splice variants), shows considerable ligand selectivity, i.e. TrkA binds NGF with high selectivity whereas TrkB binds BDNF and NT 4/5. In contrast, the second type of receptor, the common (or shared) neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, binds all of the neurotrophins with about equal affinity (∼10-9 m) (5Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Both types of receptor can and do function in the absence of the other, but there are also many observations that suggest their functions may be linked, perhaps by physical interactions (6Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These cross-receptor interactions appear to be particularly important in affecting ligand affinity and in maintaining viability (or not) in peripheral neurons, where extensive programmed cell death is an essential process during development (7Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Although p75NTR was characterized relatively early by cloning methodology (8Chao M.V. Bothwell M.A. Ross A.H. Koprowski H. Lanahan A.A. Buck C.R. Sehgal A. Science. 1986; 232: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Radecke M.J. Misko T.P. Hsu C. Herzenberg L.A. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1987; 325: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), it was several years before the members of the Trk family were shown to be neurotrophin receptors (10Klein R. Jing S.Q. Naduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 11Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In some respects this was unfortunate since the absence of an obvious effector (particularly a kinase moiety) in the p75NTR frustrated the development of any serious understanding of neurotrophin mechanisms for several years. Indeed, when the Trks were finally identified, p75NTR was relegated for some time to a position of minor importance, as a signaling accessory protein (12Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 13Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, a more complete understanding of the signaling potential of the TNFR superfamily (“death domains”) acquired from experiments in both genetics and cell biology led to the identification of genuine signaling responses, e.g. the activation of NFκB (14Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhaeuser N. Boehm-Matthaei R. Baeurle P.E. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), by p75NTR alone and established its role as an important independent receptor in neurotrophin-dependent systems (4Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 7Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 15Sofroniew M.V. Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) (and references cited therein). Although the death domain is apparently the principal initiator site for p75NTR signaling, the intracellular juxtamembrane region has also been implicated in some responses (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Baca M. Shipham K.A. Hulett S.M. Kilpatrick T.J. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30537-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is important to note that p75NTR, both in isolation and when co-expressed with Trks, is also capable of initiating positive signaling pathways, leading to effects as diverse as survival and cellular migration (for reviews, see Refs. 7Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar and 17Mamidipudi V. Wooten M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is now appreciated that p75NTR interacts with a host of proteins, although the significance of all of these interactions is not completely understood (18Rabizadeh S. Bredesen D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent evidence, obtained with TRAF6(-/-) mice (19Yeiser E.C. Rutkoski N.J. Naito A. Inoue J.I. Carter B.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10521-10529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), that TRAF6 is a key entity in the activation of both NFκB and JNK (involved in survival and apoptosis, respectively) underscores the importance of the Trk-independent activities of the common receptor and suggests that the mechanism of TRAF6 activation will be the main apoptotic signaling mechanism of this moiety. The overall organization of human p75NTR is that of a type I transmembrane protein whose protomer contains some ∼400 residues with a single membrane segment (18Rabizadeh S. Bredesen D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ectodomain, which binds the neurotrophins, is characterized by four cystine-rich domains (CRDs) with the one closest to the N terminus having a single putative site of N-linked glycosylation (NX(S/T) consensus) in humans (two in rat). The extracellular juxtamembrane region also contains O-linked glycosylation. The intracellular domain is composed of ∼150 amino acids, the second half of which constitutes the death domain (20Liepinsh E. Ilag L. Otting G. Ibanez C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As observed in other receptor systems (21Tyson D.R. Bradshaw R.A. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 1. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 361-366Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the unliganded receptor occurs as a dimer (22Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23Grob P.M. Ross A.H. Koprowski H. Bothwell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p75NTR binds NGF through interactions with the CRDs of the ectodomain. He and Garcia (24He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have reported the structure of a crystallographic complex of NGF and this portion of the p75NTR (residues 1-161 of the rat protein) that defines two sites of interaction, which utilize the junction regions between CDR1 and 2 (site I) and CDR3 and 4 (site II). This structure, which was prepared with p75NTR expressed in the presence of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation, contains only one p75NTR protomer for each NGF dimer. Here we describe the solution behavior of a human p75NTR protein corresponding to the four CRDs including N-glycosylation at residue 60 (of the unprocessed mature protein) alone and as a binary complex with human NGF. The results demonstrate that the glycosylated p75NTR derivative used in these studies forms a 2:2 complex with a binding constant, determined with the immobilized receptor ectodomain, indistinguishable from that observed for NGF binding to membrane bound p75NTR. These results further suggest that the putative ternary complex of p75NTR, NGF, and TrkA is not formed through ectodomain interactions alone. Cloning and Expression of the p75NTR Ligand Binding Domain—The ligand binding domain of human p75NTR, consisting of four cystine-rich domains, was cloned into a baculovirus vector and expressed as a secreted protein in T. ni cells. The boundaries of the construct are residues 29-190, (bases 201-683 of p75NTR mRNA, NM_002507). The purified soluble p75NTR ligand binding domain is appended with an N-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDKRPL) and a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Further details are under Supplemental Materials. Purification of p75NTR and Measurement of NGF Binding Affinity —Following buffer exchange with a tangential flow concentrator (Cole Palmer), equipped with a 10-kDa MWCO filter unit (Pall), to Tris-HCl, 50 mm, NaCl, 150 mm, imidazole, 25 mm, pH 8, supplemented with Complete Block mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), the protein was purified on a column of Super Flow nickel-NTA (Qiagen) equilibrated with the above buffer. Final elution was with Tris-HCl, 50 mm, NaCl, 150 mm, and imidazole, 500 mm. The ligand binding characteristics of the recombinant p75NTR ectodomain were determined by a scintillation proximity assay (25Nelson N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mouse 2.5 S NGF (Amersham Biosciences) was 125I-iodinated as described elsewhere (26Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M. Hempstead B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyvinyltoluene beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used to immobilize monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 antibodies (Sigma), diluted 1:500. The 125I-NGF was applied at 50 pm in 3% bovine serum albumin, and the receptor concentration was calibrated. Three to five identical wells were set up for each condition, and following a 3-h incubation, were read for 30 s each in a β-particle counter (Wallac). Duplicate experiments were subjected to non-linear regression analyses (Prism, GraphPad). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Ni-NTA affinity-purified p75NTR and rhNGF (courtesy of Genentech, AAA59931) were mixed in Tris-HCl, 50 mm, NaCl, 150 mm, pH 8, concentrated in Vivaspin2 10-kDa MWCO modules (Vivascience), loaded on a Superdex HR 10/30 S200 column (30 × 1 cm, Amersham Biosciences) at +4 °C and eluted isocratically in the same buffer at 0.5 ml/minute. For preparation of samples for mass spectrometry, p75NTR and NGF were added in approximately equimolar amounts, and the fractions corresponding to the p75NTR·NGF complex were isolated and concentrated. For sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and solution x-ray scattering, p75NTR and NGF were mixed at a ∼1:2 ratio to ensure saturation of NGF bound to p75NTR. The column was calibrated with low molecular weight standards (Sigma). Mass Spectrometry—Samples for mass spectrometry were concentrated in Biospin 6 kDa MWCO modules (Bio-Rad) and buffer exchanged to either 200 or 500 mm ammonium acetate at pH 7. Data were collected with either a Q-TOF-2 or an Ultima model mass spectrometer, equipped with Z-spray source (Micromass) and modified for the transmission and isolation of high mass ions (27Lightwahl K. Schwartz B. Smith R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5271Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nano-ESI capillaries were prepared in-house from borosilicate glass tubes of 1 mm OD and 0.78 mm ID (Harvard Apparatus) using a flaming/brown P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments), and gold-coated using an S. E. sputter coater (Polaron). The capillary tips were cut under a stereo microscope to give IDs of 1-5 μm, and typically 2-3 μl of solution was loaded for sampling. The pressures and accelerating potentials in the mass spectrometer were optimized to remove adducts while preserving non-covalent interactions (27Lightwahl K. Schwartz B. Smith R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5271Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). External calibration of the spectra was achieved using solutions of cesium iodide, and the errors for all reported masses are ∼0.1% unless stated otherwise. The mass resolution achieved in Fig. 2 for the intact protein complex is ∼150 (m/Δm). Whereas below the mass resolution value that is typically achieved for pure protein complexes of this size (where none of the constituents of the complexes exhibit a heterogeneous population of masses in solution), it is a factor of 2-3 higher than the maximum predicted mass resolution for a protein complex population derived from the heterogeneous population of p75NTR glycoforms (Fig. 3B). Data acquisition and processing were performed using the MassLynx software (Micromass). All spectra are shown with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction.FIGURE 3A, expanded view of the region between 2100 and 3100 m/z from Fig. 2.

The sample (400 μl) was centrifuged for 180 min at 55,000 rpm in Optima XL-IA instrument (Beckman Coulter) and data collected every 3 min. Interference sedimentation coefficient distributions (c(S) and c(M)) were calculated from the sedimentation velocity data (28Stafford W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) using SEDFIT (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes (Vbar), buffer density and viscosity were calculated by Sednterp (30Laue T. Shaw B. Ridgeway T. Pelletier S. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-120Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements of samples of p75NTR·NGF complex were conducted with concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml and 0.50 mg/ml. Data were collected at two speeds (12,000 and 15,000 rpm) and the shape-independent molecular mass were calculated by Sedphat (31Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R. Rouault T. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at +20 °C. Solution X-ray Scattering—Solution x-ray scattering data were collected at station 2.1 of the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) with sample-to-detector distances of 4.25 m and 1 m using a two-dimensional multiwire gas detector. The final concentrations of the samples were ∼1 mg/ml and 3 mg/ml for the 4.25 m and 1 m distances, respectively. Samples and corresponding buffer solutions were measured at 4 °C as reported previously (32Grossmann J. Hall J. Kanbi L. Hasnain S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3010-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The profiles collected at both camera lengths were merged so as to cover the momentum transfer interval 0.03 Å-1 < q < 0.77 Å-1. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as q = 4π sin Θ/λ, where 2Θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength used (1.54 E). The maximum scattering angle corresponds to a nominal Bragg resolution of ∼8 Å. The radius of gyration, the forward scattering intensity, and the intraparticle distance distribution function p(r) were evaluated with the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (34Semenyuk A. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 22: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Reconstruction of the molecular shape from the scattering profile alone was carried out ab initio with the program Gasbor18 (35Svergun D. Petoukhov M. Koch M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Numerous independent shape restorations were performed using both no symmetry as well as 2-fold symmetry constraints. Only the latter provided highly consistent shape models that are reminiscent of the elongated particle shape suggested by a 2:2 p75NTR·NGF complex. Models of the 1:2 (1sg1.pdb) (24He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and 2:2 complexes (1sg12.pdb and 1bet2.pdb) (modeled based on the crystal structure of the 1:2 complex (24He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) but with a second p75NTR molecule added or on the crystal structure of an isolated NGF dimer (3McDonald N. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) with two attached p75NTR monomers) were used in the theoretical calculation of scattering curves by the program CRYSOL (36Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). The latter takes into account the solvent effect by surrounding the protein with a 3 Å thick hydration layer and fitting its excess average scattering density. The experimental models were superimposed on the modeled 2:2 structure (1sg12.pdb) visually using the program Pymol (DeLano Scientific LLC). Preparation of p75NTR and Measurement of Ligand Binding Affinity— We have expressed the ligand binding (extracellular) domain of the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR extracellular domain (referred hereafter as p75NTR) as a secreted protein in T. ni cells. To study this complex as close as possible to its physiological state, we did not inhibit N-linked glycan formation during the expression. The recombinant p75NTR is secreted from the insect cells using an ecdysone S-glycotransferase signal peptide, rather than the native mammalian signal peptide. A scintillation proximity assay of the ligand binding characteristics of the Ni-NTA purified p75NTR indicates that the recombinant protein binds NGF with an affinity comparable to native in situ systems (Fig. 1A). Based on 13 reports using a variety of methods (37Neet K. Campenot R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the binding constants for p75NTR range from 0.2 to 4 nm, with a mean and median of 1.3 nm and 0.9 nm, respectively. The T. ni expressed p75NTR binds NGF with a Kd of 2.1 × 10-9 m, with an R2 = 0.9885 (Fig. 1A) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.2 × 10-9 to 3.7 × 10-9. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The p75NTR ligand binding domain migrates as a single peak in Sephadex S200 size exclusion medium (Fig. 1B). The observed molecular mass of the major peak approaches 30 kDa, although the unglycosylated protein has a theoretical mass of 19.45 kDa. The extra mass is likely to represent material obtained from N-glycosylation. Also, the overall conformation of the p75NTR ligand binding domain is not globular, but rather elongated and flexible, which renders a direct comparison to globular molecular mass calibration markers arbitrary. NGF elutes at a volume corresponding to ∼10 kDa, which is smaller than expected from its dimeric size (a 26.99-kDa dimer), possibly because of the highly charged nature of this protein (pI ∼9) (Fig. 1B). Analytical ultracentrifugation, however, indicates that the NGF is entirely dimeric under these conditions (see below). Application of approximately equimolar amounts of p75NTR and NGF to size exclusion medium results in a singular peak, which elutes before p75NTR (Fig. 1B). The peak has a shoulder, which appears to overlap with the elution position of p75NTR, implying that an excess of p75NTR is present in this particular mixture. Indeed, adding an approximate 2-fold excess of NGF to the p75NTR sample leads to the disappearance of the shoulder (data not shown). Samples for the measurements of stoichiometry by mass spectrometric methods were prepared by collecting p75NTR-, NGF-, and p75NTR·NGF-containing fractions as shown in Fig. 1B. To reduce any unbound p75NTR in our preparation, p75NTR·NGF complex samples for analytical ultracentrifugation and solution x-ray scattering were treated with an excess of NGF and the complex was isolated by size exclusion chromatography. Mass Spectrometry—Analysis of the intact p75NTR·NGF complex by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry reveals a series of charge states that correspond to a single species with a mass of 68.37 kDa (see Fig. 2) (38Sobott F. Robinson C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine the composition of this species, we carried out a tandem mass spectrometry experiment (collision-induced dissociation or CID), which acts to break the complex ions into highly charged monomer ions and less charged stripped oligomer ions (27Lightwahl K. Schwartz B. Smith R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5271Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 39Jurchen J. Williams E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2817-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The individual subunits of NGF and p75NTR, observed with masses corresponding to 13.27 kDa and 20.92 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2), are consistent with mass spectrometric analysis performed on the protein constituents isolated in solution (data not shown). The stripped complexes, in the high mass region, correspond to complexes with 2:1 (55.10 kDa) and 1:2 (47.45 kDa) p75NTR·NGF stoichiometries, providing supporting evidence of the existence of a 2:2 complex. It is important to note that our data suggest that neither the 2:1, 1:2, nor the monomeric protein is present in solution; rather the ion signals shown in the inset of Fig. 2 are the products of an energetic unimolecular decay reaction carried out in the gas phase, designed to probe the composition of the complex. Indeed, we did not detect 2:1 complexes during the experimental mass spectrometry phase. The data shown in Fig. 2 further indicate the observed mass of 68.37 kDa for the intact protein complex, a value which is significantly higher than expected for an unglycosylated complex formed between p75NTR and NGF (65.89 kDa). A more detailed inspection of the tandem mass spectrometry data, shown in Fig. 3A, reveals further evidence for modification of p75NTR within the protein complex. At least three distinct species can be assigned to monomeric p75NTR observed in the tandem mass spectrum corresponding to proteins having approximate masses of 20.6, 20.7, and 20.9 kDa. Note also that the NGF monomer signal exhibits evidence of modification (bimodal distribution separated by ∼100 Da, noted by an asterisk in Fig. 3A). The source of this apparent chemical modification is currently unclear, as isolated samples of NGF showed no evidence of chemical modification (data not shown); however, this unknown modification apparently does not disrupt the formation of the protein complex. The mass differences observed between the three principal p75NTR species ejected from the protein complex upon collisional activation are suggestive of an N-linked glycosylation series. By comparison, a mass spectrum of p75NTR purified separately in solution (Fig. 3B) gives rise to five distinct species. The three predominate species, separated by ∼160 and 200 Da, respectively, correspond closely to the pattern observed for the +8 charge state of p75NTR ejected from the protein complex. Given the mass of the modification and the similarity between monomeric p75NTR and that ejected from the complex, the results indicate that the predominant glycoforms (labeled II, III, and IV in Fig. 3B) are participating in the p75NTR·NGF complex. Enzymatic digestions followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis indicate that the p75NTR preparation contains both linear and branched glycans consisting of fucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (TABLE ONE). T. ni cells are known to attach these fucosylated paucomannosidic structures (40Rudd P. Downing A. Cadene M. Harvey D. Wormald M. Weir I. Dwek R. Rifkin D. Gleizes P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows the distribution of glycopeptides observed by MALDI-MS after tryptic digestion and carboxymethylation. The data correlate well with the data obtained for the intact glycoprotein and show a remarkably similar distribution of glycoforms when compared with ESI-MS data (Fig. 3B).TABLE ONEAssignments of the molecular ions observed in the MALDI-TOF spectra of glycopeptides and released permethylated N-glycans at Asn60 on p75NTP High-energy CID, using a MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer, was employed to elucidate the structures of the N-glycans. Monosaccharides and linkages are represented by shapes and lines as described by Butler et al. (49Butler M. Quelhas D. Critchley A. Carchon H. Hebestreit H. Hibbert R. Vilarinho L. Teles E. Matthijs G. Schollen E. Argibay P. Harvey D. Dwek R. Jaeken J. Rudd P. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Major structures are highlighted in bold text. The N-linked glycans have compositions consistent with fucosylated paucomannosidic core structures (Fuc1-2Hex2-3HexNAc2) and a structure bearing one short antenna that is composed of HexNAc (Fuc1-2Hex3HexNAc3). The glycoforms labeled II, III, and IV in the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 3C correspond to the most abundant difucosylated structures Hex2HexNAc2Fuc2, Hex3HexNAc2Fuc2, and Hex3HexNAc3Fuc2, respectively. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—To verify the molecular masses of the complex and its components under solution conditions, we have used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analyses of gel-filtered p75NTR, NGF, and the p75NTR·NGF complex. The calculated molecular mass obtained from the sedimentation velocity dat"
https://openalex.org/W2157524851,"Drosophila tumor suppressor WARTS (Wts) is an evolutionally conserved serine / threonine kinase and participates in a signaling complex that regulates both proliferation and apoptosis to ensure the proper size and shape of the fly. Human counterparts of this complex have been found to be frequently downregulated or mutated in cancers. WARTS, a human homolog of Wts, is also known as tumor suppressor and mitotic regulator, but its molecular implications in tumorigenesis are still obscure. Here, we show that WARTS binds via its C-terminus to the PDZ domain of a proapoptotic serine protease Omi / HtrA2. Depletion of WARTS inhibited Omi / HtrA2-mediated cell death, whereas overexpression of WARTS promoted this process. Furthermore, WARTS can enhance the protease activity of Omi / HtrA2 both in vivo and in vitro. Activation of Omi / HtrA2-mediated cell death is thus a potential mechanism for the tumor suppressive activity of WARTS."

Furthermore, the αA subunit (αA-crystallin) of α crystallin is thought to be “lens-specific” as only very low levels of expression were detected in a few non-lenticular tissues. Here we report that human αA-crystallin is expressed in human livers and is regulated by farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) in response to FXR agonists. αA-Crystallin was identified in a microarray screen as one of the most highly induced genes after treatment of HepG2 cells with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064. Northern blot and quantitative real-time PCR analyses confirmed that αA-crystallin expression was induced in HepG2-derived cell lines and human primary hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells in response to either natural or synthetic FXR ligands. Transient transfection studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a functional FXR response element located in intron 1 of the human αA-crystallin gene. Importantly, immunohistochemical staining of human liver sections showed increased αA-crystallin expression in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. As a member of the small heat shock protein family possessing chaperone-like activity, αA-crystallin may be involved in protection of hepatocytes from the toxic effects of high concentrations of bile acids, as would occur in disease states such as cholestasis. α-Crystallins comprise 35% of soluble proteins in the ocular lens and possess chaperone-like functions.

The 20-kDa proteins encoded by the two α-crystallin genes, αA- and αB-crystallin, multimerize with each other to form the ≤800-kDa native high molecular weight lenticular α-crystallins (for review, see Refs. 1Derham B.K.

In contrast, non-ocular expression of αB-crystallin has been observed in a number of tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and lung (7Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 8Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Although the in vivo function and mechanism of action of α-crystallins are not well understood, in vitro studies suggest that they possess chaperone-like properties (9Horwitz J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prevalent hypothesis is that α-crystallins function as molecular chaperones to sequester unfolded proteins in the lens to maintain the refractive power essential for normal lens function (2Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Besides its chaperone activity, α-crystallins have also been shown to possess autokinase activity (11Kantorow M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the significance of this activity is unknown. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that α-crystallins associate with cytoskeletal elements, consistent with a possible structural role for this protein in the lens (13FitzGerald P.G. Graham D.

Mutations in both αA- and αB-crystallin have been linked to cataractogenesis in humans (16Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W. Weleber R.G. Hum. Mol.

Consistent with this finding, αA-crystallin knock-out mice developed mild cataracts at as early as 7-weeks of age, which further progressed into severe lens opacification as a result of formation of inclusion bodies composed mainly of αB-crystallin (20Brady J.P.

Culture media consisted of serum-free Williams' E medium supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium. After overnight culture cells were treated with GW4064, added to the culture medium from a 1000× stock in Me2SO. Control cultures received vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) alone. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after treatment, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using a 7900HT sequence detection system from Applied Biosystems.Primary Culture of Human Hepatic Stellate Cells—Primary human hepatic stellate cells were cultured on 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well.

All membranes were hybridized to a control probe (18 S or 36B4) to correct for small differences in the amount of RNA loaded in each lane. The RNA levels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software; Amersham Biosciences).Western Blot Analysis—HepG2-FXR cells were either untransfected or transfected with expression plasmids encoding FXR and RXR and treated with Me2SO or GW4064 for 24 h before protein isolation. Cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined with the Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fifty micrograms of total protein were loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE mini-gel followed by electrophoresis and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, MA). Anti-αA-crystallin polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution followed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:10,000 dilution.

Human RXRα and human FXRα1 were synthesized from CMX-hRXRα and pSG5-hFXRα1 expression vectors, respectively, using the TNT T7-Coupled Reticulocyte System (Promega). Unprogrammed lysate was prepared using the empty pCMX vector. Binding reactions contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 25 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1-4 μl of each receptor protein. Control incubation received unprogrammed lysate alone. Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Specific activities of end-labeled oligonucleotide probes were determined by scintillation counting. Volumes of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes equivalent to 25,000 cpm were used in each reaction. Reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes and where indicated in the presence of antibodies against RXRα (Santa Cruz, CA). In competition assays, competitor oligonucleotides were added at 50-, 100-, and 250-fold molar excess. Samples were held on ice for another 5 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a pre-electrophoresed 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at -70 °C for 8 h.

The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of UCLA. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining were performed by the core laboratory using standard protocols. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-αA-crystallin polyclonal antibodies against recombinant bovine protein, amino- or carboxyl-terminal peptide, were performed as follows; frozen sections were thawed at room temperature for 30 min, fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at -20 °C, and then air-dried at room temperature for 20 min. Sections were then blocked with hydrogen peroxide (0.3%) to quench endogenous peroxidase activities. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were in turn blocked with 10% normal goat serum (20 min), avidin (15 min), and biotin (15 min) (Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit, Vector laboratories, CA) at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with one of the anti-αA-crystallin antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber and washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline. Secondary antibodies were added for 30 min, and the sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were developed using the VECTORSTAIN ABC peroxidase system and either the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine or the 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrates from Vector Laboratories, counterstained with hematoxylin, and dehydrated, and the slides were mounted in xylene-based mounting medium.RESULTSαA-Crystallin Expression Is Induced in HepG2 Cells and Primary Human Hepatocytes in Response to FXR Ligands—In an attempt to identify target genes that are regulated by FXR, a microarray screen was carried out with RNAs isolated from HepG2 cells that stably express the neomycin resistance gene (HepG2-Neo) or the neomycin resistance gene and rat FXRα2 (HepG2-FXR) (50Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R.

https://openalex.org/W2064360252,"Human retinoblastoma occurs in two forms (familial and sporadic) both due to biallelic mutation of the RB1/p105 gene even if its loss is insufficient for malignancy. We have recently reported that loss of expression of the retinoblastoma-related protein pRb2/p130 correlates with low apoptotic index, suggesting that RB2/p130 gene could be involved in retinoblastoma. Mutational analysis of RB2/p130 in primary tumors showed a tight correlation between Exon 1 mutations and pRb2/p130 expression level in sporadic retinoblastoma. These mutations are located within a CpG-enriched region prone to de novo methylation. Analysis of RB2/p130 methylation status revealed that epigenetic events, most probably consequent to the Exon 1 mutations, determined the observed phenotype. Treatment of Weri-Rb1 cell line by 5-Aza-dC induced an increase in expression level of pRb2/p130, E2F1, p73 and p53. Overall, our results highlight a crucial role of epigenetic events in sporadic retinoblastoma, which opens a perspective for new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2053136253,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is the most commonly mutated gene in benign tumors of the human nervous system such as schwannomas and meningiomas. The NF2 gene encodes a protein called schwannomin or merlin, which is involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation through protein-protein interactions with various cellular proteins. In order to better understand the mechanism by which merlin exerts its function, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed and Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), a downstream molecule of Ras, was identified as a merlin-binding protein. The direct interaction between merlin and RalGDS was confirmed both in vitro and in the NIH3T3 cells. The domain analyses revealed that the broad C-terminal region of merlin (aa 141-595) is necessary for the interaction with the C-terminal Ras-binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS. Functional studies showed that merlin inhibits the RalGDS-induced RalA activation, the colony formation and the cell migration in mammalian cells. These results suggest that merlin can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the RalGDS-mediated oncogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2064397254,"Most cancers arise from the stepwise accumulation of genetic changes. There is also evidence for defects in the machinery and checkpoints for maintenance of normal diploid chromosome complements, resulting in genetic instability that helps fuel the accumulation of mutations that contribute to the development of cancer. The proto-oncogene protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and its regulators including phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase and PTEN, has been shown to play critical roles in the regulation of multiple cellular functions such as transcription, cell survival, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis and cell motility – all of which are important to the malignant process. Here, we report the use of a membrane targeted PKBβ, the activation of which is under the control of a 4-hydroxy-Tamoxifen-responsive estrogen-receptor (ER) ligand binding domain. Induction of PKBβ-ER activity in human kidney epithelial cells (HEK293) resulted in changes in cellular growth, size, and in the appearance of aneuploid cells. Over time, in a PKBβ-dependent manner, cells also underwent extensive multinucleation caused due to a combination of both endomitosis and cell fusion. These findings suggest that chronic activation of PKBβ may contribute to genetic instability and autophagy, properties commonly found in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092434771,"FADD is a key adaptor modulating several signaling pathways such as apoptosis induced by Fas (CD95) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and cell proliferation induced by mitogens. Whereas mutations in Fas disrupt its binding to FADD and cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative (lpr) syndromes, a FADD deficiency blocks embryonic development in mice. To delineate the multifunction of FADD in vivo, we performed functional reconstitution analysis by introducing wild type and mutant FADD into FADD–/– cells or FADD–/– mice lacking the endogenous FADD. An lpr-like FADD mutant, V121N, was reported previously as being defective in Fas binding in vitro. However, we found that in mice V121N can bind to Fas and is functional in signaling apoptosis. Unexpectedly, this lpr-like mutant FADD failed to support mouse development, indicating that the death domain of FADD has an additional function required for embryogenesis, which is independent of that required for receptor-induced apoptosis. Further mutagenesis was targeted at charged residues in the FADD death domain, presumably mediating electrostatic interactions with Fas. We showed that the target binding and apoptosis signaling functions of FADD were not affected when mutations were introduced to a majority of the charged residues. In one exception, replacing arginine 117 with an uncharged residue disrupted target binding and apoptosis signaling, but restoring the positive charge at position 117 failed to reconstitute the FADD function.

FADD contains a DD at the carboxyl terminus, which presumably interacts directly with the DD of Fas. In the TNF-R1 signaling pathway, another DD-containing adaptor protein TRADD is involved, which has been shown to associate with FADD (13Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). A second protein-protein interaction module called the death effector domain (DED) is present at the amino terminus of FADD, which binds to the DED in pro-caspase-8 (FLICE or MACH) (14Boldin M.P.

Activation of the apical caspase-8, upon triggering of the Fas signaling, leads to processing of downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 (16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Fas-induced apoptosis is essential for maintaining lymphoid homeostasis and suppressing autoimmunity (21Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (3972) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Fas gene blocks lymphocyte apoptosis, leading to development of autoimmune lymphoproliferative (lpr) diseases (22Cohen P.L. Eisenberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Some of the mutations resulting in defective signaling were mapped to the DD of Fas, and these lpr mutant Fas proteins are incapable of binding to FADD (11Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z.

Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar), indicating that Fas-FADD interaction is essential for cell death signaling. To understand the physiological function of FADD, we and others previously deleted the FADD gene in mouse germ cells (24Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 25Yeh W.-C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). These FADD-deficient mice die in utero possibly because of heart defects, a phenotype not present in Fas-deficient mice (26Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem cell-derived FADD-deficient primary T cells or FADD-deficient Jurkat T lymphoma cells are resistant to Fas-induced cell death (24Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 27Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies showed that expression of a dominant negative FADD mutant can block TNF-induced cell death and that a FADD deficiency inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death responses (13Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 28Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, FADD appears to be a common signaling adaptor shared by multiple death receptors. The early embryonic lethality phenotype of FADD-deficient mice is intriguing, given that mice lacking Fas, TNF-R1, or TRAIL-R develop normally (26Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 33Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S.

Immunity. 2004; 21: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). No embryonic defects were reported in double mutant mice containing null alleles of both Fas and TNF-R1, besides the accelerated autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (36Zhou T. Edwards III, C.K. Yang P. Wang Z. Bluethmann H. Mountz J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2661-2665PubMed Google Scholar). Whether collective defects in multiple receptor-induced signaling result in a developmental blockage remains to be investigated further. It is possible that FADD has additional functions, independent of apoptosis mechanisms. In a RAG-1–/– blastocyst complementation analysis, FADD deficiency inhibited lymphocyte development (24Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FADD-deficient T cells are defective in both apoptosis induced by Fas as well as proliferation responses induced by mitogens. Therefore, FADD appears to have a dual function in lymphocytes and likely in embryonic cells as well. The diverse function of FADD may be mediated by its selective interaction with various protein partners, including novel ones yet to be identified. Binding of the DD of FADD to the DDs of Fas and TRADD could readily be detected in yeast cells, indicating direct contacts between these proteins during signal transduction in mammalian cells (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar, 11Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Defining the protein interaction motif in FADD and characterization of FADD mutants lacking one function but retaining others could facilitate delineation of the multiple functions of FADD in vivo by generating hypomorphic mutant mice. In NMR spectroscopic studies, the DD of FADD appears to fold into a structure consisting of six antiparallel α-helices (37Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Berglund H. Olerenshaw D. Sankar A. Federwisch M. McDonald N.Q. Driscoll P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous mutational analysis suggested α-helices 2 and 3 as an interface interacting with Fas and TRADD by an electrostatic mechanism (37Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The lpr mutation causes a local conformational change in the DD of Fas, resulting in defective FADD binding ability (39Eberstadt M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and an lpr-like mutant of FADD reportedly fails to bind to Fas or TRADD (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar, 37Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed in vivo functional reconstitution analysis by introducing wild type and mutant forms of FADD into FADD–/– mice or cells lacking the endogenous FADD. We demonstrated that the lpr-like mutant FADD retained normal capability in apoptosis signaling but lost another function essential for embryogenesis. We then performed additional mutagenesis and identified a site in the DD of FADD essential for signal-specific binding to Fas and TRADD and for mediating apoptosis. Therefore, the DD of FADD has a dualistic function that could be dissociated in vivo. Genomic Reconstitution of FADD–/– Mice—The 12-kb EcoRV genomic DNA containing the promoter region, two coding exons, and the intron of the mouse FADD gene was subcloned from a 23-kb genomic DNA inserted in a cosmid clone (12Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This wild type FADD minigene (FADDWT) was previously shown to reconstitute normal embryonic development of FADD–/– mice (40Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using mutant oligonucleotide primers in a PCR. The codon encoding valine 121 was changed to the one encoding an asparagine residue. The resulting FADDV121N mutant and FADDWT minigenes were injected into wild type mouse embryos to produce FADD+/+ FADDV121N or FADD+/+ FADDWT mice. These mice were then crossed with heterozygous FADD knock-out (FADD+/–) mice described previously (24Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The resulting FADD+/– FADDV121N or FADD+/– FADDWT mice were backcrossed with FADD+/– mice. The offspring were genotyped by Southern blots using genomic DNA isolated from tails. In timed pregnancy analysis, female mice at various gestation stages were sacrificed and embryos isolated. Genotyping was performed by Southern blots, using genomic DNA extracted from these embryos. To prepare mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), heads and guts were surgically removed. The rest of the embryonic tissue was incubated in a 0.25 mm trypsin solution for 15 min at 37 °C and passed thorough a 23-gauge needle several times. The resulting cells/tissues were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Thomas Jefferson University. Mutagenesis and Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—Full-length murine FADD cDNA was described previously (12Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and was used as a template in PCR-mediated amplification with mutant oligonucleotide primers. Some of the mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange II kit (Stratagene). The wild type and mutant FADD cDNA was cloned into a MSCV-based CMV-IRES-GFP vector (Provided by Dr. Bill Sha, University of California, Berkeley). Recombinant viruses were packaged by cotransfecting human embryonic kidney 293T cells with pCL-Eco (Imgenix) by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (Promega Profection Mammalian Transfection System). Virus supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection and were used to infect E8.5 FADD–/– MEF cells (32Kuang A.A. Gretche D.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene. The infection was performed by the addition of recombinant virus-containing medium collected from packaging cultures. Cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Infection efficiency was examined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry 48 h after infection. Stable clones expressing GFP were established using limiting dilution and plating in 96-well plates. GFP+ cells were isolated using a high speed cell sorter (Moflo, Cytomation). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation Assays—MEF cells were detached from culture plates by trypsinization and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (20 μg of total proteins) boiled in a standard SDS-containing sample buffer, and proteins resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Yeast cells were pelleted from 1 ml of culture (A600 0.4∼0.8), and resuspended in 50 μl of a lysis buffer containing 5% SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After mixing with 40 μl of glass beads, the yeast cell were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C, and the tubes were vortexed vigorously for 1 min. The cell extracts were then collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and proteins resolved by a 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) that were blocked with nonfat milk (5%) in PBST (2 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 65 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse FADD antibodies previously prepared (12Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in 5% milk and PBST. To probe for caspase-8 in the DISC, monoclonal rat anti-mouse caspase-8 (clone 1G12, Alexis) and secondary anti-rat antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used. The SuperSignal West Pico or Dura chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) was used for detecting immobilized FADD proteins. Stable FADD–/– MEFs infected with the wild type or mutant FADD-containing viruses were detached from culture plates by trypsinization and were resuspended in 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Agonistic monoclonal anti-Fas antibodies (Jo2, Pharmingen) were added (10 μg), followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. These treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugal removal of cell debris, additional anti-Fas antibodies were added (1 μg) to the supernatant, and protein complexes were precipitated using protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) by rotational mixing at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads with protein complex were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in a standard sample buffer for 3 min and fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting using polyclonal anti-FADD antibodies was performed to detect the Fas-associated wild type or mutant FADD proteins. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The full-length wild type or mutant forms of FADD were cloned into pACTII (Clontech), and the intracellular domain of the wild type or lpr mutant Fas or the full-length TRADD was cloned into pAS1-CYH2 (41Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The recombinant pACTII and pAS1-CYH2 plasmids were cotransformed into Y190 yeast cells. Transformants were selected by culturing in minimal medium containing necessary amino acid supplements but without leucine or tryptophan. Target binding of FADD or its mutants was determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activity using X-gal in filter lifting assays or by colorimetric assays using ONPG as a substrate, according to protocols described previously (41Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assays—MEF cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum. After a 10-h incubation at 37 °C (about 70% confluence), cells were treated with 1 μg/ml anti-Fas antibodies in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum. 16 h poststimulation, cell death was determined by propidium iodide uptake assays using a flow cytometer (Coulter EPICS XL) as described previously (12Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For TNF-induced apoptosis, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml mouse recombinant TNF-α (Genzyme Corp.) and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 16 h, and cell death was also determined by propidium iodide uptake assays. An lpr-like Mutation in the DD of FADD Had No Effect on Apoptosis but Disrupted a Function Required for Mouse Embryonic Development—To understand the multifunction of FADD, we initially proposed to separate one function from the others in vivo by generating hypomorphic FADD mutant mice. For this purpose, point mutations could be introduced into FADD to generate mutants that lose some function but retain others. Because mice lacking each of the FADD-dependent death receptors develop normally (26Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 33Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W.

Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 35Diehl G.E. Yue H.H. Hsieh K. Kuang A.A. Ho M. Morici L.A. Lenz L.L. Cado D. Riley L.W. Winoto A. Immunity. 2004; 21: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it is possible that mutations disabling the cell death function of FADD would still allow a partial or complete embryogenesis. The cell death function of both Fas and FADD were investigated previously by site-directed mutagenesis analyses. In one of the lpr mutant mice, a point mutation in the Fas gene results in the replacement of an isoleucine residue at position 225 by an asparagine residue within the intracellular DD of the Fas receptor protein (23Watanabe F.R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This lpr (I225N in the mouse and V238N in the human) mutation results in defective intracellular cell death signal transduction induced by Fas, causing lymphoproliferation diseases. It was demonstrated previously by yeast two-hybrid assays that the wild type, but not the lpr mutant Fas protein, binds directly to FADD (11Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In a sequence similarity comparison, the valine 121 residue within the DD of FADD aligns with the isoleucine 225 residue in the DD of the mouse Fas and valine 238 in the human Fas (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar, 11Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). It was therefore suggested that an lpr-like mutation in FADD, replacing the valine 121 with asparagine (V121N), would disrupt the function of FADD. In one of the previous reports, a full-length V121N mutant of FADD was generated and shown to lack binding to Fas in a mammalian cell transient transfection assay (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). In another report, an in vitro binding assay using a BIAcore was performed, which could not detect binding of V121N mutant of FADD to the Fas DD (37Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially determined the in vivo effect of the V121N mutation of FADD by performing a genomic reconstitution analysis in mice. In a previous study, transgenic expression of a 12-kb wild type FADD minigene restored normal development of the homozygous knock-out FADD–/– mice, which otherwise die around embryonic day 9 (E9) (24Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 40Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U"

https://openalex.org/W1975845217,"A restriction enzyme, MspI, was introduced into cultured human cells as a probe to detect genomic regions susceptible to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A 2 h exposure to MspI at a concentration of 8 U/mul produced DSBs at MspI sites in more than 80% of HeLa cells. The sensitivity to digestion was examined on chromosomal DNAs for the region containing the p16 tumor suppressor gene and two other related genes, p14ARF and p15, by Southern blot hybridization analysis and linker-mediated capture of DNA fragments digested in vivo. DNAs for the promoter regions of the three genes, respectively, were sensitive to MspI digestion in HeLa cells, while DNA for the p16 promoter region was less sensitive in lung cancer cells with hypermethylation of the region. Breakpoints for interstitial 9p21 deletions removing the p16/p14ARF/p15 locus in a variety of human cancers were significantly over-represented in the three sensitive regions. The results suggest that the MspI sensitivity in vivo of each genomic region reflects its susceptibility to DSBs that trigger chromosome aberrations in human cells. This method could help us understand the pathogenic significance of differential susceptibility to DSBs among genomic regions in human carcinogenesis."
