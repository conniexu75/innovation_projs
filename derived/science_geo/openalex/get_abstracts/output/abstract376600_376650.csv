https://openalex.org/W2140206763,"Type-2 immunity, the ancient defence mechanism that provides protection against gastrointestinal helminth infections, involves the recruitment of T helper (TH) cells that produce immune mediators or cytokines to coordinate an immune response involving IgE antibody production, the recruitment of eosinophils and goblet cell hyperplasia. Two groups reporting in this issue have characterized innate type 2 effector leukocyte populations that promote TH2 cytokine responses. Saenz et al. describe multipotent progenitor type-2 (MPPtype2) cells that accumulate in response to the cytokine IL-25 (interleukin-25) and give rise to macrophage or granulocyte lineages promoting TH2 differentiation. Neill et al. describe 'nuocytes', induced by IL25 and IL33, which are the predominant early source of IL13 during a helminth infection. In News & Views, Gérard Eberl discusses how these two papers — and a third in Nature Reviews Immunology ( http://go.nature.com/sJ9D77 ) — influence current thinking on the role of innate immunity. Here, a new type of innate effector leukocyte cell — the nuocyte — is described and characterized. It is shown that interleukin (IL)25 and IL33 drive the expansion of the nuocyte population, that these cells secrete IL13, and that they are required for protection against helminth infection. Innate immunity provides the first line of defence against invading pathogens and provides important cues for the development of adaptive immunity. Type-2 immunity—responsible for protective immune responses to helminth parasites1,2 and the underlying cause of the pathogenesis of allergic asthma3,4—consists of responses dominated by the cardinal type-2 cytokines interleukin (IL)4, IL5 and IL13 (ref. 5). T cells are an important source of these cytokines in adaptive immune responses, but the innate cell sources remain to be comprehensively determined. Here, through the use of novel Il13-eGFP reporter mice, we present the identification and functional characterization of a new innate type-2 immune effector leukocyte that we have named the nuocyte. Nuocytes expand in vivo in response to the type-2-inducing cytokines IL25 and IL33, and represent the predominant early source of IL13 during helminth infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In the combined absence of IL25 and IL33 signalling, nuocytes fail to expand, resulting in a severe defect in worm expulsion that is rescued by the adoptive transfer of in vitro cultured wild-type, but not IL13-deficient, nuocytes. Thus, nuocytes represent a critically important innate effector cell in type-2 immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2008996473,"CD4(+) T helper 2 (T(H)2) cells secrete interleukin (IL)4, IL5 and IL13, and are required for immunity to gastrointestinal helminth infections. However, T(H)2 cells also promote chronic inflammation associated with asthma and allergic disorders. The non-haematopoietic-cell-derived cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL33 and IL25 (also known as IL17E) have been implicated in inducing T(H)2 cell-dependent inflammation at mucosal sites, but how these cytokines influence innate immune responses remains poorly defined. Here we show that IL25, a member of the IL17 cytokine family, promotes the accumulation of a lineage-negative (Lin(-)) multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell population in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses. The IL25-elicited cell population, termed MPP(type2) cells, was defined by the expression of Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a) and intermediate expression of c-Kit (c-Kit(int)), and exhibited multipotent capacity, giving rise to cells of monocyte/macrophage and granulocyte lineages both in vitro and in vivo. Progeny of MPP(type2) cells were competent antigen presenting cells, and adoptive transfer of MPP(type2) cells could promote T(H)2 cytokine responses and confer protective immunity to helminth infection in normally susceptible Il25(-/-) mice. The ability of IL25 to induce the emergence of an MPP(type2) cell population identifies a link between the IL17 cytokine family and extramedullary haematopoiesis, and suggests a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses at mucosal sites."
https://openalex.org/W2005520835,"With the help of massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes, He et al. uncover widespread heterogeneity (heteroplasmy) in the mtDNA of normal human cells and homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations in cancer cells. The frequency of heteroplasmy is shown to vary among tissues of the same individual. Together, these findings provide new insights into the nature and variability of mtDNA sequences and have implications for cancer biomarker development and forensic analysis. Each human cell contains hundreds of copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), making it difficult to characterize mtDNA completely. Here, massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis of mtDNA reveals widespread heterogeneity (heteroplasmy) in the mtDNA of normal human cells, and homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations in cancer cells. The findings provide new insight into the nature and variability of mtDNA sequences, with implications for forensic analysis and the development of biomarkers for cancer. The presence of hundreds of copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in each human cell poses a challenge for the complete characterization of mtDNA genomes by conventional sequencing technologies1. Here we describe digital sequencing of mtDNA genomes with the use of massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis approaches. Although the mtDNA of human cells is considered to be homogeneous, we found widespread heterogeneity (heteroplasmy) in the mtDNA of normal human cells. Moreover, the frequency of heteroplasmic variants varied considerably between different tissues in the same individual. In addition to the variants identified in normal tissues, cancer cells harboured further homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations that could also be detected in patient plasma. These studies provide insights into the nature and variability of mtDNA sequences and have implications for mitochondrial processes during embryogenesis, cancer biomarker development and forensic analysis. In particular, they demonstrate that individual humans are characterized by a complex mixture of related mitochondrial genotypes rather than a single genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2074814691,"The worldwide epidemic of obesity has increased the urgency to develop a deeper understanding of physiological systems related to energy balance and energy storage, including the mechanisms controlling the development of fat cells (adipocytes). The differentiation of committed preadipocytes to adipocytes is controlled by PPARgamma and several other transcription factors, but the molecular basis for preadipocyte determination is not understood. Using a new method for the quantitative analysis of transcriptional components, we identified the zinc-finger protein Zfp423 as a factor enriched in preadipose versus non-preadipose fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of Zfp423 in non-adipogenic NIH 3T3 fibroblasts robustly activates expression of Pparg in undifferentiated cells and permits cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation under permissive conditions. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of Zfp423 expression in 3T3-L1 cells blunts preadipocyte Pparg expression and diminishes the ability of these cells to differentiate. Furthermore, both brown and white adipocyte differentiation is markedly impaired in Zfp423-deficient mouse embryos. Zfp423 regulates Pparg expression, in part, through amplification of the BMP signalling pathway, an effect dependent on the SMAD-binding capacity of Zfp423. This study identifies Zfp423 as a transcriptional regulator of preadipocyte determination."
https://openalex.org/W2086905642,"Plasma membrane-borne pattern recognition receptors, which recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns, provide the first line of defense in innate immunity. In plants, leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases fulfill this role, as exemplified by FLS2 and EFR, the receptors for the microbe-associated molecular patterns flagellin and elongation factor Tu. Here we examined the perception of the damage-associated molecular pattern peptide 1 (AtPep1), an endogenous peptide of Arabidopsis identified earlier and shown to be perceived by the leucine-rich repeat protein kinase PEPR1. Using seedling growth inhibition, elicitation of an oxidative burst and induction of ethylene biosynthesis, we show that wild type plants and the pepr1 and pepr2 mutants, affected in PEPR1 and in its homologue PEPR2, are sensitive to AtPep1, but that the double mutant pepr1/pepr2 is completely insensitive. As a central body of our study, we provide electrophysiological evidence that at the level of the plasma membrane, AtPep1 triggers a receptor-dependent transient depolarization through activation of plasma membrane anion channels, and that this effect is absent in the double mutant pepr1/pepr2. The double mutant also fails to respond to AtPep2 and AtPep3, two distant homologues of AtPep1 on the basis of homology screening, implying that the PEPR1 and PEPR2 are responsible for their perception too. Our findings provide a basic framework to study the biological role of AtPep1-related danger signals and their cognate receptors.

Our findings provide a basic framework to study the biological role of AtPep1-related danger signals and their cognate receptors. In plant immunity, a first line of defense is based on the perception of a group of conserved, pathogen-derived molecules, called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) 4The abbreviations used are: MAMPmicrobe-associated molecular patternFLS2flagellin-sensitive 2EFREF-Tu receptorROSreactive oxygen speciesDAMPdamage-associated molecular patternPEPRPEP receptorBAK1BRI1-associated kinase 1WTwild typeMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTEAtetraethanolamine. by pattern recognition receptors, which cause the expression of defense genes as well as metabolic rearrangements, and ultimately activate basal resistance to potential pathogens (1Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 2Boller T. He S.Y. Science. 2009; 324: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the best studied MAMPs are the bacterial flagellin (active epitope flg22) and elongation factor Tu (active EF-Tu epitopes elf13, elf18, and elf26), which are recognized by their cognate leucine rich repeat-receptor-like kinases FLS2 (flagellin-sensitive 2) and EFR (EF-Tu receptor), respectively (reviewed in Ref. 1Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Perception of these MAMPs leads to a set of responses that can be used to monitor the recognition process, including the triggering of ion fluxes, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulation of ethylene, and finally up-regulation of defense-related genes; investment into increased resistance against bacterial pathogens negatively feeds back on plant growth (3Zipfel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition to these MAMP/pattern recognition receptor systems, another class of surveillance system recognizes plant-derived molecules previously known as “endogenous elicitors” and now as DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns): DAMPs are endogenous molecules that newly appear in the intercellular space in response to the damage caused by a pathogen attack, e.g. cell wall fragments or effectors derived from cytoplasmic proteins (2Boller T. He S.Y. Science. 2009; 324: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 4Ryan C.A. Huffaker A. Yamaguchi Y. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The recent identification of an endogenous peptide elicitor, AtPep1, in Arabidopsis thaliana expanded previous work on systemin signaling in solanaceous plants (5Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14577-14580Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and provided new insights into plant defense systems (4Ryan C.A. Huffaker A. Yamaguchi Y. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Like systemin, AtPep1 is derived from the C terminus of a precursor protein, PROPEP1, the gene of which is strongly induced in response to cell wall degradation, wounding, jasmonate, and ethylene or general elicitor recognition (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A receptor for AtPep1 was purified after photolabeling with its radioactive marked ligand and subsequently cloned (8Yamaguchi Y. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10104-10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), providing the first known DAMP/pattern recognition receptor couple in Arabidopsis. This receptor, termed PEPR1 (PEP receptor 1), like FLS2 and EFR, belongs to the group of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases. Interestingly, the Arabidopsis genome encodes a close homologue of PEPR1 called PEPR2 (4Ryan C.A. Huffaker A. Yamaguchi Y. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and at least 6 genes distantly related to the AtPep1 precursor PROPEP1 (8Yamaguchi Y. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10104-10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar); synthetic peptides representing the C terminus of these homologues, called AtPep2–AtPep6, were found to cause medium alkalinization like AtPep1, and all except AtPep4 competed with AtPep1 binding to the PEPR1 receptor (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). microbe-associated molecular pattern flagellin-sensitive 2 EF-Tu receptor reactive oxygen species damage-associated molecular pattern PEP receptor BRI1-associated kinase 1 wild type 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid tetraethanolamine. Here we examine the nature of DAMP signaling and its interrelationship to the MAMP system. We focus on plasma membrane-delimited responses induced by the activation of the pattern recognition receptors AtPEPR1, identified by Huffaker et al. (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and AtPEPR2 its closest homologue isolated in the context of this study. We demonstrate that AtPep(s) increase cytosolic calcium and activate chloride channels followed by membrane depolarization in a strictly receptor-dependent manner. Thus, together with growth inhibition and enhanced production of ROS and ethylene, the overall response pattern of the plants to AtPep(s) is reminiscent to the response to MAMPs such as flg22 or elf18, although differing in amplitude. Our electrophysiological studies are compatible with the hypothesis that DAMPs and MAMPs, after being recognized through their receptors, lead to the activation of anion and calcium channels. The Arabidopsis plants used in this study were grown as one plant per pot at 20–21 °C with an 8-h photoperiod, or on plates containing MS salts medium (Duchefa), 1% sucrose, and 0.8% agar under continuous light. The T-DNA insertion lines SALK_059281 (pepr1) and SALK_098161 (pepr2) were supplied by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (Nottingham, United Kingdom). As PEPR1 and PEPR2 are encoded on the same chromosome, their double homozygous plants are rare among the T2 progeny. Thus the double mutants were created and obtained by screening a segregating population of crosses of the pepr1 and pepr2 mutant alleles for AtPep1-insensitive offspring. Of 134 T2 seedlings 34 showed partial insensitivity and 4 showed a complete insensitivity to AtPep1. These 4 were genotyped and turned out to be double homozygous mutants for pepr1/pepr2 and all 34 partially insensitive plants were either homozygous for pepr1 or pepr2. Peptides of flg22 (QRLSTGSRINSAKDDAAGLQIA), AtPep1 (ATKVKAKQRGKEKVSSGRPGQHN), AtPep2 (DNKAKSKKRDKEKPSSGRPGQTNSVPNAAIQVYKED), and AtPep3 (EIKARGKNKTKPTPSSGKGGKHN) (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) obtained from EZBiolabs were dissolved in water (stock solutions of 1 mm) and diluted in a solution containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 0.1 m NaCl. For the growth inhibition assay shown in supplemental Fig. S1, flg22 of Xanthomonas axonopodis var. citri, flg22Xac (QRLSSGLRINSAKDDAAGLAIS) was used. Reactive oxygen species released by leaf tissue was assayed by H2O2-dependent luminescence of luminol. Leaf pieces of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants were cut in 2-mm2 pieces and floated overnight in water. One piece per well was transferred into a 96-well plate (LIA White, Greiner Bio-One) containing 1 mg of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and 100 nm luminol (Sigma). Luminescence was measured in a plate reader (MicroLumat LB96P, Berthold Technologies) for 30 min after addition of elicitor. For ethylene measurement leaf material of 4-week-old plants were cut into 1-mm thick stripes and floated overnight in water. Afterward three leaf stripes (20 mg) were transferred in 6-ml glass vials containing 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of the elicitor to be tested. The tubes were closed with a rubber septa and ethylene accumulating in the free air space was measured by gas chromatography (GC-14A Shimadzu) after a 3-h incubation. Seedlings grown for 5 days on MS agar plates were transferred to liquid MS medium supplied with the elicitors indicated (two seedlings per 500 μl of medium in 24-well plates). The effect of treatment with different peptides on seedling growth was analyzed after 10 days by photography, weighing (fresh weight) or measuring the length of the longest root of each seedling. Prior to measurements, the 7–9-week-old A. thaliana (cv. Columbia) rosette leaves were glued to a chamber bottom, peeled off from an abaxial side, and left for recovery for at least 4 h in a standard solution containing (mm): 0.1 KCl; 1 CaCl2; 5 MES adjusted with Tris to pH 6. For impalements, microelectrodes from borosilicate glass capillaries with filament (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) were pulled on a horizontal laser puller (P2000, Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA). They were filled with 300 mm KCl and connected via an Ag/AgCl half-cell to a headstage (1 gigaohm, HS-2A, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). A tip-resistance was about 20–30 megaohm, whereas the input resistance of the headstage was 1013 ohm. The reference electrode was filled with 300 mm KCl as well. An Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used. The cells were impaled by a hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-103, Narashige, Tokyo, Japan). In the course of the experiments, leaves were constantly perfused with 1 ml/min of the standard solution. For stimulation the standard solution was supplemented with 10 nm elicitor and 1 mg/ml of albumin (bovine serum albumin, V fraction, AppliChem). Stimulation was for 5 min. The free running membrane potential was digitalized with the ME-RedLab interface (Meilhaus Electronic, Puchheim, Germany) and recorded on a hard disk. Leaf discs of A. thaliana Col-0 expressing apoequorin were left under complete darkness for 6 h in the standard solution supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine (Synchem, Felsberg/Altenburg, Germany) for reconstitution. Data were acquired using 96-well microplate luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The substances were supplied to the wells via a computer-controlled dispensing system. Each experiment ended up with a discharge by adding 1 m CaCl2 in 10% ethanol. The relative luminescence was determined from the ratio of the actual luminescence per second and the total luminescence was emitted from the probe (9Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Characteristically, exogenously applied MAMP signals such as flg22 and elf18 cause a strong inhibition of seedling growth (3Zipfel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast, Arabidopsis plants expressing the AtPep1 precursor PROPEP1 exhibited increased root and aerial growth compared with wild type plants (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To compare the MAMP and DAMP AtPep1 response directly, we incubated Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings for 10 days in the presence of AtPep1 or flg22. Compared with untreated control plants, seedlings grown in the presence of either flg22 or AtPep1 exhibited pronounced growth retardation (Fig. 1). With respect to fresh weight, flg22 had a stronger effect than AtPep1, whereas AtPep1 inhibited root growth more strongly than flg22 (Fig. 1). In gain of function experiments involving heterologous expression in Nicotiana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase protein AtPEPR1 was clearly demonstrated to act as a receptor for AtPep1 (8Yamaguchi Y. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10104-10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, pepr1 T-DNA insertion mutant plants remained responsive to AtPep1 (Fig. 1). Like WT, pepr1 mutants grown in the presence of AtPep1 exhibited a reduction in seedling fresh weight of about 25–50% when grown in the presence of AtPep1. The reduction of root length was substantial as well, but less pronounced than in WT plants; it was similar to the effect seen in response to flg22 (Fig. 1). These results indicate that Arabidopsis plants have at least one additional PEP receptor. The Arabidopsis genome harbors a close homologue of the PEPR1 that exhibits 72% similarity at the amino acid level (4Ryan C.A. Huffaker A. Yamaguchi Y. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test whether this putative PEP receptor 2 (PEPR2) is involved AtPep1 signaling also, we analyzed the corresponding T-DNA insertion mutant. AtPep1 caused a significant growth inhibition in pepr2 plants, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree than in WT Col-0 and pepr1 mutants (Fig. 2, A and C). Although root growth in Col-0 and pepr1 mutants was inhibited by AtPep1 to the same extent, the roots of pepr2 mutants appeared to be completely insensitive (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that PEPR2 has a predominant role as a receptor for AtPep1 in the roots. To test whether PEPR1 and PEPR2 show functional redundancy we crossed the pepr1 and pepr2 single mutants and searched T2 progeny for the pepr1/pepr2 phenotype. The double mutant was completely insensitive to AtPep1 with respect to overall growth and root length (Fig. 2, A and C). Together, these results show that both, PEPR1 and PEPR2, function redundantly as receptors for AtPep1. In roots, growth inhibition caused via the PEP perception of PEPR2 appears to be dominant. This correlates to a certain extent with published microarray data on gene expression of untreated wild type Arabidopsis plants: as analyzed by Genevestigator 3 (10Hruz T. Laule O. Szabo G. Wessendorp F. Bleuler S. Oertle L. Widmayer P. Gruissem W. Zimmermann P. Adv. Bioinformatics. 2008; 2008 (Article ID 420747)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PEPR2 is particularly highly expressed in the radicle; however, PEPR1 appears to be expressed in roots and radicles as well. One hallmark of the defense response elicited by both MAMPs and DAMPS is the rapid production of ROS (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). When AtPep1 was applied to leaf sections derived from WT Col-0 plants, it elicited ROS generation in a similar way as flg22, although the signal was about 10 times smaller (supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, upon AtPep1 stimulation, a ROS signal was not observed with the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant (Figs. 2D and supplemental S1A). As a control, we examined the response of the plant lines to flg22 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Besides a strong variation between different experiments in the maximal amplitude of ROS generation, the WT, single pepr1, and pepr2 mutants as well as the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant all showed a strong increase in ROS production after a lag phase of about 2 min. As expected, the fls2 mutant was completely insensitive to flg22 (supplemental Fig. S1B). In previous work with MAMPs, we have frequently assayed production of ethylene, because enhanced production of this volatile stress hormone serves a highly reproducible and robust marker for an ongoing defense process. In our standard assay with cut and preincubated Arabidopsis leaves, both single pepr mutants fully responded to AtPep1 treatment to the same extent as WT plants (Fig. 2E). In the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant, however, ethylene production was not enhanced in response to AtPep1, confirming that the double mutant was unable to perceive the DAMP. To investigate the role of AtPep1 in membrane-delimited responses, we studied the electrical properties of the plasma membrane. Peeled leaves of A. thaliana WT (Col-0) were impaled by voltage recording microelectrodes. In the presence of 0.1 mm KCl and 1 mm CaCl2 in the bath solution, the membrane potential of mesophyll cells was around −160 mV. Upon application of the MAMPs flg22 and elf18 (10 nm) as a control, the membrane potential of impaled cells after a lag phase of about 2 min became less negative by about 80–100 mV (Fig. 3A) and returned to the pre-stimulus level within 1–1.5 h (11Jeworutzki E. Roelfsema M.R. Anschütz U. Krol E. Elzenga J.T. Felix G. Boller T. Hedrich R. Becker D. Plant J. 2010; (1, 1210.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04155.x)PubMed Google Scholar). Upon application of 10 nm AtPep1, membrane depolarization was of similar kinetics but significantly smaller amplitude when compared with the one triggered by flg22. Although the pepr1 mutant still responded to AtPep1 (Fig. 3B), the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant showed no change in membrane potential upon AtPep1 stimulation at all, although it was fully sensitive to flg22 and elf18 (Fig. 3C). To examine the DAMP membrane response quantitatively, we prepared dose-response curves for AtPep1-induced membrane depolarizations in wild type and mutant plants (Fig. 3D). In WT plants, the apparent effective concentration EC50 was calculated to be 0.10 nm. Saturation was observed at 10 nm AtPep1, a concentration used in most subsequent experiments. Interestingly, the pepr1 mutant exhibited a significantly reduced EC50 of 0.75 nm. More importantly, the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant did not respond to AtPep1 at any AtPep1 concentration. To examine which ions are required for AtPep-induced membrane depolarizations, we supplemented the extracellular ions in question one by one (Table 1). In the resting state the membrane potential of plant cells is dominated by the conductance of potassium channels and proton pumps (12Ward J.M. Mäser P. Schroeder J.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and both K+ and H+ ions seem to not interfere with membrane-delimited potential changes in response to MAMPs (11Jeworutzki E. Roelfsema M.R. Anschütz U. Krol E. Elzenga J.T. Felix G. Boller T. Hedrich R. Becker D. Plant J. 2010; (1, 1210.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04155.x)PubMed Google Scholar) or DAMPs (Table 1). The cytoplasmic chloride concentration is around 50 mm, whereas the chloride concentration of our standard bath solutions was 1 mm. Under this Cl− gradient we measured resting potentials ranging from −140 to −190 mV, indicating that in the absence of a stimulus, chloride ions did not dominate the membrane potential. Truly, an increase of extracellular chloride concentrations to 50 mm did not affect the resting potential (Fig. 3A, [TEACl]ext = 50 mm). Ca2+ influx and/or Cl− efflux are believed to drive membrane depolarization, thus an increase in their external concentrations should bear opposite effects. Indeed, a simultaneous increase in extracellular concentration of both ions ([CaCl2]ext = 10 mm) did not affect AtPep1-triggered depolarization (Table 1). A strong reduction, however, was observed in the presence of high external chloride concentrations (Fig. 3A and Table 1). This supports the notion that mainly Cl− efflux stands for large and long-lasting membrane potential changes as also observed in the case of flg22 or elf18 as stimuli (11Jeworutzki E. Roelfsema M.R. Anschütz U. Krol E. Elzenga J.T. Felix G. Boller T. Hedrich R. Becker D. Plant J. 2010; (1, 1210.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04155.x)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results are consistent with a Ca2+-dependent activation of Cl− channels.TABLE 1Effect of different ionic compositions of the bath solution on membrane depolarizationBath supplementnaNumber of plants examined.Relative amplitude ± S.D.% control50 mm TEACl526 ± 7bStatistically significant.10 mm CaCl2599 ± 2550 mm K-gluconate, pH 6498 ± 1550 mm K-gluconate, pH 7.1486 ± 29pH 7.1594 ± 15a Number of plants examined.b Statistically significant. Open table in a new tab To test whether Ca2+cyt changes are involved in AtPep1 signaling, we used apoaequorin expressing plants (A. thaliana Col-0) and monitored cytosolic calcium changes following AtPep1 application. In these experiments flg22 was used as a positive control, because the capability of this MAMP to elevate [Ca2+]cyt is well documented (reviewed in Ref. 3Zipfel C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Stimulation of leaf discs with 10–20 nm flg22 or AtPep1 caused a transient rise in [Ca2+]cyt after a lag phase of about 1 min, which reached its peak after 3–5 min (Fig. 4A). In line with the differences in depolarization amplitudes, AtPep1 was considerably less effective in the generation of calcium signals than flg22 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S1). When flg22 and AtPep1 were applied in combination, amplitude of the Ca2+ signal appeared similar to the one elicited by flg22 alone (Fig. 4A), indicating that both stimuli affected the same pathway. As a direct link was postulated between H2O2 elevation and plasmalemma calcium channel activation in response to abiotic (13Pei Z.M. Murata Y. Benning G. Thomine S. Klüsener B. Allen G.J. Grill E. Schroeder J.I. Nature. 2000; 406: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) and biotic challenges (14Klüsener B. Young J.J. Murata Y. Allen G.J. Mori I.C. Hugouvieux V. Schroeder J.I. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2152-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we examined whether the membrane potential changes in response to DAMPs and PAMPs depend on ROS production. Diphenyleneiodonium, a potent inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, slightly reduced the resting potential, but membrane depolarization in response to flg22, elf18, or AtPep1 was not affected (Fig. 4B). Well in line with this observation, Arabidopsis plants lacking both rbohD and rbohF oxidases (15Kwak J.M. Mori I.C. Pei Z.M. Leonhardt N. Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Bloom R.E. Bodde S. Jones J.D.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) showed WT-like membrane depolarization in response to flg22, elf18, or AtPep1 (Fig. 4C). Based on data base searches, five additional homologues of the precursor protein of AtPep1 have been described in the Arabidopsis genome (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides representing their C-terminal parts, termed, AtPep2–AtPep6, are active as DAMPs and cause medium alkalization with cultured Arabidopsis cells (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We found that AtPep1, AtPep2, and AtPep3 were also effective in intact leaves, even in the pepr1 mutant (Fig. 3B and Table 2). In fact, all three peptides tested were indistinguishable in their efficiency to elicit membrane depolarization in wild type plants and pepr1 mutants. Well in line with equivalent competence of AtPep1, AtPep2, and AtPep3 is the fact that AtPep1 pre-treated cells remained desensitized to any AtPep applied. When AtPep1-stimulated cells had re-gained their resting potential after about 1 h, they still were in a “refractory state” to a second AtPep(s) application; responsiveness to AtPep(s) gradually re-appeared in the course of 3 h in WT plants as well as in pepr1 mutants (supplemental Fig. S2A).TABLE 2Membrane depolarization in response to MAMPs and DAMPsTreatmentAmplitude ± S.D.WTpepr1pepr1/pepr2bak1–4mV10 nm AtPep179.1 ± 10.572.0 ± 20.60aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.47.2 ± 12.4aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.(13)(15)(10)(4)10 nm AtPep269.9 ± 14.961.5 ± 19.10aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.45.5 ± 12.5aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.(12)(10)(10)(4)10 nm AtPep371.6 ± 15.157.2 ± 12.8aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.0aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.49.2 ± 15.7aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.(12)(9)(10)(9)10 nm flg2298.0 ± 16.6116.2 ± 21.9aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.117.9 ± 24.2aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.42.7 ± 5.4aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.(12)(17)(6)(4)b4 out of 10 examined (remaining 6 was flg22-insensitive).10 nm elf1879.7 ± 19.897.9 ± 17.2aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.96.8 ± 17.4aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.47.8 ± 15.7aStatistically significant in comparison to WT.(12)(17)(6)(4)a Statistically significant in comparison to WT.b 4 out of 10 examined (remaining 6 was flg22-insensitive). Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the pepr1/pepr2 double mutant was completely insensitive not only to AtPep1, but also to AtPep2 and AtPep3 (see Table 2). Somewhat surprisingly, the pepr1/pepr2 single and double mutant showed a slightly but significantly enhanced depolarization in response to the MAMPs flg22 and elf18, pointing to a possible trade-off between MAMP and DAMP signaling irrespective of addressing different receptors (PEPR1/PEPR2, FLS2, and EFR). The latter issue was corroborated through the experiments showing additivity of MAMP-DAMP-triggered depolarization (supplemental Fig. S2B). More importantly, however, we were able to show that for all AtPep(s) as well as for both MAMPs, BAK1 receptor kinase was indispensable for the full responsiveness (see Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2C). This is in good correspondence with the most recent publication of Schulze et al. (17Schulze B. Mentzel T. Jehle A. Mueller K. Beeler S. Boller T. Felix G. Chinchilla D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 284: 9444-9451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (320) Google Scholar) reporting on BAK1 acting as a general signaling partner for various pattern recognition receptors and may explain here the postulated trade-off between MAMP and DAMP perception systems. Earlier studies observed an increase in root and aerial growth in plants expressing constitutively the AtPep1 precursor PROPEP1, which seems to be in contrast to the effect of AtPep1 on Arabidopsis seedlings observed here (6Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, this contradiction results rather from different experimental approaches, rather than from differences between MAMPs and DAMPs. Meanwhil"

IntroductionSeveral lines of clinical and experimental evidence support a pathogenetic role of α-synuclein in Parkinson disease (PD) 2The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinhsc70heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDaCMAchaperone-mediated autophagyqPCRquantitative PCRThy-1thymus cell antigen 1PKproteinase KPQparaquatPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and other neurodegenerative disorders. The precise mechanisms by which this endogenously expressed protein becomes involved in pathologic processes have yet to be fully elucidated. However, data from both clinical and laboratory studies indicate that enhanced α-synuclein expression is itself capable of triggering a parkinsonian syndrome in humans and PD-like pathology in animal models. Indeed, multiplication mutations of the α-synuclein gene that result in increased expression of the wild-type protein are causally associated with autosomal dominant parkinsonism (1Singleton A.B. Farrer M. Johnson J. Singleton A. Hague S. Kachergus J. Hulihan M. Peuralinna T. Dutra A. Nussbaum R. Lincoln S. Crawley A. Hanson M. Maraganore D. Adler C. Cookson M.R. Muenter M. Baptista M.

Gwinn-Hardy K. Wszolek Z. Dickson D. Langston J.W. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). From the experimental standpoint, evidence of a gain of toxic function of elevated α-synuclein includes the observation of neurodegeneration and neuronal inclusions in the substantia nigra of rats and monkeys that overexpress α-synuclein after viral-mediated neuronal transduction (3Lo Bianco C. Ridet J.L. Schneider B.L. Deglon N. Aebischer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10813-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Eslamboli A. Romero-Ramos M. Burger C. Bjorklund T.

Although α-synuclein clearance is likely to occur through different mechanisms, recent reports have underscored the important contribution of lysosomal pathways of protein degradation and, in particular, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (5Webb J.L.

Vekrellis K. Stefanis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). CMA targets specific cytosolic proteins that are recognized by the heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (hsc70) and, after interacting with the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), are translocated into the lysosomal lumen for rapid degradation (9Massey A.C. Zhang C. Cuervo A.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 73: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of α-synuclein contains a pentapeptide succession consistent with a CMA recognition motif. Experiments in which purified α-synuclein was added to intact lysosomes revealed that this CMA motif is essential for the internalization of α-synuclein into the lysosomal lumen and degradation by lysosomal proteases (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis and CMA activity has been found to decrease α-synuclein clearance in a variety of in vitro systems, including primary neuronal cultures (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).Despite these compelling in vitro data, the relationship between α-synuclein, lysosomes, and CMA remains unexplored in the brain in vivo. It is unknown if, in this setting, α-synuclein is translocated into lysosomes and if enhanced α-synuclein expression is associated with CMA induction and increased lysosomal levels of the protein. In this study, lysosome-α-synuclein interactions were investigated in normal mice as well as in mice in which increased α-synuclein expression was a consequence of either toxic injury or genetic manipulation. Lysosomes were isolated from midbrain tissue because neuronal cells within this region (i.e. dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra) are highly vulnerable to neurodegeneration and α-synuclein pathology in PD. In a first set of experiments, levels of α-synuclein and CMA markers were compared in midbrain lysosomes from control mice versus animals injected with the herbicide paraquat. Paraquat administration was used as a model of enhanced α-synuclein burden because it has previously been shown to induce a marked up-regulation of the protein within nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (10Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Di Monte D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1641-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 11Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Purisai M.G. Bolin L.M. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3095-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a second set of experiments, the association between elevated α-synuclein and CMA induction was assessed in transgenic mice overexpressing α-synuclein. Taken together, results of these studies provide in vivo evidence of lysosomal clearance of α-synuclein that is enhanced under conditions of increased protein burden and is mediated, at least in part, by CMA activation.DISCUSSIONResults of this study provide evidence of lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein in vivo by showing internalization of the protein into lysosomes from the midbrain of control mice and mice injected with paraquat. In the latter, selective injury of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is accompanied by an increased expression of α-synuclein (10Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Di Monte D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1641-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 25McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Of note, levels of intralysosomal α-synuclein were also markedly enhanced after paraquat exposure, suggesting a relationship between cytosolic up-regulation and lysosomal translocation of the protein. One possible explanation for the increased lysosomal α-synuclein after paraquat exposure may be the formation of post-translationally modified forms of the protein resistant to degradation by lysosomal proteases. In particular, formation of oxidized α-synuclein could be hypothesized under our experimental conditions given the pro-oxidant effects of paraquat on nigral dopaminergic neurons (26McCormack A.L. Atienza J.G. Johnston L.C. Andersen J.K. Vu S. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27McCormack A.L. Atienza J.G. Langston J.W. Di Monte D.A. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent report, however, has demonstrated that the rate of lysosomal clearance is not significantly different between unmodified and oxidized α-synuclein, making it unlikely that paraquat would cause a lysosomal accumulation of protease-resistant forms of the protein (7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J. Mosharov E.V. Hodara R. Fredenburg R. Wu D.C. Follenzi A. Dauer W. Przedborski S. Ischiropoulos H. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Cuervo A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 777-788PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that ∼50% of α-synuclein was degraded during a 5-min incubation of lysosomal matrix extracts, regardless of whether they were obtained from control or paraquat-treated mice. Thus, lysosomal accumulation of α-synuclein following treatment with the herbicide cannot simply be explained by reduced clearance capability. Rather, it reflects an increase in lysosomal uptake triggered by the cytosolic buildup of the protein.To elucidate mechanisms involved in the enhanced translocation of α-synuclein into lysosomes after paraquat administration, we assessed changes in lysosomal hsc70 and LAMP-2A as markers of CMA induction. The rationale for investigating the relationship between α-synuclein clearance and CMA in the paraquat model was 2-fold. First, earlier in vitro data are consistent with α-synuclein being a CMA substrate and with CMA playing an important role in preventing neuronal accumulation of the protein (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J. Mosharov E.V. Hodara R. Fredenburg R. Wu D.C. Follenzi A. Dauer W. Przedborski S. Ischiropoulos H. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Cuervo A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 777-788PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vogiatzi T. Xilouri M. Vekrellis K. Stefanis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Second, paraquat administration has previously been shown to upregulate CMA activity in rat liver and cultured fibroblasts (16Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5805-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Our current findings provide evidence in favor of a contribution of CMA to α-synuclein degradation in the midbrain of paraquat-exposed mice. In these animals, higher levels of lysosomal hsc70 and LAMP-2A paralleled the enhanced cytosolic expression and lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein. Moreover, a punctate α-synuclein and LAMP-2A co-immunoreactivity most likely reflected the lysosomal localization of both these proteins within nigral neurons. Finally, binding of α-synuclein to cytosolic hsc70 was augmented in the midbrain of paraquat-treated mice, further supporting a relationship between CMA induction and increased lysosomal clearance of α-synuclein.Quite interestingly, paraquat-induced up-regulation of LAMP-2A was achieved through de novo synthesis, as indicated by the dramatic elevation of LAMP-2A mRNA in the ventral mesencephalon of mice injected with the herbicide. At least two mechanisms have been described to increase LAMP-2A under conditions associated with CMA induction. During nutritional stress, the most extensively studied inducer of CMA, enhanced LAMP-2A results from a decrease in its degradation as well as a relocation of the receptor protein from the lysosomal lumen to the lysosomal membrane (18Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, LAMP-2A changes associated with CMA activation during oxidative stress were found to be caused by an actual increase in LAMP-2A synthesis (22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This latter mechanism could explain our present data: the oxidative damage caused by paraquat administration would induce new synthesis of LAMP-2A as a critical CMA factor involved in the lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein and other toxic/damaged proteins.A causal relationship between intraneuronal α-synuclein levels, CMA induction and enhanced translocation of α-synuclein into lysosomes may be difficult to demonstrate in the in vivo setting. It could be argued that the findings of increased lysosomal α-synuclein and CMA activation in the paraquat model are compatible with but do not necessarily indicate a direct link between these events. In particular, they do not address the issue of whether α-synuclein accumulation is itself a condition leading to CMA induction. To further investigate this possibility, a final set of experiments was carried out in mice in which increased α-synuclein levels resulted from transgenic overexpression of the protein. Data revealed a robust up-regulation of LAMP-2A in the brain of transgenic animals and supported a direct correlation between levels of α-synuclein overexpression and CMA activation. Indeed, the increase in LAMP-2A was greatest in the brain region with the highest α-synuclein level (ventral mesencephalon) and smallest in the area with the lowest protein expression (frontal cortex). CMA induction as a consequence of transgene expression was also indicated by enhanced hsc70 immunoreactivity within nigral neurons laden with α-synuclein.As suggested by earlier studies, the clearance of wild-type or mutated α-synuclein may involve a variety of mechanisms (5Webb J.L.

The present findings do not rule out this possibility but clearly reveal the importance of lysosomal pathways and, in particular, CMA in the neuronal degradation of wild-type α-synuclein in vivo. The observation of CMA induction and enhanced lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein under conditions of increased protein expression (i.e. paraquat-induced up-regulation and transgenic overexpression of α-synuclein) bears significant implications. Both clinical and experimental data suggest that higher levels of neuronal α-synuclein may trigger or predispose to pathologic consequences, including aggregate formation and neurodegeneration (2Farrer M. Kachergus J. Forno L. Lincoln S. Wang D.S. Hulihan M. Maraganore D. Gwinn-Hardy K. Wszolek Z. Dickson D. Langston J.W. Ann.

If so, induction of lysosomal degradation pathways may represent an important mechanism that counteracts α-synuclein-related pathology.

IntroductionSeveral lines of clinical and experimental evidence support a pathogenetic role of α-synuclein in Parkinson disease (PD) 2The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinhsc70heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDaCMAchaperone-mediated autophagyqPCRquantitative PCRThy-1thymus cell antigen 1PKproteinase KPQparaquatPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and other neurodegenerative disorders. The precise mechanisms by which this endogenously expressed protein becomes involved in pathologic processes have yet to be fully elucidated. However, data from both clinical and laboratory studies indicate that enhanced α-synuclein expression is itself capable of triggering a parkinsonian syndrome in humans and PD-like pathology in animal models. Indeed, multiplication mutations of the α-synuclein gene that result in increased expression of the wild-type protein are causally associated with autosomal dominant parkinsonism (1Singleton A.B.

From the experimental standpoint, evidence of a gain of toxic function of elevated α-synuclein includes the observation of neurodegeneration and neuronal inclusions in the substantia nigra of rats and monkeys that overexpress α-synuclein after viral-mediated neuronal transduction (3Lo Bianco C.

Although α-synuclein clearance is likely to occur through different mechanisms, recent reports have underscored the important contribution of lysosomal pathways of protein degradation and, in particular, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (5Webb J.L.

CMA targets specific cytosolic proteins that are recognized by the heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (hsc70) and, after interacting with the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), are translocated into the lysosomal lumen for rapid degradation (9Massey A.C. Zhang C. Cuervo A.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 73: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of α-synuclein contains a pentapeptide succession consistent with a CMA recognition motif.

It is unknown if, in this setting, α-synuclein is translocated into lysosomes and if enhanced α-synuclein expression is associated with CMA induction and increased lysosomal levels of the protein. In this study, lysosome-α-synuclein interactions were investigated in normal mice as well as in mice in which increased α-synuclein expression was a consequence of either toxic injury or genetic manipulation. Lysosomes were isolated from midbrain tissue because neuronal cells within this region (i.e. dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra) are highly vulnerable to neurodegeneration and α-synuclein pathology in PD. In a first set of experiments, levels of α-synuclein and CMA markers were compared in midbrain lysosomes from control mice versus animals injected with the herbicide paraquat. Paraquat administration was used as a model of enhanced α-synuclein burden because it has previously been shown to induce a marked up-regulation of the protein within nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (10Manning-Bog A.B.

Of note, levels of intralysosomal α-synuclein were also markedly enhanced after paraquat exposure, suggesting a relationship between cytosolic up-regulation and lysosomal translocation of the protein. One possible explanation for the increased lysosomal α-synuclein after paraquat exposure may be the formation of post-translationally modified forms of the protein resistant to degradation by lysosomal proteases. In particular, formation of oxidized α-synuclein could be hypothesized under our experimental conditions given the pro-oxidant effects of paraquat on nigral dopaminergic neurons (26McCormack A.L. Atienza J.G. Johnston L.C. Andersen J.K. Vu S. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27McCormack A.L. Atienza J.G. Langston J.W. Di Monte D.A. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent report, however, has demonstrated that the rate of lysosomal clearance is not significantly different between unmodified and oxidized α-synuclein, making it unlikely that paraquat would cause a lysosomal accumulation of protease-resistant forms of the protein (7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J. Mosharov E.V. Hodara R. Fredenburg R. Wu D.C. Follenzi A. Dauer W. Przedborski S. Ischiropoulos H. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Cuervo A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 777-788PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that ∼50% of α-synuclein was degraded during a 5-min incubation of lysosomal matrix extracts, regardless of whether they were obtained from control or paraquat-treated mice. Thus, lysosomal accumulation of α-synuclein following treatment with the herbicide cannot simply be explained by reduced clearance capability. Rather, it reflects an increase in lysosomal uptake triggered by the cytosolic buildup of the protein.To elucidate mechanisms involved in the enhanced translocation of α-synuclein into lysosomes after paraquat administration, we assessed changes in lysosomal hsc70 and LAMP-2A as markers of CMA induction. The rationale for investigating the relationship between α-synuclein clearance and CMA in the paraquat model was 2-fold. First, earlier in vitro data are consistent with α-synuclein being a CMA substrate and with CMA playing an important role in preventing neuronal accumulation of the protein (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J. Mosharov E.V.

Xilouri M. Vekrellis K. Stefanis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Second, paraquat administration has previously been shown to upregulate CMA activity in rat liver and cultured fibroblasts (16Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5805-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Our current findings provide evidence in favor of a contribution of CMA to α-synuclein degradation in the midbrain of paraquat-exposed mice. In these animals, higher levels of lysosomal hsc70 and LAMP-2A paralleled the enhanced cytosolic expression and lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein. Moreover, a punctate α-synuclein and LAMP-2A co-immunoreactivity most likely reflected the lysosomal localization of both these proteins within nigral neurons. Finally, binding of α-synuclein to cytosolic hsc70 was augmented in the midbrain of paraquat-treated mice, further supporting a relationship between CMA induction and increased lysosomal clearance of α-synuclein.Quite interestingly, paraquat-induced up-regulation of LAMP-2A was achieved through de novo synthesis, as indicated by the dramatic elevation of LAMP-2A mRNA in the ventral mesencephalon of mice injected with the herbicide. At least two mechanisms have been described to increase LAMP-2A under conditions associated with CMA induction. During nutritional stress, the most extensively studied inducer of CMA, enhanced LAMP-2A results from a decrease in its degradation as well as a relocation of the receptor protein from the lysosomal lumen to the lysosomal membrane (18Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, LAMP-2A changes associated with CMA activation during oxidative stress were found to be caused by an actual increase in LAMP-2A synthesis (22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This latter mechanism could explain our present data: the oxidative damage caused by paraquat administration would induce new synthesis of LAMP-2A as a critical CMA factor involved in the lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein and other toxic/damaged proteins.A causal relationship between intraneuronal α-synuclein levels, CMA induction and enhanced translocation of α-synuclein into lysosomes may be difficult to demonstrate in the in vivo setting. It could be argued that the findings of increased lysosomal α-synuclein and CMA activation in the paraquat model are compatible with but do not necessarily indicate a direct link between these events. In particular, they do not address the issue of whether α-synuclein accumulation is itself a condition leading to CMA induction. To further investigate this possibility, a final set of experiments was carried out in mice in which increased α-synuclein levels resulted from transgenic overexpression of the protein. Data revealed a robust up-regulation of LAMP-2A in the brain of transgenic animals and supported a direct correlation between levels of α-synuclein overexpression and CMA activation. Indeed, the increase in LAMP-2A was greatest in the brain region with the highest α-synuclein level (ventral mesencephalon) and smallest in the area with the lowest protein expression (frontal cortex). CMA induction as a consequence of transgene expression was also indicated by enhanced hsc70 immunoreactivity within nigral neurons laden with α-synuclein.As suggested by earlier studies, the clearance of wild-type or mutated α-synuclein may involve a variety of mechanisms (5Webb J.L.

The present findings do not rule out this possibility but clearly reveal the importance of lysosomal pathways and, in particular, CMA in the neuronal degradation of wild-type α-synuclein in vivo. The observation of CMA induction and enhanced lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein under conditions of increased protein expression (i.e. paraquat-induced up-regulation and transgenic overexpression of α-synuclein) bears significant implications. Both clinical and experimental data suggest that higher levels of neuronal α-synuclein may trigger or predispose to pathologic consequences, including aggregate formation and neurodegeneration (2Farrer M.

If so, induction of lysosomal degradation pathways may represent an important mechanism that counteracts α-synuclein-related pathology. Failure of this mechanism, which may arise from normal aging (19Zhang C. Cuervo A.M. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), could play a role in the pathogenesis of PD and other α-synucleinopathies, whereas enhancement of these pathways could become a valuable strategy for therapeutic intervention in these human diseases.

Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 7Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Kaushik S. Massey A.C. Mazzulli J. Mosharov E.V.

Xilouri M. Vekrellis K. Stefanis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Second, paraquat administration has previously been shown to upregulate CMA activity in rat liver and cultured fibroblasts (16Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5805-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Our current findings provide evidence in favor of a contribution of CMA to α-synuclein degradation in the midbrain of paraquat-exposed mice. In these animals, higher levels of lysosomal hsc70 and LAMP-2A paralleled the enhanced cytosolic expression and lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein. Moreover, a punctate α-synuclein and LAMP-2A co-immunoreactivity most likely reflected the lysosomal localization of both these proteins within nigral neurons. Finally, binding of α-synuclein to cytosolic hsc70 was augmented in the midbrain of paraquat-treated mice, further supporting a relationship between CMA induction and increased lysosomal clearance of α-synuclein. Quite interestingly, paraquat-induced up-regulation of LAMP-2A was achieved through de novo synthesis, as indicated by the dramatic elevation of LAMP-2A mRNA in the ventral mesencephalon of mice injected with the herbicide. At least two mechanisms have been described to increase LAMP-2A under conditions associated with CMA induction. During nutritional stress, the most extensively studied inducer of CMA, enhanced LAMP-2A results from a decrease in its degradation as well as a relocation of the receptor protein from the lysosomal lumen to the lysosomal membrane (18Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, LAMP-2A changes associated with CMA activation during oxidative stress were found to be caused by an actual increase in LAMP-2A synthesis (22Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This latter mechanism could explain our present data: the oxidative damage caused by paraquat administration would induce new synthesis of LAMP-2A as a critical CMA factor involved in the lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein and other toxic/damaged proteins. A causal relationship between intraneuronal α-synuclein levels, CMA induction and enhanced translocation of α-synuclein into lysosomes may be difficult to demonstrate in the in vivo setting. It could be argued that the findings of increased lysosomal α-synuclein and CMA activation in the paraquat model are compatible with but do not necessarily indicate a direct link between these events. In particular, they do not address the issue of whether α-synuclein accumulation is itself a condition leading to CMA induction. To further investigate this possibility, a final set of experiments was carried out in mice in which increased α-synuclein levels resulted from transgenic overexpression of the protein. Data revealed a robust up-regulation of LAMP-2A in the brain of transgenic animals and supported a direct correlation between levels of α-synuclein overexpression and CMA activation. Indeed, the increase in LAMP-2A was greatest in the brain region with the highest α-synuclein level (ventral mesencephalon) and smallest in the area with the lowest protein expression (frontal cortex). CMA induction as a consequence of transgene expression was also indicated by enhanced hsc70 immunoreactivity within nigral neurons laden with α-synuclein. As suggested by earlier studies, the clearance of wild-type or mutated α-synuclein may involve a variety of mechanisms (5Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Atkins J. Skepper J.N. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol.

The present findings do not rule out this possibility but clearly reveal the importance of lysosomal pathways and, in particular, CMA in the neuronal degradation of wild-type α-synuclein in vivo. The observation of CMA induction and enhanced lysosomal internalization of α-synuclein under conditions of increased protein expression (i.e. paraquat-induced up-regulation and transgenic overexpression of α-synuclein) bears significant implications. Both clinical and experimental data suggest that higher levels of neuronal α-synuclein may trigger or predispose to pathologic consequences, including aggregate formation and neurodegeneration (2Farrer M. Kachergus J. Forno L. Lincoln S. Wang D.S. Hulihan M. Maraganore D. Gwinn-Hardy K. Wszolek Z. Dickson D. Langston J.W. Ann.

If so, induction of lysosomal degradation pathways may represent an important mechanism that counteracts α-synuclein-related pathology. Failure of this mechanism, which may arise from normal aging (19Zhang C. Cuervo A.M. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), could play a role in the pathogenesis of PD and other α-synucleinopathies, whereas enhancement of these pathways could become a valuable strategy for therapeutic intervention in these human diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1976029219,"Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate cognate mRNAs at the post-transcriptional stage. Several studies have shown that miRNAs modulate gene expression in mammalian cells by base pairing to complementary sites in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the target mRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, miR-24 was found to target fas associated factor 1(FAF1) by binding to its amino acid coding sequence (CDS) region, thereby regulating apoptosis in DU-145 cells. This result supports an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs can exercise their effects through binding to the CDS region of the target mRNA. Transfection of miR-24 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-24-ASO) also induced apoptosis in HGC-27, MGC-803 and HeLa cells. Conclusions/Significance We found that miR-24 regulates apoptosis by targeting FAF1 in cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-24 could be an effective drug target for treatment of hormone-insensitive prostate cancer or other types of cancers. Future work may further develop miR-24 for therapeutic applications in cancer biology."

InhA is the target of the current first line drug isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis infections. Compounds that directly target InhA and do not require activation by the mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase KatG are promising candidates for treating infections caused by isoniazid-resistant strains. Previously we reported the synthesis of several diphenyl ethers with nanomolar affinity for InhA. However, these compounds are rapid reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, and based on the knowledge that long drug target residence times are an important factor for in vivo drug activity, we set out to generate a slow onset inhibitor of InhA using structure-based drug design. 2-(o-Tolyloxy)-5-hexylphenol (PT70) is a slow, tight binding inhibitor of InhA with a K1 value of 22 pm. PT70 binds preferentially to the InhA·NAD+ complex and has a residence time of 24 min on the target, which is 14,000 times longer than that of the rapid reversible inhibitor from which it is derived. The 1.8 Å crystal structure of the ternary complex between InhA, NAD+, and PT70 reveals the molecular details of enzyme-inhibitor recognition and supports the hypothesis that slow onset inhibition is coupled to ordering of an active site loop, which leads to the closure of the substrate-binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2017709907,"Lo-MYC and Hi-MYC mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostatic adenocarcinoma as a result of MYC overexpression in the mouse prostate. However, prior studies have not determined precisely when, and in which cell types, MYC is induced. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to localize MYC expression in Lo-MYC transgenic mice, we show that morphological and molecular alterations characteristic of high grade PIN arise in luminal epithelial cells as soon as MYC overexpression is detected. These changes include increased nuclear and nucleolar size and large scale chromatin remodeling. Mouse PIN cells retained a columnar architecture and abundant cytoplasm and appeared as either a single layer of neoplastic cells or as pseudo-stratified/multilayered structures with open glandular lumina-features highly analogous to human high grade PIN. Also using IHC, we show that the onset of MYC overexpression and PIN development coincided precisely with decreased expression of the homeodomain transcription factor and tumor suppressor, Nkx3.1. Virtually all normal appearing prostate luminal cells expressed high levels of Nkx3.1, but all cells expressing MYC in PIN lesions showed marked reductions in Nkx3.1, implicating MYC as a key factor that represses Nkx3.1 in PIN lesions. To determine the effects of less pronounced overexpression of MYC we generated a new line of mice expressing MYC in the prostate under the transcriptional control of the mouse Nkx3.1 control region. These ""Super-Lo-MYC"" mice also developed PIN, albeit a less aggressive form. We also identified a histologically defined intermediate step in the progression of mouse PIN into invasive adenocarcinoma. These lesions are characterized by a loss of cell polarity, multi-layering, and cribriform formation, and by a ""paradoxical"" increase in Nkx3.1 protein. Similar histopathological changes occurred in Hi-MYC mice, albeit with accelerated kinetics. Our results using IHC provide novel insights that support the contention that MYC overexpression is sufficient to transform prostate luminal epithelial cells into PIN cells in vivo. We also identified a novel histopathologically identifiable intermediate step prior to invasion that should facilitate studies of molecular pathway alterations occurring during early progression of prostatic adenocarcinomas."

In this study, we report that THAP1 shares sequence characteristics, in vivo expression patterns and protein partners with THAP3, another THAP-zf protein. Proteomic analyses identified HCF-1, a potent transcriptional coactivator and cell cycle regulator, and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc, as major cellular partners of THAP3. THAP3 interacts with HCF-1 through a consensus HCF-1-binding motif (HBM), a motif that is also present in THAP1.

Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The full-length coding region of human THAP3 was cloned in-frame with an 82-bp linker encoding Flag/HA tags in pTRE-Tight expression vector (Clontech). The resulting vector was co-transfected with pRep-Hygro vector into Hela Tet-Off cells and stable transformants were obtained after 4 weeks of selection in 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Human THAP1 ORF was cloned into expression vector pFlag-CMV5a (Sigma) to generate pFlag-THAP1 expression vector. GST, GST-THAP11–213, GST-THAP3162–239 fusion proteins were produced using pGEX-2T prokaryotic expression vector (Amersham Biosciences), and purified as previously described (11Roussigne M. Cayrol C. Clouaire T. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2432-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GST-THAP3H178A, -THAP3Y180A, and -THAP3HBM (DHSY/AAAA) mutants were obtained from wild-type GST-THAP3162–239 using PCR. Gal4-THAP3 and Gal4-THAP3HBM mutant expression vectors were generated by inserting the corresponding full-length THAP3 fragments, generated by PCR, into pCMVGT vector downstream of the Gal4-DB (amino acids 1–147). The THAP3HBM mutant was also cloned into pTRE-Tight expression vector. For two-hybrid assays, the open-reading frames of human THAP-zf proteins were amplified by PCR from full-length clones (Open Biosystems) and inserted into the pGADT7 expression vector (Clontech). Multiple sequence alignments of the THAP-zf proteins and their HBMs were generated with ClustalW according to the Blosum matrix and colored with Boxshade. Prediction of coiled-coil domains was performed with COILS and PAIRCOIL programs. Nuclear extracts from induced Hela-t-THAP3 cells were prepared as previously described (22Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclei were incubated for 30 min in buffer B: 20 mm Tris pH 7.4; 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0,5% Nonidet, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The salt concentration was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, and nuclear extracts were loaded onto a 4-ml 10–40% glycerol gradient in 150 mm NaCl buffer B, centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (200,000 × g) for 4 h. Fractions corresponding to a peak determined after immunoblotting were pooled and purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FlagM2 antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma), which were washed with 150 mm NaCl-containing IP buffer and eluted with a solution at 500 μg/ml of Flag peptide. As a control, a mock purification was performed from uninduced HeLa cells. Samples from induced and non-induced HeLa cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, and submitted for proteomic analysis (see supplemental information). Nuclear extracts prepared in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7,4; 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0,5% Nonidet, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche), were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-HA mAb (clone HA-7; Sigma; A 2095), control Ig or polyclonal anti-HCF-1 antibodies (15Narayanan A. Ruyechan W.T. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10835-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and precipitated proteins were captured with Protein G-Sepharose beads (eBioscience). Alternatively, Flag-tagged protein complexes were captured with anti-Flag (M2) agarose beads (Sigma; A 2220). After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot with mAbs to HA or Flag epitope tags (Sigma), or rabbit antiserum to HCF-1 (15Narayanan A.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10835-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or OGT (AL28; a generous gift of Dr. Gerald Hart), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (1/10000; Promega). Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare). Rabbit anti-THAP1 (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-tubulin-α (Sigma) antibodies (1/1000) were used for some Western blot analyses. HF7c and Y190 strains were transformed with pGAL29 encoding the HCF-1 kelch domain (amino acids 3–455) fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and subsequently retransformed with pGADT7 or the GADT7-THAP clones. HF7c cotransformant strains were patched on SD-Leu, Trp, and SD-Leu/Trp/His media. Y190 cotransformant strains were assayed for β-galactosidase using the Gal-Screen System (Applied Biosystems). GST pulldown assays were performed as previously described (11Roussigne M. Cayrol C. Clouaire T. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2432-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using immobilized GST, GST-THAP1, GST-THAP3, or GST-THAP3HBM mutant proteins, and 35S-labeled HCF1 kelch domain (amino acids 3–455) generated in vitro with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Hela HLR cells, which contain a Firefly luciferase chromatin-integrated reporter gene under the control of five GAL4 binding sites, were co-transfected with 50 ng of pCMVGT-Gal4-THAP3 or -Gal4-THAP3HBM constructs and 50 ng of Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-CMV, Promega), with or without 1 μg of HCF-1-V5 expression vector (15Narayanan A. Ruyechan W.T. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10835-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using JetPEI reagent (2 μl/well, Polyplus Transfection). After 48h, Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. ChIP-qPCR assays were performed as previously described (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of antibodies specific for THAP1 (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10835-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sequences of the primers are available in the supplemental information. QuantiTect Primer Assays (Qiagen) were used for analysis of HCF-1, RRM1, and GAPDH expression by qPCR. For Northern blot analysis, blots of poly(A)+ RNA from adult mouse and human tissues were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech), using random-primed human THAP3 and THAP1 cDNA probes. Human THAP-zf proteins are not known to share homologies outside the THAP-zf. However, we observed that, among the 12 human THAP-zf proteins (7Roussigne M. Kossida S. Lavigne A.C. Clouaire T. Ecochard V. Glories A. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), THAP3, shares sequence similarities with THAP1 not only within the THAP-zf (7Roussigne M. Kossida S. Lavigne A.C. Clouaire T. Ecochard V. Glories A. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but also within the carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains in both proteins, a conserved bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a coiled-coil domain predicted by COILS and PAIRCOIL programs (Fig. 1A). Northern blot analyses revealed that THAP3 and THAP1 also share striking similarities in their expression profile both in mouse and human tissues (Fig. 1B). Together, these findings indicated THAP3 and THAP1 exhibit similarities not only in their primary structure and sequence but also in their expression pattern in vivo. To identify THAP3-interacting partners in vivo, nuclear extracts were prepared from Hela-t-THAP3 cells, conditionally expressing a carboxyl-terminal Flag/HA-tagged THAP3, and fractionated in a glycerol gradient. A predominant THAP3-containing complex of ∼0.6 MDa (supplemental Fig. S1) was identified, immunoprecipitated from the corresponding fractions with anti-Flag antibody, and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). The purification was reproducible, as several THAP3-interacting proteins were repeatedly identified in three independent affinity purification/proteomic analyses (Table 1). Strikingly, many of the THAP3-interacting proteins corresponded to differentially processed forms of HCF-1. Numerous peptides were identified within both N- and C-terminal parts of HCF-1, including many peptides bearing O-glycosylated residues within the HCF-1 basic domain (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, the human OGT enzyme (20Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) and protein chaperones with demonstrated O-GlcNAc lectin activity, such as the HSP70-like proteins Hsc71 and GRP-78 (23Lefebvre T. Cieniewski C. Lemoine J. Guerardel Y. Leroy Y. Zanetta J.P. Michalski J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were also reproducibly identified in the THAP3-associated protein complexes (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The association of HCF-1 and OGT with THAP3 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunoblot analyses of nuclear extracts fractionated in glycerol gradients (supplemental Fig. S1). Together, these proteomic analyses indicated that O-GlcNAcylated-HCF-1, O-GlcNAc transferase OGT, and O-GlcNAc lectins constitute the core components of the THAP3-associated protein complexes in human Hela cells.TABLE 1THAP3-associated proteins identified by mass spectrometryProtein nameACGene nameMWBest scoreNo. of SequencesNo. of Total MS/MSRatio ip/controlNo. of ExperimentsHost cell factorP51610HCFC1210,707118043734783THAP domain-containing protein 3Q8WTV1THAP327,384904202291913UDP-N-acetylglucosamine–peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110-kDa subunitO15294OGT118,10461835160173Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc71)P11142HSPA871,082743289316378-kDa glucose-regulated protein precursor (GRP-78)P11021HSPA572,4027093153242Stress-70 protein, mitochondrial precursorP38646HSPA973,9206062752142 Open table in a new tab Numerous viral and cellular factors bind the HCF-1 amino-terminal kelch domain, via a tetrapeptide motif ((D/E)HXY), designated the HCF-1-binding motif (HBM) (19Tyagi S.

A consensus HBM (DHSY) is also present in THAP3 (Fig. 1A), and GST pulldown assays revealed that wild-type THAP3 binds to HCF-1 in vitro. Mutations of the THAP3-HBM strongly reduced (single amino acid mutants) or completely abrogated (quadruple mutant) the THAP3-HCF-1 interaction in vitro (Fig. 2B). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays in human cells revealed that THAP3, but not the THAP3HBM mutant, is able to precipitate HCF-1 and OGT (Fig. 2C). The association of THAP3HBM with OGT was also significantly reduced, suggesting THAP3 associates with OGT in vivo mainly through its interaction with HCF-1. We also observed that THAP1 contains a consensus HBM (DHNY) (Fig. 1A) and interacts with HCF-1 in two-hybrid (see below) and GST pulldown assays in vitro (Fig. 2D). In addition, THAP1 associates with HCF-1 and OGT in co-immunoprecipitation assays in vivo (Fig. 2E). These later findings indicated THAP3 shares its two major cellular partners with THAP1. Comparison of the THAP1 and THAP3 sequences with other human THAP-zf proteins showed that a consensus HBM is also present in human THAP2 (EHSY), THAP5 (EHSY), THAP6 (EHSY), THAP7 (EHSY), THAP9 (DHNY), and THAP11 (DHSY), whereas THAP4 contains two HBM-like sequences (LHSY) (Fig. 3A). The HBMs are always located upstream predicted coiled-coil domains (Fig. 3B) and are found at similar positions in the orthologues of THAP-zf proteins in other species, including zebrafish and xenopus, indicating strong evolutionary conservation (supplemental Fig. S3). In agreement with the presence of the HBM, several members of the human THAP-zf protein family were identified in large scale two-hybrid screens with the HCF-1 amino-terminal kelch domain (supplemental Fig. S4). Additional two-hybrid assays (Fig. 3, C and D) revealed that the HCF-1 kelch domain binds to human THAP-zf proteins that contain an HBM (THAP1 to THAP7 and THAP11) or HBM-like motif (THAP4) but not to those which do not possess HBMs (THAP8 and THAP10). Based on our bioinformatics analyses and two-hybrid results, we concluded that THAP-zf proteins represent a large family of HCF-1 binding factors. We asked if interaction of THAP3 with HCF-1 might play a role in transcriptional regulation. Because THAP3 target genes have not yet been identified, we used a chromatin-integrated Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Hela-HLR cell line). Wild-type THAP3 or THAP3HBM mutant was expressed as Gal4 DNA binding domain-fusion proteins in Hela HLR cells, with or without V5-epitope-tagged HCF-1 (Fig. 4A). ChIP assays revealed that both Gal4-THAP3 and Gal4-THAP3HBM were significantly enriched at the Gal4 binding sites in the Gal4 reporter gene (Fig. 4B). In contrast, ChIP assays with anti-V5 antibodies showed that the V5-epitope-tagged HCF-1 was recruited to the Gal4 binding sites when co-expressed with Gal4-THAP3 but not when co-expressed with Gal4-THAP3HBM (Fig. 4C). Moreover, recruitment of HCF-1 by Gal4-THAP3 resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of the Gal4-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4D), whereas no effect was found with the Gal4-THAP3HBM mutant. We conclude that THAP3, through its HBM, is able to recruit HCF-1 to a chromatin-integrated promoter for transcriptional activation. We next asked if HCF-1 might play a role in transcriptional regulation by endogenous THAP1. Using primary human endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have recently shown that THAP1 associates in vivo with consensus THAP1 binding sites found in the RRM1 promoter (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because HCF-1 has previously been found to be required for multiple stages of cell cycle progression (18Julien E. Herr W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we determined whether binding of HCF-1 to THAP1 may play a role in transcriptional regulation of RRM1. The RRM1 promoter (Fig. 5A) contains binding sites for both THAP1 and E2F transcription factors. ChIP assays were performed in HUVECs after knockdown of endogenous THAP1 expression with a pool of specific siRNAs (Fig. 5B). ChIP experiments performed in the presence of control siRNAs revealed that THAP1 and HCF-1 are recruited to the promoter region containing the THAP1 binding sites (−178) but not to the 5′-untranslated region containing the E2F site (+84) nor to a site close to the STOP codon (+2630) (Fig. 5C). In cells treated with THAP1 siRNAs, there was a significant reduction of THAP1 association. Interestingly, the reduction in THAP1 binding correlated with a parallel reduction in HCF-1 association with the RRM1 promoter (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S5). In contrast, the association of HCF-1 with the p107 promoter, a promoter bound by E2Fs (19Tyagi S. Chabes A.L. Wysocka J. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) but not by THAP1, was increased after knockdown of THAP1 (Fig. 5D). These experiments performed in primary human cells indicated that THAP1, rather than E2Fs, is important for HCF-1 recruitment to the RRM1 promoter during endothelial cell proliferation. We have previously shown that silencing of endogenous THAP1 in primary HUVECs led to a significant decrease in RRM1 mRNA levels (10Cayrol C. Lacroix C. Mathe C. Ecochard V. Ceribelli M. Loreau E. Lazar V. Dessen P. Mantovani R. Aguilar L. Girard J.P. Blood. 2007; 109: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether HCF-1, a potent transcriptional coactivator (24Kristie T.M. Liang Y. Vogel J.L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010; 1799: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), may also play a role in the regulation of RRM1 expression. Knockdown of endogenous HCF-1 expression with a pool of siRNAs optimized to reduce off-target effects (ON-TARGET-plus SMARTpool siRNAs) resulted in down-regulation of RRM1 mRNA levels (Fig. 6A), indicating HCF-1 is essential for the activation of RRM1 during cell cycle progression. This result was confirmed using 4 individual siRNAs, which similarly reduced HCF-1 levels in HUVECs, as shown by Western blot (Fig. 6B) and qPCR (Fig. 6C) analyses. Importantly, the 4 HCF-1 siRNAs reduced RRM1 mRNA levels (∼50% inhibition), but had no significant effects on mRNA levels of actin, GAPDH, and THAP1. Together, these data provide strong evidence that endogenous HCF-1 modulates RRM1 mRNA levels in primary human endothelial cells. Finally, we performed knockdown experiments to address the potential role of OGT in RRM1 regulation. As shown in supplemental Fig. S6, reduction of OGT levels did not affect RRM1 expression in HUVECs. However, this does not preclude a role for OGT in RRM1 regulation in other cell types and for the THAP1/HCF-1/OGT complex in the regulation of other promoters. In this study, we report that dystonia protein THAP1/DYT6 exhibits striking similarities with THAP3, another member of the THAP-zf protein family, in terms of primary structure, in vivo expression pattern and cellular partners. Similarly to THAP3, THAP1 associates with HCF-1, a cell cycle factor and potent transcriptional coactivator, and OGT, the enzyme that mediates O-GlcNAcylation of proteins. THAP3 binding to HCF-1 is mediated by a consensus HBM, a motif that is also found in THAP1. In addition to THAP1 and THAP3, seven other members of the human THAP-zf protein family, contain evolutionary conserved HBMs and possess HCF-1 binding properties, indicating THAP-zf proteins represent a large family of HCF-1-binding factors. We found that THAP3 and THAP1 are both able to recruit HCF-1 to chromatin-integrated promoters for transcriptional activation. HCF-1 was recruited to the THAP1 binding sites, rather than the E2F site, in the promoter of cell cycle-specific gene RRM1, and endogenous THAP1 was found to be essential for HCF-1 recruitment during endothelial cell proliferation. This is an important result because, although recruitment of HCF-1 on cell cycle-specific promoters has been found to be correlated with the presence of E2F transcription factors (19Tyagi S. Chabes A.L. Wysocka J. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the absolute requirement of E2Fs for HCF-1 recruitment has not yet been shown. Knockdown of HCF-1 expression with siRNAs resulted in down-regulation of RRM1 mRNA levels, indicating HCF-1 is essential for the activation of RRM1 during cell cycle progression. Together, these findings suggest THAP1 and E2Fs may cooperate for HCF-1 recruitment on cell cycle specific promoters, with THAP1 playing important roles on some promoters (i.e. RRM1) and E2Fs (19Tyagi S. Chabes A.L. Wysocka J. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) on other promoters (i.e. p107, cyclin A). They also support the possibility the critical role of HCF-1 in G1/S cell cycle progression (14Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Julien E. Herr W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) may be caused by its interaction with both E2Fs and THAP1. HCF-1 was initially discovered as a cellular cofactor in the induction of herpes simplex virus transcription and is a potent coactivator for viral VP16 and numerous transcription factors (reviewed in (24Kristie T.M. Liang Y. Vogel J.L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010; 1799: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Wysocka J. Herr W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 294-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)). Accordingly, our results indicate that interaction of THAP1 and THAP3 with HCF-1 plays a role in transcriptional activation. However, the interaction of HCF-1 with Ronin (the mouse orthologue of human THAP11) has recently been proposed to be involved in transcriptional repression in mouse embryonic stem cells (27Dejosez M. Krumenacker J.S. Zitur L.J. Passeri M. Chu L.F. Songyang Z. Thomson J.A. Zwaka T.P. Cell. 2008; 133: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, interaction of THAP-zf proteins with HCF-1 may be important for both transcriptional activation and repression, depending on the THAP-zf protein involved, the cellular context and/or the cell cycle status. This would be similar to what has previously been proposed for the E2F family (19Tyagi S. Chabes A.L. Wysocka J. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our data also link THAP1 to OGT, an enzyme that plays an essential role in glucose metabolism by transferring O-GlcNAc to many nucleocytoplasmic proteins (20Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). The identification of a physical link between THAP1/DYT6 and OGT (Fig. 7A) supports the possibility OGT may play a role in DYT3 dystonia/parkinsonism. Indeed, the OGT gene is mapped within the DYT3 critical interval on Xq13.1 and mutations have been identified in DYT3 patients that may affect the OGT regulatory regions (Fig. 7B). These include 4 disease-specific single nucleotide changes (DSCs), a 48-bp deletion and a SVA retrotransposon insertion in intron 32 of the TAF1 gene (12Makino S. Kaji R. Ando S. Tomizawa M.

The DSCs have been proposed to alter a multiple transcript system (MTS) expressed within the DYT3 critical interval (21Nolte D. Niemann S. Müller U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, the retrotransposon insertion has been shown to correlate with reduced TAF1 mRNA levels (12Makino S. Kaji R. Ando S. Tomizawa M. Yasuno K. Goto S. Matsumoto S. Tabuena M.D. Maranon E. Dantes M. Lee L.V. Ogasawara K. Tooyama I. Akatsu H. Nishimura M. Tamiya G. Am. J. Hum.

However, the molecular pathological mechanism in DYT3 dystonia remains unknown and the different mutations within the DYT3 locus may also affect expression of OGT. An intriguing possibility is that OGT and glucose metabolism may play a role in the pathology of both DYT6 and DYT3 dystonias. We thank Dr. G.

https://openalex.org/W2079350688,"To help understand the dynamic nature of membrane fusion induced by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope protein, we developed a new cell-based real-time assay system employing a pair of novel reporter proteins. The reporter proteins consist of a pair of split Renilla luciferase (spRL) fused to split green fluorescent protein (spGFP). The spGFP modules were chosen not only to compensate weak self-association of spRL but also to provide visual reporter signals during membrane fusion. Use of this reporter together with a membrane permeable substrate for Renilla luciferase achieved a simple real-time monitoring of membrane fusion using live cells. We analyzed the HIV-1 envelope mutants whose membrane-spanning domains were replaced with that of glycophorin A or vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein. These mutants showed a slower kinetics of membrane fusion. The analysis of membrane fusion in the presence of fusion inhibitors, soluble CD4 and C34, revealed that these replacements prolonged the period during which the mutants were sensitive to the inhibitors, as compared with the wild type. These results suggest that the mutations within the membrane-spanning domains exerted an allosteric effect on the HIV-1 envelope protein, probably affecting the receptor-induced conformational changes of the ectodomain of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2004708049,"Background Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by cytokines is rapid, mediated through the activation of the IKK complex with subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory IκB proteins. The IKK complex is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory protein known as NEMO. Using cells from mice that are genetically deficient in IKKβ or IKKα, or using a kinase inactive mutant of IKKβ, it has been proposed that IKKβ is critical for TNF-induced IκB phosphorylation/degradation through the canonical pathway while IKKα has been shown to be involved in the non-canonical pathway for NF-κB activation. These conclusions have led to a focus on development of IKKβ inhibitors for potential use in inflammatory disorders and cancer. Methodology Analysis of NF-κB activation in response to TNF in MEFs reveals that IKKβ is essential for efficient phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα, yet IKKα contributes to the NF-κB activation response in these cells as measured via DNA binding assays. In HeLa cells, both IKKα and IKKβ contribute to IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. A kinase inactive mutant of IKKβ, which has been used as evidence for the critical importance of IKKβ in TNF-induced signaling, blocks activation of NF-κB induced by IKKα, even in cells that are deficient in IKKβ. Conclusions These results demonstrate the importance of IKKα in canonical NF-κB activation, downstream of cytokine treatment of cells. The experiments suggest that IKKα will be a therapeutic target in inflammatory disorders."

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the reduction in PS levels caused by E2 in HepG2-ERα cells, which stably express ERα, and also the genomic ER signaling pathway, which modulates the ligand-dependent repression of the PSα gene (PROS1). We observed that E2 repressed the production of mRNA and antigen of PS. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that E2 down-regulated PROS1 promoter activity and that this E2-dependent repression disappeared upon the deletion or mutation of two adjacent GC-rich motifs in the promoter. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNA pulldown assay revealed that the GC-rich motifs were associated with Sp1, Sp3, and ERα. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found ERα-Sp protein-promoter interaction involved in the E2-dependent repression of PROS1 transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrated that E2 treatment recruited RIP140 and the NCoR-SMRT-HDAC3 complex to the PROS1 promoter, which hypoacetylated chromatin. Taken together, this suggested that E2 might repress PROS1 transcription depending upon ERα-Sp1 recruiting transcriptional repressors in HepG2-ERα cells and, consequently, that high levels of E2 leading to reduced levels of plasma PS would be a risk for deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women.

https://openalex.org/W1981087370,"LDL receptor-related protein (LRP1) is expressed by Schwann cells in vivo mainly after injury to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells in primary culture, which provide a model of Schwann cells in the injured PNS, also express abundant LRP1. Herein, we show that LRP1 gene-silencing or treatment with receptor-associated protein (RAP) promotes Schwann cell adhesion and inhibits cell migration on fibronectin. LRP1 gene-silencing also resulted in the formation of prominent focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. These changes, which were induced by loss of LRP1 expression or activity, were explained mechanistically by an increase in activated RhoA, coupled with a decrease in activated Rac1. Known LRP1 ligands, including matrix metalloprotease-9, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and α2-macroglobulin activated Rac1 in LRP1-expressing Schwann cells. An inhibitor of Rac1 activation promoted Schwann cell adhesion. Conversely, in cells in which LRP1 was silenced, a Rho kinase inhibitor promoted migration and inhibited adhesion. These results demonstrate that direct binding of ligands to LRP1 controls activation of small Rho family GTPases.

Schwann cells are typically immobile, providing trophic support and in some cases, ensheathing and myelinating axons (1Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468: 3-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PNS injury triggers Schwann cell dedifferentiation, allowing these cells to survive, detach from axonal connections, proliferate, and migrate (2Ide C. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 25: 101-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dedifferentiation is essential for PNS regeneration (3Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Many exogenous factors have been reported to stimulate migration of dedifferentiated Schwann cells, including neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neuregulin-1, and insulin-like growth factor-I (4Yamauchi J.

Rac1 promotes dynamic actin remodeling, lamellipodia formation and random cell migration (7Pankov R. Endo Y. Even-Ram S. Araki M. Clark K. Cukierman E. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J.

In Schwann cells, the ability of Rac1 to promote cell migration may be counteracted by high levels of activated RhoA and its downstream effector, Rho kinase (10Yamauchi J. Chan J.R. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RhoA activation may be inhibited by Rac1 and Rac1 activation may be inhibited downstream of Rho kinase, allowing for orchestration of these GTPases in the control of cell morphology and migration (11Nimnual A.S.

Gene products that control transformation of the Schwann cell phenotype in PNS injury remain incompletely characterized. We recently identified low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) as a receptor expressed by Schwann cells mainly after PNS injury (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LRP1 is a 600-kDa type I transmembrane protein in the LDL receptor gene family, originally characterized as an endocytic receptor, but currently recognized also for its role in cell signaling (17Strickland D.K.

Diverse proteins implicated in PNS injury, including matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M) bind to LRP1 and activate Akt and ERK/MAP kinase in Schwann cells in vitro and in the injured PNS (19Mantuano E.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11571-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the increase in Schwann cell migration, observed when cells are treated with MMP-9, has been attributed to activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K downstream of LRP1, Schwann cells in culture migrate readily in the absence of added MMP-9 (19Mantuano E. Inoue G. Li X. Takahashi K. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11571-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The basal rate of Schwann cell migration, in the absence of added reagents, is inhibited by 90% when LRP1 is silenced (19Mantuano E. Inoue G. Li X. Takahashi K. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11571-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This result is intriguing given the importance of Schwann cell migration in PNS injury and the fact that LRP1 is expressed by Schwann cells primarily after nerve injury (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to determine the mechanism by which LRP1 expression controls the basal rate of Schwann cell migration. Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of exogenously added ligands, LRP1 is a major activator of Rac1 and a reciprocal inhibitor of RhoA in Schwann cells. The ability of LRP1 to directly regulate Rho family GTPases explains its activity in regulating the basal rate of Schwann cell migration. The LRP1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-RAP) as previously described (22Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, we expressed GST in bacteria transformed with the empty vector, pGEX-2T. Purified fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN), and a monoclonal antibody specific for vinculin (clone hVIN-1) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Rac/Cdc42 assay reagent (PAK-PBD1), which includes residues 67–150 of p21-activated kinase (PAK-1) fused to GST and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically binds Rac1 was from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The Rho assay reagent, a GST-tagged fusion protein corresponding to residues 7–89 of mouse Rhotekin Rho Binding Domain (GST-TRBD) expressed in Escherichia coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose, was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). This fusion protein specifically binds GTP-Rho. RhoA-specific monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, and Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (PEX) and the α2M receptor binding domain (RBD) were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as previously described (19Mantuano E. Inoue G. Li X. Takahashi K. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11571-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Mantuano E. Mukandala G. Li X. Campana W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Catalytically inactive tPA (mtPA) was purchased from Molecular Innovations (Novi, MI). MMP-9 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Schwann cells were isolated from sciatic nerves of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories) and further separated from other cell types by using anti-Thy1.1 and rabbit complement, as previously described (23Campana W.M. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. Faseb J. 1998; 12: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). Final preparations consisted of 98% Schwann cells, as determined by immunofluorescence for S100, which is a specific Schwann cell marker. Primary cultures of Schwann cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 21 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, and 4 μm forskolin (Complete medium) at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2. Schwann cell cultures were passaged no more than six times before conducting experiments. The previously described rat LRP1-specific siRNA (siLRP1, CGAGCGACCUCCUAUCUUUUU) (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and NTC siRNA were from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Primary cultures of Schwann cells (1 × 106) were transfected with LRP1-specific siRNA (25 nm) or with NTC siRNA (25 nm) by electroporation using the Rat Neuron Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). The degree of LRP1 gene-silencing was 92–95%, 24–72-h post-electroporation as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). qPCR analysis of gene-silencing was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and RAP ligand blotting, as previously described (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cell signaling and cell migration experiments were performed 24–36 h after introducing siRNAs. Schwann cells were transferred to serum-free medium (SFM) and maintained for 1 h. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (PBS with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture, and sodium orthovanadate). The protein concentration in cell extracts was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). An equivalent amount of cellular protein (50 μg per lane) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with Tween-20 and incubated with the primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The membranes were washed and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Health-Care Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Densitometry was performed using NIH Image. Migration of Schwann cells was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores (Costar, Corning, NY), as previously described (19Mantuano E. Inoue G. Li X. Takahashi K. Gaultier A.

We selected FN as the primary substratum for our studies because after PNS injury, FN expression is induced to provide a provisional extracellular matrix for nerve regeneration (26Inoue G. Gaultier A. Li X. Mantuano E. Richardson G. Takahashi K. Campana W.M. Glia. 2010; 58: 399-409PubMed Google Scholar). Schwann cells that were transfected with siLRP1 or with NTC siRNA were cultured in Sato medium (27Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 129: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and treated with Y27632 (25 μm) or vehicle. Wild-type Schwann cells were pretreated with GST-RAP (100 nm) or GST (100 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to adding Y27632. The same reagents were added to both chambers of each Transwell. The bottom chamber contained 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (105) were added to the top chamber and allowed to migrate at 37 °C. After 4 h, the upper surface of each membrane was cleaned with a cotton swab. The membranes then were stained with Diff-Quik (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL). The number of cells on the bottom surface of each membrane was determined. Each condition was studied at least in triplicate. Four fields from each membrane were examined. 96-well plates were coated with various concentrations of FN or VN in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and then blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 2 h at 22 °C. Cells transfected with siLRP1 or NTC siRNA and wild-type Schwann cells were suspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in Sato medium, supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of Y27632 or the Rac1 inhibitor, NC23766. In some cases, wild-type Schwann cells were pretreated with GST or GST-RAP (100 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, rinsed, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Cell-associated stain was recovered in 1% SDS. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured. Each value represents the mean of 18 separate replicates, in three separate experiments. siLRP1- or NTC-transfected Schwann cells were dissociated with non-enzymatic dissociation buffer. The cells were plated in Sato medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml of BSA on FN-coated glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5–3 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with vinculin-specific antibody for 18 h, followed by secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and phalloidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568. Control cultures were treated equivalently except for the omission of primary antibody. Preparations were mounted on slides using Pro-long Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and examined using a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope. Images were obtained with a ×63 oil immersion objective and a Hamamatsu digital camera with SimplePCI software. Deconvolution was performed using Simple PCI software. Affinity precipitation of active Rac1 was performed using PAK1-PBD, which specifically recognizes the GTP-bound form of Rac1 and Cdc42, as previously described (28Kjøller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were cultured in 10-cm2 plates coated with FN (5 μg/ml) for 18 h and then serum-starved for 4 h in Sato medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA. Cultures were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The extracts were incubated with 15 μg of PAK1-PBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose was washed and then treated with SDS-sample buffer to dissociate the PAK1-PBD and associated proteins. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect active Rac1. Samples of each cell extract were subjected to immunoblot analysis prior to incubation with PAK1-PBD, to determine total Rac1. Affinity precipitation of active RhoA was performed using GST-TRBD, as previously described (30Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were cultured in 10-cm2 plates for 18 h, serum-starved for 4 h in Sato medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, washed with ice-cold PBS, and extracted in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2) supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The extracts were incubated with 30 μg of GST-TRBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. The matrix was washed and then treated with SDS sample buffer to dissociate GST-TRBD and GTP-Rho. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect active RhoA. Samples of each cell extract were subjected to immunoblot analysis prior to incubation with GST-TRBD to determine total RhoA. In all studies, replicates refer to separate experiments, typically performed with internal duplicates or triplicates. Results of cell migration, cell adhesion, and cell signaling experiments were subjected to a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc analysis to assess differences between greater than three treatment groups. In the case of two treatment means, a Student's t test was performed. Schwann cells in culture express high levels of LRP1, mimicking the phenotype of Schwann cells in vivo in the injured PNS (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To study the effects of LRP1 on Schwann cell adhesion and migration, cells were transfected with the previously described LRP1-specific siRNA, siLRP1 (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N. Janes J. Gaultier A. Gonias S.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11197-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or with NTC siRNA. Fig. 1A shows that LRP1 protein was essentially undetectable in gene-silenced cells, as determined by immunoblot analysis. To avoid the previously reported adverse effects of LRP1 gene-silencing on Schwann cell survival, transfected cells were maintained in Sato medium (27Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 129: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, altered survival was not observed, as determined by MTT assay (results not shown). Cell migration was studied using Transwell units. FN was adsorbed selectively to the lower membrane surface to form a haptotactic gradient. Fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber to provide a chemoattractant stimulus. Fig. 1B shows representative images of the lower surfaces of Transwell membranes. When LRP1 was silenced, Schwann cell migration was substantially inhibited. As shown in Fig. 1C, the number of LRP1 gene-silenced cells migrating to the lower membrane surface was decreased by 80–90% compared with the number of control cells (p < 0.01). In Transwell migration assays, decreased migration may be explained if cells do not adhere to the upper membrane surface. To control for this possibility, we studied Schwann cell adhesion to FN-coated surfaces. Cell culture wells were coated with 0.2–5.0 μg/ml FN. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h. Fig. 1D shows that LRP1 gene-silencing did not inhibit cell adhesion but instead, robustly increased cell adhesion. At each FN concentration, the number of adherent cells was increased about 3-fold by LRP1 gene-silencing. As a second approach to test the effects of LRP1 on Schwann cell adhesion, we treated Schwann cells with RAP, which binds to LRP1 and blocks the binding of other ligands that initiate LRP1-dependent cell signaling (17Strickland D.K.

Fig. 1E shows that RAP increased Schwann cell adhesion to FN, confirming the results obtained by gene-silencing. Because RAP is expressed as a GST fusion protein, as a control, we examined the effects of purified GST, which did not affect cell adhesion, as anticipated. Next, we examined Schwann cell adhesion to FN as a function of time. As is evident by phase contrast microscopy, LRP1 gene-silencing was associated not only with an increase in the rate of adhesion but also with more rapid spreading (Fig. 2A). By 4 h, adhesion of gene-silenced and control cells tended to equalize. Interestingly, although LRP1 gene-silenced cells tended to spread more rapidly, these cells showed fewer and more poorly developed cellular processes at 4 h. To further examine the effects of LRP1 gene-silencing on Schwann cell spreading, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy studies. Vinculin immunofluorescence was imaged as a marker of focal adhesions (32Demali K.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 565-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Filamentous actin (f-actin) was imaged by phalloidin staining. Fig. 2B shows representative images of control Schwann cells and cells in which LRP1 was silenced. In the gene-silenced cells, prominent focal adhesions were observed, running perpendicular to the plasma membrane near the cell margins. Focal adhesions were fewer and less prominent in control cells. Many LRP1 gene-silenced cells also demonstrated well-defined stress fibers. In other LRP1 gene-silenced cells, the pattern of f-actin was primarily circumferential, near the cell perimeter. This pattern has been observed before and described as a variant of the classic fibroblast stress fiber, formed under the control of Rho and Rho kinase (33Kawkitinarong K. Linz-McGillem L.

Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 1501-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Schwann cells, Akt and ERK1/2 are activated when the cells are treated with LRP1 ligands. LRP1 gene-silencing or treatment with RAP decreases Akt activation in the absence of added LRP1 ligands, suggesting that autocrine circuits may be disrupted (16Campana W.M. Li X. Dragojlovic N.

Because of the effects of LRP1 gene-silencing on Schwann cell adhesion and spreading, we examined activation of Rac1 and RhoA. Rho GTPases cycle between GTP-loaded, activated states, and GDP-loaded, inactive states under the control of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (35Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 36Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The assortment of GEFs and GAPs that regulate Rac1 or RhoA is large, allowing for considerable cross-talk in cell signaling. Cell extracts were prepared from confluent cultures of LRP1 gene-silenced and control Schwann cells 22 h after plating on FN-coated plates. For the final 4 h, the cells were maintained in serum-free Sato medium. Fig. 3A shows a representative immunoblot comparing GTP-loaded Rac1 and total Rac1. In LRP1 gene-silenced cells, the fraction of Rac1 that was GTP-loaded was decreased by 85 ± 10% (p < 0.01). At the same time, LRP1 gene-silencing resulted in a substantial increase in GTP-loaded RhoA. As shown in Fig. 3B, the increase was 5.2 ± 0.3-fold (p < 0.01). These changes in small GTPase activity are consistent with the observed changes in Schwann cell phenotype and suggest that LRP1 may control Schwann cell adhesion and the basal rate of cell migration by its effects on Rac1 and RhoA. To confirm that LRP1 regulates Rac1 activity, Schwann cells in culture were treated with four structurally diverse LRP1 ligands. MMP-9, the isolated LRP1 binding domain of MMP-9 (PEX), the receptor-binding domain of α2M (RBD), and a mutated form of tPA in which the serine protease active site is deleted (mtPA) activated Rac1 in Schwann cells (Fig. 4A). mtPA-induced cell signaling has not been studied in Schwann cells previously; however, mtPA initiates LRP1-dependent cell signaling in other cell types (21Shi Y. Mantuano E. Inoue G. Campana W.M. Gonias S.L. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra18Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Hu K. Yang J. Tanaka S. Gonias S.L. Mars W.M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The extent of Rac1 activation induced by each LRP1 ligand was comparable. In Schwann cells in which LRP1 was silenced, PEX and RBD failed to activate Rac1 (Fig. 4B). By contrast, in cells that were transfected with NTC siRNA, PEX and RBD activated Rac1, providing further confirmation that the mechanism by which PEX and RBD regulate GTPase activity requires LRP1. We also examined the effects of PEX and RBD on RhoA activation. Because LRP1 expression is associated with a substantial decrease in GTP-RhoA, we hypothesized that PEX and RBD might further decrease GTP-RhoA. In two separate experiments, a further decrease was not observed (results not shown); however, because the level of GTP-loaded RhoA is already very low in LRP1-expressing Schwann cells, our inability to detect a further decrease in GTP-RhoA m"

The cancer drug imatinib binds tightly to several homologous kinases, including Abl, but weakly to others, including Src. Imatinib specifically targets the inactive, so-called “DFG-out” conformation of Abl, which differs from the preferred, “DFG-in” conformation of Src in the orientation of a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) activation loop. However, recent x-ray structures showed that Src can also adopt the DFG-out conformation and uses it to bind imatinib. The Src/Abl-binding free energy difference can thus be decomposed into two contributions. Contribution i measures the different protein-imatinib interactions when either kinase is in its DFG-out conformation. Contribution ii depends on the ability of imatinib to select or induce this conformation, i.e. on the relative stabilities of the DFG-out and DFG-in conformations of each kinase. Neither contribution has been measured experimentally. We use molecular dynamics simulations to show that contribution i is very small, 0.2 ± 0.6 kcal/mol; imatinib interactions are very similar in the two kinases, including long range electrostatic interactions with the imatinib positive charge. Contribution ii, deduced using the experimental binding free energy difference, is much larger, 4.4 ± 0.9 kcal/mol. Thus, conformational selection, easy in Abl, difficult in Src, underpins imatinib specificity. Contribution ii has a simple interpretation; it closely approximates the stability difference between the DFG-out and DFG-in conformations of apo-Src. Additional calculations show that conformational selection also governs the relative binding of imatinib to the kinases c-Kit and Lck. These results should help clarify the current framework for engineering kinase signaling.

They modify other proteins by transferring a phosphate from ATP to a tyrosine side chain; this results in a functional change of the target protein and a cellular signal. Their activity must be tightly controlled, so they assume an inactive conformation and only become active when switched on by phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) or binding of other proteins or small molecules (6Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Unregulated kinase activity can lead to excessive cell division and is a cause of many forms of cancer, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, where the kinase Abl is improperly activated (7Gambacorti-Passerini C.B.

Obtaining inhibitors that are specific for a particular kinase or group of kinases is difficult, because of the sequence similarity of kinase active sites (9Verkhivker G.M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Chen J. Zhang X. Fernandez A.

O'Dwyer M. Swords R. Leukemia. 2009; 23: 1698-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There are 518 known kinases in the human genome (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar), and the average sequence identity between any two is about 30% for the catalytic domain (12Kinnings S.L. Jackson R.M. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2009; 49: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Within the subgroup involving Abl and Src, the 32 human nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, the mutual sequence identities are typically higher, around 40–50%. Expression levels can also influence ligand binding specificity; they depend on many factors but do not appear to vary dramatically when different kinases are compared; for example, Abl and Src expression levels are within about a factor of 20 in several cell types (14Son M.Y. Kim J. Han H.W. Woo S.M. Cho Y.S. Kang Y.K. Han Y.M. Reproduction. 2008; 136: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).To achieve inhibitor specificity, one strategy has been to target the kinase inactive conformation, because structural differences between kinases tend to be larger in the inactive state (15Liu Y. Gray N.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 16Johnson L.N. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2009; 42: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitor PP1 binds to the inactive conformation of Hck (17Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), and the cancer drug imatinib binds to the inactive conformations of Abl, c-Kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (15Liu Y. Gray N.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 18Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J.

In several cases, including Abl and c-Kit (18Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), the inactive conformation is observed in the absence of the inhibitor, in an apoprotein crystal structure. Thus, the inhibitor “selects” a conformation that is already populated in its absence. In other cases, such as Src, the DFG-out conformation that is competent for imatinib binding has not been seen in an apocrystal structure and is shown below to have a rather high free energy. Thus, it may be more intuitive to describe the imatinib-Src binding mechanism as an induced fit (22Boehr D.D. Nussinov R. Wright P.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Both conformational selection and induced fit are of broad interest for drug design and molecular recognition (22Boehr D.D.

Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This was initially puzzling, because Src and Abl share a high sequence identity, 47% identity for the catalytic domains of human c-Src and c-Abl. In fact, the Abl crystal structure (18Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) revealed that the inactive conformation of Abl is structurally distinct from the one seen in both Src and Hck (6Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 18Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D.

Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A defining feature of all the inactive conformations of these kinases concerns the so-called activation loop, or A-loop, which includes a conserved DFG motif (Asp381–Phe382–Gly383 in human c-Abl; see Fig. 1). In Abl, this motif adopts a “DFG-out” orientation. In the active state, the DFG motif is in a different “DFG-in” orientation, with its backbone flipped by 180° with respect to DFG-out; the Phe382 side chain then occupies a position that overlaps with the imatinib-binding site (18Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In the inactive Src crystal structure (6Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), the DFG backbone shares the same DFG-in orientation as active Abl and Src, with its Phe side chain overlapping the imatinib site. Thus, the poor Src-imatinib binding has a simple structural explanation.Recently, however, an additional complexity was brought to light for inhibitor binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on a related kinase, p38, showed that the DFG-in and DFG-out conformations were actually in dynamic equilibrium over fairly short time scales (milliseconds) (35Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Hoelder S. Grimme S. Betz M. Schieborr U. Pescatore B. Robin M. Delarbre L. Langer T. Wendt K.U. Schwalbe H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006; 45: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An x-ray structure revealed that the two inactive conformations could coexist in the same crystal (35Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Hoelder S. Grimme S. Betz M. Schieborr U. Pescatore B. Robin M. Delarbre L. Langer T. Wendt K.U. Schwalbe H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006; 45: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was then found that both Src and Abl can also interconvert between two inactive conformations: an Abl-like, DFG-out inactive conformation and a Src-like, DFG-in inactive conformation. Indeed, a recent x-ray structure of Abl (36Levinson N.M. Kuchment O. Shen K. Young M.A. Koldobskiy M. Karplus M. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J.A. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 753-767Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) has a DFG-in inactive conformation, whereas a recent structure of Src (33Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) has a DFG-out inactive conformation. What is more, the Src structure includes an imatinib ligand, bound in the same manner as in DFG-out Abl. This raises a new question regarding the specificity of imatinib. Is the preference for Abl solely due to the intrinsic preference Abl for the DFG-out, Abl-like inactive conformation or is it partly also due to superior protein-ligand interactions?Seeliger et al. (33Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) addressed this question with site-directed mutagenesis experiments. To increase the affinity of Src for imatinib, they swapped residues with the corresponding residues in Abl. They were able to slightly increase drug sensitivity by introducing mutations that are expected to destabilize the DFG-in inactive conformation. Earlier resistance screens had identified Abl mutants with decreased imatinib sensitivity, which may act by destabilizing the DFG-out state, because they involve amino acids that have different positions in the DFG-out and DFG-in states (37Shah N.P. Nicoll J.M. Nagar B. Gorre M.E. Paquette R.L. Kuriyan J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 38Azam M. Latek R.R. Daley G.Q. Cell. 2003; 112: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In contrast, Seeliger et al. (33Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) could not increase Src-imatinib binding by mutating residues that are in direct contact with imatinib. However, imatinib carries a net positive charge when bound to Abl and probably Src (39Aleksandrov A. Simonson T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), so there could be long range stabilizing interactions with more distant Abl residues that are absent in Src but have not yet been identified. For a quantitative answer on the sources of imatinib selectivity, we should decompose the imatinib-kinase binding free energy into the following two components: (i) free energy to bind imatinib to the DFG-out, Abl-like inactive conformation and (ii) the remainder of the binding free energy. This decomposition can be performed in a three-step thought experiment as follows: (a) Abl is first restrained to the DFG-out conformation; (b) imatinib binds; and (c) the restraints are released. The second step, step b, corresponds to free energy contribution i; the other two steps, steps a and c, make up contribution ii. For a kinase like Src, as detailed below, contribution ii can be thought of as the free energy difference between the DFG-in and DFG-out conformations in the absence of imatinib. Indeed, step a essentially pushes Src into a high free energy state (because apo-Src prefers to be DFG-in), whereas the free energy for step c is very small (releasing the restraints has no effect, because holo-Src prefers to be DFG-out). In the general case, the interpretation of contribution ii can be more complicated (see below), but it is always closely related to the relative stability of the DFG-out and DFG-in inactive conformations. We would like to determine the exact contributions i and ii to the total standard imatinib binding free energy difference between Src and Abl, ΔΔGbind = 4.6 kcal/mol (favoring Abl binding). So far, it has not been possible to directly measure either contribution for any kinase.We estimate contribution i to ΔΔGbind using computer simulations. Because the overall ΔΔGbind is known from experiments, we can then deduce the second “conformational” contribution ii. Specifically, we compare imatinib binding to c-Abl, c-Src, c-Kit, and a fourth kinase, Lck, all in their Abl-like, DFG-out inactive conformations.

Agreement was obtained not only for relative binding constants (comparing several ligands) but also for the absolute binding constants of the individual ligands. Other systems that gave close agreement for relative binding constants include peptides binding to the Src domain 2 (47Chipot C. Rozanska X. Dixit S.B. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

Thompson D. Simonson T. J. Mol. Recognit. 2010; 23: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar). To study the present system, we previously developed an accurate molecular mechanics description (a “force field”) for imatinib; we also performed extensive MD simulations to determine its predominant protonation state (positively charged) (39Aleksandrov A. Simonson T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Here, using long MD simulations of Src and Abl (totaling 0.5 μs of molecular dynamics), we obtain excellent precision for contribution i.For the other kinases, Lck and c-Kit, we use a more approximate and much less expensive technique, which employs a continuum electrostatic model to estimate the binding free energy differences. Below, we refer to the first rigorous technique as the “MD free energy method.” The second method involves solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically, and so we refer to it as the “PB free energy method.” A group of similar continuum electrostatic methods are commonly referred to in the literature with the acronym “MM/PBSA” (for Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann-Surface Area) (49Simonson T.

Comparisons for imatinib binding to Abl have been performed and are reported in the supplemental material. Overall, the PB method is expected to be a reasonable proxy for the more rigorous and expensive MD method.Using these methods, we show that for the Src/Abl pair, but also for Src/Kit, Lck/Abl, and Lck/Kit, the binding free energy difference is dominated by the conformational term ii. Contribution i is smaller. Thus, conformational selection is the main factor governing the relative affinities of imatinib, in agreement with the earlier hypothesis (33Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Shah N.P. Nicoll J.M. Nagar B. Gorre M.E. Paquette R.L. Kuriyan J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) data. What is more, by combining the MD data with experimental data and thermodynamic relations, we show that the imatinib ligand actually reports on the conformational free energy surface of apo-Src. Indeed, the Src/Abl binding free energy difference ΔΔGbind closely approximates the free energy difference between the DFG-out and DFG-in inactive conformations of Src in the absence of imatinib (a quantity that is very hard to measure or compute directly (57Ozkirimli E.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3776-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). This makes it difficult to engineer increased binding by chemically modifying the imatinib ligand, although it is not impossible as shown very recently (60Seeliger M.A. Ranjitkar P. Kasap C. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Shah N.P. Kuriyan J. Maly D.J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2384-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Before concluding this section, we must consider the relation between conformational selection and induced fit (22Boehr D.D. Nussinov R. Wright P.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 29Lange O.F. Lakomek N.A. Farès C. Schröder G.F. Walter K.F. Becker S. Meiler J. Grubmüller H.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19346-19351Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and explain a choice of vocabulary. According to equilibrium statistical mechanics, even the highest energy conformations of an apokinase have a non-zero population, so a ligand always “selects” a pre-existing conformation. Thus, there is no real theoretical distinction between conformational selection and induced fit. In practice, in the biochemical literature, the distinction is often made depending on the high or low free energy of the selected conformation; if the free energy is “high” in the apoprotein, one speaks of induced fit (22Boehr D.D. Nussinov R. Wright P.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 29Lange O.F. Lakomek N.A. Farès C. Schröder G.F. Walter K.F. Becker S. Meiler J. Grubmüller H.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19346-19351Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we prefer to describe the imatinib-binding mechanism in all cases as a conformational selection and to simply distinguish cases where the relevant DFG-out conformation is “easy” to select (it has a “low” free energy in the apokinase) or “hard” to select (it has a high free energy in the apokinase). Thus, induced fit is viewed as a special case of conformational selection. This choice of vocabulary is made for convenience, because the mechanism of binding will always be evident from the context. It does not question in an"
https://openalex.org/W2085774288,"Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important causal role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and diabetes mellitus. Insight into the genetic determinants responsible for ER homeostasis will greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these debilitating diseases. Suppressor enhancer Lin12 1 like (SEL1L) is an ER membrane protein and was thought to be involved in the quality control of secreted proteins. Here we show that the mice homozygous mutant for SEL1L were embryonic lethal. Electron microscopy studies revealed a severely dilated ER in the fetal liver of mutant embryos, indicative of alteration in ER homeostasis. Consistent with this, several ER stress responsive genes were significantly up-regulated in the mutant embryos. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells deficient in SEL1L exhibited activated unfolded protein response at the basal state, impaired ER-associated protein degradation, and reduced protein secretion. Furthermore, markedly increased apoptosis was observed in the forebrain and dorsal root ganglions of mutant embryos. Taken together, our results demonstrate an essential role for SEL1L in protein quality control during mouse embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1968275334,"The main aim of our study is to determine the significance of the stromal microenvironment in the malignant behavior of prostate cancer. The stroma-derived growth factors/cytokines and hyaluronan act in autocrine/paracrine ways with their receptors, including receptor-tyrosine kinases and CD44 variants (CD44v), to potentiate and support tumor epithelial cell survival. Overexpression of hyaluronan, CD44v9 variants, and stroma-derived growth factors/cytokines are specific features in many cancers, including prostate cancer. Androgen/androgen receptor interaction has a critical role in regulating prostate cancer growth. Our previous study showed that 1) that increased synthesis of hyaluronan in normal epithelial cells promotes expression of CD44 variants; 2) hyaluronan interaction with CD44v6-v9 promotes activation of receptor-tyrosine kinase, which stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-induced cell survival pathways; and 3) CD44v6/short hairpin RNA reduces colon tumor growth in vivo (Misra, S., Hascall, V. C., De Giovanni, C., Markwald, R. R., and Ghatak, S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 12432–12446). Our results now show that hepatocyte growth factor synthesized by myofibroblasts associated with prostate cancer cells induces activation of HGF-receptor/cMet and stimulates hyaluronan/CD44v9 signaling. This, in turn, stabilizes the androgen receptor functions in prostate cancer cells. The stroma-derived HGF induces a lipid raft-associated signaling complex that contains CD44v9, cMet/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, HSP90 and androgen receptor. CD44v9/short hairpin RNA reverses the assembly of these components in the complex and inhibits androgen receptor function. Our results provide new insight into the hyaluronan/CD44v9-regulated androgen receptor function and the consequent malignant activities in prostate cancer cells.

Alternate splicing and post-translational modification of CD44 variants in pathological conditions enhances hyaluronan binding and increases tumorigenicity (32Naor D. Nedvetzki S. Golan I. Melnik L. Faitelson Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 527-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of CD44v9 (variant 9) promotes the malignant behavior of prostate cancer cells (33Omara-Opyene A.L. Qiu J. Shah G.V. Iczkowski K.A. Lab. Invest. 2004; 84: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, up-regulation of the CD44s reduces the tumorigenicity of prostate tumor cells (34Miyake H. Hara I. Okamoto I.

Urol. 1998; 160: 2004-2008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of CD44 variants in prostate cancer. Recent studies also indicate important roles of stroma-derived HGF in prostate cancer growth and metastasis (36Fujita K. Ewing C.M. Sokoll L.J. Elliott D.J. Cunningham M. De Marzo A.M. Isaacs W.B. Pavlovich C.P. Prostate. 2008; 68: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HGF modifies the phenotype of the epithelial cells, thereby promoting tumor cell invasiveness, and induces up-regulation of CD44 variants in cancer cells (37Orian-Rousseau V. Chen L. Sleeman J.P. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we showed that experimental up-regulation of hyaluronan synthesis in phenotypically normal intestinal epithelial cells stimulated MMP1/2/9 production as well as CD44v6 (variant 6) expression (38Misra S. Hascall V.C. Berger F.G. Markwald R.R. Ghatak S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that increased hyaluronan stimulates CD44 variants in normal epithelial cells (18Misra S. Hascall V.C. De Giovanni C. Markwald R.R. Ghatak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12432-12446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that hyaluronan/CD44 variant interactions activate multiple receptor tyrosine kinases in prostate and other cancers (20Misra S. Toole B.P. Ghatak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34936-34941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to facilitating cell invasion, hyaluronan interacting with CD44 variants acts as a physiological stimulus for macrophage cytokine and growth factor production (21Zoltan-Jones A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These cytokines/growth factors in turn can stimulate CD44 variants formation and increased hyaluronan binding (40Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6184-6194PubMed Google Scholar). Hyaluronan binding to “constitutively activated” CD44 variants (CD44v) induces intracellular signaling during cell dynamic processes but does not do so under conditions of adult tissue homeostasis (40Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 42He Q. Lesley J. Hyman R. Ishihara K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the cellular processes and the associated molecular mechanisms by which this important HGF-induced hyaluronan/CD44v9 signaling cascade mediates invasiveness through PI3K-androgen receptor activity remain largely unknown. To understand the tumor biology underlying prostate cancer growth through the regulatory effects of the hyaluronan/CD44v9 interaction on androgen receptor-mediated malignant activities, we used human prostatic epithelial cells of normal and malignant prostate tumor origin and associated myofibroblasts in a coculture system to recreate possible interactions between prostate cancer cells and surrounding stromal myofibroblasts. The results suggest that prostate tumor epithelial cells up-regulate HGF production in prostate cancer-associated myofibroblasts, whereas myofibroblast-derived HGF and hyaluronan lead to invasive growth in prostate cancer cells by inducing cMet activation and by augmenting hyaluronan/CD44 variant-induced signaling, which, in turn, stabilizes the androgen receptor functions in these cells. We provide evidence that 1) IGF1 and TNF-α produced by the tumor cells induce HGF production in the prostate cancer-associated myofibroblasts; 2) stromal HGF induces hyaluronan, which then interacts with CD44v9 to activate cMet to form a lipid raft-associated multimeric signaling complex that contains CD44v9, phosphorylated cMet (p-cMet), androgen receptor, HSP90, and p110α/PI3K (catalytic subunit of PI3K), and stability of this signaling complex is necessary for androgen receptor function and consequent cell invasiveness; 3) androgen receptor directly interacts with CD44v9, and blocking androgen/receptor inhibits HGF-induced CD44v9 expression and function; 4) the androgen (DT) stimulates hyaluronan-induced CD44v9 signaling in DT-dependent LNCaP cells, which correlates with endogenously activated hyaluronan/CD44v9 signaling of DT-independent C4-2 cells; and 5) CD44v9/short hairpin RNA (shRNA) reverses hyaluronan/CD44v9/cMet-associated signaling, decreases androgen receptor function, and increases apoptotic pathway responses. These results strongly suggest that interaction of androgen receptor and CD44v9 is essential for regulating hyaluronan-mediated invasiveness in prostate cancer and provide evidence for an important paracrine role for stroma-derived HGF in regulating the effects of androgen receptor- and hyaluronan/CD44v9-dependent malignant signaling in prostate cancer.

Double-stranded oligonucleotide cassettes for CD44v9 shRNA, CD44v5 shRNA, and CD44v10 shRNA were prepared.

The resulting pSicoR-CD44/variant shRNA transfectants constitutively silence respective CD44 variants in the cells. pSicoR-CD44v9 shRNA silences CD44v9 or any variant that contains v9, such as CD44v6–9. Scrambled shRNA (scrshRNA) was cloned into the pRS vector, and the androgen receptor shRNA plasmids are from Origene. The soft agar tetrazolium assay was done as described previously (3Aaltomaa S.

Preparation of cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, and immunoprecipitation analyses were done as described previously (17Misra S. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

Separation of lipid raft fractions was done with the lysates of C4-2 cells that had been pretreated with HGF (10 ng/ml for 12 h) or that were transfected with scrambled silencing RNA (control siRNA), with HAS2 siRNA, with pSicoR scrambled shRNA (control shRNA), or with pSicoR-CD44v9 shRNA (v9 shRNA) prior to induction with HGF. Transfected and treated cells were extracted in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer and adjusted to ∼45% sucrose. This was then overlaid with equal volumes of 35 and 5% sucrose for step gradient centrifugation as described in our earlier work (22Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Eight fractions (300 μl) were collected from the bottom up of the gradients using a minipump, and 50 μl from each fraction was immunoprecipitated with cMet antibody and was Western blotted for p-cMet, androgen receptor, HSP90, p110α/PI3K, p85/PI3K (regulatory subunit of PI3K), and CD44. This analysis revealed that phospho-cMet (p-cMet) was distributed throughout the gradient, whereas androgen receptor, HSP90, p110α/PI3K, p85/PI3K, and CD44 were enriched in the middle fractions (fractions 2–5) of the gradient (data not shown). Because fractions 2–5 from the gradients correspond to the putative rafts as described in our previous work (22Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), these pooled fractions were collected to study protein/protein interaction by immunoprecipitating with antibody against cMet (Fig. 8A) or CD44 (Fig. 8B). Western blots were prepared from the immunoprecipitates with antibodies against cMet, p-cMet, and CD44 as well as for the p110α and p85 subunits of PI3K, androgen receptor, and β-actin. The cells were also treated with 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, which extracts cholesterol from cell membranes and causes disassembly of lipid rafts prior to extraction and gradient centrifugation. This treatment caused all of the p-cMet, HSP90, p110α/PI3K, p85/PI3K, and CD44 to concentrate in the bottom fractions (fractions 6–8) of the gradient. Some of the p-cMet remained in the top fractions (fractions 2–5) from the gradient, whereas the rest was concentrated in the bottom fractions (fractions 6–8). The differences in amounts of p-cMet, androgen receptor, and CD44 present in pooled fractions (fractions 2–8) can be calculated from cells treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin versus the amounts present in these fractions (fractions 2–8) from cells that were not treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Thus, estimations of the amounts of lipid raft-associated p-cMet, androgen receptor, and CD44 present in the cMet-immunoprecipitated fractions (fractions 2–8) of step gradient centrifugation from the lysates of cells treated with or without methyl-β-cyclodextrin were obtained. These amounts are plotted in Fig. 8C (the data for CD44 are not shown). Primers for human CD44 variants were used as described previously (46van Weering D.H. Baas P.D. Bos J.L.

https://openalex.org/W1999959431,"Protein misfolding is usually deleterious for the cell, either as a consequence of the loss of protein function or the buildup of insoluble and toxic aggregates. The aggregation behavior of a given polypeptide is strongly influenced by the intrinsic properties encoded in its sequence. This has allowed the development of effective computational methods to predict protein aggregation propensity.Here, we use the AGGRESCAN algorithm to approximate the aggregation profile of an experimental cytosolic Escherichia coli proteome. The analysis indicates that the aggregation propensity of bacterial proteins is associated with their length, conformation, location, function, and abundance. The data are consistent with the predictions of other algorithms on different theoretical proteomes.Overall, the study suggests that the avoidance of protein aggregation in functional environments acts as a strong evolutionary constraint on polypeptide sequences in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2046053700,"Background Acute lung injury (ALI) and the development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a major cause of death in trauma patients. Earlier studies in trauma hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) have documented that splanchnic ischemia leading to gut inflammation and loss of barrier function is an initial triggering event that leads to gut-induced ARDS and MODS. Since sex hormones have been shown to modulate the response to T/HS and proestrous (PE) females are more resistant to T/HS-induced gut and distant organ injury, the goal of our study was to determine the contribution of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ in modulating the protective response of female rats to T/HS-induced gut and lung injury. Methods/Principal Findings The incidence of gut and lung injury was assessed in PE and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats subjected to T/HS or trauma sham shock (T/SS) as well as OVX rats that were administered estradiol (E2) or agonists for ERα or ERβ immediately prior to resuscitation. Marked gut and lung injury was observed in OVX rats subjected to T/HS as compared to PE rats or E2-treated OVX rats subjected to T/HS. Both ERα and ERβ agonists were equally effective in limiting T/HS-induced morphologic villous injury and bacterial translocation, whereas the ERβ agonist was more effective than the ERα agonist in limiting T/HS-induced lung injury as determined by histology, Evan's blue lung permeability, bronchoalevolar fluid/plasma protein ratio and myeloperoxidase levels. Similarly, treatment with either E2 or the ERβ agonist attenuated the induction of the intestinal iNOS response in OVX rats subjected to T/HS whereas the ERα agonist was only partially protective. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that estrogen attenuates T/HS-induced gut and lung injury and that its protective effects are mediated by the activation of ERα, ERβ or both receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2010212668,"Glaucoma is a disease frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure that can be alleviated by filtration surgery. However, the post-operative subconjunctival scarring response which blocks filtration efficiency is a major hurdle to the achievement of long-term surgical success. Current application of anti-proliferatives to modulate the scarring response is not ideal as these often give rise to sight-threatening complications. SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) is a matricellular protein involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) production and organization. In this study, we investigated post-operative surgical wound survival in an experimental glaucoma filtration model in SPARC-null mice. Loss of SPARC resulted in a marked (87.5%) surgical wound survival rate compared to 0% in wild-type (WT) counterparts. The larger SPARC-null wounds implied that aqueous filtration through the subconjunctival space was more efficient in comparison to WT wounds. The pronounced increase in both surgical survival and filtration efficiency was associated with a less collagenous ECM, smaller collagen fibril diameter, and a loosely-organized subconjunctival matrix in the SPARC-null wounds. In contrast, WT wounds exhibited a densely packed collagenous ECM with no evidence of filtration capacity. Immunolocalization assays confirmed the accumulation of ECM proteins in the WT but not in the SPARC-null wounds. The observations in vivo were corroborated by complementary data performed on WT and SPARC-null conjunctival fibroblasts in vitro. These findings indicate that depletion of SPARC bestows an inherent change in post-operative ECM remodeling to favor wound maintenance. The evidence presented in this report is strongly supportive for the targeting of SPARC to increase the success of glaucoma filtration surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2043910002,"Background We have examined the genomic distribution of large rare autosomal deletions in a sample of 440 parent-parent-child trios from the Quebec founder population (QFP) which was recruited for a study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Methodology/Principal Findings DNA isolated from blood was genotyped on Illumina Hap300 arrays. PennCNV combined with visual evaluation of images generated by the Beadstudio program was used to determine deletion boundary definition of sufficient precision to discern independent events, with near-perfect concordance between parent and child in about 98% of the 399 events detected in the offspring; the remaining 7 deletions were considered de novo. We defined several genomic regions of very high deletion frequency (‘hotspots’), usually of 0.4–0.6 Mb in length where independent rare deletions were found at frequencies of up to 100 fold higher than the average for the genome as a whole. Five of the 7 de novo deletions were in these hotspots. The same hotspots were also observed in three other studies on members of the QFP, those with schizophrenia, with endometriosis and those from a longevity cohort. Conclusions/Significance Nine of the 13 hotspots carry one gene (7 of which are very long), while the rest contain no known genes. All nine genes have been implicated in disease. The patterns of exon deletions support the proposed roles for some of these genes in human disease, such as NRXN1 and PARKIN, and suggest limited roles or no role at all, for others, including MACROD2 and CTNNA3. Our results also offer an alternative interpretation for the observations of deletions in tumors which have been proposed as reflecting tumor-suppressive activity of genes in these hotspots."

https://openalex.org/W1966167980,"Advanced light microscopy offers sensitive and non-invasive means to image neural activity and to control signaling with photolysable molecules and, recently, light-gated channels. These approaches require precise and yet flexible light excitation patterns. For synchronous stimulation of subsets of cells, they also require large excitation areas with millisecond and micrometric resolution. We have recently developed a new method for such optical control using a phase holographic modulation of optical wave-fronts, which minimizes power loss, enables rapid switching between excitation patterns, and allows a true 3D sculpting of the excitation volumes. In previous studies we have used holographic photololysis to control glutamate uncaging on single neuronal cells. Here, we extend the use of holographic photolysis for the excitation of multiple neurons and of glial cells.The system combines a liquid crystal device for holographic patterned photostimulation, high-resolution optical imaging, the HiLo microscopy, to define the stimulated regions and a conventional Ca(2+) imaging system to detect neural activity. By means of electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging in acute hippocampal slices, we show that the use of excitation patterns precisely tailored to the shape of multiple neuronal somata represents a very efficient way for the simultaneous excitation of a group of neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that fast shaped illumination patterns also induce reliable responses in single glial cells.We show that the main advantage of holographic illumination is that it allows for an efficient excitation of multiple cells with a spatiotemporal resolution unachievable with other existing approaches. Although this paper focuses on the photoactivation of caged molecules, our approach will surely prove very efficient for other probes, such as light-gated channels, genetically encoded photoactivatable proteins, photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, and voltage-sensitive dyes."
https://openalex.org/W1974449587,"Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonosis that affects livestock and humans and is caused by closely related Brucella spp., which are adapted to intracellular life within cells of a large variety of mammals. Brucella can be considered a furtive pathogen that infects professional and non-professional phagocytes. In these cells Brucella survives in a replicative niche, which is characterized for having a very low oxygen tension and being deprived from nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins. Among these vitamins, we have focused on riboflavin (vitamin B2). Flavin metabolism has been barely implicated in bacterial virulence. We have recently described that Brucella and other Rhizobiales bear an atypical riboflavin metabolic pathway. In the present work we analyze the role of the flavin metabolism on Brucella virulence. Mutants on the two lumazine synthases (LS) isoenzymes RibH1 and RibH2 and a double RibH mutant were generated. These mutants and different complemented strains were tested for viability and virulence in cells and in mice. In this fashion we have established that at least one LS must be present for B. abortus survival and that RibH2 and not RibH1 is essential for intracellular survival due to its LS activity in vivo. In summary, we show that riboflavin biosynthesis is essential for Brucella survival inside cells or in mice. These results highlight the potential use of flavin biosynthetic pathway enzymes as targets for the chemotherapy of brucellosis."

Although it has been shown that chemokines bind and activate their respective G protein-coupled receptors as monomers, many chemokines oligomerize upon GAG binding, and the ability to oligomerize and bind GAGs is required for in vivo function. In this study, we investigated the structure, dynamics, and oligomerization behavior of cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK, also known as CCL27) by NMR. 15N relaxation and translational self-diffusion rates indicate that CCL27 oligomerizes, but in contrast to many other chemokines that form relatively discrete oligomers, CCL27 transitions between monomer, dimer, and tetramer species over a relatively narrow concentration range. A three-dimensional structure determination was pursued under conditions where CCL27 is primarily dimeric, revealing the standard motif for a chemokine monomer. Analysis of chemical shift perturbations of 1H-15N HSQC spectra, relaxation-dispersion experiments, and filtered nuclear Overhauser effects suggest that CCL27 does not adopt a discrete CXC or CC dimer motif. Instead, CCL27 has uncommon oligomerization behavior, where several equilibria involving relatively low affinity interactions between different interfaces seem to be simultaneously at work. However, interaction with heparin avidly promotes oligomerization under conditions where CCL27 is monomeric by itself. We hypothesize that the plasticity in the oligomerization state may enable CCL27 to adopt different oligomeric structures, depending on the nature of the GAG binding partner, thereby providing a mechanism for increased diversity and specificity in GAG-binding and GAG-related functions.

https://openalex.org/W2008504652,"Artemisinin, a thapsigargin-like sesquiterpene has been shown to inhibit the Plasmodium falciparum sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase PfSERCA. To collect baseline pfserca sequence information before field deployment of Artemisinin-based Combination therapies that may select mutant parasites, we conducted a sequence analysis of 100 isolates from multiple sites in Africa, Asia and South America. Coding sequence diversity was large, with 29 mutated codons, including 32 SNPs (average of one SNP/115 bp), of which 19 were novel mutations. Most SNP detected in this study were clustered within a region in the cytosolic head of the protein. The PfSERCA functional domains were very well conserved, with non synonymous mutations located outside the functional domains, except for the S769N mutation associated in French Guiana with elevated IC(50) for artemether. The S769N mutation is located close to the hinge of the headpiece, which in other species modulates calcium affinity and in consequence efficacy of inhibitors, possibly linking calcium homeostasis to drug resistance. Genetic diversity was highest in Senegal, Brazil and French Guiana, and few mutations were identified in Asia. Population genetic analysis was conducted for a partial fragment of the gene encompassing nucleotide coordinates 87-2862 (unambiguous sequence available for 96 isolates). This supported a geographic clustering, with a separation between Old and New World samples and one dominant ancestral haplotype. Genetic drift alone cannot explain the observed polymorphism, suggesting that other evolutionary mechanisms are operating. One possible contributor could be the frequency of haemoglobinopathies that are associated with calcium dysregulation in the erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2039132487,"NBCe1-A electrogenically cotransports Na(+) and HCO(3)(-) across the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. Eight missense mutations and 3 nonsense mutations in NBCe1-A cause severe proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA). In this study, the topologic properties and structural importance of the 8 endogenous residues mutated in pRTA and the in situ topology of NBCe1-A were examined by the substituted cysteine accessibility method. Of the 55 analyzed individually introduced cysteines, 8 were labeled with both membrane permeant (biotin maleimide (BM)) and impermeant (2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine)carboxylamino)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA)) sulfhydryl reagents, 4 with only BM, and 3 with only MTS-TAMRA. The location of the labeled and unlabeled introduced cysteines clearly indicates that the transmembrane region of NBCe1-A contains 14 transmembrane segments (TMs). In this in situ based NBCe1-A topology, residues mutated in pRTA (pRTA residues) are assigned as: Ser(427), TM1; Thr(485) and Gly(486), TM3; Arg(510) and Leu(522), TM4; Ala(799), TM10; and Arg(881), TM12. Substitution of pRTA residues with cysteines impaired the membrane trafficking of R510C and R881C, the remaining membrane-processed constructs had various impaired transport function. Surprisingly, none of the membrane-processed constructs was accessible to labeling with BM and MTS-TAMRA, nor were they functionally sensitive to the inhibition by (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate. Functional analysis of Thr(485) with different amino acid substitutions indicated it resides in a unique region important for NBCe1-A function. Our findings demonstrate that the pRTA residues in NBCe1-A are buried in the protein complex/lipid bilayer where they perform important structural roles."
https://openalex.org/W2048425249,"Background Defensins are natural endogenous antimicrobial peptides with potent anti-HIV activity and immuno-modulatory effects. We recently demonstrated that immature dendritic cells (DC) produce α-defensins1-3 and that α-defensins1-3 modulate DC generation and maturation. Since DC-HIV interaction plays a critical role during the first steps of HIV infection, we investigated the possible impact of α-defensins1-3 production by DC on disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings Monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) were analyzed comparatively in healthy controls (HC) and HIV-infected patients, including untreated “elite” and “viremic” controllers, untreated viremic non-controllers and antiretroviral-treated patients. We found that production of α-defensins1-3 was significantly increased in MDDC from HIV-infected patients versus HC, and this increase was mainly due to that observed in controllers, while in non-controllers the increase was not statistically significant (controllers vs. HC, p<0.005; controllers vs. non-controllers p<0.05). Secreted α-defensins1-3 by immature MDDC positively correlated with CD4 T cell counts in controllers, but not in non-controllers. Moreover, independently of their clinical classification, HIV-infected patients with higher α-defensins1-3 secretion by immature MDDC showed slower disease progression, measured as no decrease in the number of CD4+ T-cells below 350 cell/mm3, lower increase of plasma viral load and no initiation of treatment over time. Plasma alpha-defensins1-3 levels lacked any relationship with immunologic and virologic parameters. Conclusions/Significance High production of α-defensins1-3 by immature DCs appears as a host protective factor against progression of HIV-1infection, suggesting potential diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive implications. This protective effect may arise from the activity of α-defensins1-3 to damage the virions prior and/or after their internalization by immature DC, and hence favoring a more efficient viral processing and presentation to HIV-specific CD4+ T cells, without or with a minor rate of transmission of infectious HIV-1 virions."

https://openalex.org/W1999800243,"Background Cellular contact with stimulated T cells is a potent inducer of cytokine production in human monocytes and is likely to play a substantial part in chronic/sterile inflammatory diseases. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) specifically inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by T cell contact. Methodology/Principal Findings To further elucidate the pro-inflammatory functions of cellular contact with stimulated T cells and its inhibition by HDL, we carried out multiplex and microarray analyses. Multiplex analysis of monocyte supernatant revealed that 12 out of 27 cytokines were induced upon contact with stimulated T cells, which cytokines included IL-1Ra, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNγ, CCL2, CCL5, TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CCL3, and CCL4, but only the latter six were inhibited by HDL. Microarray analysis showed that 437 out of 54,675 probe sets were enhanced in monocytes activated by contact with stimulated T cells, 164 probe sets (i.e., 38%) being inhibited by HDL. These results were validated by qPCR. Interestingly, the cytokines induced by T cell contact in monocytes comprised IL-1β, IL-6 but not IL-12, suggesting that this mechanism might favor Th17 polarization, which emphasizes the relevance of this mechanism to chronic inflammatory diseases and highlights the contrast with acute inflammatory conditions that usually involve lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In addition, the expression of miR-155 and production of prostaglandin E2—both involved in inflammatory response—were triggered by T cell contact and inhibited in the presence of HDL. Conclusions/Significance These results leave no doubt as to the pro-inflammatory nature of T cell contact-activation of human monocytes and the anti-inflammatory functions of HDL."
https://openalex.org/W2036131623,"Background Carotenoids can confer somatic and reproductive benefits, but most evidence is from captive animal experimentation or single time-point sampling. Another perhaps more informative means by which to assess physiological contributions to animal performance is by tracking an individual's ability to increase or sustain carotenoids or other health-related molecules over time, as these are likely to be temporally variable. Methodology/Principal Findings In a field study of North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster), we analyzed within-individual changes in carotenoid concentrations by repeatedly sampling the carotenoid profiles of individuals over the course of the breeding season. Our results demonstrate that carotenoid concentrations of individuals are temporally dynamic and that season-long balance of these molecules, rather than single time-point samples, predict reproductive performance. This was true even when controlling for two important variables associated with reproductive outcomes: (1) timing of breeding and (2) sexually selected plumage coloration, which is itself positively correlated with and concomitantly changes with circulating carotenoid concentrations. Conclusions/Significance While reproduction itself is purported to impose health stress on organisms, these data suggest that free-ranging, high-quality individuals can mitigate such costs, by one or several genetic, environmental (diet), or physiological mechanisms. Moreover, the temporal variations in both health-linked physiological measures and morphological traits we uncover here merit further examination in other species, especially when goals include the estimation of signal information content or the costs of trait expression."
https://openalex.org/W2032258002,"Importin beta mediates active passage of cellular substrates through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Adaptors such as importin alpha and snurportin associate with importin beta via an importin beta binding (IBB) domain. The intrinsic structural flexibility of importin beta allows its concerted interactions with IBB domains, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins, and the GTPase Ran during transport. In this paper, we provide evidence that the nature of the IBB domain modulates the affinity of the import complex for the NPC. In permeabilized cells, importin beta imports a cargo fused to the snurportin IBB (sIBB) with approximately 70% reduced energy requirement as compared with the classical importin alpha IBB. At the molecular level, this is explained by approximately 200-fold reduced affinity of importin beta for Nup62, when bound to the sIBB. Consistently, in vivo, the importin beta.sIBB complex has greatly reduced persistence inside the central channel of the NPC. We propose that by controlling the degree of strain in the tertiary structure of importin beta, the IBB domain modulates the affinity of the import complex for nucleoporins, thus dictating its persistence inside the NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2119201577,"Techniques for analyzing the membrane diffusion of molecules are the most promising methods for investigating the compartmentalization of G-protein-coupled receptors, particularly as relevant to receptor signaling processes. Here, we report fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements performed at variable spot radius for human mu opioid (hMOP) receptors on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in the presence of ligands. Although an antagonist did not affect the behavior of the receptors compared with the basal state, two different agonists, DAMGO and morphine, caused markedly different changes to receptor diffusion. Like receptors in the absence of ligand, receptors bound to morphine exhibited diffusion confined to joined semipermeable domains, but with smaller domain size and diffusion coefficient. This effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin, strongly suggesting that this dynamic behavior is associated with early steps of signaling. In the presence of DAMGO, half of the receptors displayed free long-range diffusion and the other half were confined to smaller isolated domains. Hypertonic sucrose buffer suppressed this effect, which we attribute to receptor entry into clathrin-coated pits. It is likely that the observation of distinct receptor dynamics in the presence of DAMGO and morphine involves the agonist-selective phosphorylation of the receptor."

The anti-phospho-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-His tag clone HIS1, EGF, sphingosine 1 phosphate, and carbachol were obtained from Sigma. Different anti-phospho-ERK5 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen, Abcam, Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or Upstate Biotech Millipore. The Src inhibitor PP2 and the EGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 were obtained from Calbiochem. Myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide (Myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL) was obtained from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). G protein-Sepharose and ProBond resins were obtained from Invitrogen. Pertussis toxin was obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other reagents were of the highest commercially available grades. COS-7 and NIH 3T3-ml cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) or newborn serum (Invitrogen), respectively, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from wild-type or PKCζ−/− mice were cultured as described previously (18Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. García J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The desired cell type was stimulated with carbachol (10 μm) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (100 nm) at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium during the indicated time periods. The cells were serum-starved for 5–6 h before ligand addition to minimize basal kinase activity. Treatments with the Src inhibitor PP2 (10 μm), AG1478 (250 nm), the PLCβ inhibitor U73122 (10 μm), or the PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (10 μm) were initiated 30 min before agonist stimulation. For the inactivation of Gi proteins, cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 16 h. COS-7 or 3T3 cells (70–80% confluent monolayers in 60- or 100-mm dishes) were transiently transfected with the desired combinations of cDNA constructs using the Lipofectamine Plus method, following the manufacturer's instructions. Empty vector was added to keep the total amount of DNA per dish constant. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Transient expression of the desired proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates using specific antisera, as described below. The activation state of ERK1/2 and ERK5 was measured by Western blot analysis of cell lysates by using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:500) as reported previously (19Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or anti-ERK5 (1:500) antibodies, respectively. In the latter case, the stimulation of ERK5 can be detected by the presence of a band with slower electrophoretic mobility that represents the active, phosphorylated form of the protein (20Xu B.E. Stippec S. Lenertz L. Lee B.H. Zhang W. Lee Y.K. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7826-7831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or by using specific anti-phospho ERK5 antibodies. To obtain cell lysates, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer plus 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus a mixture of protease inhibitors). Lysates were resolved by 6–10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (19Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by laser-scanner densitometry, and the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 or phosphorylated ERK5 protein was normalized to the amount of the total ERK1/2 or ERK5 protein, as assessed by the specific antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, as indicated. Immunoprecipitation assays of co-transfected proteins were performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were scraped and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 500 μl/100-mm dish of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and an aliquot (30 μl) was used to assess protein expression levels. The immunoprecipitation reactions were performed by incubating the supernatants with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the specific antibodies for HA (12CA5, 4 μg), Gαq (C19, 2 μg), PKCζ (H1, 0.6 μg), or GST (Z5, 2 μg) at 4 °C overnight followed by reincubation with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, as reported previously (21Mariggiò S. García-Hoz C. Sarnago S. De Blasi A. Mayor Jr., F. Ribas C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, 80% confluent monolayers from two 100-mm dishes of cultured cells were used. Cell lysates were tested for protein expression by using the required specific antibodies. Additionally, to identify MEK5 interaction partners, lysates from cells expressing GST-MEK5 (or GST alone as a negative control) were subjected to GST pulldown assays with glutathione-Sepharose 4B as reported previously (21Mariggiò S. García-Hoz C. Sarnago S. De Blasi A. Mayor Jr., F. Ribas C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All blots were developed using the chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). When required, bands were quantified by laser-scanner densitometry, and the amount of co-precipitated protein was normalized to the amount of the immunoprecipitated protein, as assessed by the specific antibodies. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, as indicated. Purified recombinant Gαq (10–20 nm) was incubated at 4 °C with purified His-PKCζ (20 nm) or GST-MEK5 (100 nm) fusion proteins (or GST 100 nm as a negative control) in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 70 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.01% Lubrol plus a mixture of protease inhibitors). Subsequently, ProBond (for His PKCζ) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (for GST-MEK5) resins was added for 2 h at 4 °C, after which the affinity matrix was pelleted and washed four times with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer (in the presence of 10 mm imidazole in experiments involving His-PKCζ). Proteins retained on the matrix were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was then performed with the anti-Gαq (C-19, (1:1000)), anti-histidine (1:1000), or anti-GST (1:500) antibodies, depending on the experiment. Previous studies indicated that GPCR that can couple to the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, such as m1-muscarinic and thrombin receptors, were able to promote ERK5 activation in COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells (15Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Marinissen M.J. Servitja J.M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46814-46825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanisms involved, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing the human m1-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (NIH 3T3-m1R) (22Crespo P. Xu N. Daniotti J.L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were stimulated with carbachol for different periods of time. This agonist promoted a clear, time-dependent increase in endogenous ERK5 activation (Fig. 1A) that can be detected by immunoblot analysis with an ERK5 antibody by the appearance of a band of slower electrophoretic mobility (corresponding to the phosphorylated, stimulated kinase), which comigrated with the band detected with different ERK5-phosphospecific antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the latter method was, in our hands, less sensitive (supplemental Fig. S1, lower panel), the band-shift method was routinely used to assess ERK5 stimulation. Activation of ERK5 by different mitogens may involve Src tyrosine kinase (9Sun W. Kesavan K. Schaefer B.C. Garrington T.P. Ware M. Johnson N.L. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and can also be triggered by EGF (10Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, stimulation of ERK5 by muscarinic agonists was not affected in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2 (supplemental Fig. S2A) or the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (supplemental Fig. S2B). On the other hand, ERK5 activation by carbachol was not affected by the presence of the PLCβ inhibitor U73122, whereas ERK1/2 stimulation was markedly decreased (Fig. 1B). Moreover, expression of a GTPase-deficient, constitutively active Gαq mutant (GqR183C) mimicked ERK5 activation by Gq-coupled GPCR in NIH 3T3-m1R cells, and the same was true for the other constitutively active construct (Gq Q209L-AA), previously shown to be unable to interact with the known Gαq effector PLCβ (Fig. 1, C and D) (23Fan G. Ballou L.M. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52432-52436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggested that Gq-coupled GPCR trigger the stimulation of the ERK5 cascade by biochemical routes involving Gαq but not its classical effector PLCβ, nor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases nor EGF receptor transactivation. It has been previously shown that the atypical PKC isoform PKCζ interacts with MEK5 in a growth factor-inducible manner and that such interaction is required and sufficient for the activation of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway (10Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some groups had reported that agonists acting through Gq-coupled GPCR such as angiotensin (24Takeishi Y. Jalili T. Ball N.A. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Parmentier J.H. Zhang C. Estes A. Schaefer S. Malik K.U. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Hypertension. 2003; 41: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were able to promote PKCζ translocation, although the mechanisms involved and the potential triggering of downstream cascades were not explored in detail. Therefore, we sought to determine whether PKCζ could be involved in Gαq-mediated GPCR stimulation of the ERK5 pathway. To test this hypothesis, NIH 3T3-m1 cells were pretreated or not with a cell-permeable myristoylated-PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor (27Godeny M.D. Sayeski P.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C1297-C1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Parmentier J.H. Smelcer P. Pavicevic Z. Basic E. Idrizovic A. Estes A. Malik K.U. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the presence of the inhibitor promotes a marked decrease in the percentage of phosphorylated endogenous ERK5 in response to the agonist carbachol. Similar results were obtained when overexpressing a dominant-negative PKCζ-mutant (11.1 ± 2.6% of phosphorylated HA-ERK5 after a 30-min stimulation with carbachol in its absence versus 6.5 ± 0.9% in its presence). To further establish that PKCζ is required for ERK5 stimulation by Gq-coupled GPCR in a physiological setting, we investigated this pathway in cells derived from PKCζ-deficient mice (18Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. García J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Using MEFs from wild-type mice, we found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an agonist that can stimulate both Gi-coupled and Gq-coupled endogenous receptors (29Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), promoted a clear increase in ERK5 activation that was not affected by the presence of pertussis toxin (supplemental Fig. S3A), thus indicating that this process did not involve G proteins of the Gi subfamily. In contrast, S1P-mediated ERK1/2 stimulation was markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin (supplemental Fig. S3B). Interestingly, although S1P significantly increased ERK5 activity in MEFs from wild-type (WT) mice (1.89 ± 0.38-fold over basal at 15 min of treatment, p < 0.05, two-tailed t test), no ERK5 activation over basal levels (0.74 ± 0.37-fold) could be observed when MEFs obtained from PKCζ knock-out mice were used (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the stimulation of ERK1/2 was detected in these cells to an extent similar to that observed in WT MEFs (supplemental Fig. S3B), indicating that the effect of PKCζ deficiency is specific to the ERK5 pathway and does not lead to a general decrease in receptor signaling. To investigate how Gαq and PKCζ functionally interact to promote ERK5 stimulation, we expressed an HA-tagged PKCζ construct together with wild-type or active Gαq (the GTPase-deficient Gαq R183C mutant) and performed immunoprecipitation assays using either anti-HA-monoclonal (Fig. 3A, upper panel) or anti-Gαq polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3A, middle panel). A clear association of PKCζ and Gαq upon co-expression is observed using both approaches. Interestingly, a clear association with PKCζ was also observed for the Gq Q209L-AA mutant unable to activate and interact with PLCβ (Fig. 3B), again suggesting that this process is independent of the PLCβ pathway. Moreover, the association between PKCζ and Gαq appears to be specific because PKCζ does not co-immunoprecipitate with co-expressed Gαs, Gαi, or Gα12 subunits, nor does Gαq associate with PKCλ, another atypical PKC isoform with high sequence similarity to PKCζ (supplemental Fig. S4). The fact that the Gαq/PKCζ association was markedly increased (from 2.5- to 4-fold over control, Fig. 3A) when expressing the active Gαq mutant when compared with wild-type Gαq subunit suggested that Gαq/PKCζ co-immunoprecipitation would be regulated upon Gq protein activation by GPCR, as is the case for other Gα protein subunit effectors. Consistently, carbachol stimulation of Gαq-coupled m1-muscarinic receptors promoted a clear increase in the association of either co-transfected (not shown) or endogenous PKCζ and Gαq (3.1–5-fold over basal conditions at 5 min of agonist challenge, Fig. 3C), indicating that the functional interaction between these proteins takes place in physiological conditions upon activation of GPCR. To determine whether the Gαq/PKCζ association was direct or mediated by other cellular proteins, we performed an “in vitro” binding assay using purified recombinant Gαq and a His-PKCζ fusion protein. Fig. 3D shows a clear, direct interaction between both proteins. In agreement with the notion that the Gαq/PKCζ pathway is relevant for the activation of the ERK5 cascade, we were able to detect the presence of MEK5, the well known PKCζ interactor and upstream activator of ERK5 (7Wang X. Tournier C. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in Gαq immunocomplexes (Fig. 4A) upon co-expression of active Gαq, HA-PKCζ, and GST-MEK5 constructs in COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, MEK5 co-immunoprecipitated with Gαq even in the absence of co-expressed PKCζ, whereas the presence of extra MEK5 decreased the extent to which PKCζ associated with Gαq (Fig. 4A). The same was observed when PKCζ immunocomplexes were analyzed in similar assays using a HA immunoprecipitating antibody (Fig. 4B). However, the presence of extra Gαq does not reduce, but appears to even enhance PKCζ/MEK5 association (Fig. 4B). To further characterize such Gαq/MEK5 functional interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using an anti-GST-MEK5 polyclonal antibody. Gαq/MEK5 association was clearly detected and markedly increased (4-fold over control, Fig. 5A) when expressing an active Gαq mutant when compared with wild-type Gαq subunit, consistent with a stimulus-dependent interaction.FIGURE 5Gαq associates with MEK5. A, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids encoding GST-MEK5, GST, wild-type Gαq (WT), or a constitutively active Gαq mutant (Gαq R183C). Cell lysates were subjected to pulldown (PD) with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin as detailed under ”Experimental Procedures.“ Proteins retained in the matrix were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of GST, GST-MEK5, and Gαq was determined by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. To compare the association of MEK5 to WT Gαq and Gαq R183C, blot bands were quantified and normalized by total GST-MEK5. The MEK5/WT Gαq association was taken as the control condition. Data are mean ± S.E. of 3–4 independent experiments. Representative blots are shown. B, MEFs obtained from PKCζ−/− mice cells were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids, and cell lysates were analyzed using a pulldown assay as in the previous panel. C, direct interaction between Gαq and GST-MEK5. Purified recombinant Gαq (10 nm) was incubated in the absence or presence of purified GST-MEK5 fusion protein (100 nm), and the mixture was subjected to affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. Proteins retained in the matrix were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of GST-MEK5 or Gαq was analyzed by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies, including the input (20%) of Gαq as a control. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. D, stimulation of Gq-coupled GPCR promotes the association of endogenous Gαq and MEK5 proteins. NIH 3T3-m1R cells were challenged with 10 μm carbachol for different times as in Fig. 1A, and endogenous Gαq/MEK5 co-immunoprecipitation (IP) was assessed with specific antibodies. Data are mean ± S.E. of 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In principle, the observed association between Gαq and MEK5 could be either direct or mediated by endogenous PKCζ, able to interact with both proteins. To discriminate between these possibilities, we carried out similar co-immunoprecipitation assays in MEFs obtained from PKCζ knock-out mice (Fig. 5B). Under these conditions, a clear association between Gαq and MEK5 was also observed, indicating that this process does not strictly require PKCζ. Consistently, an in vitro binding assay using purified recombinant Gαq and a GST-MEK5 fusion protein shows a clear, direct interaction between both proteins (Fig. 5C). However, it is interesting to note that in the cell milieu, active and wild-type Gαq display a similar association to MEK5 in the absence of PKCζ (Fig. 5B), suggesting that PKCζ may facilitate the binding of MEK5 to active Gαq. In agreement with this notion, stimulation of Gq-coupled m1-muscarinic receptors promoted a clear increase in the association of endogenous MEK5 and Gαq (Fig. 5D) with a time course slightly retarded when compared with the Gαq/PKCζ association (Fig. 3C). Overall, our data suggested that by recruiting"
https://openalex.org/W2056611451,"Background During the in vitro differentiation of human villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells to a syncytiotrophoblast (STB) phenotype, mRNA levels for the nuclear hormone receptor NR2F2 (ARP-1, COUP-TFII) increase rapidly, reaching a peak at day 1 of differentiation that is 8.8-fold greater than that in undifferentiated CTB cells. To examine whether NR2F2 is involved in the regulation of villous CTB cell differentiation, studies were performed to determine whether NR2F2 regulates the expression of TFAP2A (AP-2α), a transcription factor that is critical for the terminal differentiation of these cells to a STB phenotype. Methodology/Primary Findings Overexpression of NR2F2 in primary cultures of human CTB cells and JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells induced dose-dependent increases in TFAP2A promoter activity. Conversely, siRNA mediated silencing of the NR2F2 gene in villous CTB undergoing spontaneous differentiation blocked the induction of the mRNAs for TFAP2A and several STB cell specific marker genes, including human placental lactogen (hPL), pregnancy specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) by 51–59%. The induction of TFAP2A promoter activity by NR2F2 was potentiated by the nuclear hormone receptors retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA). Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NR2F2 is involved in villous CTB cell differentiation and that NR2F2 acts, at least in part, by directly activating TFAP2A gene expression and by potentiating the transactivation of TFAP2A by RARA and RXRA."
https://openalex.org/W2066660791,"Deciphering the behavioral repertoire of great apes is a challenge for several reasons. First, due to their elusive behavior in dense forest environments, great ape populations are often difficult to observe. Second, members of the genus Pan are known to display a great variety in their behavioral repertoire; thus, observations from one population are not necessarily representative for other populations. For example, bonobos (Pan paniscus) are generally believed to consume almost no vertebrate prey. However, recent observations show that at least some bonobo populations may consume vertebrate prey more commonly than previously believed. We investigated the extent of their meat consumption using PCR amplification of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segments from DNA extracted from bonobo feces. As a control we also attempted PCR amplifications from gorilla feces, a species assumed to be strictly herbivorous.We found evidence for consumption of a variety of mammalian species in about 16% of the samples investigated. Moreover, 40% of the positive DNA amplifications originated from arboreal monkeys. However, we also found duiker and monkey mtDNA in the gorilla feces, albeit in somewhat lower percentages. Notably, the DNA sequences isolated from the two ape species fit best to the species living in the respective regions. This result suggests that the sequences are of regional origin and do not represent laboratory contaminants.Our results allow at least three possible and mutually not exclusive conclusions. First, all results may represent contamination of the feces by vertebrate DNA from the local environment. Thus, studies investigating a species' diet from feces DNA may be unreliable due to the low copy number of DNA originating from diet items. Second, there is some inherent difference between the bonobo and gorilla feces, with only the later ones being contaminated. Third, similar to bonobos, for which the consumption of monkeys has only recently been documented, the gorilla population investigated (for which very little observational data are as yet available) may occasionally consume small vertebrates. Although the last explanation is speculative, it should not be discarded a-priori given that observational studies continue to unravel new behaviors in great ape species."

TRIF is a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein critically involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. It has been shown that TRIF interacts with TLR3 through their respective TIR domains. In this study, we identified a splice variant of TRIF lacking the TIR domain, which is designated as TRIS. Overexpression of TRIS activates NF-κB, interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), and the interferon-β promoter, whereas knockdown of TRIS inhibited TLR3-mediated signaling, suggesting that TRIS is involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we identified an N-terminal TBK1-binding motif of TRIS or TRIF that was important for its interaction with TBK1 and ability to activate ISRE. Activation of ISRE by TRIS also needs its dimerization or oligomerization mediated by its C-terminal RIP homotypic interaction motif. Finally, we demonstrated that TRIS was associated with TRIF upon TLR3 activation by poly(I-C). These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of TLR3-mediated signaling.

Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by host pattern recognition receptors represents a critical step in innate immune response. In mammals, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by three classes of pattern recognition receptors, the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 3The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorIFNinterferonHAhemagglutininRNAiRNA interferenceMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastTBRTBK1-binding regionRHIMRIP homotypic interaction motifTIRToll-interleukin 1 receptorISREinterferon-stimulated response element. the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, and the Nod proteins. Detection of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors initiates a series of signaling events, leading to induction of various chemokines and cytokines and subsequent inflammatory and innate immune responses against the pathogens (1Kawai T.

The TLRs are characterized by a conserved cytoplasmic domain, the TIR domain, that is defined by a motif of ∼160 amino acids including five β-sheets surrounded by α-helices and connected together by flexible loops (6Xu Y.

TLRs act as hetero- or homodimers that are thought to be pre-assembled in a low affinity complex under physiological conditions. Upon ligand binding, TLRs undergo conformational changes that bring the two TIR domains in the cytoplasmic regions into closer proximity, creating a new platform on which to build a signaling complex that triggers the activation of several transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP1, and IRF3 (7Jin M.S.

These transcription factors cooperatively induce expression of downstream proteins involved in inflammation and innate immunity. Among the TLRs, TLR3 has been shown to recognize viral double strand RNA. TLR3 signals through a TIR domain containing an adapter protein called TRIF/TICAM1 (10Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K.

TRIF-deficient mice are defective in TLR3-mediated activation of NF-κB and IRF3 and expression of type I IFNs and various proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that TRIF is required for TLR3-mediated signaling (12Hoebe K.

It has been shown that the N-terminal domain of TRIF is associated with TBK1, probably through NAP1 and/or TRAF3, and is required for TRIF-mediated IRF3 activation (14Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B.

Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). TRIF mediates NF-κB activation through two distinct pathways. TRIF contains a consensus TRAF6-binding motif in the N-terminal region, and mutation of this motif impairs TRIF-mediated NF-κB but not IRF3 activation (16Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the role of TRAF6 in TRIF signaling is still controversial as in TRAF6-deficient macrophages, in contrast to TRAF6-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), TLR3 signaling was not affected (17Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 18Jiang Z.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). TRIF is also capable of activating NF-κB through its C-terminal RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), which is responsible for recruiting RIP to TRIF (20Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that poly(I-C)-induced NF-κB activation is completely blocked in RIP-deficient MEFs (21Cusson-Hermance N. Khurana S. Lee T.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36560-36566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition to NF-κB and IRF3 activation, TRIF is capable of inducing apoptosis. TRIF-induced apoptosis is mediated through RIP1, FADD, and caspase-8 (22Kaiser W.J. Offermann M.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4942-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 23Han K.J. Su X.

In this study, we identified a TIR-less splice variant of TRIF designated as TRIS. Rather than acting as an inhibitor of TLR3-mediated signaling, TRIS is surprisingly required for TLR3-mediated signaling. TRIS forms a heterocomplex with TRIF through their C-terminal RHIM motifs. Overexpression of TRIS activates NF-κB and IRF3, although specific knockdown of TRIS inhibits TLR3-mediated NF-κB and IRF3 activation. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of TLR3-mediated signaling. Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG and HA epitopes (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIF-N (catalog no. ALX-210-908, Alexis Biochemical), anti-TRIF(219) (catalog no. 4596, Cell Signaling Technology), 293, HeLa, and Jurkat cells (ATCC) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers. 293-TLR3 cells were provided by Drs. Katherine Fitzgerald and Tom Maniatis. The NF-κB, ISRE, and IFN-β promoter luciferase reporter plasmids and mammalian expression plasmids for TRIF and TRIF deletion mutants TBK1, TBK1-KA, IRF3-DN, and RIP were described previously (23Han K.J.

Lei C. He X. Zhang L. Tien P. Shu H.B. Immunity. 2008; 29: 538-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids for TRIS, TRIS deletion and point mutants, TRIF point mutants, and the TBD-TIR(88) fusion were constructed in a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector containing a 5′-HA or -FLAG tag by standard molecular biology techniques. Double strand oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into the pSuper.Retro RNAi plasmid (Oligoengine Inc.). The target sequences for TRIF cDNA are as follows: 1) GACCAGACGCCACTCCAAC; 2) GAAGATACCACCTCTCCAA. The target sequences for TRIS cDNA are as follows: 1) CCATGCCCTTCCCGCAGTC; 2) TGCCCTTCCCGCAGTCCCC; and 3) TACCATGCCCTTCCCGCAG. pSuper.Retro-GFP-RNAi plasmid (Oligoengine Inc.), which targets green fluorescent protein cDNA sequences, was used as a control for all RNAi-related experiments in this study. 293 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 12-well dishes and transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. In the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 50 ng of pTK-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Approximately 16 h after transfection, luciferase reporter assays were performed using a Dual-LuciferaseTM assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activities. For transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected for 24 h. Transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis was performed. All immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated at least twice, and similar data were obtained. 293-TLR3 cells (2 × 108) were treated with poly(I-C) or left untreated for 30 min. The cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was recovered and loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The samples were eluted from the column in lysis buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collected in fractions of 1 ml. The fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blots with antibodies against the N terminus of TRIF/TRIS. During our studies of the TRIF protein, we routinely found that a commercially available rabbit antibody raised against the N terminus of human TRIF (anti-TRIF-N) could detect an extra protein band of ∼30 kDa in all examined cells, including 293, 293-TLR3 (a 293 cell line stably expressing TLR3), HeLa, and Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1A). The 30-kDa band was not cleaved or degraded TRIF, because transfection of two independent TRIF RNAi plasmids down-regulated full-length TRIF but not the 30-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). The detection of the 30-kDa band could be due to nonspecific recognition by the antibody or, alternatively, represented a splice variant of TRIF. To distinguish these two possibilities, we isolated potential TRIF variants from a mixed cDNA library under PCR conditions favoring amplifying short cDNAs (Fig. 1C). Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed the existence of a splice variant of TRIF lacking amino acids 218–657 of the full-length TRIF (Fig. 1D). Because this splice variant of TRIF lacks the TIR domain, which is located between amino acids 394 and 532 of full-length TRIF, we designated this variant as TRIS. The deduced molecular mass of TRIS is ∼30 kDa, matching well with the extra band recognized by the anti-TRIF-N. To further determine whether the 30-kDa band represents TRIS, we designed two RNAi plasmids specifically targeting TRIS but not TRIF by exploiting the different sequences at the splicing junction sites (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot analysis indicated that the TRIS RNAi plasmids down-regulated the 30-kDa protein but not the full-length TRIF (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that the 30-kDa band represents the TIR-less splice variant TRIS. Various studies have demonstrated that TRIF is an essential adapter protein for TLR3-mediated signaling. TRIF interacts with TLR3 through their respective TIR domains. It is believed that the TIR domain of TRIF is required for its signaling activity (10Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 23Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine the functions of TRIS, we performed reporter assays. Surprisingly, the TIR-less TRIS also activated the IFN-β promoters ISRE and NF-κB, although to a lesser degree in comparison with TRIF (Fig. 2A). In the poly(I-C)-responsive 293-TLR3 cells, poly(I-C) stimulation added little to the reporter activities induced by overexpression of TRIF or TRIS (supplemental Fig. S1). It is possible that overexpression of TRIF or TRIS may overwhelmingly and directly activate the downstream signaling pathway, whereas poly(I-C) stimulation activates the pathway through ectopically expressed TLR3 and endogenous TRIF/TRIS, which is not potent in these experiments. Alternatively, specific knockdown of TRIS by two independent RNAi plasmids (plasmids 1 and 3), which had no effects on TRIF expression (Fig. 1E), inhibited poly(I-C)-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter in 293-TLR3 cells (supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 2B). The TRIS RNAi-1 plasmid was used for the following experiments. We also found that knockdown of TRIS inhibited poly(I-C)-induced ISRE and NF-κB activation in 293-TLR3 cells (Fig. 2B). In similar experiments, knockdown of TRIS inhibited TLR4-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that TRIS is involved in TLR3- and TLR4-mediated signaling. It is unexpected that a TIR-less variant of TRIF is required for TLR3-mediated signaling. Therefore, we next determined the molecular mechanisms of TRIS-mediated signaling. Previously, it has been demonstrated that TRIF signals IRF3 activation through the noncanonical IκB kinase TBK1 (26Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, TRIS interacted with TBK1 (Fig. 3A). A kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1, as well as a dominant negative mutant of IRF3, inhibited TRIS-mediated ISRE activation (Fig. 3B). In addition, TRIS activated ISRE in wild type but not TBK1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that TRIS activates IRF3 through TBK1. We next determined the domains that are required for TRIS-mediated ISRE activation. Interestingly, both the N-terminal (TRIS-N) and C-terminal (TRIS-C) domains are required for TRIS-mediated ISRE activation, whereas a TRIF truncation containing the N-terminal and TIR domains (TRIF-NT) was sufficient for TRIF-mediated ISRE activation (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that the N terminus together with either the TIR domain or the C terminus of TRIF are sufficient for its ability to activate ISRE. Because both TRIF and TRIS activate ISRE through TBK1 and they contain a shared N-terminal domain that is required for its ability to activate ISRE, we determined whether the N terminus of TRIF/TRIS contains a conserved TBK1-binding site. Using a series of N-terminal deletion mutants of TRIS, we found that amino acids 180–200 of TRIS are required for ISRE activation in reporter assays (Fig. 3E). An alignment of this 20-amino acid region of TRIS with the TBK1-binding regions in TANK and NAP1, two proteins previously shown to interact with TBK1 (27Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fujita F. Taniguchi Y. Kato T. Narita Y. Furuya A. Ogawa T. Sakurai H. Joh T. Itoh M. Delhase M. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7780-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Ryzhakov G. Randow F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3180-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), revealed that two amino acids (Gln-190 and Leu-194 in TRIS/TRIF) are conserved among the three proteins (Fig. 3F). To determine whether these two amino acids are important for the interaction of TRIS with TBK1, we mutated these conserved residues to alanines and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that substitution of Leu-194 to alanine abolished the interaction of TRIS with TBK1, although mutation of Gln-190 had no significant effect (Fig. 3F). Consistently, TRIS(L194A) but not TRIS(Q190A) completely lost its ability to activate ISRE and could act as a dominant negative mutant to inhibit poly(I-C)-induced ISRE activation in 293-TLR3 cells (Fig. 3, G and H). TRIS(L194A) could activate NF-κB to a similar level with wild type TRIS (Fig. 3I). Similar results were also observed when these mutations were introduced into TRIF (data not shown). In similar experiments, TRIS(Q190A) had little effect on poly(I-C)-induced signaling in 293-TLR3 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These data suggest that Leu-194 is essential for the ability of TRIS/TRIF to bind to TBK1 and for TRIS/TRIF-mediated ISRE but not NF-κB activation pathways. Based on the above studies, it is clear that the TBK1-binding region around Leu-194 at the N terminus is required for TRIS/TRIF-mediated ISRE activation. However, the N terminus alone is not sufficient for activating ISRE. In addition to the N terminus, activation of ISRE by TRIS or TRIF also requires either the C-terminal RHIM-containing domain or the TIR domain. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the RHIM motif of TRIF is responsible for its interaction with RIP and for its ability to activate NF-κB. However, the interaction with RIP is not required for TRIS/TRIF-mediated ISRE activation (20Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 21Cusson-Hermance N. Khurana S. Lee T.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36560-36566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that RHIM motifs are responsible for the homotypic interaction between RIP and RIP3, whereas TIR domains are involved in interactions of TIR-containing proteins. Based on this information, the simplest explanation for our observations is that activation of ISRE by TRIS/TRIF requires TBK1 binding via their N terminus and homotypic dimerization or oligomerization by the C terminus or TIR domain. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether TRIS can dimerize or oligomerize through its C-terminal RHIM motif. In transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, TRIS could interact with itself as well as TRIF (Fig. 4A). Mutation of the four RHIM amino acids (QLGL) to alanines, designated as TRIS-4A, abolished the ability of TRIS to interact with itself or TRIF (Fig. 4A) as well as its ability to activate ISRE (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that TRIS could dimerize/oligomerize or interact with TRIF through the RHIM motif, which is also required for its ability to activate ISRE. Similarly, deletion analysis indicated that the TRIF-NT mutant was able to dimerize or oligomerize. The TIR domain is required for the ability of TRIF-NT to dimerize or oligomerize (Fig. 4C) and to activate ISRE (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that either the TIR domain or the C-terminal RHIM motif can provide the dimerization or oligomerization requirement for activating ISRE by TRIF or TRIS. To further confirm that dimerization or oligomerization is an important step to activate ISRE, we determined whether an artificial dimerization or oligomerization domain can confer the N terminus of TRIS to activate ISRE. We constructed a chimeric molecule consisting of the N terminus of TRIS and the TIR domain of MyD88, a TRIF-related protein that does not activate ISRE (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of this chimeric protein strongly activated ISRE but not NF-κB (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that TBK1 binding and dimerization or oligomerization are two required events for the ability of TRIS to activate ISRE. Similarly to TRIF, TRIS is capable of activating NF-κB (Fig. 2A). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, TRIS interacted with RIP (Fig. 5A). Mutation of the RHIM motif of TRIS abolished its interaction with RIP (Fig. 5A), as well as its ability to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, mutation of the RHIM motif of TRIF caused marked reduction but not complete loss of its interaction with RIP as well as its ability to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5, A and B). These findings are consistent with our previous observation that both the TIR and the C-terminal domains can interact with RIP (23Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15652-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TRIS activates NF-κB through its RHIM-mediated interaction with RIP, whereas TRIF can activate NF-κB through either its TIR or C-terminal domain. Because TRIS is involved in TLR3-mediated ISRE and NF-κB activation, we determined whether TRIS is associated with TRIF under physiological conditions. We first performed gel filtration chromatography with lysates from 293-TLR3 cells untreated or treated with poly(I-C) for 30 min. In untreated cells, TRIF was eluted in complexes of more than 670 kDa as well as fractions between 220 and 440 kDa with a peak around 400 kDa, whereas TRIS only coeluted with the high molecular weight TRIF complex (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, both TRIF and TRIS shifted to overlapping high molecular weight complexes following poly(I-C) stimulation (Fig. 6A). Endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody specifically recognizing TRIF but not TRIS indicated that poly(I-C) triggered association of TRIF with TRIS (Fig. 6, B and C). These data suggest that association of TRIF with TRIS following ligand binding of TLR3 is an important step for TLR3-mediated signaling. TRIF is a TIR domain-containing adapter protein that is recruited to TLR3 through their respective TIR domains upon ligand binding. Gene knock-out studies have demonstrated that TRIF is required for TLR3-mediated activation of IRF3 and NF-κB as well as induction of type I IFNs. In this study, we identified a TIR-less splice variant of TRIF designated as TRIS. Surprisingly, we found that TRIS forms a complex with TRIF and is required for TLR3-mediated signaling. Consistent with a role of TRIF in TLR4-mediated signaling, knockdown of TRIS inhibited TLR4-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter, suggesting that TRIS is also involved in TLR4-mediated signaling. TRIS was identified as a 30-kDa splice variant in Western blot analysis with an antibody raised against the N terminus of TRIF. Several lines of evidence exclude the possibility that this 30-kDa protein is a degraded fragment of TRIF. First, knockdown of full-length TRIF by RNAi did not down-regulate the expression of the 30-kDa protein. Second, GenBankTM data base analysis revealed a TRIF splice variant that encodes a TIR-less protein of ∼30 kDa. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments amplified a cDNA encoding for such a splice variant of TRIF. Third, an antibody raised against the N terminus of TRIF recognized both TRIF and the 30-kDa band, whereas an antibody raised against a peptide around amino acid 219 of TRIF only recognized TRIF but not the 30-kDa band. Finally, an RNAi construct targeting the joint region of TRIS mRNA (which is not in TRIF mRNA) selectively down-regulated expression of the 30-kDa protein but not full-length TRIF. These experiments suggest that TRIS is a naturally occurring splice variant of TRIF. TRIS is constitutively and abundantly expressed in all examined and divergent types of cell lines, including human embryonic kidney 293, epithelial HeLa cells, and T lymphoma Jurkat cells, pointing to the possibility that TRIS plays an important role in TRIF-related functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that TRIF is associated with TLR3 through their respective TIR domains; therefore, a TIR-less TRIF splice variant would be expected to act as an inhibitor of the TLR3-mediated signaling. Surprisingly, overexpression of TRIS activated ISRE, NF-κB, and the IFN-β promoter, whereas specific knockdown of TRIS by RNAi inhibited poly(I-C)-induced activation of ISRE, NF-κB, and the IFN-β promoter. These results suggest that TRIS is specifically involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. TRIS contains an N- and a C-terminal domain. Deletion analysis identified an N-terminal region that was required for the interaction between TRIS and TBK1. This region, located at amino acids 180–200 of TRIS or TRIF, is designated as TBK1-binding region (TBR). Alignment of this TBR with those of TANK and NAP1, two proteins also binding to TBK1, revealed a conserved leucine residue (Leu-194). Mutation of this residue to alanine abolished the ability of TRIS or TRIF to activate ISRE but not NF-κB. These observations suggest that both TRIS and TRIF activate the IRF3 activation pathways through their TBR-mediated interaction with TBK1. However, overexpression of the N-terminal TBR-containing domain is not sufficient to activate ISRE. Activation of ISRE by TRIS requires its dimerization or oligomerization provided by its C-terminal RHIM-containing domain. Consistently, an artificial fusion protein between the N-terminal TBR-containing domain of TRIS/TRIF and the TIR domain of MyD88, which itself does not activate ISRE, could potently activate ISRE. These studies suggest that TRIS/TRIF-mediated ISRE activation requires both their association with TBK1 and dimerization or oligomerization. TRIS was capable of activating NF-κB, which was mediated by its association with RIP through its C-terminal RHIM. Mutation of the RHIM to alanines abolished the ability of TRIS to interact with RIP and to activate NF-κB. TRIF could activate NF-κB through the RHIM-mediated interaction with RIP; however, TRIF could also activate NF-κB through the TIR domain-mediated interaction with TRAF6 (16Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4304-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 18Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that TRIS and TRIF activate NF-κB through overlapping and distinct mechanisms. Gel filtration chromatography experiments suggest that under unstimulated conditions, TRIF was eluted in complexes of more than 670 kDa as well as fractions between 220 and 440 kDa with a peak around 400 kDa, whereas TRIS only coeluted with the high molecular weight TRIF complex. Stimulation of the cells with the TLR3 ligand poly(I-C) caused a shift of TRIF and TRIS to overlap higher molecular weight complexes. Endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TRIF could interact with TRIS after poly(I-C) stimulation of 293-TLR3 cells. These results suggest that TRIS is associated with TRIF upon TLR3 activation. The detailed mechanisms on the involvement of TRIS in TLR3-mediated signaling are unknown at this time. Nevertheless, the identification of a TIR-less variant of TRIF that is important for TLR3-mediated signaling will certainly challenge the traditional view on the early events of TLR3-mediated signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2080279634,"Disruption of the fission yeast LAMMER kinase, Lkh1, gene resulted in diverse phenotypes, including adhesive filamentous growth and oxidative stress sensitivity, but an exact cellular function had not been assigned to Lkh1. Through an in vitro pull-down approach, a transcriptional repressor, Tup12, was identified as an Lkh1 binding partner. Interactions between Lkh1 and Tup11 or Tup12 were confirmed by in vitro and in vivo binding assays. Tup proteins were phosphorylated by Lkh1 in a LAMMER motif-dependent manner. The LAMMER motif was also necessary for substrate recognition in vitro and cellular function in vivo. Transcriptional activity assays using promoters negatively regulated by Tup11 and Tup12 showed 6 or 2 times higher activity in the Δlkh1 mutant than the wild type, respectively. Northern analysis revealed derepressed expression of the fbp1+ mRNA in Δlkh1 and in Δtup11Δtup12 mutant cells under repressed conditions. Δlkh1 and Δtup11Δtup12 mutant cells showed flocculation, which was reversed by co-expression of Tup11 and -12 with Ssn6. Here, we presented a new aspect of the LAMMER kinase by demonstrating that the activities of global transcriptional repressors, Tup11 and Tup12, were positively regulated by Lkh1-mediated phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2077932728,"Background Core Binding Factor or CBF is a transcription factor composed of two subunits, Runx1/AML-1 and CBF beta or CBFβ. CBF was originally described as a regulator of hematopoiesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that CBF is involved in the control of skeletal muscle terminal differentiation. Indeed, downregulation of either Runx1 or CBFβ protein level accelerates cell cycle exit and muscle terminal differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of CBFβ in myoblasts slows terminal differentiation. CBF interacts directly with the master myogenic transcription factor MyoD, preferentially in proliferating myoblasts, via Runx1 subunit. In addition, we show a preferential recruitment of Runx1 protein to MyoD target genes in proliferating myoblasts. The MyoD/CBF complex contains several chromatin modifying enzymes that inhibits MyoD activity, such as HDACs, Suv39h1 and HP1β. When overexpressed, CBFβ induced an inhibition of activating histone modification marks concomitant with an increase in repressive modifications at MyoD target promoters. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data show a new role for Runx1/CBFβ in the control of the proliferation/differentiation in skeletal myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2023469025,"The recD mutants of the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and fail to grow at 4 degrees C. Generally, RecD associates with two other proteins (RecB and RecC) to produce RecBCD enzyme, which is involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair in many bacteria, including Escherichia coli. However, RecD is not essential for DNA repair, nor does its deletion cause any growth defects in E. coli. Hence, the assessment of the P. syringae RecBCD pathway was imperative.Mutational analysis and genetic complementation studies were used to establish that the individual null-mutations of all three genes, recC, recB, and recD, or the deletion of whole recCBD operon of P. syringae, lead to growth inhibition at low temperature, and sensitivity to UV and mitomycin C. Viability of the mutant cells dropped drastically at 4 degrees C, and the mutants accumulated linear chromosomal DNA and shorter DNA fragments in higher amounts compared to 22 degrees C. Additional genetic data using the mutant RecBCD enzymes that were inactivated either in the ATPase active site of RecB (RecB(K29Q)) or RecD (RecD(K229Q)), or in the nuclease center of RecB (RecB(D1118A) and RecB(Delta nuc)) suggested that, while the nuclease activity of RecB is not so critical in vivo, the ATP-dependent functions of both RecB and RecD are essential. Surprisingly, E. coli recBCD or recBC alone on plasmid could complement the defects of the Delta recCBD strain of P. syringae.All three subunits of the RecBCD(Ps) enzyme are essential for DNA repair and growth of P. syringae at low temperatures (4 degrees C). The RecD requirement is only a function of the RecBCD complex in the bacterium. The RecBCD pathway protects the Antarctic bacterium from cold-induced DNA damages, and is critically dependent on the helicase activities of both RecB and RecD subunits, but not on the nuclease of RecBCD(Ps) enzyme."

To accommodate the large spectrum of substrates, the conserved AAA+ core has become specialized through the insertion of specific substrate-binding motifs. Given their critical roles in cellular function, understanding the nucleotide-driven mechanisms of action is of wide importance. For one type of member AAA+ protein (phage shock protein F, PspF), we identified and established the functional significance of strategically placed arginine and glutamate residues that form interacting pairs in response to nucleotide binding. We show that these interactions are critical for “cis” and “trans” subunit communication, which support coordination between subunits for nucleotide-dependent substrate remodeling. Using an allele-specific suppression approach for ATPase and substrate remodeling, we demonstrate that the targeted residues directly interact and are unlikely to make any other pairwise critical interactions. We then propose a mechanistic rationale by which the nucleotide-bound state of adjacent subunits can be sensed without direct involvement of R-finger residues. As the structural AAA+ core is conserved, we propose that the functional networks established here could serve as a template to identify similar residue pairs in other AAA+ proteins.

Hexameric AAA+ ATPases (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) are involved in multiple cellular processes and are present in all kingdoms of life. Mutations in these proteins have been reported in several human diseases, including fronto-temporal dementia with inclusion body myopathy and Paget disease of bone, hereditary spastic paraparesis, dystonia, and prostate cancer (1Konakova M.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which these mutations affect the AAA+ ATPase (resulting in these diseases) are largely unknown, reducing drastically the possibility of treatment. Understanding the conserved mechanism by which AAA+ ATPases achieve their functionality is then of prime importance in the search for therapeutics. AAA+ ATPase molecular machines require nucleotide hydrolysis to remodel their substrate. They share a structural core (containing Walker A and B motifs, the sensor I sequence and the second region of homology) usually made more elaborate by inserted motif(s) (defining them as subclade) to establish the specialized functionality needed for substrate interaction specificity (reviewed in Refs. 9Iyer L.M.

Some AAA+ ATPases have evolved complexity through formation of heteromeric assemblies (e.g. m-AAA protease Yta10–12 or AAA helicase MCM2–7), strongly suggesting differential contributions of subunits to hexamer activity (12Augustin S.

Sensing the adjacent subunit functional state is expected to be critical for hexameric ring activity. Conserved arginine residues, so-called arginine finger residues (R-finger), have been shown to play a crucial role in the hexameric ring ATPase activity by acting in trans, stabilizing the nucleotide in the adjacent nucleotide binding pocket (16Briggs L.C.

We speculate that other residues sensitive to the nucleotide-bound state will support the coordinated conformational changes. Defining the functional networks between residues of the common structural AAA+ core is crucial to fully understand how these molecular machines work. Studying the molecular communication pathway operating between the different subunits of the AAA+ oligomeric ring requires use of an established tractable system. Here, we used the AAA+ domain of PspF (PspF1–275), a bacterial enhancer binding protein involved in bacterial pathogenicity (19Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and an archetypal member of subclade 6 of the AAA+ protein family (which includes HslU, ClpX, MCM, RuvB, and Ltag) as a model of the conserved AAA+ core (9Iyer L.M.

In PspF the conserved AAA+ core is refined by two inserted structural motifs: loop 1 (L1, inserted in α-helix 3) and loop 2 (L2 or presensor I, inserted in α-helix 4). L1 presents the substrate-interacting “GAFTGA motif,” allowing docking of σ54 (the substrate), and L2 is proposed to coordinate L1 in a nucleotide-dependent manner (23Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R.

In addition, structural studies showed that all six of the substrate-interacting motifs (L1) do not contact σ54 (the target) at the same time, further inferring coordination between subunits (25Rappas M.

Here, we provide functional evidence for new communication networks used to establish substrate binding and remodeling activities, suggesting how subunits communicate the local effects of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to support coordination of subunit activities in the hexamer. Plasmid pPB1 encodes the AAA+ domain of Escherichia coli PspF, called PspF1–275, with an amino-terminal His6 tag in pET28b+ (23Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M.

The ATPase activity assays were performed in buffer containing final concentrations of 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 70 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 19 mm ammonium acetate, 0.7 mm DTT, and 3 μm PspF1–275. The mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding 3 μl of an ATP solution containing 0.6 μCi/μl [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) plus 3.33 mm ATP and incubated for varying times at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of 5 volumes of 2 m formic acid. The [α-32P]ADP was separated from [α-32P]ATP by thin layer chromatography, and radiolabeled ADP and ATP were measured by PhosphorImager (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using Aida software. Activity is expressed as a percentage of PspF1–275WT turnover value. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and fluctuations of turnover values were maximally 10%.

Open complex formation was monitored following the synthesis of the short transcript (−1UpGGG+3) started by simultaneous addition of heparin (100 μg/ml), initiating dinucleotide UpG (0.5 mm), GTP (0.01 mm), and 4 μCi of [α-32P]GTP for a further 10 min.

Radiolabeled RNA products were measured by PhosphorImager (Fuji Bas1500) and analyzed using Aida software.

The mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by addition of 5 μm of PspF1–275 WT or variants and incubated for varying times at 37 °C. Full-length transcription (from the supercoiled Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter) was initiated by adding a mixture containing 100 μg/ml heparin, 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, 0.5 mm UTP, and 3 μCi of [α-32P]UTP for a further 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. Radiolabeled RNA products were measured by PhosphorImager (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using Aida software. PspF1–275 WT and variants (at different concentrations) were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2 ± 0.5 mm ATP where indicated. 50-μl samples were then injected onto a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm, 24 ml) (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with the sample buffer ± nucleotide. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and columns were calibrated with globular proteins as follows: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). All experiments were repeated at least twice, and the elution profiles obtained were similar. Proteins were detected at a 280-nm wavelength. Structural data from PspF, NtrC, RuvB, and Ltag in the presence of different bound nucleotides suggest that the side chains of several strategically placed and physically paired residues could move in a nucleotide-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The PspF “dimer” presented in Fig. 1 has some uncertainties as follows: (i) the crystal structure of PspF1–275 only defines a PspF1–275 monomer, and the interface structure of the dimer is therefore modeled; and (ii) the nucleotide-bound form of the monomeric structure was obtained by soaking the preformed apo-crystal with nucleotide, so movements observed for the residue side chains could be restricted due to crystal packing constraints. The structural model of the PspF dimer interface requires experimental validation. Based on this model, we identified two putative “networks” that might allow the coupling of the nucleotide-bound state to functional activities in the PspF hexamer, probably via the formation of differential salt bridges between compatible pair residues. The first network includes residues located in the same subunit as follows: Glu81, Arg91, Glu97, and Arg131, potentially associated with coordination between L1 and L2 in response to the nucleotide bound in the subunit (Fig. 1, A and B). The second is composed of residues located in two adjacent subunits (at their interface), transArg95, transArg98, and Glu130, potentially to establish coordination between subunits in the hexameric ring (Fig. 1, C and D). Residues of the two putative pathways are sufficiently close to each other to directly support a cross-talk between the two networks based on mutually exclusive but dynamic pairwise interactions. We examined whether the two putative networks described above were conserved among bacterial enhancer binding proteins (supplemental Fig. 1S). The positions corresponding to Glu81/Arg131 and Glu97/Arg131 pairs in PspF are clearly conserved (supplemental Fig. 1S, A and B). The Arg95/Glu130 equivalent pair is most frequently Arg-Glu (salt bridge) and then Leu-Arg (hydrogen-bound) followed by Lys-Glu (salt bridge), suggesting a high degree of functional conservation (supplemental Fig. 1SC). In the case of Arg98/Glu130, two pairs are well represented, Leu-Glu and Arg-Glu, whereas a multitude of additional combinations are observed (supplemental Fig. 1SD). We reasoned that if the paired amino acids are indeed simply directly interacting for hexameric ring functionality and are not directly involved in any other activities, we should be able to invert the residues of the same pair without major effects on protein activity (e.g. Arg-Glu is substituted by Glu-Arg, and allele specific suppression is assessed). To do so, we measured the effect of double substitutions on protein activity compared with WT and single substitution variants. A second substitution compensating for a negative effect of a single substitution would provide clear evidence that the residues act as a pair. We constructed single, double, and triple variants using alanine substitutions as a control for Glu to Arg and Arg to Glu substitutions (supplemental Table 1S) to address the following contributions: (i) Glu81, Arg91, Glu97, and Arg131 for intrasubunit communication, and (ii) Arg95, Arg98, and Glu130 for intersubunit communication. After purification, we tested whether the above PspF1–275 variants were functional (as in Ref. 38Joly N. Burrows P.C. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13725-13735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the following: (i) substrate remodeling; (ii) substrate interaction; (iii) ATP hydrolysis; and (iv) oligomerization. Each single substitution greatly reduced the ability of PspF1–275 to remodel its substrate, measured as a reduction in σ54-dependent transcription activation (Figs. 2A and 3A). Indeed, we were not able to detect any significant signal for the single substituted variants except for R91A (2% of WT, Fig. 2A, lane 4) and E130A (6% of WT, Fig. 3A, lane 6), suggesting that the substitutions used are targeting critical residues.FIGURE 3trans variant functional activities. For each variant potentially involved in trans subunit communication, we tested the following: A, remodeling activity (transcription activation, as % of WT; maximal error is 14%); B, substrate interaction activity (binding to σ54 using ADP-AlFx, as % of WT; maximal error is 15%); and C, ATPase activity (as % of WT; maximal error is 10%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next addressed whether the lack of substrate remodeling activity was due to a lack of interaction between PspF and its primary target, σ54. Using the transition state nucleotide analogue ADP-AlFx, a stable PspF-σ54 complex can be formed (39Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the presence of radiolabeled σ54, we only observed (Figs. 2B and 3B) complexes between σ54 and PspF1–275 WT (100%), R91A (99%), R91E (70%), R131A (73%), and E130A (8%). As expected, the variants able to remodel their substrate (R91A and E130A) can interact with σ54. Strikingly, R91E and R131A, which are inactive for substrate remodeling can interact stably with σ54 at a similar level to WT. These results suggest that Arg91 and Arg131 are directly involved in a pathway supporting substrate remodeling after the initial nucleotide-dependent substrate interaction. To investigate whether the lack of remodeling activity observed with the variants able to interact with σ54 was due to defective energy coupling or a loss of ATPase activity, we performed ATPase assays. Variants R91A and R91E retained 100% activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5), establishing that R91E ATPase activity is uncoupled from substrate remodeling. All the other single substitutions caused drastic reductions in ATPase activity (Figs. 2C and 3C). These residues are remote from the site of ATP hydrolysis and not predicted to be directly involved in ATPase activity, rather they may indirectly impact on the active site architecture. In conclusion, single substitutions of these residues affect to a similar extent the final output (i.e. decrease the substrate remodeling activity) but have distinct defects as follows: decreased ATPase and/or substrate binding and/or signal coupling between ATPase and substrate remodeling activities. Many of the targeted residues chosen for this study are anticipated to be involved in intrasubunit communication or to be at the interface between subunits. Hence, we addressed whether these substitutions affected formation of the hexamer and subsequently the organization of the catalytic interface (to potentially account for decreased ATPase activity). Gel filtration experiments were conducted to assess the oligomeric states of the PspF1–275 variants (as described previously (33Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For all the single variants, the equilibrium between apparent dimer and hexamer forms is displaced in favor of the dimeric form, suggesting that each substituted residue is functionally important for oligomer formation (data not shown). We tested whether the presence of nucleotide could favor high order oligomer formation, as is the case for WT (33Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and observed a similar increase in self-association with all the variants except E97A/E97R, R95A/R95E, and R98E (supplemental Figs. 2S and 3S). In conclusion, these residues (Arg95, Glu97, and Arg98) impact on nucleotide-dependent oligomerization, suggesting that they play an important role in nucleotide-dependent protein organization. Having established the major changes in activities associated with single substitutions, we tested whether formation of salt bridges between the paired residues identified was sufficient to support all, or some, of the nucleotide-dependent activities. Based on the likelihood of intrasubunit communication (Fig. 1), we investigated the roles of Glu81, Arg91, Glu97, and Arg131. Recall these residues might relay and amplify conformational changes in the nucleotide binding pocket to L1 and L2. We constructed double, triple, and quadruple alanine and “pair swapping” variants (supplemental Table I) and determined whether these variants retained remodeling activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–23) but did not detect any. These results suggest requirements beyond just simple pairwise interactions between these residues for remodeling activity. However, the swapping pair E97R/R131E is clearly able to interact with the substrate (σ54), much better than the corresponding single substitutions, implying that the interaction between Glu97 and Arg131 is critical for engagement of L1 with substrate (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–15). Glu97 may have more than one interacting partner (e.g. Glu97 interacts with Arg131 in the presence of ATP and with Arg91 in the presence of ADP, Fig. 1, A and B) prompting analysis of triple and quadruple substitutions (supplemental Table I). Substrate interactions of the E81A/R91A/R131A (2% of WT) and R91A/E97A/R131A (12% of WT) triple alanine variants were detected, but no substrate remodeling activity was observed (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lane 16 with 10 and 12 and lane 20 with 12 and 14). These data imply that the substrate interaction activity of L1 is tightly regulated. Indeed, the correct presentation of the σ54-interacting motif cannot only be explained by the release of repressive interactions maintaining L1 in an “off” state (see results with variant E81A/R91A/E97A/R131A) but is also an outcome of “positive” interactions leading to an L1 “on” state. We have shown the importance of the Glu97/Arg131 pair for substrate engagement with L1 (swapping variant E97R/R131E) demonstrating that L2 residue Arg131 plays an active role in controlling L1 exposure. In addition, these results suggest that these residues are not only involved in one protein activity but several, probably via different “pair interactions.” The failure to identify substitutions that restore full oligomer activity strongly suggests the requirement of more than one subunit in the process, subunits most likely harboring different interacting pairs (due to different nucleotides bound) at the same time. We next addressed whether Glu97/Arg131 communication was occurring in the same subunit (in cis) or between adjacent subunits (in trans). If mixing the two single variants E97R and R131E yields a gain of activity (compared with the starting activity of the single variants), then the residues are involved in intersubunit communication (in trans), whereas no change in activity suggests intrasubunit communication (in cis). Using a fixed PspF1–275 total concentration, we mixed E97R and R131E and all the possible combinations with E97A/E97R and R131A/R131E at ratios from 6:0 to 0:6 and tested the substrate binding (Fig. 4A and data not shown), remodeling (Fig. 4B, black bars, and data not shown), and ATPase (Fig. 4B, gray bars, and data not shown) activities. This “doping” experiment did not reveal any changes in substrate interaction or remodeling when compared with the results obtained with the corresponding single substitutions. In contrast, a substrate interaction complex was observed with the double variant E97R/R131E. These results demonstrate that the complementary effect observed in E97R/R131E is due to a “cis” complementation phenomenon (i.e. interactions are occurring in the same subunit). As expected, all the other combinations that were tried failed to change the activities tested (data not shown). In addition, a similar experiment was performed with combinations of single and double variants to try to mimic E81A/R91A/R131A an"

Several proteins and polysaccharide capsule have recently been implicated in the virulence of and protective immunity against Streptococcus pneumonia. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is highly conserved among S. pneumonia strains, inhibits complement activation, binds lactoferrin, elicits protective systemic immunity against pneumococcal infection, and is necessary for full pneumococcal virulence. Identification of PspA peptides that optimally bind human leukocyte antigen (HLA) would greatly contribute to global vaccine efforts, but this is hindered by the multitude of HLA polymorphisms. Here, we have used an experimental data set of 54 PspA peptides and in silico methods to predict peptide binding to HLA and murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. We also characterized spleen- and cervical lymph node (CLN)-derived helper T lymphocyte (HTL) cytokine responses to these peptides after S. pneumonia strain EF3030-challenge in mice. Individual, yet overlapping peptides, 15 amino acids in length revealed residues 199 to 246 of PspA (PspA199–246) consistently caused the greatest IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5 and proliferation as well as moderate IL-10 and IL-4 responses by ex vivo stimulated splenic and CLN CD4+ T cells isolated from S. pneumonia strain EF3030-challeged F1 (B6×BALB/c) mice. IEDB, RANKPEP, SVMHC, MHCPred, and SYFPEITHI in silico analysis tools revealed peptides in PspA199–246 also interact with a broad range of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP allelles. These data suggest that predicted MHC class II-peptide binding affinities do not always correlate with T helper (Th) cytokine or proliferative responses to PspA peptides, but when used together with in vivo validation can be a useful tool to choose candidate pneumococcal HTL epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2143823439,"Previously we have shown that insertion of IS1301 in the sia/ctr intergenic region (IGR) of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) isolates from Spain confers increased resistance against complement-mediated killing. Here we investigate the significance of IS1301 in the same location in N. meningitidis isolates from the UK. PCR and sequencing was used to screen a collection of more than 1500 meningococcal carriage and disease isolates from the UK for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR. IS1301 was not identified in the IGR among vaccine failure strains but was frequently found in serogroup B isolates (MenB) from clonal complex 269 (cc269). Almost all IS1301 insertions in cc269 were associated with novel polymorphisms, and did not change capsule expression or resistance to human complement. After excluding sequence types (STs) distant from the central genotype within cc269, there was no significant difference for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of carriage isolates compared to disease isolates. Isolates with insertion of IS1301 in the IGR are not responsible for MenC disease in UK vaccine failures. Novel polymorphisms associated with IS1301 in the IGR of UK MenB isolates do not lead to the resistance phenotype seen for IS1301 in the IGR of MenC isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2073649599,"The activation of protein kinase A involves the synergistic binding of cAMP to two cAMP binding sites on the inhibitory R subunit, causing release of the C subunit, which subsequently can carry out catalysis. We used NMR to structurally characterize in solution the RIalpha-(98-381) subunit, a construct comprising both cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domains, in the presence and absence of cAMP, and map the effects of cAMP binding at single residue resolution. Several conformationally disordered regions in free RIalpha become structured upon cAMP binding, including the interdomain alphaC:A and alphaC':A helices that connect CNB domains A and B and are primary recognition sites for the C subunit. NMR titration experiments with cAMP, B site-selective 2-Cl-8-hexylamino-cAMP, and A site-selective N(6)-monobutyryl-cAMP revealed that cyclic nucleotide binding to either the B or A site affected the interdomain helices. The NMR resonances of this interdomain region exhibited chemical shift changes upon ligand binding to a single site, either site B or A, with additional changes occurring upon binding to both sites. Such distinct, stepwise conformational changes in this region reflect the synergistic interplay between the two sites and may underlie the positive cooperativity of cAMP activation of the kinase. Furthermore, nucleotide binding to the A site also affected residues within the B domain. The present NMR study provides the first structural evidence of unidirectional allosteric communication between the sites. Trp(262), which lines the CNB A site but resides in the sequence of domain B, is an important structural determinant for intersite communication."
https://openalex.org/W2064524655,"The cell catalysts calnexin (CNX) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) cooperate in establishing the disulfide bonding of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein. Following HIV binding to lymphocytes, cell-surface PDI also reduces Env to induce the fusogenic conformation. We sought to define the contact points between Env and these catalysts to illustrate their potential as therapeutic targets. In lysates of Env-expressing cells, 15% of the gp160 precursor, but not gp120, coprecipitated with CNX, whereas only 0.25% of gp160 and gp120 coprecipitated with PDI. Under in vitro conditions, which mimic the Env/PDI interaction during virus/cell contact, PDI readily associated with Env. The domains of Env interacting in cellulo with CNX or in vitro with PDI were then determined using anti-Env antibodies whose binding site was occluded by CNX or PDI. Antibodies against domains V1/V2, C2, and the C terminus of V3 did not bind CNX-associated Env, whereas those against C1, V1/V2, and the CD4-binding domain did not react with PDI-associated Env. In addition, a mixture of the latter antibodies interfered with PDI-mediated Env reduction. Thus, Env interacts with intracellular CNX and extracellular PDI via discrete, largely nonoverlapping, regions. The sites of interaction explain the mode of action of compounds that target these two catalysts and may enable the design of further new competitive agents."

This conformational range of KorB is likely to be biologically required for DNA partitioning and for binding to a diverse set of partner proteins. The partitioning of DNA between daughter cells upon cell division is critical for the survival of all organisms. Partitioning in most bacteria is dependent on two proteins from the ParA/ParB families (1Bignell C. Thomas C.M. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ParB binds to a specific centromere-like sequence (parS) on the chromosome forming a higher order nucleoprotein complex that is thought to pair the sister chromosomes/plasmids. ParA, an ATPase, binds to ParB and is thought to act as a motor, pulling or pushing two ParB-bound chromosomes apart to different poles of the bacterial cell (2Kostelidou K. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2807-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a protein of the ParA family also encoded on the plasmid, and is more similar to chromosomal ParB homologues than those from P1 or F plasmids. This makes KorB a good candidate for structural studies to understand partitioning of bacterial chromosomes. In addition to its role in partitioning, KorB acts as a global repressor of transcription for at least six operons in RK2, where it also interacts with a number of other proteins (7Lukaszewicz M. Kostelidou K. Bartosik A.A. Cooke G.D. Thomas C.M. Jagura-Burdzy G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). KorB binds simultaneously with RNA polymerase at promoters and interacts with it to prevent open complex formation (17Williams D.R. Motallebi-Veshareh M. Thomas C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). KorB can act upstream or downstream of the promoters and also at a distance (2Kostelidou K. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

At all promoters, KorB acts cooperatively with a second repressor, either KorA, TrbA, or KorC, forming a regulatory network that coordinates expression of the operons on the plasmid (3Zatyka M. Bingle L. Jones A.C. Thomas C.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Bingle L.E. Macartney D.P. Fantozzi A. Manzoor S.E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

Therefore, KorB is of interest for understanding not only partitioning, but also for understanding cooperative protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in gene regulation. KorB consists of three distinct segments (7Lukaszewicz M. Kostelidou K. Bartosik A.A. Cooke G.D. Thomas C.M. Jagura-Burdzy G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) of which only two have been crystallized and their structures determined to atomic resolution. Firstly, the C-terminal 64 amino acid residue dimerization domain (residues 294–358) (18Delbrück H. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4191-4198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is structurally similar to SH3 domains, and consists of β-strands. Secondly, the central domain (residues 137–252), which interacts with operator DNA (19Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is entirely α-helical. The structure of the N-terminal 137 amino acids of KorB is unknown, however the corresponding region of a homologous protein, SpoOJ from Thermos thermophilus, together with its central domain, have been determined (20Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is of mixed secondary structure, and the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of SpoOJ are not seen in this structure. KorB has an additional N-terminal 20 amino acids compared with SpoOJ; it also contains two additional predicted helices at the N terminus of the central domain, after the helix-turn-helix motif, which are not found in SpoOJ (Fig. 1B) (1Bignell C. Thomas C.M. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In KorB these helices contact DNA and are postulated to lead to sequence-specific binding. Thus, despite the sequence homology, the overall structure and DNA binding of SpoOJ may differ from that of KorB. To date there is no structural information about a full-length ParB protein. Using a range of biophysical techniques we show the protein is modular in its domain organization and that the orientations of the domains of KorB within the protein are highly flexible due to zones of intrinsic disorder along the length of the protein. As the first structural description of a full-length ParB protein, we have reconstructed KorB from the known crystal structures using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) 5The abbreviations used are: SAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringSEC-MALLSsize exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scatteringWTwild typeM̄wweight average molecular weightPDBProtein Data Bank. and calculated an ensemble of conformations that the protein adopts in solution.

Cells were scanned every 10 min at 280 nm. All data were analyzed using SEDFIT (26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Analytical fractionation was carried out using a series of SEC columns TSK G6000PW and TSK G4000PW protected by a similarly packed guard column (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) with on-line MALLS (Dawn HELIOS II, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) and refractive index (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology) detectors. The eluant was Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pumped at 0.8 ml min−1 (PU-1580, Jasco, Great Dunmow, UK), and the injected volume was 100 μl (∼1.0 × 10−3 g ml−1) for each sample. Absolute weight average molecular weights (M̄w) were calculated using ASTRA® (Version 5.1.9.1) software (Wyatt Technology). Online viscometry measurements were made using the Viscostar differential pressure viscometer (Wyatt Technology), and data were transformed using the software provided. The model of the N-terminal region 54–154 of KorB was built using the program CPHmodels 2.0. (27Lund, O., Nielsen, M., Lundegaard, C., Worning, P., (2002) CPHmodels: 3M, a computer program to extract 3D models. in CASP5 Conference.Google Scholar) based on homology to SpoOJ (20Leonard T.A.

Small angle scattering data were collected at Beamline X33 at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). Proteins (3–15 mg/ml) were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. Data were collected at an x-ray wavelength of 1.54 Å, and the SAXS cell was equilibrated to 20 °C. Data were taken in 1-min frames, and typically 2 frames were taken for each cell. Low angle portions of successive frames were compared for evidence for aggregation of the sample due to photo-damage. Data were reduced to one dimension and displayed using the program PRIMUS (28Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Molecular mass was determined from the forward scattering I(0) calculated from the Guinier analysis using the scattering from 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data from three concentrations of each protein were compared with examine for aggregation, and, where necessary, the data sets were merged so the low angle scattering came from the most dilute sample. SAXS data is of the form,I(s)=∫P(r)sin(2πsr)2πsrdr(Eq. 1) where r is the distance between scattering centers in the molecule, P(r) is the distance distribution function, ands=2sinθλ(Eq. 2) and 2θ is the scattering angle. Distance distribution data were derived from the scattering data using the indirect Fourier transform of Equation 1 where,P(r)=1π∫I(s)2sinπsr2πsrds(Eq. 3) using the program GNOM (29Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For potentially folded domains, data were reconstructed using the program Gasbor (30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Here, a simulated annealing method is used to minimize against X2 discrepancy,X2=1n−1∑j=1n[〈c(s)〉/DR(sj)−clexp(sj)σ(sj)]2(Eq. 4) where c is a scaling function, IDR is the intensity from a bead representing an amino acid, and σ is the standard deviation. The process is repeated 10–12 times, with resulting structures averaged. Conformers for the intrinsically disordered domains were calculated using a bead for each amino acid, and the vector between the center of each bead was weighted by the known vectors for each dipeptide Cα–Cα from the Protein Data Bank (31Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Pools of 10,000 conformers were generated using the program RANCH (31Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). For constructs containing the N-terminal domain, this was modeled either completely unfolded or with residues 51–137 modeled using SpoOJ as a template. In the latter case, the structures were aligned with the central domain across residues 137–154. For WT and (NΔ150)KorB, dimers were constructed using the known structure of the dimerization domain as a template. Random conformers were selected from the pool of 10,000 generated monomer conformers and aligned using the CCP4 module LSQKAB (32Potterton E. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Cowtan K. Noble M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each constructed dimer was checked for steric clashes; dimers without clashes were then collated until 10,000 models, each with non-symmetry-related monomers, had been constructed. The theoretical intensity of each conformer was calculated using CRYSOL (33Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Selected ensembles of curves forming distributions of conformations that represent the raw scattering data were generated with the genetic algorithm GAJOE13 (31Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Here, the pool of theoretical scattering curves is divided into “chromosomes”: ensembles of curves that represent the scattering data. Cycles of mutation and crossing are carried out and the goodness of fit of each ensemble compared with the theoretical scattering data using the discrepancy in Equation 5.X2=1N−1∑j[lexp(sj)−clcalc(sj)σ(sj)]2(Eq. 5) This process was repeated five times, and distributions were compared. Fig. 1A shows the domain organization in KorB. Bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence using the program DISPROT (34Sickmeier M. Hamilton J.A. LeGall T. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Tantos A. Szabo B. Tompa P. Chen J. Uversky V.N. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D786-D793Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) predicts that KorB protein has a zone of disorder for the first 64 amino acids, as well as between the DNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerization domain (supplemental Fig. S1). These regions contain many charged residues, with only small hydrophobic residues that cannot form a compact hydrophobic core. Such disordered regions are predicted to be common in eukaryotic genomes and occur in several proteins with key functions in cell signaling and gene regulation, but few examples have been found in bacteria (35Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Predictions of disorder in these regions of KorB correspond well with the known structural data (Fig. 1B). For instance the known structure of the DNA-binding domain (PDB code: 1R71) was determined from a KorB derivative that also included the linker region (residues 252–294), although none of the additional residues in this region were visible in the crystal structure (19Khare D. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C-terminal dimerization domain (residues 297–358), which has also been crystallized (18Delbrück H. Ziegelin G. Lanka E. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4191-4198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 1IGU) was initially obtained on attempting to crystallize the full-length protein. This suggests that the wild-type protein is readily proteolyzed at residue 296, at the end of the linker region. To characterize the structure of the protein in solution, we have studied wild-type KorB and a series of deletion mutants of KorB, which contain different combinations of predicted ordered and disordered domains (Fig. 1A). (CΔ60)KorB does not include the C-terminal dimerization domain, whereas (CΔ105)KorB does not include the dimerization domain and the putative flexible linker. (NΔ150)KorB includes the central, DNA-binding domain, and the C-terminal dimerization domain, with the putative flexible linker but does not include the first 150 amino acids of KorB, including the putative disordered N-terminal region; whereas (NΔ297)KorB contains primarily the C-terminal dimerization domain, crystallized previously (PDB code: 1IGU). To examine the N-terminal region of the protein, we constructed (NΔ31-CΔ221)KorB, which contains all the structurally uncharacterized N-terminal regions of KorB, apart from the first 31 amino acids: all of which are proposed to be disordered. To determine sample homogeneities and solution molecular weights, the four largest proteins were analyzed by both SEC-MALLS (size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering) and analytical ultracentrifugation. As expected, full-length KorB elutes first from the SEC column, and (CΔ105)KorB last (supplemental Fig. S2), each giving a single peak. The constructs (NΔ297)KorB and (NΔ31-CΔ221)KorB are below the size that can be accurately determined by SEC-MALLS and, as such, were not subjected to this method of analysis. Analysis of the multiangle-dependent light scattering of these peaks showed that all the proteins were monodisperse; as judged by the ratio of the Z-averaged and the number averaged molecular masses, Mz/Mn (Table 1). The weight M̄w values were determined for each of the protein samples from solution light scattering and are also shown in Table 1. The WT KorB and (NΔ150)KorB proteins are dimeric as expected, because they contain the C-terminal dimerization domain, whereas (CΔ105)KorB and (CΔ60)KorB are monomeric, due to the deletion of this domain.TABLE 1Hydrodynamic parameters determined from light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and viscometry analysisConstructs20,w0aDetermined from sedimentation velocity.f/fobDetermined from analysis of sedimentation coefficient using SEDNTERP.−MwcCalculated from the amino acid sequence.−MwdDetermined from a direct fit to the sedimentation velocity data.−MweDetermined from multiangle light scattering.Polydispersity (Mz/Mn)fDetermined from the molecular weight moments from light scattering analysis.[η]gViscosity increment determined from differential pressure viscometry.SvedbergskDakDakDaml.g−1KorB3.8 (±0.2)1.9 (±0.1)41.678.2 (±0.5)83.7 (±0.08)1.003 (±0.002)14.1 (±0.01)NΔ1502.7 (±0.2)1.6 (±0.1)25.747.5 (±0.5)51.3 (±0.05)1.003 (±0.002)11.6 (±0.07)CΔ602.5 (±0.1)1.7 (±0.1)34.734.7 (±0.5)34.5 (±0.04)1.008 (±0.004)13.6 (±0.01)CΔ1052.1 (±0.1)1.6 (±0.1)30.129.9 (±0.4)32.2 (±0.03)1.004 (±0.002)11.0 (±0.01)(NΔ31-CΔ221)KorB1.8 (±0.1)1.06 (±0.1)7.119.9 (±0.3)NDhND, not determined.NDND(NΔ297)KorB1.5 (±0.1)1.55 (±0.1)18.119.9 (±0.3)NDNDNDa Determined from sedimentation velocity.b Determined from analysis of sedimentation coefficient using SEDNTERP.c Calculated from the amino acid sequence.d Determined from a direct fit to the sedimentation velocity data.e Determined from multiangle light scattering.f Determined from the molecular weight moments from light scattering analysis.g Viscosity increment determined from differential pressure viscometry.h ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab All sedimentation velocity profiles (Fig. 2A) showed a single symmetric peak, which did not vary with loading concentration of the sample (data not shown). This is also indicative of a single monodisperse species and complements the SEC-MALLS analysis. Molecular weights determined from the ratio of sedimentation and diffusion coefficient were close to those determined from SEC-MALLS (Table 1), again indicative of monodispersity. For the smaller proteins, (NΔ297)KorB and (NΔ31-CΔ221)KorB, analytical ultracentrifugation shows the appropriate masses and the frictional ratios derived from the analysis of the sedimentation velocity data are reasonable for globular proteins (25Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom2005: 1-26Google Scholar). In contrast, the frictional ratios for the four largest proteins range from 1.6 to 1.9 (Table 1) are larger than expected for a “typical” globular protein (1.01–1.60) (25Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom2005: 1-26Google Scholar). This indicates that the molecules are quite extended in solution. The viscosity increments derived for the four largest proteins were found to fall between values of 11.0 and 14.1 ml/g. Intrinsic viscosity has a weak dependence on molecular mass but a strong dependence on shape and flexibility (36Harding S.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 207-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These values fall closer to values in the literature for flexible and unfolded proteins (typically 13–15 ml/g), than for globular proteins (typically 2.5–5.0 ml/g). This situation is consistent with previous determinations of intrinsic viscosity on unstructured proteins (36Harding S.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 207-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 38Chenal A. Guijarro J.I. Raynal B. Delepierre M. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1781-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and in-line with our bioinformatics predictions. NMR and CD spectroscopy values were used to examine the secondary structure of the proteins. The one-dimensional NMR spectra of the proteins (supplemental Fig. S3A) showed some signatures of folded protein, with dispersed signals, including high field methyl groups (supplemental Fig. S3B) and low field amino protons. However, all the proteins also had a number of sharp, intense peaks corresponding to highly flexible segments. Fig. 2B shows CD spectra for full-length KorB and the deletion mutants. All of the constructs showed some folded character; WT KorB, (NΔ150)KorB, and (CΔ60)KorB have similar CD spectra with a peak at 222 nm, consistent with some α-helica"
