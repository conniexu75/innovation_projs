https://openalex.org/W2016772559,"Acid sensing is associated with nociception, taste transduction, and perception of extracellular pH fluctuations in the brain. Acid sensing is carried out by the simplest class of ligand-gated channels, the family of H+-gated Na+ channels. These channels have recently been cloned and belong to the acid-sensitive ion channel (ASIC) family. Toxins from animal venoms have been essential for studies of voltage-sensitive and ligand-gated ion channels. This paper describes a novel 40-amino acid toxin from tarantula venom, which potently blocks (IC50 = 0.9 nm) a particular subclass of ASIC channels that are highly expressed in both central nervous system neurons and sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia. This channel type has properties identical to those described for the homomultimeric assembly of ASIC1a. Homomultimeric assemblies of other members of the ASIC family and heteromultimeric assemblies of ASIC1a with other ASIC subunits are insensitive to the toxin. The new toxin is the first high affinity and highly selective pharmacological agent for this novel class of ionic channels. It will be important for future studies of their physiological and physio-pathological roles.

They are present in many neuronal cell types throughout the central nervous system (1Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neurosci.

These channels might also play an important role in pathological situations such as brain ischemia or epilepsy, which produce significant extracellular acidification. They are also present in nociceptive neurons (1Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 24: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I.

Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The ASICs belong to a superfamily that includes amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (13Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Barbry P.

Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Several ASIC subunits have now been described: ASIC1a (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), ASIC1b (17Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The different subunits produce channels with different kinetics, external pH sensitivities, and tissue distribution. They can form functional homomultimers as well as heteromultimers (21Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C.

ASIC1a and ASIC1b both mediate rapidly inactivating currents following rapid and modest acidification of the external pH. However, although ASIC1a is present in both brain and afferent sensory neurons, its splice variant ASIC1b is found only in sensory neurons (17Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). ASIC2a forms an active H+-gated channel and is abundant in the brain but essentially absent in sensory neurons, whereas its splice variant ASIC2b is present in both brain and sensory neurons and is inactive as an homomultimer. ASIC2b can form functional heteromultimers with other ASIC subunits and particularly ASIC3 (21Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ASIC3 is found exclusively in small sensory neurons that act as nociceptors. Its expression in various heteromultimeric systems generates a biphasic current with a fast inactivating phase followed by a sustained component (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The association of ASIC2b with ASIC3 forms an heteromultimer with properties (time course and ionic selectivity) similar to those of a native sustained H+-sensitive channel, which is present in dorsal root ganglion cells and appears to play a particularly important role in pain sensation (6Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Venoms from snakes, scorpions, sea anemones, marine snails, and spiders are rich sources of peptide toxins that have proven of great value in the functional exploration of voltage-sensitive and ligand-gated ion channels. This report describes the discovery and characterization from the venom of the South American tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei, of psalmotoxin 1 (PcTX1), the first potent and specific blocker of this new class of ASIC channels. P. cambridgei(Araneae Theraphosidae) venom was obtained by electrical stimulation of anesthetized spiders (Invertebrate Biologics). Freeze-dried crude venom was resuspended in distilled water, centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 20 min), filtered on 0.45-μm microfilters (SJHVL04NS, 4-mm diameter; Millipore), and stored at −20 °C prior to analysis. Crude venom diluted to 10 times the initial volume was fractionated by C8 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (10 × 250 mm, 5C8MS; Nacalai Tesque) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water in constant 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A second purification step used cation exchange chromatography on a Tosoh SP5PW column (4.6 × 70 mm) (Tosoh), with a linear gradient of ammonium acetate in water (20 mmto 2 m). A total of 160 μl of venom was purified in two separate batches (10 and 150 μl). All solvents used were of HPLC grade. Separation was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard HP1100 system coupled to a diode array detector and a microcomputer running the Chemstation® software. Monitoring of the elution was done at 215 and 280 nm. Samples were hydrolyzed in a Waters Pico-Tag station, with 6 n HCl (0.6% phenol) at 110 °C, under vacuum for 20 h. Hydrolyzed peptides were derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate, and the derivatized amino acid mixtures were analyzed by C18 RP-HPLC using a gradient of 60% acetonitrile in 50 mm phosphate buffer (100 mmNaClO4). The peptide was reduced and alkylated by 4-vinyl-pyridine, desalted by C8 RP-HPLC, and submitted to automated N-terminal sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 477A gas phase sequencer. Reduced-alkylated toxin was submitted to the following treatments: (a) tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated Trypsin (Sigma), 2% w/w at 37 °C for 14 h in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1 mmCaCl2 pH 8.1; (b) V8 protease at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, in 10% acetonitrile; and (c) BNP-skatole (2-(nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine) at 37 °C for 24 h in 75% acetic acid. Resulting peptides were separated by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water in constant 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra of native PcTX1 dissolved in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix were recorded on a MALDI-TOF Perseptive Voyager Elite spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems), in positive ion linear mode using an internal calibration method with a mixture of β-insulin (3495.9 Da) and bovine insulin (5733.5 Da). Data were analyzed using the GRAMS386 software. Theoretical molecular masses and pI values were calculated from sequence data using the GPMAW protein analysis software. Synthetic PcTX1 was analyzed on a Micromass Platform II electrospray system (Micromass, Altrincham, UK), in positive mode (cone voltage 20kV, temperature 60 °C). Sequence homologies were determined using sequences obtained from a search of nonredundant protein data bases via the BLAST server. Sequence alignments and percentages of similarity were calculated with ClustalW. The synthesis of native PcTX1 was performed using the Fmoc/tert-butyl and maximal temporary protection strategy on an Applied Biosystems 433A synthesizer. The chemical procedure used 0.05 nm of Fmoc-Thr(OtBu)-4-hydroxymethylphenoxy resin (0.39 mmol/g), a 20-fold excess of each amino acid, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole activation. Deprotection (1.5 h) and cleavage (200 mg of peptide + resin) were achieved using 10 ml of a mixture trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water (9.5/0.25/0.25, v/v/v). The acidic mixture was then precipitated twice in 100 ml of cold diethylether. The solid was dissolved in 50 ml of 10% aqueous acetic acid and freeze-dried. The crude reduced toxin was purified by RP-HPLC on a C18 semi-preparative column (21 × 250 mm, Jupiter) using a 40-min gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–18% B in 4 min, 30% B in 30 min, and 100% B in 6 min, where B is 90% acetonitrile/H2O/0.1%trifluoroacetic acid). Oxidation of the reduced toxin was achieved at 0.1 mg/10 ml in degassed potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.8) using the redox couple reduced glutathione (5 mm)/oxidized glutathione (0.5 mm). The disappearance of the reduced peptide was monitored by RP-HPLC on a C18 analytical column (10 × 15 mm, Vydac) using a 40-min gradient (0–18% B in 8 min, 30% B in 18 min, and 60% B in 14 min). Cloning of cDNA and synthesis of complementary RNA were done as described previously (26Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Xenopus laevis were purchased from Centre de Recherches en Biochimie Macromoléculaire (Montpellier, France). Pieces of the ovary were surgically removed, and individual oocytes were dissected in a saline solution (ND96) containing 96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Stage V and VI oocytes were treated for 2 h with collagenase (1 mg/ml, type Ia; Sigma) in ND96 to remove follicular cells. cRNA (ASIC1a, ASIC2a, Kv2.1, and Kv2.2) or DNA (ASIC1b, ratASIC3, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) solutions were injected (5–10 ng/μl for cRNA and 50–100 ng/μl for DNA, 50 nl/oocyte) using a pressure microinjector. The oocytes were kept at 19 °C in the ND96 saline solution supplemented with gentamycin (5 μg/ml). Oocytes were studied within 2–4 days following injection. In a 0.3-ml perfusion chamber, a single oocyte was impaled with two standard glass microelectrodes (1–2.5 MΩ resistance) filled with 3 m KCl and maintained under voltage clamp using a Dagan TEV 200 amplifier. Stimulation of the preparation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using the pClamp software (Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–22 °C) in ND96. 0.1% bovine serum albumine was added in solutions containing PcTX1 to prevent its adsorption to tubing and containers. For measurements of ASIC currents, changes in extracellular pH were induced by rapid perfusion, with or without PcTX1, near the oocyte. Test solutions with a pH of 4 or 5 were buffered with MES rather than HEPES. Voltage-dependent K+ channels were activated by depolarization tests to +10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV, and the toxin solutions were applied externally by gently puffing 100 μl near the oocyte. In the initial screening, 1-μl aliquots of crude venoms were tested at a 1:1000 dilution in ND96 solution. During the fractionation process aliquots (1:20) of chromatographic fractions were dried, redissolved in ND96, and applied to the oocyte by perfusion. COS cells, at a density of 20.000 cells/35-mm diameter Petri dish, were transfected with a mix of CD8 and one of the following plasmids: pCI-ASIC1a, pCI-ASIC1b, pCI-ASIC2a, and pCI-ASIC3 (1:5) using the DEAE-Dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1–3 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to fix CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal, Norway). DRG of 2–3-day-old Wistar rats were mechanically dissociated and maintained in culture in Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor. Cells were used for electrophysiological recordings 2 or 3 days after plating. Cerebella of 4–8-day-old mice were dissected, mechanically dissociated, and cultured as described previously (27Lauritzen I. De Weille J. Adelbrecht C. Lesage F. Murer G. Raisman-Vozari R. Lazdunski M. Brain Res. 1997; 753: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were used for electrophysiological recordings 10–14 days after plating. Ion currents were recorded using either the whole cell or outside-out patch clamp technique, and results were stored on hard disc. Data analysis was carried out using the Serf freeware. Statistical significance of differences between sets of data was estimated by the single-sided Student test. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Changes in extracellular pH were induced by shifting one of six outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell or patch. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–24 °C). The screening of several tarantula venoms was carried out against cloned ASIC channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. It singled out P. cambridgeivenom as containing a potent inhibitor of the ASIC1a proton-gated current. A diluted solution of 1 μl of crude venom (1:1000) applied to the oocyte provoked a 90% block of the ASIC1a current. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the venom by reversed-phase and cation exchange chromatography led to the purification of the minor venom constituent Psalmotoxin 1 (PcTX1), in a two-step process (Fig.1, A and B). PcTX1 is a 40-amino acid peptide, possessing 6 cysteines linked by three disulfide bridges. Its full sequence was established by N-terminal Edman degradation of the reduced alkylated toxin and of several cleavage fragments (Fig. 1 D). The calculated molecular mass (4689.40 Da average) was in accordance with the measured molecular mass (4689.25 Da) and suggested a free carboxylic acid at the C-terminal extremity. PcTX1 has limited overall homology to other spider venom toxins identified to date (Fig. 1 E). However, it shares a conserved cysteine distribution (Fig. 1 F) found both in spider venom and cone snails polypeptide toxins (28Narasimhan L. Singh J. Humblet C. Guruprasad K. Blundell T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1573-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is a basic polypeptide (pI 10.38 for the native form with disulfide bridges bonded) comprising a large number of basic residues (9 residues, including 4 arginines) but also of acidic residues (6 residues). The chemical synthesis of PcTX1-OH unambiguously confirmed the structure of PcTX1. The purified refolded synthetic toxin (PcTX1 s) and the native form have identical measured molecular mass, and when co-injected in two separate experiments using reversed-phase and cation exchange HPLC, native and synthetic PcTX1 were indistinguishable in their migration and co-eluted in both systems (Fig. 1 C). Most electrophysiological experiments were therefore conducted with the synthetic toxin. The effect of PcTX1 on the activity of ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 channels expressed in X. laevis oocytes is shown in Fig. 2. The natural as well as the synthetic toxin block the ASIC1a current recorded at pH 6, with an IC50 of 0.9 nm (Fig.2, A and B). The blockade is rapid and reversible. PcTX1 at 10 nm also completely blocks the ASIC1a current activated by a pH drop to pH 5 or pH 4 (not shown). PcTX1 is highly selective. Neither the native nor the synthetic PcTX1 (10 nm or 100 nm) blocked ASIC1b currents activated at pH 6 (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, the ASIC2a channel activated by a pH drop to pH 5 was insensitive to the action of PcTX1 at 10 nm (Fig. 2 D) or 100 nm (not shown). The rapid and slow components of the ASIC3 channel were also insensitive to the perfusion of PcTX1 at 10 nm (Fig.2 E) and 100 nm (not shown). The toxin was also tested on the epithelial Na+ channel formed by the assembly of α, β, and γ subunits (30Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and no inhibition occurred with concentrations of 10 nm or 100 nm PcTx1 (n = 3, not shown). Sequence homologies of PcTX1 with other spider toxins that block different subtypes of voltage-dependent K+channels such as hanatoxins (Kv2.1) (31Swartz K.J. Mackinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), heteropodatoxins (Kv4.2) (32Sanguinetti M.C. Johnson J.H. Hammerland L.G. Kelbaugh P.R. Volkmann R.A. Saccomano N.A. Mueller A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 491-498PubMed Google Scholar), and phrixotoxins (Kv4.2, Kv4.3) (33Diochot S. Drici M.D. Moinier D. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 E) prompted us to test its effects against Kv2.1, Kv2.2, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These channels were not affected by 10 or 100 nm PcTX1 (not shown). Experiments carried out with the same ASIC channels expressed in COS cells confirmed the results obtained in oocytes. ASIC1a was completely inhibited by 10 nm PcTX1, whereas ASIC1b, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 were insensitive (n = 10 for each channel) to a higher toxin concentration of 50 nm (not shown). PcTX1 was then assayed on heteromultimers of the ASIC1a subunit (Fig.3). Co-expression of ASIC1a and ASIC3 in COS cells produces a rapidly inactivating H+-gated current (τ = 0.19 ± 0.01 s at pH 6, n = 5) that is insensitive to PcTX1 (n = 10) (Fig.3 C), whereas ASIC1a homomultimers produce a current that inactivates more slowly at the same pH (τ = 2.10 ± 0.30 s, n = 10) but that is completely blocked by PcTX1 (10 nm) (Fig. 3 A). ASIC1a/ASIC2a heteromultimers were also insensitive to PcTX1 (Fig.3 B). The ASIC1a channel can also be blocked by amiloride, but the IC50 is 10 μm (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), i.e.104 times lower in affinity than PcTX1. Moreover amiloride is not selective. It blocks the transient current generated by ASIC1a (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), ASIC1b (17Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), ASIC2a (18Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Small DRG neurons isolated from 2-day-old rats were voltage clamped at −60 mV and stimulated by a pH drop from pH 7.3 to pH 6. As previously observed in small sensory neurons from trigeminal ganglia (1Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 24: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this pH change evoked three different types of responses that are presented in Fig.4 (A–C). Currents presented in Fig. 4 A were blocked by 3–10 nm of the toxin PcTX1, whereas H+-evoked currents in other neurons were insensitive to the toxin (Fig. 4,B–C). DRG neurons express at least two subpopulations of transient currents as judged by their constants of inactivation (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). One population inactivates very rapidly with a time constant of inactivation below 0.5 s, whereas the other one has time constants between 1 and 3 s, the average time constant of inactivation being 1.95 ± 0.14 s (n = 23). The data clearly indicate that the most rapidly inactivating currents with an average time constant of inactivation of 0.24 ± 0.03 s (n = 22) are insensitive to PcTX1. Only the more slowly inactivating H+-gated channels are highly sensitive to PcTX1. The dose-response curve presented in Fig. 4 E was obtained from the PcTX1-sensitive population of neurons. The IC50value for half-maximum inhibition is 0.7 nm, very similar to the value of 0.9 nm obtained for ASIC1a channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Fig. 4 F shows that a change of the extracellular pH from pH 7.3 to pH 6 in neurons that express the channel type shown in Fig.4 A evokes a rapid depolarization resulting in a train of action potentials. This effect is blocked by very low concentrations of PcTX1, and this inhibition is reversible. ASIC channel subunits are highly expressed in cerebellum and particularly in granular cells (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 34Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This is why we have used these cells to analyze the properties of these channels in central nervous system neurons (Fig. 5). Cerebellar granule cells in culture all responded to a pH drop from pH 7.3 to pH 6 with a transient Na+ inward current characterized by a time constant of inactivation of 2.06 ± 0.17 s (n= 10) (Fig. 5 A). Both the rate of inactivation and the pH dependence of this H+-gated Na+ channel (pH0.5 6.6 versus pH0.5 6.4) are very similar to those of the ASIC1a channel (Ref. 12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar and this work) (Fig. 5 B). H+-gated Na+ channels with the same properties have been recently identified in cortical neurons (35Varming T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The transient H+-gated Na+channel expressed by granule cells was completely inhibited by 10 nm PcTX1 (n = 10) (Fig. 5 A). PcTX1 is a novel toxin from tarantula venom that is a potent and specific blocker of one class of H+-gated Na+channels. The molecular scaffold of PcTX1 is likely to be similar to that previously described for both cone snail and spider toxins (28Narasimhan L. Singh J. Humblet C. Guruprasad K. Blundell T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,36Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It comprises a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet structure reticulated by three disulfide bridges and tightly folded into the “knottin” fold pattern (29Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1573-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). PcTX1 is characterized by the unusual quadruplet Lys25-Arg26-Arg27-Arg28, which probably forms a strongly positive “patch” at the surface of the toxin molecule, constituting an area that is a strong candidate for receptor recognition. It is particularly intriguing to observe (a) that PcTX1 is absolutely specific for ASIC1a and can distinguish between the two ASIC1 splice variants ASIC1a and ASIC1b, although they only differ in their N-terminal sequence (17Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar); (b) that PcTX1 can also distinguish between ASIC1a, ASIC2 and ASIC3; and (c) that PcTX1 looses its capacity to block ASIC1a as soon as this subunit is associated with another member of the family, be it ASIC2a or ASIC3. An important site of the interaction of ASIC1a with PcTX1 is probably located in the extracellular stretch of 113 amino acids situated immediately after the first transmembrane domain. This is the only extracellular site where the splice variants ASIC1a and ASIC1b are different. They are identical in extracellular regions except for the 113-residue region immediately C-terminal to the first transmembrane domain. ASIC1a is present in the central nervous system (notably in the hippocampus and the cerebellar granular layer) as well as in DRG neurons (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological experiments have shown that both cerebellar granule cells and a subpopulation of DRG neurons possess H+-gated currents that inactivate at pH 6 with time constants of 1.95–2.06 s, very similar if not identical to the time constant of inactivation (2.10 ± 0.30 s) of the homomultimeric ASIC1a current expressed in COS cells. The H+-gated currents in these neurons are inhibited by very low concentrations of PcTX1. The resemblance in the inactivation kinetics and pH dependence, in the selective block of the current by PcTX1 and the near identity of the IC50 values for the blockade of ASIC1a channels (IC50 = 0.9 nm) and of native channels (IC50 = 0.7 nm) strongly suggest that the H+-gated current with a τinact of ∼2 s in both DRG cells and cerebellar granular cells is mediated by an homomultimeric assembly of ASIC1a. This view is strengthened by the fact that none of the heteromultimeric channels tested (ASIC1a/ASIC2a and ASIC1a/ASIC3) is sensitive to the toxin. DRG neurons also express H+-gated currents with time constants of inactivation that are either faster or slower than the time constant of inactivation of the homomultimeric ASIC1a current. A class of these proton-sensitive channels inactivates at a fast rate (τinact = 0.24 ± 0.03 s), which turns out, as shown in this work, to be very similar to the rate of inactivation of the ASIC1a/ASIC3 channel expressed in COS cells (τinact = 0.19 ± 0.01 s). This rapidly inactivating current, like the current generated by ASIC1a/ASIC3 heteromultimers, is insensitive to PcTX1. The ASIC3 channel alone or in association with ASIC2b (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) probably corresponds to the sustained current recorded in DRG cells (6Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). ASIC3 homomultimers, ASIC3/ASIC2b heteromultimers, and the native noninactivating H+-gated channels are not blocked by PcTX1. It is hoped that further studies will provide other toxins specifically active on these maintained channels that are thought to play an important role in pain (6Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Spider venoms are mixtures of neuroactive peptides capable of incapacitating the prey through a myriad of molecular mechanisms. PcTX1 is a potent tool that now opens the way to a more detailed analysis of the physiological function of the important class of H+-gated Na+ channels. We are grateful to M. Jodar, Y. Benhamou and V. Lopez for technical assistance and to E. Lingueglia for the epithelial Na+ channel and ASIC2b clones and very helpful discussions. The support of Dr. T.

Transient transfection experiments with human RAGE promoter-luciferase chimeras revealed that the region from nucleotide number −751 to −629 and the region from −239 to −89 in the RAGE 5′-flanking sequence exhibited the AGE/TNF-α and E2 responsiveness, respectively. Site-directed mutation of an nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) site at −671 or of Sp-1 sites at −189 and −172 residing in those regions resulted in an abrogation of the AGE/TNF-α- or E2-mediated transcriptional activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that ECV304 cell nuclear extracts contained factors which retarded the NF-κB and Sp-1 elements, and that the DNA-protein complexes were supershifted by anti-p65/p50 NF-κB and anti-Sp-1/estrogen receptor α antibodies, respectively. These results suggest that AGE, TNF-α, and E2 can activate the RAGE gene through NF-κB and Sp-1, causing enhanced AGE-RAGE interactions, which would lead to an exacerbation of diabetic microvasculopathy.

These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives termed advanced glycation end products (AGE)1 (1Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). AGE are known to accumulate in various tissues at an extremely accelerated rate under a diabetic state, and are implicated in the development of diabetic vascular complications, e.g. retinopathy and nephropathy (1Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that AGE exert their effects on endothelial cells and pericytes, the constituents of microvessels, through interactions with a cell-surface receptor for AGE (RAGE); AGE stimulate the growth of microvascular endothelial cells through an induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to angiogenesis on the one hand (2Yamagishi S. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Katsuno K. Sato F. Mita I. Ooka H. Satozawa N. Kawakami T. Nomura M. Yamamoto H. J. Biol.

Fujimori H. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Yamamoto H. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). AGE exhibit a growth inhibitory action on pericytes (4Yamagishi S.

Kuwabara T. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1961; 66: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). RAGE belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules (6Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Tsang T.C. Stern D. J. Biol.

Przysiecki C. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts with various ligands including AGE (9Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Brett J. Yan S.D.

Res. 1999; 84: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The engagement of RAGE by AGE has been reported to induce cellular oxidant stress, activating the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (11Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J.

Res. 1999; 84: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). AGE-RAGE interaction thus has been thought to play a central role in the development of diabetic vasculopathy. To determine how the RAGE gene is regulated under a diabetic state is, therefore, important for clarifying the pathogenesis of diabetic complications as well as for understanding the physiological roles of RAGE. It has been reported that AGE-rich blood vessels show enhanced RAGE immunoreactivity (13Soulis T. Thallas V. Youssef S. Gilbert R.E. McWilliam B.G. Murray-McIntosh R.P. Cooper M.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); this implies the possibility that AGE themselves may up-regulate the RAGE expression. Among cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is thought to be involved in the development of diabetes (14Moller D.E. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated that serum TNF-α levels are increased in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (15Hotamisligil G.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 19Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 20Antwerp D.J.V. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Recently, NF-κB has been reported to play a role in the basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of the RAGE gene (21Li J.F. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16498-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that diabetic vasculopathy is often aggravated during pregnancy, probably due to the increased level of serum estrogen (22Moloney J.B.M. Drury M.I. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1982; 93: 745-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Klein B.E.K. Moss S.E. Klein R.

Ophthalmology. 1996; 103: 1815-1819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). From these observations, the possibility that TNF-α and estrogen worsen the diabetic complications through the induction of RAGE gene expression should also be considered. In the present study, we thus examined the effects of AGE, TNF-α, and 17β-estradiol (E2) on RAGE gene expression and found that the three agents are capable of up-regulating the RAGE mRNA and protein levels in human microvascular endothelial cells. On the other hand, non-glycated BSA, other cytokines, and an anti-estrogen did not affect the RAGE mRNA levels. mRNA stability and promoter assays demonstrated that the induction was at the transcriptional level, and that AGE and TNF-α induced the RAGE gene through an activation of NF-κB while E2 induced the gene through Sp-1. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V, fatty acid-free, endotoxin-free) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). TNF-α was purchased from Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). E2 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH tamoxifen) were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products.

Human skin microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) were maintained in HuMedia-EB2 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (5 ng/ml), heparin (10 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml) according to the supplier's instructions (Kurabo Corp., Osaka, Japan) in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2. The human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived cell line ECV304 (25Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev.

All experiments using HMVEC and ECV304 cells were carried out in media lacking epidermal growth factor and hydrocortisone, and FBS, respectively. These media are referred to as the experimental media. AGE-BSA was prepared by incubating BSA with 0.5 m glucose at 37 °C for 6 weeks under sterile conditions as described previously (2Yamagishi S. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Katsuno K. Sato F. Mita I. Ooka H. Satozawa N. Kawakami T. Nomura M. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8723-8730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). After unincorporated sugars were removed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), glucose-modified higher molecular weight materials were used as AGE-BSA. Control non-glycated BSA was incubated under the same conditions except for the absence of glucose. The concentration of AGE-BSA and control BSA were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 71: 248-254Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from subconfluent cultures of HMVEC or ECV304 cells incubated under various conditions, using a Quick Prep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), and analyzed by RT-PCR with a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA) as described previously (27Hatakeyama H. Miyamori I. Fujita T. Takeda Y. Takeda R. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers and probes for human RAGE, VEGF, and β-actin mRNA were the same as described previously (4Yamagishi S. Hsu C.-C. Taniguchi M. Harada S. Yamamoto Y. Ohsawa K.

The fragments amplified with PCR were sequence-verified on both strands by the chain termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Five-μl aliquots of each RT-PCR reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membrane was hybridized with the respective probes, which had been 32P-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (27Hatakeyama H. Miyamori I. Fujita T. Takeda Y. Takeda R. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signal intensities of hybridized bands were measured by a BAS 1000 BioImage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Hamamatsu, Japan). HMVEC or ECV304 cells were treated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 4 h, and further cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma) for various time periods. Total RNAs were isolated from the cultures with Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) according to the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and analyzed by the quantitative RT-PCR method described above. The amounts of total RNA templates and cycle numbers for amplification were chosen in quantitative ranges; 300 ng of templates and 35 cycles were chosen for amplifying human RAGE mRNA, and 300 ng and 20 cycles for β-actin mRNA. Subconfluent cultures of HMVEC or ECV304 cells were incubated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 24 h. After the incubation, cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped off in cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cells were lysed immediately by sonication in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Twelve μg of the cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5%), and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was treated with the anti-RAGE polyclonal antibodies, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized with an ECL detection system (Amarsham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (32Kaji M. Yonemura Y. Harada S. Liu X. Terada I. Yamamoto H. Cancer Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar). Signal intensities of the resultant bands were determined by densitometry using BIO-PROFIL 1-D (version 5.08) software (Vilber Lourmat Biotechnology, Marne La Vallée, France). The chimeric genes for transfection experiments were constructed by ligating the 5′-flanking regions of differing lengths of the human RAGE gene upstream of the luciferase gene in a pGL3-basic vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) (see Fig. 5 A). The genomic DNA fragments of the human RAGE gene were amplified by PCR using a cosmid named KS71 (33Sugaya K. Fukagawa T. Matsumoto K. Mita K. Takahashi E. Ando A. Inoko H. Ikemura T. Genomics. 1994; 23: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as a template, which was kindly provided by Professor Toshimichi Ikemura (National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan). The PCR primers employed in the amplification reactions are shown in Table I. Furthermore, we constructed two additional chimeric genes. The DNA fragments containing exons 1–11 plus introns 1–10 or the 3′-flanking region of the human RAGE gene were amplified by PCR using the cosmid KS71 and specific primers shown in TableI, and were ligated to downstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector that had carried the longest fragment of the 5′-flanking region (see Fig. 5 A). All the fragments obtained were sequence-verified.Table IPrimers used for the construction of RAGE promoter-luciferase fusion genesNames of the constructsNucleotide sequencesCorresponding nucleotide positions in the RAGE gene (33)Forward primers pGL-15′-GAACGCGT AGAGATGCCAAAAATGGGGA−1689 to −1669 pGL-25′-GAACGCGT CTTACCTCATACGCAGCTCA−1599 to −1579 pGL-35′-GAACGCGT TACCTCGGAGGGAGTTTCTG−1528 to −1508 pGL-45′-GAACGCGT GGGAATTATTGACTGGGCTT−1500 to −1480 pGL-55′-GAACGCGT ACTGTCCCATCCTCAGCCCT−751 to −731 pGL-65′-GAACGCGT TTGGAAGTGTGATGGGTGGG−629 to −609 pGL-75′-GAACGCGT GAGACCCTAGAGGGTACACT−239 to −219 pGL-85′-GAACGCGT CGACTGAAAGATGGGGGCTG−89 to −69Reverse primer pGL-1∼85′-GAAGATCT CAGGCTCCAACTGCTGTTCC+43 to +23Forward primers pGL-el-115′-GAGTCGAC TCCTCAGTCTGTGGGGTGAG+52 to +72 pGL-3′fl5′-GAGTCGAC CCCCACAATGATGATTAAAC+3253 to +3273Reverse primers pGL-el-115′-GAGTCGAC AGAGCAAGATGTGTCAGGTG+3272 to +3252 pGL-3′fl5′-GAGTCGAC AAGAGGTGGAACAAGAGAAG+6318 to +6298 Open table in a new tab Mutations were introduced into the RAGE promoter-luciferase chimeras using a GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The nucleotide sequences of the mutagenic oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers were 5′-ACTGTCAGAGTGGGGTTCCCCTCCCATTAAAG-3′ (nucleotides −683 to −652), 5′-GTGACTGTACCCAGAAACTGGTAGTACCCAGG-3′ (−202 to −171), 5′-CTGGTAGTACCCAGGAATGGGGTGATAATTAT-3′ (−185 to −154), and 5′-ACTGTACCCAGAAACTGGTAGTACCCAGGAATGGGGTGATAAT-3′ (−199 to −157) for yielding pGL-5 NF-κB2m, pGL-7 Im, pGL-7 IIm, or pGL-7 ImIIm, respectively (mutated sites are indicated by underlines) (see schematic representations in Fig. 6 A). pGL-5 NF-κB2m contained the region −751 to +43, but with the mutation in an NF-κB site (−671 to −663). pGL-7 Im and pGL-7 IIm contained the region −239 to +43, but with the mutations in one of two Sp-1 sites (−189 to −181 and −172 to −166), respectively. pGL-7 ImIIm had the mutations in both Sp-1 sites. All the mutated constructs were sequence-verified. ECV304 cells or HMVEC (2 × 105 cells) were plated into the wells of six-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) 1 day before transfection. For ECV304 cells, the DNA/cationic lipid mixture for transfection was composed of test plasmid (2 μg), pRL-SV40 vector (0.5 μg) (Promega) that served as an internal control to normalize luciferase activities, TransFastTM transfection reagent (7.5 μl) (Promega), and 1 ml of the experimental medium. Cells were exposed to the DNA/cationic lipid mixture for 2 h, then received 5 ml of the FBS-containing medium and were further incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. For transfection of HMVEC, test plasmid (2 μg) and pRL-CMV vector (1 μg) (Promega) were added to a tube containing 100 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Lipofectin reagent (6 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to another tube containing 100 μl of Opti-MEM I. The plasmid DNA and lipofectin reagent were then mixed together. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, DNA-liposome complex was diluted with 800 μl of Opti-MEM I. Cells were exposed to the mixture for 8 h, then received 2 ml of the FBS-containing medium and were further incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were treated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 8 h in the experimental medium. Luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL version 2.2.4, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Schreiber et al. (34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, ECV304 cells (2 × 106) were plated onto 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Becton Dickinson Labware) in the complete medium and left for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were further incubated in the experimental medium at 37 °C for 12 h and then treated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 4 h. After the treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off in PBS (10 ml), and pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm in a Beckman GH3.7 roter at 4 °C for 5 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and placed on ice for 15 min. After the addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, the suspension was vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a Hitachi T15S roter at 4 °C for 30 min. The resultant nuclear pellets were washed with buffer A and resuspended in 0.1 ml of a solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by constant agitation for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear lysates were centrifugated at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. The protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 71: 248-254Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides encompassing the NF-κB site (nucleotide numbers −671 to −663) or the two Sp-1 sites (−189 to −181 and −172 to −166) were prepared. Their sequences were 5′-AGAGTGGGGAACCCCTCCCA-3′ and 5′-AGAGTGGGGTTCCCCTCCCA-3′ (−677 to −658) as the wild and mutated NF-κB elements, respectively, and 5′-CCCAGAGGCTGGTAGTACCCAGGGGTGGGGTGA-3′ and 5′-CCCAGAAACTGGTAGTACCCAGGAATGGGGTGA-3′ (−193 to −161) as the wild and mutated Sp-1 elements, respectively (mutated sites are indicated by underlines). Twenty-five fmol of wild-type oligodeoxyribonucleotides, which had been 32P-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (27Hatakeyama H. Miyamori I. Fujita T. Takeda Y. Takeda R. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.2× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer at 10 V/cm for 2–3 h. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C overnight. For competition assay, nuclear extracts were first incubated with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligodeoxyribonucleotides at room temperature for 15 min, and then incubated with the labeled wild-type probe for 30 min under the same conditions as described above. For supershift assays, antibodies to NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, Sp-1, estrogen receptor (ER) α, or ERβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the nuclear extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. The antibody-treated nuclear extracts were subsequently incubated with the labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides for 30 min under the same conditions as described above. Paired t tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's range tests were used to test for significant differences between groups. All experiments were carried out at least three times. To examine the effects of TNF-α, E2, and AGE-BSA on the RAGE mRNA level in HMVEC, poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from cells that had been exposed to various concentrations of these agents for 4 h, and analyzed by the quantitative RT-PCR method. As shown in Fig.1 A, TNF-α, E2, and AGE-BSA increased the RAGE mRNA levels in dose-dependent manners. The extents of induction and the peak concentrations were about 3-fold at 100 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 nm E2, and 50 μg/ml AGE-BSA, respectively, when normalized by β-actin mRNA-derived signals used as an internal control. Next, we examined the time course of the RAGE mRNA induction. HMVEC were treated for various time periods with TNF-α, E2, and AGE-BSA at their most effective doses. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the mRNA levels began to increase at 2 h and reached a maximum at ∼8 h after the addition of either of the three agents. On the other hand, exposure of HMVEC to TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), IFN-γ (165 ng/ml), and non-glycated BSA (50 μg/ml) for 4 h did not affect the RAGE mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C). 4-OH tamoxifen (10 nm), an anti-estrogen, abolished the E2-induced RAGE mRNA induction (Fig.1 C). We next determined the RAGE mRNA levels in ECV304 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (25Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This cell line exhibited the same responsiveness to AGE-BSA with respect to VEGF induction (Fig.2 A) as did HMVEC (2Yamagishi S. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Katsuno K. Sato F. Mita I. Ooka H. Satozawa N. Kawakami T. Nomura M. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8723-8730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the most effective dosage of AGE-BSA being 50 μg/ml in both cultures. The extent of induction was about 4-fold. When exposed to TNF-α (100 ng/ml), E2 (10 nm), or AGE-BSA (50 μg/ml) for 4 h, the RAGE mRNA levels in the ECV304 cells were also increased about 2-fold compared with those in the control unexposed cells (Fig. 2 B). We next examined whether the increase in RAGE mRNA was actually followed by an increase in RAGE proteins in HMVEC and ECV304 cells. The cells were treated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 24 h, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-RAGE polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, one major immunoreactive band was marked at 46 kDa in either HMVEC (Fig.3 A) or ECV304 cells (Fig. 3 B), being consistent with our previous report (3Yamagishi S. Fujimori H. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Yamamoto H. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and its intensity was increased by the treatment with the three agents. The RAGE protein levels in HMVEC and ECV304 cells treated with TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA were about 2-fold higher than the basal levels. The results indicated that ECV304 cells retained the ability to respond to those agents as did primary cultured endothelial cells, and subsequently we mainly used this cell line to examine the mechanisms of RAGE gene induction. We next determined the RAGE mRNA stability in HMVEC and ECV304 cells exposed or not exposed to the three agents to determine which step of gene expression accounted for the increase in RAGE mRNA levels. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TNF-α, E2, or AGE-BSA for 4 h, then incubated with actinomycin D for various time periods, and underwent quantitative RT-PCR analyses. As shown in Fig.4 (A and B), the half-lives of RAGE mRNA in TNF-α-, E2-, and AGE-BSA-treated or untreated HMVEC and ECV304 cells were calculated from the RAGE and β-actin mRNA-derived signals to be between 2.1 and 2.8 h, and there was no statistically significant difference among them. The results suggested that the TNF-α-, E2-, and AGE-BSA-induced increase in RAGE mRNA was achieved at the transcriptional level. To confirm whether TNF-α, E2, and AGE-BSA did induce the RAGE gene transcription and, if so, to delimit the regions involved in such transcriptional activations, a series of chimeric 5′-deletion promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were prepared."

Exposure of cultured rat hippocampal neurons to the selective glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (300 μm, 5 min) or to the apoptosis-inducing protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (300 nm) induced a delayed neuron death. In both cases, neuron death was preceded by the mitochondrial release of the pro-apoptotic factor cytochrome c. Unlike staurosporine, the N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced release of cytochrome c did not lead to significant activation of caspase-3, the main caspase involved in the execution of neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, activation of the Ca2+-activated neutral protease calpain I was readily detectable after the exposure toN-methyl-d-aspartate. In a neuronal cell-free apoptosis system, calpain I prevented the ability of cytochromec to activate the caspase cascade by inhibiting the processing of procaspase-3 and -9 into their active subunits. In the hippocampal neuron cultures, the inhibition of calpain activity restored caspase-3-like protease activity after an exposure toN-methyl-d-aspartate. Our data demonstrate the existence of signal transduction pathways that prevent the entry of cells into a caspase-dependent cell death program after the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+-permeableN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors and the subsequent neuronal Ca2+ overloading have been shown to mediate glutamate-induced neuron death (1.Choi D.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mitochondria take up large amounts of Ca2+ during glutamate receptor overactivation (2.White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies provided evidence that this mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is required to trigger excitotoxic neuron death (3.Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4.Castilho R.F. Hansson O. Ward M.W. Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J.

Excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has been shown to deenergize mitochondria and to trigger the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (4.Castilho R.F. Hansson O. Ward M.W. Budd S.L.

Handran S.D. Rothman S.M. Lin T.-S. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6377-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After an intense or prolonged period of glutamate receptor overactivation, the disturbance of mitochondrial energetics is irreversible and induces excitotoxic necrosis (8.Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading, however, has also been shown to cause the release of the pro-apoptotic factor cytochromec (10.Andreyev A.Y. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 6: 825-832Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c is able to activate a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, by binding to the cytosolic protein apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (10.Andreyev A.Y. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 6: 825-832Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). The activation of the caspase cascade starts with caspase-9, the upstream caspase in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (13.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). This activates caspase-3, which is the major executioner caspase in neurons (14.Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S.

Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and is also responsible for the activation of caspase-2, -6, -7, and -8 (16.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The caspase cascade is essential for many biochemical and morphological changes occurring during apoptosis. However, sufficient ATP levels are required for the activation of the caspase cascade (17.Nicotera P. Leist M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that the ability of mitochondria to recover their energetics after a toxic glutamate receptor overactivation decides whether the neuron is going to die by apoptosis or necrosis (8.Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a variety of processes are activated during glutamate receptor overactivation that could also influence the mode of cell death chosen. An increased nitric oxide production has been shown to contribute to excitotoxic neuron death (18.Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide induces oxidative stress (18.Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar) but may also inhibit apoptotic processes by nitrosylation and inactivation of caspases (19.Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 20.Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The activation of the Ca2+-activated neutral cysteine protease calpain I also occurs early in excitotoxic neuron death (21.Siman R. Noszek J.C. Kegerise C. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Faddis B.T. Hasbani M.J. Goldberg M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 951-959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the caspases, calpain I cleaves a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, and transcription factors and could interfere with the proteolytic activity of the caspases (23.Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in excitotoxic neuron death. We show that calpains but not caspases are the predominantly activated proteases during excitotoxic neuron death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that calpains inhibit the ability of NMDA to initiate an apoptotic cell death program after the mitochondrial release of cytochromec. NMDA was purchased from Sigma. Caspase substrates and inhibitors were from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany), and staurosporine (STS) was from Alexis (Grünstetten, Germany). Dizocilpine and tetrodotoxin were purchased from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany), and calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) was from Calbiochem. Leupeptin and the other protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals came in analytical grade purity from Merck. Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from neonatal (P1) Fischer 344 rats as described (24.Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated hippocampal neurons were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 onto poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). For immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning experiments, neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips that were mounted onto 35-mm Petri dishes (Willco Wells B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or 8-chamber culture slides (Becton Dickinson, Meylan Cedex, France). Cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% NU-serum, 2% B-27 supplement (50× concentrate), 2 mml-glutamine, 20 mmd-glucose, 26.2 mm sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were performed on 14–16-day-old cultures. Animal care followed official governmental guide lines. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the induction of excitotoxic neuronal injury, cultures were washed in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) (144 mm NaCl, 10 mmHepes, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmd-glucose; 320 mosm; pH 7.4) and were then exposed for 5 min to Mg2+-free HBS supplemented with 300 μm NMDA, 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin, and 100 nm glycine (25.Prehn J.H.M. Bindokas V.P. Marcuccilli C.J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12599-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Control cultures were exposed to Mg2+-free HBS alone. After the exposure, cells were washed and returned to the original culture medium. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of the protein kinase inhibitor STS (300 nm) into the culture medium (24.Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respective controls received the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Cell death was determined at the indicated time points using a trypan blue exclusion assay (0.5% in HBS, 5 min). Uptake of trypan blue identifies membrane leakage, the end point of neuronal degeneration that also occurs after neuronal apoptosis in vitro (secondary necrosis). A total number of 400–500 neurons were counted in several randomized subfields of each culture. Cell counts were performed by two investigators without knowledge of the respective treatments, and the counts were meaned for further statistical analysis. Chromatin fragmentation was visualized with the DNA-binding fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33258. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and exposed to 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Nuclei were observed with a 40× oil immersion objective using an Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope equipped with an epifluorescence unit and the appropriate filter sets (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany). Since chromatin condensation is a reversible process, only fragmented nuclei were considered apoptotic. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei was quantified as described above. Rhodamine-123 (R-123) is a cationic, lipophilic probe that accumulates in the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix according to the Nernst equation potential (26.Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wie M.D. Wuskell J.P. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). An R-123 stock was prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Working stocks of 30 μm were made up fresh in distilled water. For the estimation of mitochondrial membrane potential after the NMDA exposure, cells were exposed to NMDA or Mg2+-free HBS (sham-exposed controls) for 5 min and returned to the original culture medium. After 2 h, cells were loaded with 30 nm R-123 for 15 min in culture medium, and the fluorescence was acquired with the dye present in the extracellular solution for the entire course of data collection. R-123 fluorescence was quantified using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope attached to a confocal laser scanning unit equipped with a 488-nm argon laser and a 20× fluorescence objective (Fluoview; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). The regions of interest were monitored and focused by eye and then scanned once. Data were analyzed using Metmorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Fluorescence data are given as the ratio between the average pixel intensity of the mitochondria-rich regions and the nucleus to compensate for background differences and unequal R-123 loading (27.Wadia J.S.

After the respective treatments, the culture medium was aspirated, cells washed three times with HBS, and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% CHAPS. Fifty μl of this extract was added to 150 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The reaction buffer was supplemented with 10 μmacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC), a fluorogenic substrate preferentially cleaved by caspase-3, -7, and -8 but also caspase-1, -6, -9, and -10 (28.Garcia-Calvo M.

Fluorogenic substrates with higher specificity for caspase-2 (benzyloxylcarbonyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin, Z-VDVAD-AFC) or caspase-6 (benzyloxylcarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin, Z-IETD-AFC) were also used. Production of fluorescent AMC or AFC was monitored over 60 min using a fluorescent plate reader (HTS 7000, Perkin-Elmer) (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Fluorescence of blanks containing no cellular extracts were subtracted from the values. Protein content was determined using the Pierce Coomassie Plus Protein Assay reagent (KMF, Cologne, Germany), and the caspase activity is expressed as change in fluorescent units per h per μg of protein. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Tris-buffered saline containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, glycerin, and the above protease inhibitors. Protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA Micro Protein Assay kit, and samples were supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. An equal amount of protein (10–20 μg) was separated with 5–15% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Protean BA 85; Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin, non-fat dry milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing the primary antibody. Antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (H-277; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) raised against full-length human caspase-3 diluted 1:1,000, a rabbit polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody (MF397) raised against p17/p12 x-ray crystallographic grade recombinant caspase-3 diluted 1:1,000 (29.Black S.C.

Afterward, membranes were washed and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5,000–1:20,000; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Antibody-conjugated peroxidase activity was visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). After exposure to NMDA or STS, hippocampal cultures were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized. Unspecific binding was blocked, and neuron cultures were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. The following primary antibodies were used: a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (6H2.B4; PharMingen, Becton Dickinson) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for postautolytic calpain I (large subunit) diluted 1:200 (31.Saido T.C.

After washing, biotin-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added for 1 h, followed by a streptavidin-Oregon Green or -Texas Red conjugate (1 μg/ml, 20 min; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). As a negative control, cultures were incubated with the secondary antibody only. Fluorescence was observed using the Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Digital images of equal exposure were acquired with a digital camera (SPOT-2; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) using Metamorph software. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as described (33.Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay reagent. For activation of apoptosis, 50 μg of protein extract was diluted in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cytochrome c (500 nm; purified from horse heart, Sigma), dATP (1 mm; Sigma), calpain I (0.8 milliunits/μl; purified from porcine erythrocytes; Calbiochem), calpain inhibitor I (10 μm) or leupeptin (10 μm) were added as indicated. Controls received the vehicle. Caspase activity was determined fluorimetrically over 90 min using the fluorigenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (10 μm). Data are given as means ± S.E. For statistical comparison, t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test were employed. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To investigate the involvement of apoptotic processes in excitotoxic neuron death, we established a model in which a transient, 5-min exposure to the selective glutamate receptor agonist NMDA (300 μm) induced a delayed cell death in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (Fig.1 a). The time course of neuronal degeneration was comparable to that during a continuous exposure to the apoptosis-inducing agent STS (300 nm). In both cases, the first significant increase in percentage of trypan blue-positive cells was 4 h after onset of the stimulus. After 24 h, the degree of neuronal degeneration reached 41.5 ± 2.2% in cultures exposed for 5 min to NMDA (n = 16 cultures in four separate experiments) and 49.3 ± 7.5% in cultures exposed to STS (n = eight cultures in two separate experiments). The percentages showed no significant differences at all time points investigated. We have previously demonstrated that mitochondria remained polarized during STS-induced apoptosis of cultured rat hippocampal neurons (24.Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate receptor overactivation has been suggested to induce apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the recovery of mitochondrial function (8.Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). To investigate whether mitochondrial membrane potential had recovered after the exposure to NMDA, the uptake of the voltage-sensitive probe R-123 was determined in individual hippocampal neurons by confocal laser scanning microscopy 2 h after termination of the NMDA exposure. Excitotoxic neuron death was preceded by a recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential, as uptake of R-123 was indistinguishable from that of sham-exposed control cultures (Fig.1 b). The key trigger for the mitochondrial activation of apoptosis is the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intercristal space into the cytosol (11.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons after the exposure to NMDA and STS by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody specific for native cytochrome c (Fig. 1,c–f). In control cultures, cytochrome cimmunoreactivity was distributed in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern excluding the nucleus (Fig. 1 d). Two h after cells were exposed to NMDA, cytochrome c immunoreactivity was largely intact. After 8 h, mitochondrial cytochrome cimmunofluorescence decreased significantly (Fig. 1 e). Hippocampal neurons exposed to 300 nm STS also exhibited a decrease in their cytochrome c immunofluorescence (Fig.1 f). Despite the release of cytochrome c, recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential, and delayed neuronal degeneration, cell death induced by the NMDA exposure occurred without a significant activation of the caspase cascade (Fig.2). We determined the cleavage of fluorigenic caspase substrates in cytosolic extracts prepared from NMDA-exposed hippocampal neuron cultures (Fig. 2 a). Cellular extracts from sham-exposed control cultures showed a negligible cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AMC, a substrate for caspase-3, -7 and -8, as well as caspase-1, -6, -9, and -10 (28.Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The exposure to STS led to a significant increase in caspase-3-like protease activity after 6 h of treatment. In contrast, Ac-DEVD-AMC cleavage of NMDA-exposed neuron cultures was not significantly different from base-line activity of sham-exposed controls at all time points investigated. Evidence against a prominent activation of caspase-3 after glutamate receptor overactivation was also obtained from Western blot experiments. During apoptosis, caspase-3 is proteolytically activated by cleavage of its 32-kDa precursor, procaspase-3, into active subunits. We observed a pronounced decrease in the 32-kDa precursor protein during STS treatment (Fig. 2 a, inset). In contrast, no significant decrease in the 32-kDa proenzyme was detected after the NMDA exposure. Moreover, we could not detect a significant increase in the p17 caspase-3 subunit above the level seen in sham-exposed controls using an antibody raised against active caspase-3 (see below, Fig.5 b). NMDA exposure also did not lead to significant cleavage of Z-VDVAD-AFC, a substrate cleaved by caspase-2 and -3, or Z-IETD-AFC, a substrate cleaved by caspase-6 and -8. In contrast, cleavage of both substrates was detectable after the exposure to STS (data not shown).Figure 5Treatment with calpain inhibitor I restores caspase activity after glutamate receptor overactivation. a, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to 300 μm NMDA or Mg2+-free HBS (Con) for 5 min. Calpain inhibitor I (CI-1) (1 μm) or vehicle were added to the cultures 1 h prior to the exposure and remained in the cultures after the exposure. Caspase-3-like activity was measured in cytosolic extracts prepared 8 h after the exposure. Data are means ± S.E. from n = 6 cultures. Difference from controls: * p < 0.05.

Although NMDA-induced cell death was accompanied by nuclear condensation, chromatin fragmentation was not increased above the level seen in sham-exposed control cultures (Fig. 2 b).

Finally, protein B23 possesses intrinsic ribonuclease activity that has been implicated in the processing of preribosomal RNA in the internal transcribed spacer region 2 region (12Herrera J.E.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggested a role in nuclear import. The latter activity might be explained by its ability to act as a molecular chaperone (19Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In normal cells, this activity may aid in the transport of ribosomal or other nucleolar proteins from their site of synthesis into the nucleus or nucleolus. Alternatively, protein B23 could serve as a chaperone in preventing aggregation of proteins in the very crowded environment of the nucleolus during ribosome assembly. Under native conditions protein B23 probably exists as a hexamer and or larger oligomer (4Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Hügle-Dörr B. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Herrera J.E. Correia J.J. Jones A.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because many chaperones are oligomers (21Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar,22Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 553-575Google Scholar), the chaperone activity of protein B23 could be related to its oligomerization properties. Although the activities of protein B23 are commonly found in many proteins, it lacks similarities to any sequence motifs normally correlated with these activities. Specific functions are often contained in discrete structural regions or domains of multifunctional proteins. In such cases, functional studies can be facilitated by characterization of the activities residing in individual domains. In protein B23 there are distinctive sequence motifs along the polypeptide chain, which suggest the presence of functional domains,i.e. the N-terminal region has relatively high density of hydrophobic residues, the central region contains two highly acidic segments, and the C-terminal third of the molecule carries a net positive charge. Thus, it might be possible to characterize segments of the molecule responsible for particular activities and thereby identify novel structural-functional motifs. In this study we generated a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of protein B23 to facilitate the dissection of the molecule into possible functional domains. It was found that different activities reside in mainly independent but slightly overlapping segments of the polypeptide chain. To create fusion constructs containing the entire B23 cDNA or fragments encoding different domains of protein B23, appropriate primers were synthesized (Cybersyn) for use in polymerase chain reaction amplification using Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and rat B23 cDNA as template. The following oligonucleotides were used for the synthesis of each construct: B1N (5′-ATGGAAGACTCGATGGACATG-3′) and B1C (5′-TTAAAGAGACTTCCTCCACTG-3′) for full-length B23, B2N (5′-GATGAAAATGAGCACCAG-3′) and B1C for ΔN35, B3N (5′-GGCTTCGAAATTACACCA-3′) and B1C for ΔN90, B4N (5′-GAGGAAGATGCAGAGTCAG-3′) and B1C for ΔN119, B5N (5′-GGAAAGAGATCTGCTCCC-3′) and B1C for ΔN139, B6N (5′-GAAGAAAAGGTTCCAGTGAAG-3′) and B1C for ΔN185, B7N (5′-ACACCAAGGTCAAAGGGT-3′) and B1C for ΔN216, B1N and B2C (5′-ACCACCTTTTTCTATACTTGC-3′) for ΔC35, B1N and B3C (5′-TTCATCAAGTTTTACTTTTTTCTG-3′) for ΔC132, B1N and B4C (5′-ATCTTCCTCATCTTCATCTTC-3′) for ΔC161, and B1N and B5C (5′-CAAGACCACAGGTGGTGTAAT-3′) for ΔC192. ΔN and ΔC indicate N- and C-terminal mutants, and the numbers specify the number of amino acids deleted from the respective end. Polymerase chain reaction products were excised from the gel and ligated into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced and subsequently subcloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen), with the N-terminal His tag. The fragments were excised at the XhoI andHindIII sites and subcloned into the SalI andHindIII sites of the pQE-30 vector. For the N-terminal GST-tagged1 deletion constructs (GST-ΔN255, GST-ΔN240), the fragments were excised byEcoRI restriction endonuclease and ligated into theEcoRI site of pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector. Nucleotide sequences were verified so that the correct reading frame was preserved for each clone. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into M15 bacterial cells and grown in 1-liter volumes of LB medium. The cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. A few of the mutants including full-length B23, ΔN35, ΔN90, ΔN139, and ΔC35 grew poorly in LB medium and were grown in terrific broth instead. Cells were collected by centrifugation and kept at −20 °C overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer B (8m urea, 0.01 m Tris, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, pH 8.0) and mixed gently on a rocker for 45 min. The homogenate was then spun at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. To the supernatant, 1 ml of pre-equlilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin was added and mixed gently for 2 h. After three washes with buffer C (8m urea, 0.01 m Tris, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, pH 6.3) tagged peptide was eluted with elution buffer (buffer C + 250 mm imidazole). All of the eluates were tested for protein purity using SDS-PAGE and were dialyzed against a modified H1 buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) and concentrated to 5–10 mg/ml of protein using Amicon centriprep concentrators with the desired cut-off range. Protein concentrations were calculated using the Bio-Rad protein assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21. The protocol used for protein expression and purification is as described in Smith and Johnson (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (GST alone, GST-ΔN255, GST-ΔN240) were dialyzed against H1 buffer (described above) and were tested for purity using SDS-PAGE. Plasmid pGEM-4Z was labeled using random priming (Megaprime DNA labeling kit) and 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding to DNA by protein B23 and its mutants was measured using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described previously (25Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture, which included labeled DNA and mutant proteins (0–60 μm), was incubated in a TBE buffer (90 mmTris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by filtration through a prewetted nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Scheull; 0.45 μm), followed by washes with 1 ml of TBE buffer. The amount of radioactivity retained on the filter was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The substrate used for ribonuclease digestions was obtained by in vitrotranscription of the rDNA plasmid (pXKDF15) as described previously (13Savkur R.S. Olson M.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The plasmid contained 1.3 kilobases of the 5′ external transcribed spacer region sequence with positions +638 to +1880 from the transcription start site. Plasmid pXKDF15 was linearized withXhoI and in vitro transcription was performed using a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (26Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Transcripts were uniformly labeled with 32P by the addition of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products). Synthesized transcripts were treated with DNase I and proteinase K, followed by a phenol extraction. To the supernatant, sodium acetate (pH 5.5) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the mixture was ethanol precipitated at −70 °C. Transcripts were washed with 70% EtOH, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The perchloric acid precipitation assay used was a modification of the method used by Eichler and Eales (27Eichler D.C. Eales S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14384-14389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing radiolabeled RNA (40 μg/ml) and protein (50 μm concentration) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and RNasin at a final concentration of 0.5 unit/μl were digested at 37 °C for 15 min. The assays were initiated by addition of proteins and terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 2.5 mg/ml yeast RNA, 7 μl of uranyl acetate, and 80 μl of 10% perchloric acid. Reactions were placed on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 min. 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant were taken, and the amount of nonprecipitable nucleotides was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The control in this assay was a catfish T cell receptor β protein cloned into pQE30 vector that was processed in a manner identical to protein B23 and its mutants to account for endogenous ribonuclease activity carried through the purification process. The chaperone activity of protein B23 and its mutants was measured using bovine liver rhodanese (Sigma) as a substrate. The anti-aggregation effect was measured using a turbidity assay (28Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (19Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained ice-cold rhodanese solution at a concentration of 300 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with or without added protein B23 or mutants thereof. Aggregation was monitored by spectrophotometrically recording the absorbance at 360 nm at 1 min intervals after addition of the sample to the cuvette held at 65 °C. The relative activity was calculated from the ratio of the absorbance of the reaction mixture containing the mutant protein with the absorbance of the sample containing protein B23.1 (100%) at the 15-min time point with a substrate to protein molar ratio of 1:0.5. Under the latter conditions there was a linear relationship between reduction in turbidity and protein concentration. Purified proteins (30 μl of a 100 μm concentration protein solution in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) were loaded onto a Superose 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The column was run using a Varian high performance liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at room temperature, and the elution was monitored at an absorbance of 280 nm. Molecular weight standards were purchased from Sigma, and the column was calibrated using the following protein markers: blue dextran (2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochromec (9.6 kDa). Protein B23.1 has several distinctive segments in its primary structure. These include a nonpolar N-terminal domain, two highly acidic regions in the central portion, and a C-terminal region that is basic (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether these segments correlate with functional domains of the protein, we generated a series of N- and C-terminal His- and GST-tagged deletion mutants (Fig. 1 A). The purified mutant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All of these fusion proteins were efficiently expressed at their predicted sizes, without any significant degradation (Fig. 1, B and C). Previous studies showed that protein B23 binds both DNA and RNA and that the C-terminal end is essential for this activity (6Wang D. Baumann A. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30994-30998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which parts of the C-terminal sequence are required for nucleic acid binding, we initially assayed the series of His-tagged N-terminal deletion mutants. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed with double-stranded DNA (plasmid pGEM) uniformly labeled with32P. The N-terminal deletion mutants ΔN35, ΔN185, and ΔN216 had DNA binding curves very similar to that of the full-length B23 (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, mutant proteins ΔN90, ΔN119, and ΔN139 also had normal DNA binding curves (data not shown). These results clearly indicated that the C-terminal 76 amino acids (ΔN216) are sufficient for nucleic acid binding activity. The C-terminal deletion mutants ΔC35, ΔC132, ΔC161, and ΔC192 were also inactive in DNA binding (Fig.2 A), further supporting the importance of the C-terminal end for this activity. To further dissect the nucleic acid-binding domain, more deletion constructs were tested. The GST fusion tag was used to facilitate expression of the small mutant proteins (GST-ΔN255, GST-ΔN240). The ΔN255 mutant contains the 37 amino acids that are unique to isoform B23.1 and essential for DNA binding activity as shown with ΔC35 (see above). However, ΔN255 did not bind DNA, indicating that this segment alone is not sufficient for activity (Fig. 2 B). The mutant ΔN240, which lacks the basic amino acid cluster at the N-terminal end of the 76-residue segment (Fig. 1 A), is also devoid of DNA binding activity. Thus, both ends of the 76-residue C-terminal domain are critical for nucleic acid binding. To determine the location of the B23 endoribonuclease activity in the polypeptide chain, the 5′ external transcribed spacer region region of preribosomal RNA was used as a nonspecific RNA substrate (13Savkur R.S. Olson M.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ribonuclease activity of the individual deletion mutants was assessed using the perchloric acid precipitation assay with 32P-labeled RNA. Preliminary studies were performed with varying protein and constant substrate concentrations; this provided information on the linear range of protein and substrate concentrations that could be used for initial rate assays. A control protein not known to have any ribonuclease activity, expressed and purified under conditions identical to those used for the B23 mutants, was used to assess the background ribonuclease level of bacterially produced protein. Fig. 3 shows that a high level of ribonuclease activity is maintained even after deletion of the first 139 amino acids from the N-terminal end of the protein. Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal 139 amino acids (ΔN139) including the first acidic domain enhances the ribonuclease activity significantly. Conversely, deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids (ΔC35) decreases the ribonuclease activity of the protein almost 2 fold, whereas deletion of 132 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the protein (ΔC132) reduces the activity by about 3–4-fold. Mutant proteins with substantial deletions in either the N- or C-terminal ends (ΔN185, ΔN216, ΔC161, and ΔC192) show little or no activity. These results suggest that the central portion of protein B23 and the C-terminal end play crucial roles in maintaining the ribonuclease activity. Protein B23 has been shown to have molecular chaperone activity toward substrates typically used in anti-aggregation assays (19Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Light scattering studies performed with rhodanese at a concentration of 300 μm showed that when the temperature was raised from 4 to 65 °C, the protein aggregated and achieved maximum turbidity in 30 min (Fig. 4 A). However, the aggregation was almost completely suppressed by adding B23 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The aggregation as measured by turbidity decreased in a linear manner as concentrations of added protein B23 were increased (data not shown). To determine the segments of the polypeptide chain that contribute to the molecular chaperone activity, aggregation assays were performed with the mutants using a substrate to protein molar ratio of 1:0.5 to account for both positive and negative effects. As portions of the N-terminal region of B23 were deleted, there were moderate reductions in chaperone activity, i.e. the anti-aggregation effect of ΔN35 and ΔN90 relative to the full-length protein was reduced to 84 and 66%, respectively (Fig.4 B). However, deletion of an additional 30 amino acids (ΔN119) reduced the activity to approximately 10% of the control. The remaining N-terminal deletion mutant proteins (ΔN139, ΔN185, and ΔN216) had no anti-aggregation activity (Fig. 4 B). Upon analysis of the C-terminal mutant proteins, ΔC35 showed 100% activity, indicating that the C-terminal 35 amino acids did not contribute to the chaperone activity. However, deletion of larger portions of the C-terminal end decreased the anti-aggregation effect, with mutant proteins ΔC132, ΔC161, and ΔC192 having 80, 57, and 30% of the control activity, respectively. Similar studies were performed using liver alcohol dehydrogenase and citrate synthase as substrates with results generally similar to those obtained with rhodanese (data not shown). It has been suggested that molecular chaperones suppress aggregation by making appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces available to the denaturing protein substrates (29Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7335-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of protein B23 is relatively rich in nonpolar amino acids. The substantially decreased anti-aggregation effect seen after removal of the N-terminal region (ΔN119) suggests that the chaperone activity is dependent on this nonpolar region. However, deletion of the acidic regions also results in loss of activity, indicating that the N-terminal region is not sufficient for maintaining full chaperone activity. In other words, both of these segments of the protein seem to be important for the chaperone activity. Several laboratories have previously observed that protein B23 is capable of oligomerization and probably exists as a hexamer or larger oligomer in the cell (20Herrera J.E. Correia J.J. Jones A.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Yung B.Y.M. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 1997; 8: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography was used to assess the oligomeric states of the mutant proteins to determine the possible relationship of this property with chaperone activity. Examples of gel filtration elution profiles using full-length B23, ΔN139, and ΔN90 are shown in Fig. 5 A. All of these proteins elute primarily as single peaks; protein B23 has an apparent molecular mass of 350 kDa, which approximates a decameric complex. Similarly, ΔN139 has an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa compared to a theoretical monomer molecular mass of 20,130 Da, suggesting that this mutant protein mainly exists as a monomer. Conversely, protein ΔN90 forms a very large complex that elutes near the void volume. Although it was not possible to estimate the molecular mass of this complex, it is clearly larger than 700 kDa. Other mutant proteins that aggregate into larger complexes are ΔN35, ΔC132, and ΔC161. Table I provides estimates of molecular weights and oligomerization states of the constructs based on the data presented in Fig. 5 B. The data indicate that the N-terminal deletion mutants ΔN35 and ΔN90 form very large oligomers, whereas ΔN119 elutes as a trimer and the remaining N-terminal mutants ΔN139, ΔN185, and ΔN216 elute primarily as monomers. The C-terminal mutants ΔC35, ΔC132, and ΔC161 elute as oligomers, whereas ΔC192 is a mixture of large oligomeric complexes and monomers. These studies indicate that the N-terminal third of the molecule is essential for oligomerization.Table IMolecular mass estimation of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants by analytical gel filtration chromatographyProteinV e/V oEstimated molecular weightMonomer molecular weightApproximate number of subunitsB23.11.9285354,65635,42010ΔN351.6429>700,0001-aBecause these samples eluted out of the linear range of the standards, no effort was made to determine their molecular weights.32,670>21ΔN901.1071>700,0001-aBecause these samples eluted out of the linear range of the standards, no effort was made to determine their molecular weights.25,520>27ΔN1192.2563,71622,3302–3ΔN1392.428624,55120,1301ΔN1852.516,76815,0701ΔN2162.571411,75111,6601ΔC351.9285354,65632,67011ΔC1321.7857>700,0001-aBecause these samples eluted out of the linear range of the standards, no effort was made to determine their molecular weights.20,900>34ΔC1611.8214628,30917,71035ΔC1921.0357>700,0001-aBecause these samples eluted out of the linear range of the standards, no effort was made to determine their molecular weights.14,300>492.571416,7681The molecular size of the mutants was estimated from a plot ofV e/V o versus molecular weight constructed from standard proteins of known molecular weight (Fig. 5).1-a Because these samples eluted out of the linear range of the standards, no effort was made to determine their molecular weights. Open table in a new tab The molecular size of the mutants was estimated from a plot ofV e/V o versus molecular weight constructed from standard proteins of known molecular weight (Fig. 5). Analysis of these data suggests a link between oligomerization state and chaperone activity. The effect is pronounced with the N-terminal mutants ΔN119, ΔN139, ΔN185, and ΔN216 that clearly exist as monomers and do not possess any chaperone activity. However, ΔN35 and ΔN90 are oligomers and show about 60–80% retention of chaperone activity. The C-terminal mutants exist mainly as oligomers and show varying degrees of activity. These studies suggest that the chaperone activity requires the ability to oligomerize for maximal activity. The N-terminal region seems to play a dual role in the chaperone activity and oligomerization of protein B23. The current studies show that the molecular chaperone, ribonuclease, and nucleic acid binding activities of protein B23 reside in nearly independent but partially overlapping segments of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 6). Two adjacent segments in the polypeptide chain are important for the molecular chaperone activity. The first of these is the nonpolar region in the N-terminal end; deletion of this region results in nearly complete abolition of chaperone activity, suggesting that the nonpolar residues play a crucial role in the chaperone activity. The second important segment is the acidic region in the center of the molecule. Removal of this part of the molecule also results in proteins with greatly reduced chaperone activities. Thus, both charge-charge and hydrophobic interactions seem to be essential for the chaperone activity of protein B23. The same combination of interactions is important for the activity of members of the small heat shock class of chaperones, e.g.αB-crystallin (29Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones are divided into several groups on the basis of similarity of structural characteristics and/or similarity of functions. Although there is little or no sequence homology between B23 and the small heat shock proteins, there are other interesting similarities (22Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 553-575Google Scholar). The monomeric sizes of these proteins are 15–40 kDa, but they exist as large oligomeric complexes of up to 50 subunits within cells, with molecular masses ranging from 280 kDa to 2 MDa. Their secondary structures are predominantly β-sheet (40–50%) with some α-helix (10–20%). These proteins have sequence homology with each other in the C-terminal halves (including nonpolar residues), and also contain conserved, flexible, and solvent-exposed C-terminal extensions. Protein B23 shares several features in common with the small heat shock proteins/αB-crystallins including (a) the dependence on both nonpolar and charged regions for activity, (b) secondary structures composed mostly of β-sheets and β-turns (34Umekawa H. Chang J.H. Correia J.J. Wang D. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 635-645PubMed Google Scholar), and (c) a tendency to oligomerize (20Herrera J.E. Correia J.J. Jones A.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There is mounting evidence for a relationship between oligomerization state and chaperone activity (35Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Yung B.Y.M. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Zirwes R.F. Kouzmenko A.P. Peters J.M. Franke W. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this is the first study to correlate its oligomerization with molecular chaperone activity. Clearly, no chaperone activity was retained in mutant proteins that were monomeric; however, it cannot be ruled out that these mutants simply lacked a substrate-binding site because this seems to reside in the N-terminal third of the molecule. The mutagenesis studies provided clues about the general sequence requirements within the 76-residue nucleic acid-binding segment. Deletion of either end of this segment results in complete loss of nucleic acid binding activity. The C-terminal 37-residue segment, which is required but is not sufficient for activity, is relatively rich in aromatic amino acids. In the C-terminal end of this sequence there are five aromatic residues:FINYVKNCFRMTDQEAIQDLWQWRKSL. The placement of the aromatic residues, especially the two tryptophans is highly conserved in analogous proteins including starfish nucleolar protein ANO39 (37Nakajima H. Matoba K. Matsumoto Y.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and B23 from chickens (39Maridor G. Nigg E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and humans (3Chan W.Y. Liu Q.R. Borjigin J. Busch H. Rennert O, M. Tease L.A. Chan P.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The requirement for the two tryptophans is reinforced by experiments in which they were replaced by leucines; the resulting mutant protein did not bind DNA. 2A. Baumann and M. O. J. Olson, unpublished observations. The spacing of the basic residues in the N-terminal end of the 76-residue segment is also highly conserved; this portion is also necessary but not sufficient for activity. Thus, the aromatic and basic side chains at the two ends of the nucleic acid-binding domain seem to act in combination to serve this function. The N-terminal end of this segment also contains the two putative cdc2 phosphorylation sites (40Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which could regulate nucleic acid binding during various stages of the cell cycle. Finally, analysis of the two isoforms of protein B23 for ribonuclease activity reveals that although these mutants differ only in their C-terminal end, the shorter form shows a significant decrease in activity, suggesting that the C-terminal 35 amino acids are important for substrate binding. This is not surprising because this region is essential for nucleic acid binding activity. Because the shorter isoform possesses a relatively high level of activity, it follows that the catalytic site is in another part of the molecule. Interestingly, deletion of the first acidic domain causes a substantial increase in ribonuclease activity; this effect may be due to exposure of the region between the two acidic segments. It is possible that this increase in activity upon deletion of the acidic domain is due to a decrease in electrostatic repulsion, making RNA-protein interactions more favorable. Alternatively, the shift to the monomeric state resulting in decreased steric hindrance and more rapid diffusion could cause this enhancement. Because deletion of the short region between the acidic segments results in the complete loss of ribonuclease activity, it seems likely that it contains the catalytic site. Curiously, deletion of the N-terminal end of the molecule, which contains all of the histidine residues, does not abolish activity. Although histidine residues are part of the catalytic sites in many ribonucleases (41Gerlt J.A. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1-34Google Scholar), this is clearly not the case in the B23 ribonuclease. Determining the catalytic mechanism of the B23 ribonuclease may be facilitated by a crystallographic structure of the protein along with its bound substrate. What is the advantage to the organism of having a protein with multiple activities that are seemingly unrelated in the same polypeptide chain? The C-terminal nucleic acid-binding domain of B23 seems to be involved with recognition at various levels. First, this region has been shown to be essential for nucleolar localization in the Xenopusversion of the protein (42Peculis B.A. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and in a similar protein from sea urchin (43Warner A.K. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1999; 44: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because of its association with preribosomal particles in the nucleolus, the most likely mode of recognition is through RNA binding. Because other parts of the B23 molecule are also important for nucleolar targeting (33Zirwes R.F. Kouzmenko A.P. Peters J.M. Franke W. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this may be a cooperative process involving interactions with other proteins. The recognition process could target proteins bound to protein B23 to specific sites during the ribosome assembly process. The C-terminal domain could also be important in substrate recognition for the ribonuclease activity of the protein. Preferential cleavage of a narrow region of the pre-rRNA transcript by the B23 ribonuclease (13Savkur R.S. Olson M.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) could possibly utilize the C-terminal end of B23 for recognition. The catalytic region of the ribonuclease seems to reside in the center of the molecule and overlaps with the chaperone-containing segment. It is conceivable that the binding of other proteins, e.g.ribosomal proteins, to the chaperone region of B23 could alter the catalytic site and regulate the ribonuclease activity to provide temporal regulation of steps in ribosome biogenesis. Thus, seemingly independent activities could be related to each other through targeting and regulatory processes. Confirmation of this hypothesis will require development of more satisfactory systems for studying ribosome biogenesis. We gratefully acknowledge Siddhartha De and Drs. Aurita Antao and Donald Sittman for helpful discussions regarding the project. We also thank Mike Wallace for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2090025458,"Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is an essential dietary nutrient for humans and animals. The mechanisms involved in cellular regulation as well as in the preferential cellular and tissue accumulation of alpha-tocopherol are not yet well established. We previously reported (Stocker, A., Zimmer, S., Spycher, S. E., and Azzi, A. (1999) IUBMB Life 48, 49-55) the identification of a novel 46-kDa tocopherol-associated protein (TAP) in the cytosol of bovine liver. Here, we describe the identification, the molecular cloning into Escherichia coli, and the in vitro expression of the human homologue of bovine TAP, hTAP. This protein appears to belong to a family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins, which have the CRAL (cis-retinal binding motif) sequence in common. By using a biotinylated alpha-tocopherol derivative and the IASys resonant mirror biosensor, the purified recombinant protein was shown to bind tocopherol at a specific binding site with K(d) 4.6 x 10(-7) m. Northern analyses showed that hTAP mRNA has a size of approximately 2800 base pairs and is ubiquitously expressed. The highest amounts of hTAP message are found in liver, brain, and prostate. In conclusion, hTAP has sequence homology to proteins containing the CRAL_TRIO structural motif. TAP binds to alpha-tocopherol and biotinylated tocopherol, suggesting the existence of a hydrophobic pocket, possibly analogous to that of SEC14."
https://openalex.org/W2121042865,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I signals are mediated via phosphorylation of a family of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which may serve both complementary and overlapping functions in the cell. To study the metabolic effects of these proteins in more detail, we established brown adipocyte cell lines from wild type and various IRS knockout (KO) animals and characterized insulin action in these cells in vitro. Preadipocytes derived from both wild type and IRS-2 KO mice could be fully differentiated into mature brown adipocytes. In differentiated IRS-2 KO adipocytes, insulin-induced glucose uptake was decreased by 50% compared with their wild type counterparts. This was the result of a decrease in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane. This decrease in insulin-induced glucose uptake could be partially reconstituted in these cells by retrovirus-mediated re-expression of IRS-2, but not overexpression of IRS-1. Insulin signaling studies revealed a total loss of IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity and a reduction in phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase by 30% (p < 0.05) in the KO cells. The phosphorylation and activity of Akt, a major downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, as well as Akt-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and p70S6 kinase were not affected by the lack of IRS-2; however, there was a decrease in insulin stimulation of Akt associated with the plasma membrane. These results provide evidence for a critical role of IRS-2 as a mediator of insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose uptake in adipocytes. This occurs without effects in differentiation, total activation of Akt and its downstream effectors, but may be caused by alterations in compartmentalization of these downstream signals.

An impairment of the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in these tissues contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (1Hunter S.J.

Over the past 2 decades, considerable progress has been made defining the upstream signaling mechanisms regulating Glut4 translocation. Activation of the insulin receptor results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several IRS1 proteins, the most widely distributed of which are IRS-1 and IRS-2 (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr.

On the other hand, disruption of IRS-2 in mice leads to a more profound insulin resistance in muscle and liver, a significantly reduced β-cell mass, and early development of type 2 diabetes (20Withers D.J.

However, a physiological role of IRS-2 in insulin-induced glucose transport has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we have investigated the role of IRS-2 in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose uptake by establishing immortalized brown adipocytes from IRS-2 KO mice and their wild type counterparts. We find that insulin-induced Glut4 translocation and glucose transport are decreased significantly in the IRS-2-deficient cells despite a normal level of cell differentiation. Signaling studies suggest that this may be the result of a decrease in the IRS-2-associated pool of PI 3-kinase and membrane translocation of Akt. Thus, IRS-2 plays a unique role in insulin-induced Glut4 translocation and glucose transport in adipocytes.

Preadipose cells were immortalized by infection with the retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40T antigen (kindly provided by Dr. J. DeCaprio, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) and selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). For differentiation, preadipocytes were grown in culture medium supplemented with 20 nm insulin and 1 nm T3 (differentiation medium). After reaching confluence, cells were cultured for 48 h in differentiation medium further supplemented with 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 μm dexamethasone, and 0.125 mm indomethacin. After 4 more days in differentiation medium, cells exhibited a fully differentiated phenotype with massive accumulation of multilocular fat droplets.

IRS-2-deficient cells were infected at 60% confluence with Polybrene (4 μg/ml)-supplemented virus overnight. Selection with 250 μg/ml of the bleomycin analogue Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was started 48 h after infection. Dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then stained with a filtered Oil Red O solution (0.5 g of Oil Red O in 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol) for 2 h at room temperature, washed twice with water, and visualized. After a starvation period of 16–18 h, differentiated brown adipocytes were treated with 100 nm insulin for 20 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in HES buffer (10 mm Hepes, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) using 26 strokes of a 1-ml Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenized cells were then subjected to subcellular fractionation to isolate plasma membrane (PM), cytosolic, high density microsomal (HDM), and low density microsomal (LDM) fraction as described previously (25Brooks C.C.

Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal CA-630, 2 mmvanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein amount in the supernatants was determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of protein (100 μg and 500 μg, respectively) were either solubilized directly in Laemmli sample buffer or immunoprecipitated for at least 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes in lysis buffer, immunoprecipitates were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were boiled for 2 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.2) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h. Specifically bound primary antibodies were detected with either peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence or 125I-protein A and autoradiography. Cells lysates were obtained as described above. Supernatants containing 500 μg of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, bound complexes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Igepal CA-630, twice with 0.5 m LiCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and twice in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Sepharose beads were resuspended in a mixture containing 50 μl of reaction buffer, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 μg/μl). Reactions were initiated by adding 5 μl of reaction mixture (880 μm ATP, 20 mmMgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol)) per tube and stopped after 10 min by adding 20 μl of 8n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). The samples were briefly centrifuged, and 50 μl of the lower organic phase was spotted on a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in CHCl3:methanol:H2O:NH4OH (120:94:23:2.4), dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Protein kinase B/Akt assays were performed as described (27Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 500 μg of cellular protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an Akt-specific antibody, and immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads. After two washes, the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg of Crosstide) for 20 min at 30 °C. Aliquots were spotted on P-81 paper, washed, and counted as Cherenkov radiation. Cells were assayed for glucose uptake essentially as described (28Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Differentiated monolayers of brown adipocytes were treated with insulin for the indicated periods of time, after which 50 μl of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/ml final concentration) was added for an additional 3 min. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Results are indicated as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t tests were used for analysis of differences between various cell treatments; p values <0.05 are considered significant and <0.01 highly significant. Preadipocytes derived from wild type and IRS-2-deficient mice were differentiated into brown adipocytes using insulin, T3, isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and indomethacin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At various days of the differentiation process, cells from both genotypes were either stained with Oil Red O, a fat-specific dye (Fig.1 A), or prepared for Western blot analysis of several adipogenic markers (Fig. 1 B). At day 1 of the differentiation protocol, neither wild type nor IRS-2-deficient preadipocytes showed significant fat staining (Fig.1 A). Cells of both genotypes showed a similar increase in fat content over time with maximal amounts at day 10 of differentiation (Fig. 1 A). The adipogenic markers fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and C/EBPα showed a comparable expression pattern during the differentiation process in both wild type and KO cells (Fig. 1 B). Similar amounts of the thermogenic brown fat-specific uncoupling protein-1 and the insulin-responsive Glut4 were detectable in wild type and IRS-2-deficient adipocytes during differentiation (Fig.1 B). Basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake were assessed in fully differentiated cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” There was no significant difference in basal glucose transport activity in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig.2, A and B). However, in dose response, as well as time course experiments, maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport was decreased by more than 50% in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes compared with wild type cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, A and B). In both the wild type and IRS-2 KO adipocytes insulin-induced glucose uptake was suppressed completely by pretreatment of these cells with wortmannin, an irreversible inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (Fig.2 A). To determine if the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport was caused by impaired Glut4 translocation from the LDM fraction to the PM, basal and insulin-induced cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting revealed no significant difference in the basal levels of Glut4 in PM and LDM fraction in the two cell genotypes (Fig.3, A and B). Upon insulin stimulation, a significant 1.5-fold increase in Glut4 protein could be observed in the PM of wild type adipocytes (Fig.3 A). This was associated with a 50% decrease of Glut4 in the LDM fraction (Fig. 3 B). The translocation of Glut4 to the PM of insulin-induced wild type cells was significantly higher than that in IRS-2-deficient cells, which exhibited only a 1.2-fold increase in the PM and a 15% decrease in the LDM fraction after insulin treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, lack of IRS-2 impairs insulin-induced Glut4 translocation, as well as glucose transport, in brown adipocytes. We investigated whether the decrease in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose transport in adipocytes lacking IRS-2 could be linked to changes on different levels of the insulin signaling cascade. There was no detectable difference in insulin receptor protein content or tyrosine phosphorylation between wild type and KO cells in both the basal and insulin-stimulated state (Fig.4 A). As expected, no IRS-2 protein was detectable by Western blot in whole cell lysates from IRS-2-deficient adipocytes (Fig. 4 B). However, IRS-2 was detectable in cells from wild type animals and underwent rapid insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation with the maximum at 1 min of stimulation (Fig. 4, B and C). Western blots probed with anti-IRS-1 antibodies indicated comparable levels of IRS-1 in adipocytes from both genotypes (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, no significant difference in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the KO cells compared with their wild type counterparts could be observed (Fig. 4 C). Withers et al. (20Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) have described a secondary IRS-1-associated defect in muscle and liver of IRS-2-deficient mice. Thus, to confirm that the lack of IRS-2 was responsible for the differences in glucose transport between wild type and KO cells, we used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to reconstitute the KO cells with IRS-2 or add more IRS-1. After retroviral-mediated gene transfer the level of IRS-2 re-expression in the KO cells was between 50 and 70% of that seen in wild type adipocytes (Fig. 4 B). After IRS-1 retroviral infection, the IRS-2-deficient cells overexpressed IRS-1 about 1.8-fold above endogenous levels (Fig. 4 B). Both the re-expressed IRS-2 as well as the overexpressed IRS-1 showed insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in proportion to the increased level of protein (Fig. 4 C). Insulin-induced glucose uptake is dependent upon the activation of the enzyme PI 3-kinase, which binds via its p85 regulatory subunit to tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrates. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with IRS-specific antibodies and immunoblotting with an antibody detecting the p85 subunit indicated an 8-fold and 5-fold stimulation of p85-binding to IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively, after insulin treatment of wild type adipocytes (Fig. 4 C). In the IRS-2 KO cells, no p85 binding could be detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates, whereas coprecipitation of p85 with IRS-1 was unaltered, consistent with the expression and phosphorylation of these substrates in these cells (Fig.4 C). Retroviral re-expression of IRS-2 in KO cells restored insulin-induced p85 binding to IRS-2 in proportion to the level of IRS-2 protein, without affecting the amount of p85 associated with IRS-1 (Fig. 4 C). IRS-2-deficient adipocytes overexpressing IRS-1 showed an almost 2-fold increase in insulin-induced p85 binding to IRS-1 compared with wild type cells, without having detectable binding of p85 to IRS-2 (Fig. 4 C). PI 3-kinase activity assays paralleled the results for p85 association. Thus, IRS-1- and IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activities were stimulated 12-fold and 7-fold, respectively, in wild type cells (Fig.5, A and B). No IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity was found in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes in either the basal or insulin-stimulated states (Fig. 5,A and B). Re-expression of IRS-2 in these cells restored this defect in proportion to the level of IRS-2 (Fig. 5,A and B). As expected, overexpression of IRS-1 had no effect on IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 5,A and B). Insulin-induced IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was comparable in wild type and IRS-2-deficient adipocytes consistent with similar expression of IRS-1 in both cell lines, whereas overexpression of IRS-1 in the KO cells was accompanied by a significant 1.5-fold increase of PI 3-kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates compared with wild type cells (Fig. 5,A and B). To assess the relative contribution of IRS-2 to total insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation, we determined PI 3-kinase activity in phosphotyrosine (pY) immunoprecipitates. In wild type adipocytes insulin stimulation produced a 30-fold increase of pY-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 5, A andB). The level of pY-associated PI 3-kinase activity was decreased by 30% in IRS-2-deficient cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that IRS-2 accounts for about 30% of insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation in differentiated brown adipocytes. Re-expression of IRS-2 and overexpression of IRS-1 in the KO cells were both able to restore this quantitative defect in pY-associated PI 3-kinase (Fig. 5, Aand B). As both insulin receptor substrates were able to restore total PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes (Fig. 5,A and B), we determined whether re-expression of IRS-2 or overexpression of IRS-1 is sufficient to reconstitute insulin-induced glucose transport in these cells. There was no significant difference in basal glucose transport activity in all four cell lines (Fig. 6). Upon stimulation with insulin, wild type adipocytes showed a 6-fold increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 6). This was decreased by 54% in IRS-2-deficient cells (Fig. 6). Re-expression of IRS-2 in IRS-2-deficient cells increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake 1.5-fold compared with the KO adipocytes and thereby rescued about 50% of glucose uptake lost due to lack of IRS-2 (Fig. 6). By contrast, overexpression of IRS-1 in KO adipocytes was unable to restore glucose uptake in IRS-2-deficient cells, despite its ability to reconstitute pY-associated PI 3-kinase activity fully (Fig. 6). The serine/threonine kinase Akt is a downstream target of PI 3-kinase and has been implicated in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose transport. Total Akt content was similar in cell lines from both genotypes (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, the protein levels of Akt-1 and Akt-2 were comparable in IRS-2 KO adipocytes and their wild type counterparts as determined by Western blotting using isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 7 A). By immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody to Akt, we found comparable amounts of activated Akt in both wild type and KO adipocytes at all time points of insulin stimulation (Fig. 7 B). Consistent with this observation basal and insulin-induced Akt activity were similar in both cell lines (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and p70S6 kinase were comparable between wild type and IRS-2-deficient adipocytes (Fig.7 D). We studied whether subcellular distribution of Akt might be different in wild type and KO cells. The majority of Akt was found in the cytosolic fraction in the basal and insulin-stimulated state (Fig.8 A). Treatment with insulin induced a similar shift of the cytosolic Akt in both wild type and KO cells, reflecting increased phosphorylation of this protein (Fig.8 A). The amount of cytosolic Akt decreased after insulin induction in adipocytes from both genotypes, probably because of translocation of this serine/threonine kinase to different subcellular compartments (Fig. 8 A). A 1.3-fold increase in Akt content in the PM fraction could be observed in the wild type cells upon insulin stimulation, whereas no increase was detectable in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes (Fig. 8 B). The amount of Akt in the PM fraction of insulin-induced KO cells was decreased by 50% compared with wild type adipocytes (p < 0.05) (Fig.8 B). Furthermore, upon insulin stimulation there was a trend (p = 0.17) toward decreased Akt amounts in the LDM fraction of wild type cells, whereas no change could be observed in IRS-2-deficient adipocytes (Fig. 8 C). No significant amount of Akt was detectable in the HDM fraction (data not shown). To obtain a better understanding of the physiological role of the four different IRS proteins, we and other have established mice with a targeted disruption of each IRS gene (16Araki E.

However, the association between its expression level and survival has not been demonstrated in human cancer. Using the immunohistochemical technique to examine the expression levels of maspin in 44 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we found that 66% of the cases expressed low to intermediate levels of maspin and 34% of the cases expressed high levels of maspin. We further examined maspin protein expression in a series of six SCC cell lines from the head and neck, and found that all but one expressed low or no maspin protein. We also compared the clinicopathological features of the oral SCC cases with the maspin expression level, and found that high maspin expression was associated with the absence of lymph node metastasis. More importantly, we showed that higher maspin expression was significantly associated with better rates of overall survival, suggesting that high maspin expression may be a favorable prognostic marker for oral SCC."

MyD118 and Gadd45 are related proteins that previously were shown to interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), implicated in DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. To establish the role of MyD118 and Gadd45 interactions with PCNA, in this work we sought to identify the interacting domains and analyze the significance of this interaction in negative growth control. Using complementaryin vivo and in vitro interaction assays the N-terminal (1–46) and middle (100–127) regions of PCNA were identified as harboring MyD118- and Gadd45 interacting domains, whereas PCNA interacting domains within MyD118 and Gadd45 were localized to the C termini of these proteins (amino acids 114–156 and 137–165, respectively). These findings provide first evidence that similar domains within MyD118 and Gadd45 mediate interactions with PCNA. Importantly, ectopic expression of MyD118 or Gadd45 N-terminal peptides, lacking the PCNA interacting domain, was found to suppress colony formation or induce apoptosis more efficiently than the full-length proteins. These findings suggest that interaction of MyD118 or Gadd45 with PCNA, in essence, serves to impede negative growth control.

Lord K.A. Hoffmann-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar). TheMyD118-encoded protein was found to be remarkably similar to the protein encoded by Gadd45, a growth arrest- and DNA damage-induced gene, regulated in part by the p53 tumor suppressor (2.Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar,3.Fornace Jr., A.J. Jackman J. Hollander M.C. Hoffmann-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In recent years, several lines of evidence have established the roleMyD118 and Gadd45 play in negative growth control, including inhibition of cellular growth and apoptotic cell death. MyD118 was also found to be a primary response gene to the growth inhibitory and apoptotic cytokine TGF-β, which induces M1 cells for growth arrest and apoptosis uncoupled from differentiation (4.Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hoffmann B. Liebermann D. Oncogene. 1994; 10: 1791-1798Google Scholar). Blocking MyD118 expression in M1 cells by MyD118antisense RNA was found to compromise TGF-β-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of bc1–2 in M1 cells, which blocked TGF-β-induced apoptosis, resulted in reduced levels of MyD118 transcripts. In contrast, deregulated expression of either c-myc or c-myb in M1 cells, which accelerated TGF-β-induced apoptosis, markedly elevated the level of MyD118transcripts. Taken together, these findings are consistent with MyD118 being a positive modulator of TGF-β-induced apoptosis (4.Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hoffmann B. Liebermann D. Oncogene. 1994; 10: 1791-1798Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that ectopic expression of MyD118 orGadd45 in a variety of human tumor cell lines or in NIH3T3 fibroblasts negatively regulated cellular growth resulting in suppression of colony formation (5.Zhan Q. Lord K. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffmann-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MyD118,Gadd45, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were observed to synergize in colony suppression (5.Zhan Q. Lord K. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffmann-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell.

It was shown that MyD118 and Gadd45 encode for nuclear proteins that interact with PCNA, as well as with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (6.Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y.

More recently (upon completion of this study), it became clear that MyD118 and Gadd45 also interact with several other cellular proteins, including the core histones, the stress-inducible MTK1/MEKK4 kinase, and Cdk1 (cdc2-p36) (9.Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 10.Zhan Q. Antinore M.J. Wang X.W. Carrier F. Smith M.L. Harris C.C. Fornace Jr., A.J.

How this multitude of interactions modulates the functions of MyD118 and Gadd45 in negative growth control has not been established. PCNA, a normal component of multiple quaternary complexes, which include the cyclins, CDKs, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, plays a central role in cell cycle regulation (12.Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13.Sherr C.J.

Ample evidence has established the important role of PCNA in various multiprotein complexes that move along the DNA and operate as a communication point and signal-processing center for a variety of cellular processes, including DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, post replication repair, mismatch repair, base excision repair, and apoptosis via at least one pathway (15.Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 16.Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17.Kelman Z. Hurwitz J.

Given the central role of PCNA in cell proliferation and that it was found to interact with both MyD118 and Gadd45, in this work we sought to dissect the domains that mediate these interactions and analyze their relevance for negative growth control. Having identified the interacting domains, we show that the interaction of MyD118/Gadd45 with PCNA, in essence, impedes the functions of these proteins as negative regulators of cellular growth. H1299 and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC. All the cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 (293T were cultured at 5% CO2). All the cells were cultured to give 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection. One day before transfection H1299 cells were plated at 1.2 million cells/100-mm dish, and 293T cells were plated at 3 million cells/100-mm dish). Manipulation ofEscherichia coli and DNA was performed according to standard methods (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with the CLONTECH Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System-2, essentially as described in the CLONTECH protocol.

Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were used to generate all the deletion constructs ofMyD118/Gadd45/PCNA. Deletion mutants were constructed by taking advantage of unique restriction enzyme sites within the coding sequence of these cDNAs. Full-length cDNAs and truncated cDNAs encoding for deletion peptides were cloned in-frame into pAct2 (GAL4 activation domain “trap”) as well as into the modified pAS2.1 (GAL4 DNA binding domain “bait”) vector. All of the constructs were sequenced to verify in-frame cloning. Transformation into yeast strain Y187 was performed according toCLONTECH's protocol. Yeast strain Y187 was used for testing interaction by activation of the β-galactosidase gene (blue selection). Yeast strains CG1945 or Y190 were used to test interaction by activation of the histidine gene. Interaction assays were conducted only with pAct2/pAS2.1 constructs that tested negative for self-activation. Interactions either positive (+) or negative (−) were ascertained by both β-galactosidase expression (blue selection) and histidine expression (histidine selection). Quantitation of relative binding affinities of protein and deletion peptides was determined in yeast strain Y187. Three positive double transfectants were selected on minimal medium plates for each transfection and grown overnight in liquid selection minimal medium. The expression of β-galactosidase was quantified, according to theCLONTECH protocol, with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate, and the intensity of blue color developed was measured colorimetrically at 420 nm. For in vitro association assays, full-length PCNA, MyD118, Gadd45, and Bax cDNAs, and C-terminal peptide coding sequences were cloned into pET14b (7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal peptides encoding cDNAs were generated by truncating and linearizing full-length MyD118/Gadd45 cDNAs in pET14b with unique restriction enzymes at the required sites and were then used in the TNT reaction. PCNA, aa 87–261 (EcoRV-NdeI fragment), was cloned in-frame into the pAS2.1 vector. Subsequently, PCNA, aa 87–127 (NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pAS2.1), and PCNA, aa 87–149 (NdeI-BglII fragment from pAS2.1), were excised and cloned in-frame into pET23b (Novagen), which was used in the TNT reaction. Constructs were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and suspended in DNase- and RNase-free H2O. The T7-based coupled transcription and translation system, with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT, Promega) and Easy Tag [35S]methionine-L (NEN Life Science Products), was used to produce radiolabeled proteins and peptides. In vitrointeraction experiments were done as described (7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of 35S-labeled PCNA, Bax, and either MyD118 or Gadd45 proteins/peptides were mixed together (105 cpm each) in 200 μl of interaction buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 35S-Labeled Bax was added to all reactions as an internal negative control for interaction. Each interaction reaction was carried out, in triplicate, for 30 min on ice. Subsequently each reaction mixture was nonspecifically immunoprecipitated with rabbit IgG or mouse IgG for 1 h. Following pulling down of nonspecific immune complexes with protein-A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Sciences), supernatants were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with specific primary antibodies: PCNA (PC10, Santa Cruz), Bax (N 20, Santa Cruz), Gadd45 (H165, Santa Cruz), or MyD118 (7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were pulled down with protein A/G-agarose beads. Beads were washed (4×) with interaction buffer A, suspended in Laemmeli protein loading buffer, heated at 75 °C for 10 min, and loaded on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel for analysis. Following electrophoresis the gels were fixed with 25% isopropyl alcohol in 10% acetic acid, subjected to fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and vacuum-dried before exposing to x-ray film. For the in vivo interaction studies, the HA tag epitope sequence was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The pAct2 vector of the YTH system (CLONTECH) has a BglII fragment encoding for the HA tag epitope and multiple cloning site. This fragment was excised and cloned into the BamHI site of pcDNA3 to create pcDNA3/HA. Full-length MyD118/Gadd45 cDNAs and cDNAs encoding for N-terminal MyD118/Gadd45 (MyD118/aa 1–40 and Gadd45/aa 1–94) with the HA tag were excised with BglII from the pAct2 vector of the YTH system and cloned into theBamHI site of pcDNA3. cDNAs encoding for C-terminal MyD118/Gadd45 (MyD118/aa 114–156 and Gadd45/aa 95–165) were excised with the appropriate restriction enzymes from the multiple cloning site of pAS2.1 and cloned in-frame to the HA tag of pcDNA3/HA. 10 μg of the pcDNA3 constructs encoding for HA-tagged MyD118/Gadd45, full-length proteins, or deletion peptides were transiently transfected into 293T or H1299 cells, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 3 ml of interaction buffer containing protease inhibitors. Triplicate 1-ml aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to co-IP, as described above for the in vitroassociation assay, using HA antibodies (Y-11, Santa Cruz), PCNA antibodies, or nonspecific rabbit or mouse IgG. Immunecomplexes were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-EC, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Western probed with HA antibodies, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were re-probed with PCNA antibodies after stripping the blot according to manufacturer's protocol. A novel ELISA based immunoassay (21.Heuer K.H. Mackay J.P. Podzebenko P. Bains N.P.S. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9069-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used to measure the binding affinity of MyD118/Gadd45 proteins to PCNA. Expression cloning ofMyD118, Gadd45, and PCNA into pET14 was described (7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Carrier F. Smith M. Bae I. Kilpatrick K.E. Lansing T.G. Chen C.Y. Engelstein M. Friend S.H. Henner D. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 32672-32677Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These vectors were used to express the proteins in BL21(DE3)E. coli. The expressed proteins were purified from the bacterial extract by passing through a His bind affinity column, as suggested by the manufacturer (Novagen). After removal of the His tag by thrombin cleavage, proteins were again passed through a His bind affinity column to trap the excised histidine tag. ELISA assays were performed with purified proteins in Corning 96-well polystyrene disposable sterile ELISA plates. PCNA protein (50 or 100 ng), in 100 μl of interaction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20), was absorbed to the wells of an ELISA plate by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Subsequently, unbound PCNA was removed, and wells were washed three times with interaction buffer. Remaining nonspecific binding capacity of the wells was eliminated by a 1-h incubation with blocking buffer (interaction buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin). Then the blocking buffer was removed, and the wells were washed with interaction buffer. 2-Fold serially diluted recombinant MyD118 or Gadd45 protein, in 100 μl of interaction buffer plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was then applied to the wells, and proteins were allowed to interact with plate-bound PCNA for 1 h at room temperature. Following the interaction period, unbound MyD118/Gadd45 protein was removed, and the wells were washed with interaction buffer. MyD118/Gadd45 antibodies were then applied to the wells for 1 h and unbound antibodies were removed. Next, anti-rabbit IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was applied to the wells for 1 h, and unbound HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was removed. Retained HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG bound to the MyD118/Gadd45 antibody-MyD118/Gadd45 protein-PCNA complex was detected using the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (1-step slow 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine ELISA, Pierce). Color development was stopped after 15 min by adding 1 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad model 450 microplate reader. A short term transfection assay was used to assess the ability of full-lengthMyD118/Gadd45 proteins and N- or C-terminal peptides to suppress colony formation in H1299 cells (5.Zhan Q. Lord K. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffmann-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, H1299 cells were co-transfected by the LipofectAMINE method with 0.25 μg of pMSCVpac together with 5 μg of empty pcDNA3 construct (negative control) or pcDNA3 encoding for HA-tagged full-length MyD118, Gadd45 proteins or for N/C-terminal peptides. pMSCVpac was used for puromycin selection and as an internal normalization control for transfection efficiency (22.Hawley R.G. Fong A.Z. Burns B.F. Hawley T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Co-transfections were performed in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. One day following transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. The cells were replated in duplicates at 1:15, 1:30, and 1:150 dilutions with puromycin containing medium (3 μg/ml) and incubated for 14 days to allow colonies to develop. Then the medium was removed; the colonies were washed once with PBS and fixed with 75% methanol in 25% acetic acid for 5 min, and the plates were dried. Colonies were stained with Lillie's crystal violet (2 g of crystal violet, 0.8 g of ammonium oxalate in 100 ml of 80% ethanol) for 5 min and subsequently washed with de-ionized water to remove excess stain. Stained colonies containing more than 10 cells were scored and counted. The percentage of colony formation was normalized to colonies formed following transfection with empty pcDNA3. pcDNA3 encoding p53 or p21 were co-transfected with pMSCVpac as positive controls. pcDNA3 encoding for antisense p53 was used as an additional negative control. H1299 cells growing on coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were co-transfected with 2 μg of MyD118 or Gadd45 constructs (in pcDNA3) and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pSV-β-galactosidase, Promega) by the LipofectAMINE method. β-Galactosidase expression and apoptosis were analyzed 72 h following transfection. The cells were washed once with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 0.05% gluteraldehyde in PBS. Following three washes with PBS to remove the fixative, X-gal solution (20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 20 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mm magnesium sulfate in PBS; X-gal is added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml just before use, from a 20 mg/ml stock solution in N,N-dimethyl formamide) was spread over the dishes, and the dishes were incubated overnight at room temperature. The next day, the X-gal solution was removed, and cell nuclei were stained for three minutes with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst No.33342 (Sigma catalog number B 2261) and then washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium H-1000 (Vector Labs Inc.) and analyzed under a Leitz fluorescent microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by dividing the number of β-galactosidase-expressing blue cells that exhibit apoptotic nuclear morphology (condensed/fragmented nucleus) by the total number of blue cells. At least 200 cells from five randomly chosen fields were analyzed for each experiment. As a first approach to identify PCNA domains that interact with either MyD118 or Gadd45, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed (“Experimental Procedures”). Deletion constructs of PCNA cDNA, encoding for N-terminal, middle, or C-terminal peptides of PCNA, were cloned into the Gal4 DNA binding domain of the pAS2.1 yeast two-hybrid system vector. Each of these constructs were co-transfected into yeast with pACT2 yeast two-hybrid system constructs encoding for either MyD118 or Gadd45, fused to the Gal4 activation domain. Interactions, either positive (+) or negative (−), were ascertained by both β-galactosidase expression (blue color) and histidine expression (histidine selection) (“Experimental Procedures”). Results are shown in Fig.1. Consistent with previous observations (6.Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J.

PCNA C-terminal (PCNA-(224–261)), N-terminal (PCNA-(1–46)), and middle (PCNA-(87–127)) peptides also interacted with MyD118 and Gadd45. This indicated that these regions of PCNA contain MyD118/Gadd45 interacting domains. Consistent with MyD118/Gaddd45 interacting domains within the N-terminal region of PCNA, PCNA-(1–149) and PCNA-(1–127) peptides interacted with MyD118 and Gadd45 also. The PCNA-(1–223) peptide, however, failed to interact, implying that there is a steric hindrance domain within the 150–223 region of PCNA, which inhibited binding to MyD118 and Gadd45. Consistent with this notion, the aa 150–223 hindrance domain also prevented association of PCNA-(128–261) and PCNA-(150–261) C-terminal peptides with MyD118 and Gadd45. PCNA-(1–100) and PCNA-(1–86) N-terminal peptides also failed to interact with MyD118 and Gadd45. Because PCNA-(1–46) and PCNA-(1–127) did interact with MyD118/Gadd45, the data implied that the 47–86 aa region of PCNA, when juxtaposed to the N-terminal 1–46 aa region, in the absence of the 87–127 aa region, also hindered binding of PCNA peptides to MyD118 and Gadd45. The relative binding affinities of different PCNA domains with MyD118/Gadd45 were quantified using the yeast two-hybrid system liquid culture assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this assay, the level of β-galactosidase expression in yeast, under control of the interacting partner proteins encoded by pAct2 and PAS2.1, was quantified by measuring the intensity of blue color development usingo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. As shown in Fig. 1, the interaction between full-length PCNA and full-length MyD118/Gadd45 was weaker than the interaction when using PCNA-(1–46), PCNA-(87–127), or PCNA-(224–261) peptides. This observation is consistent with the notion that full-length PCNA contains, in addition to MyD118/Gadd45 interacting domains, domains which hinder interaction. Having mapped domains within PCNA that interact with MyD118 and Gadd45, next it was in our interest to map domains within MyD118/Gadd45 that mediate interaction with PCNA. The YTH vector pAS2.1 was used to construct yeast expression vectors that encode for N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of MyD118 and Gadd45. These deletion peptides were tested for interaction with PCNA cloned in the YTH vector pAct2 (Fig.2 and legend). It can be seen that full-length MyD118-(1–161) and MyD118-(1–156) interacted with PCNA, whereas MyD118-(1–113) failed to interact. MyD118-(114–156), however, did interact with PCNA. This indicated that the 114–156 C-terminal region of MyD118 harbors a domain that is essential for interaction with PCNA. Surprisingly, MyD118-(26–161), MyD118-(41–161), and MyD118-(69–161), although containing the crucial 114–156 aa domain, failed to interact with PCNA; this can be explained by assuming that the 69–113 middle domain, in the absence of the 1–25, N-terminal domain, hinders interaction. As expected, also full-length Gadd45 interacted with PCNA (Fig.2 B). However, both Gadd45-(1–136) and Gadd45-(1–94) failed to interact with PCNA, whereas Gadd45-(95–165) did interact. This indicates that also for Gadd45, there is a crucial PCNA interacting domain located in the C terminus (aa 137–165). The relative binding affinities of full-length and C-terminal peptides of MyD118/Gadd45 with PCNA were quantified, using β-galactosidase expression in yeast, and are shown in Fig. 2 B. Notably, the binding affinity to PCNA of the MyD118-(114–156) C-terminal peptide was higher than the Gadd45-(95–165) C-terminal peptide. Taken together these findings indicate that similar domains mediate interaction between either MyD118 or Gadd45 to PCNA. To determine if the interacting domains identified by the YTH approach are capable of mediating direct association between these proteins in vitro, binding assays were performed with 35S-labeled PCNA, MyD118, and Gadd45 full-length proteins and deletion peptides that were generated by coupled transcription/translation. The murine Bax protein (pKI = 4.69), a bcl-2 partner protein with a mass and charge similar to MyD118 (pKI = 3.92) and Gadd45 (pKI = 4.08) (24.Oltavi Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar), was included as an internal control to monitor for the specificity of the binding assay. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled proteins were mixed, and following incubation, the protein mixtures were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to PCNA, MyD118, Gadd45, or Bax. Because the PCNA monoclonal antibody used (PC10) was specific for amino acids 111–120 of PCNA, it could be used only to test for interaction of the middle domain of PCNA with MyD118/Gadd45. Thus, MyD118- and Gadd45-specific antibodies were used to test for interactions with other PCNA domains. As shown in Fig.3 A , MyD118 and Gadd45 were contained within PCNA immune complexes, and PCNA was contained within MyD118 and Gadd45 immune complexes. The specificity of these interactions was inferred by the observation that Bax was not contained within PCNA, MyD118, or Gadd45 immune complexes, consistent with previous observations (7.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B—D,immune complexes of peptides corresponding to PCNA N-terminal (aa 1–46) and middle (aa 87–127), but not the C-terminal (aa 224–261) domains, also contained MyD118 or Gadd45. This indicated that the middle and N-terminal regions of PCNA contain domains that were capable of association with both MyD118 and Gadd45 in vitro. Coupled transcription/translati"

These proteins contain eight conserved cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds. To study the effect of the disulfide bridges on the self-assembly, the disulfides of the SC3 hydrophobin were reduced with 1,4-dithiothreitol. The free thiols were then blocked with either iodoacetic acid (IAA) or iodoacetamide (IAM), introducing eight or zero negative charges, respectively. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy showed that after opening of the disulfide bridges SC3 is initially unfolded. IAA-SC3 did not self-assemble at the air-water interface upon shaking an aqueous solution. Remarkably, after drying down IAA-SC3 or after exposing it to Teflon, it refolded into a structure similar to that observed for native SC3 at these interfaces. Iodoacetamide-SC3 on the other hand, which does not contain extra charges, spontaneously refolded in water in the amyloid-like β-sheet conformation, characteristic for SC3 assembled at the water-air interface. From this we conclude that the disulfide bridges of SC3 are not directly involved in self-assembly but keep hydrophobin monomers soluble in the fungal cell or its aqueous environment, preventing premature self-assembly.

They fulfill a broad spectrum of functions in fungal development (1Wessels J.G.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobins are secreted by filamentous fungi into their aqueous environment, where they self-assemble at the interface between the medium and the air. This results in a dramatic drop of the water surface tension, enabling fungi to breach the interface to form aerial reproductive structures (2Wösten H.A.B. van Wetter M.-A. Lugones L.G. van der Mei H.C. Busscher H.J. Wessels J.G.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 85-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Hydrophobins also provide these aerial structures with a hydrophobic coating (1Wessels J.G.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mediate attachment of fungi to hydrophobic surfaces (for example, in pathogenic interactions) (3Wösten H.A.B. Schuren F.H.J. Wessels J.G.H.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).SC3 of Schizophyllum commune is the best studied hydrophobin, but other hydrophobins show similar properties. SC3 is a glycoprotein of 112 amino acids containing 16–22 mannose residues that are probably linked to 12 threonines and 1 serine at the amino-terminal part of the molecule (5de Vocht M.L. Scholtmeijer K. van der Vegte E.W. de Vries O.M.H. Sonveaux N. Wösten H.A.B. Ruysschaert J.M. Hadziioannou G. Wessels J.G.H. Robillard G.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2059-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SC3 is a remarkable protein because it forms an insoluble amphipathic protein film after self-assembly at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface that cannot be dissociated by heating in 2% SDS at 100 °C (6Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic side of this protein film is characterized by a mosaic of parallel rodlets (6Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) of an amyloid-like nature. 1M. L. de Vocht, I. Reviakine, H. A. B. Wösten, A. Brisson, J. G. H. Wessels, and G. T.

Upon self-assembly, the different conformations of SC3 are observed depending on the nature of the interface. For instance, after binding to a hydrophobic solid the protein is trapped in a so-called “α-helical state” (5de Vocht M.L. Scholtmeijer K. van der Vegte E.W. de Vries O.M.H. Sonveaux N.

All hydrophobins studied so far have the same spatial distribution of cysteine residues, which is as follows:X 2–38-C-X 5–9-C-C-X 11–44-C-X 8–23-C-X 5–9-C-C-X 6–18-C-X 2–14.The initial idea that intermolecular disulfide bridges were formed during the self-assembly and thus stabilize the protein film was disproved when it was shown that SC3 self-assembled not only on air bubbles but also on non-oxidative nitrogen gas bubbles (6Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that monomeric SC3 contained no free cysteine residues and that the protein film could be disassembled by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in the absence of reducing agent (7de Vries O.M.H. Fekkes M.P. Wösten H.A.B. Wessels J.G.H. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 330-335Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar).SC3 is a so-called class I hydrophobin (1Wessels J.G.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The arrangement of the disulfide bridges has been determined for the class II hydrophobin cerato-ulmin (8Yaguchi M. Pusztai-Carey M. Roy C. Surewicz W.K. Carey P.R. Stevenson K.J. Richards W.C. Takai S. Sticklen M.D. Sherald J.L. Dutch Elm Disease Research: Cellular and Molecular Approaches. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1993: 152-170Crossref Google Scholar). Cys1 is bonded to Cys2or Cys3; Cys2 or Cys3 is bonded to Cys4; Cys5 is bonded to Cys6 or Cys7; and Cys6 or Cys7 is bonded to Cys8. This results in a primary structure with four loops and two domains. Although there is no direct proof, the general assumption is that a similar pattern of disulfide bridges exists in SC3 (Fig. 1).Disulfide bonds can fulfill diverse functions in proteins. In general they stabilize proteins, but the exact manner by which the stabilizing effect is achieved cannot be predicted adequately by current theories (9Betz S.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The conserved pattern of the cysteine residues in all hydrophobins suggests that the cysteine residues are important for hydrophobin structure and/or function. To study the role of the disulfide bridges in SC3, all disulfides were reduced with DTT,3 and the free cysteines were blocked with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide. The secondary structure of carboxymethylated SC3 before and after the self-assembly processes was determined. The strength of binding to a hydrophobic Teflon surface and the ability to self-assemble in the amyloid-like form and to form rodlets were also monitored.DISCUSSIONSC3 is a very stable protein. The CD spectrum of the monomeric form hardly changes in 10 mm DTT or in 5.4 mguanidine (Fig. 2). In addition, heating to 90 °C or changing the pH between 3 and 12 does not change the secondary structure of the protein (data not shown). SC3 only unfolds after reduction of the disulfide bridges with 10 mm DTT in 5.4 m guanidine. This shows that the disulfide bridges are essential for the stability of the monomeric form of SC3.In general the conformation of proteins that adsorb on a hydrophobic solid support varies from a native or nearly native conformation to an extensively unfolded conformation (18Brash J.L. Horbett T.A. Horbett T.A. Brash J.L. Protein at Interfaces II: Fundamentals and Applications. 602. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-23Google Scholar, 19Haynes C.A. Norde W. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 313-328Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The remarkable refolding of IAA-SC3 on Teflon, with eight additional negative charges, demonstrates the high propensity of the hydrophobin to refold on a hydrophobic surface and is a clear illustration of the specific interaction of hydrophobins with hydrophobic substrates. However, the stability of the IAA-SC3 layer is decreased compared with a layer of assembled native SC3. This instability is not caused by a difference in structure but by the negative charges at pH 7.0, as shown by the recovery of the strong binding when the extraction with SDS was performed at low pH. Furthermore, the IAA-SC3 is still capable of forming rodlets (Fig.7 A). This confirms the observation that intermolecular disulfide bridges are not involved in the self-assembly process.All hydrophobins have the same distribution of cysteine residues, and they probably have the same pattern of disulfide bridges. They are produced as monomeric proteins and can self-assemble into more or less insoluble films after interaction with a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. For SC3 it has been shown that this film consists of amyloid fibrils1. For many amyloid proteins the polymerization is initiated by a partially folded state of the protein (20Taubes G. Science. 1996; 271: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Therefore it is understandable that opening of the disulfide bridges (which destabilizes the monomeric form) increases the propensity of hydrophobins to form amyloid fibrils.IAM-SC3 in water spontaneously self-assembles in an amyloid-like β-sheet form in the absence of a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, but it first goes through a short-lived α-helical state. This corroborates the observation that the α-helical form also in native SC3 is an intermediate in the self-assembly process2. We propose that the disulfide bridges stabilize the monomeric form of hydrophobins and prevent premature self-assembly (before interaction with a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface), which would result in protein aggregates within the cell or its aqueous environment. The eight conserved cysteine residues in hydrophobins are thus essential for the function of hydrophobins at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces during fungal development. Hydrophobins are small, moderately hydrophobic proteins characterized by similar hydropathy patterns and the presence of eight cysteine residues with conserved spacing. They fulfill a broad spectrum of functions in fungal development (1Wessels J.G.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For SC3 it has been shown that this film consists of amyloid fibrils1. For many amyloid proteins the polymerization is initiated by a partially folded state of the protein (20Taubes G. Science. 1996; 271: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Therefore it is understandable that opening of the disulfide bridges (which destabilizes the monomeric form) increases the propensity of hydrophobins to form amyloid fibrils.IAM-SC3 in water spontaneously self-assembles in an amyloid-like β-sheet form in the absence of a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, but it first goes through a short-lived α-helical state. This corroborates the observation that the α-helical form also in native SC3 is an intermediate in the self-assembly process2. We propose that the disulfide bridges stabilize the monomeric form of hydrophobins and prevent premature self-assembly (before interaction with a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface), which would result in protein aggregates within the cell or its aqueous environment. The eight conserved cysteine residues in hydrophobins are thus essential for the function of hydrophobins at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces during fungal development. SC3 is a very stable protein. The CD spectrum of the monomeric form hardly changes in 10 mm DTT or in 5.4 mguanidine (Fig. 2). In addition, heating to 90 °C or changing the pH between 3 and 12 does not change the secondary structure of the protein (data not shown). SC3 only unfolds after reduction of the disulfide bridges with 10 mm DTT in 5.4 m guanidine. This shows that the disulfide bridges are essential for the stability of the monomeric form of SC3. In general the conformation of proteins that adsorb on a hydrophobic solid support varies from a native or nearly native conformation to an extensively unfolded conformation (18Brash J.L. Horbett T.A. Horbett T.A. Brash J.L. Protein at Interfaces II: Fundamentals and Applications. 602. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-23Google Scholar, 19Haynes C.A. Norde W. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 313-328Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The remarkable refolding of IAA-SC3 on Teflon, with eight additional negative charges, demonstrates the high propensity of the hydrophobin to refold on a hydrophobic surface and is a clear illustration of the specific interaction of hydrophobins with hydrophobic substrates. However, the stability of the IAA-SC3 layer is decreased compared with a layer of assembled native SC3. This instability is not caused by a difference in structure but by the negative charges at pH 7.0, as shown by the recovery of the strong binding when the extraction with SDS was performed at low pH. Furthermore, the IAA-SC3 is still capable of forming rodlets (Fig.7 A). This confirms the observation that intermolecular disulfide bridges are not involved in the self-assembly process.

Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have been characterized. Both enzymes are active in the presence of high levels of free selenide (1–5 mm) and dithiothreitol (8–10 mm) that are included in the in vitro assay system employed routinely. Under these conditions, the apparent Km values for ATP and selenide are 1 mm and 20 μm, respectively. Although the reactions are carried out under argon, any traces of contaminating oxygen tend to reduce the effective concentration of selenide. The standard use of high selenide levels in vitrois a partial solution of this problem. The Km value determined for selenide in the in vitro system is far above the optimal concentration (0.1–1 μm) of selenium needed for the growth of various bacterial species and cultured mammalian cells. In fact, levels above 10 μm are toxic for many bacterial species. The fact that the high reactivity and thus the toxicity of selenide in biological systems is even greater than that of sulfide is apparent from the greater extent of ionization at physiological pH of H2Se with a pK 1 = 3.89 as compared with that of H2S with a pK 1 = 7.5. Rate acceleration by ionized selenols of disulfide reduction and disruption of protein structures or destabilization of coordinated metal ions from metallothionines (5Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L.

Potential candidates for control of selenium levels are the specific l-selenocysteine-lyase enzymes that decompose selenocysteine to elemental selenium (Se0) and alanine (6Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chocat P. Esaki N. Tanizawa K. Nakamura K. Tanaka H. Soda K J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a closely related enzymed-selenocystine-lyase (8Esaki N. Seraneeprakarn V. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 751-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The attractive possibility that these lyases also may serve normally to deliver Se0 to SPS was suggested by previous studies in which it was shown thatl-selenocysteine and the Azotobacter vinelandiiNifS protein effectively replaced the high level of free selenide in the in vitro SPS assay (9Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3091-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, even though the normal substrate for A. vinelandii NifS is cysteine (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the extent of utilization of selenocysteine in vitro was sufficient to promote a higher rate of selenophosphate formation by SPS than was observed with free selenide alone. The A. vinelandii NifS protein and the selenocysteine-lyases are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes that catalyze the elimination of sulfur from l-cysteine and selenium froml-selenocysteine (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because in vivoconcentrations of sulfur-containing compounds are a thousand-fold or more greater than their selenium analogs, proteins such as NifS presumably bind and metabolize l-cysteine preferentially. Thus, lyase proteins that are highly specific forl-selenocysteine as substrate may function as the actual selenium delivery proteins in vivo. In E. colithree NifS-like proteins were identified recently (12Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All three proteins resemble A. vinelandii NifS in amino acid sequences and catalytic properties. Sequence alignments also revealed similarities between the N-terminal region amino acid sequence of the pig liver selenocysteine-lyase (6Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the threeE. coli NifS-like proteins CsdB, CSD, and IscS revealed considerable differences in the degree of discrimination betweenl-cysteine and l-selenocysteine as substrates (12Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CsdB protein, although not entirely specific for the seleno-amino acid, substrate was 290 times more active onl-selenocysteine than on l-cysteine. This protein thus appears to be the E. coli counterpart of the mammalian selenocysteine-lyase. In an attempt to identify residues that are essential for catalysis in the SPS enzyme, mutagenesis experiments have been performed (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27020-27025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain amino acids in a glycine-rich potential ATP-binding site in the N-terminal region of the protein were selected as targets. Mutagenesis of cysteine 17, located in the potential ATP-binding site, to serine resulted in the complete loss of detectable SPS activity in both the in vitro selenide-dependent assay and the in vivo complementation of a selD lesion in E. coli strain MBO8 (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability to detect SPS catalytic activity of the cysteine 17 mutant enzyme and the failure of this mutated enzyme to catalyze a positional isotope exchange reaction between the γ-phosphoryl group and the β-phosphoryl group of ATP 2L. Mullins, H. Walker, T. Stadtman, and F. Rauschel, unpublished results. 2L. Mullins, H. Walker, T. Stadtman, and F. Rauschel, unpublished results. supported a catalytic role for cysteine 17. However, a catalytic role was contradicted by the finding that substitution of selenocysteine for cysteine at position 17, which occurs normally in H. influenzae SPS, fails to elicit an increase in catalytic activity (4Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present work, we report the ability of the CsdB, CSD, and IscS proteins to function bothin vitro and in vivo as selenium delivery proteins to the E. coli wild-type SPS and also to SPS (C17S) mutant. l-Selenocystine was synthesized (15Tanaka H. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and converted to l-selenocysteine as reported (6Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [8-14C]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedical Research Products, Costa Mesa, CA. [75Se]Selenite was purchased from The University of Missouri Research Reactor Facility, Columbia, MO. The lyase proteins CsdB, CSD, and IscS were purified as described by Mihara et al. (12Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SPS was purified by the procedure of Veres et al. (3Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Cultures were observed after 24–48 h for the production of H2, a product of an active formate dehydrogenase (FDHH)-hydrogenase H complex (also known as formate hydrogen-lyase) (18Peck Jr., H.D. Guest H. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 73: 706-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of the selenocysteine-containing FDHH depends on the availability of selenophosphate. In parallel experiments, MBO8 cultures containing both plasmids were streaked out on Luria medium plus glucose agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 48 h at 37 °C. After growth, all individual colonies were colorless. The plates were then overlaid with agar containing benzyl viologen, an electron acceptor for active FDHH that turns blue when reduced. Thus, any colonies appearing blue in color provide a test for the presence of FDHH (19Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Wee M.Y.K. Haddock B.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1978; 4: 36-40Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Single colonies of MBO8, MBO8/SPS, and MBO8/SPS (C17S) were grown anaerobically in Luria broth + 20 μCi75SeO32− at 37 °C for 24 h. Following growth, cells were harvested, resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and sonicated. Supernatants were analyzed for the presence of the selenocysteine containing FDHH by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager detection of radioactivity. All assays were performed anaerobically three to six times and averaged for each reported value. The coupled SPS-lyase assay reaction mixtures contained 50 mmTricine·KOH, pH 8.0, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 2 mm ATP, 10 mml-selenocysteine, 10 μm SPS, 0.2 μCi [8-14C] ATP, and the indicated concentration of added lyase. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, terminated by the addition of 1.2 N HClO4, and neutralized with KOH. A standard assay, in which selenide replacedl-selenocysteine and lyase protein, was performed at the same time. The nucleotides in the supernatant solutions were separated by chromatography on cellulose-polyethyleneimine thin layer sheets developed in 1.0 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. Nucleotide spots detected by UV quenching were cut out, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The selenocysteine-lyase activity of each protein was measured in the absence of selenophosphate synthetase by quantitation of liberated H2Se after reaction with lead acetate as described previously (6Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mmTricine·KOH, pH 8.0, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 10 mml-selenocysteine, and 2.5 μm lyase. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated amounts of time, and reactions were quenched by the addition of lead acetate. The amount of H2Se produced was quantitated using a molar turbidity coefficient of colloidal PbSe at 400 nm of 1.18 × 104cm−1m−1. The competition experiments with the CsdB (R379A) mutant were performed as described above for the coupled assay. A total of five assays was performed, each in the presence of a different concentration of CsdB (R379A) (0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μm). The assays performed with SPS (C17S) mutant were performed as described above. As previously reported, the high levels of free selenide that are used routinely for SPS can be replaced by the A. vinelandii NifS protein and l-selenocysteine in the in vitro SPS assay (9Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3091-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Even though the normal substrate for NifS is cysteine, the ability to act also on the selenium analog makes it an effective selenium donor in vitro. In this coupled assay, an increase in selenophosphate formation was observed, indicating that Se0 generated by the NifS protein is a more effective substrate than free selenide (9Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3091-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, three E. coligenes encoding the NifS-like proteins CsdB, CSD, and IscS were cloned, and the gene products were characterized (12Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All three proteins exhibit lyase activity on l-cysteine andl-selenocysteine as substrates and produce sulfane sulfur, S0, or Se0 respectively. One of the proteins, CsdB, utilizes selenocysteine more effectively than cysteine, indicating a more specific role for Se0 generation. To test the relative abilities of the three NifS-like proteins from E. coli to provide Se0 to SPS, assays were performed withl-selenocysteine and CsdB, CSD, or IscS in place of high levels of free selenide. SPS catalytic activity was supported in the presence of each NifS-like protein (Fig.1 A). The determined activity of SPS was directly related to the concentration of lyase used in each assay. When lyase concentrations were increased above 0.025 μm, the amount of AMP generated by SPS was slightly higher than AMP formed in assays using 1.5 mm free selenide as substrate (data not shown). However, at lyase concentrations above 0.05 μm, the amount of selenide generated was much higher (Fig. 1 B) as compared with the amount of AMP generated by SPS. (In the absence of an acceptor (SPS) and in free solution the product of the lyase reaction is referred to as selenide.) The inability to detect increased SPS activity in the presence of higher concentrations of lyase indicates SPS is saturated with selenium. SPS may have an inherently low catalytic rate because of a possible rate-limiting step in the reaction mechanism. The rate-limiting step may occur after selenium binding and could include bound ADP hydrolysis (20Walker H. Ferretti J.A. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), product release (AMP) or an enzyme conformational change. An in vivo test to detect activity of the formate hydrogen-lyase complex in E. coli depends on the evolution of gas (H2) from formate generated during anaerobic growth on glucose (18Peck Jr., H.D. Guest H. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 73: 706-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This test was later extended to detect in vivo activity of the selD gene (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27020-27025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selD gene product, SPS, forms the reactive selenium donor compound, selenophosphate, which is required for the production of selenocysteyl-tRNASec (21Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Boesmiller K. Veprek B. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of an active selenocysteine containing formate dehydrogenase depends on the availability of selenocysteyl-tRNASec. A more sensitive in vivotest, devised for the detection of redox-active enzymes such as formate dehydrogenase, involves the ability of the enzyme to reduce benzyl viologen to a blue color when agar containing the dye was overlaid on bacterial colonies grown anaerobically on glucose agar plates. E. coli MBO8, a selD mutant strain, cannot make selenophosphate and lacks an active selenocysteine containing formate dehydrogenase. Therefore, MBO8 fails to produce H2 when grown in glucose media (16Leinfelder W. Forchhammer K. Zinoni F. Sawers G. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 540-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Haddock B.A. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1982; 10: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is unable to reduce benzyl viologen, resulting in colonies that do not turn blue. Introduction of a plasmid bearing a wild-type selD gene into MBO8 complements the selD lesion and allows the synthesis of an active selenocysteine containing formate dehydrogenase that can be detected in both in vivo assays (Data not shown) (22Stadtman T.C. Davis J.N. Zehelin E. Böck A. Biofactors. 1989; 2: 35-44PubMed Google Scholar). The SPS (C17S) mutation failed to complement the selD lesion in MBO8 as judged by lack of visible H2 production from glucose during anaerobic growth (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27020-27025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified mutant enzyme was also unable to catalyze the formation of selenophosphate from 1.5 mm selenide and ATP in the usual in vitro assay (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27020-27025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To re-evaluate the activity of the SPS (C17S) mutant, MBO8 cells were transformed with a plasmid bearing the mutant gene. In the benzyl viologen overlay assay the SPS (C17S) mutant gene was able to complement the selD lesion, and transformed MBO8 colonies turned blue in color (data not shown). Although reduction of benzyl viologen is a more sensitive test for FDHH activity than production of H2 gas in glucose media, the extent of blue color development is more qualitative than quantitative. Nevertheless, the benzyl viologen assay is a rapid and selective assay for determining formate dehydrogenase activity (19Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Wee M.Y.K. Haddock B.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1978; 4: 36-40Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MBO8 colonies bearing either the wild-type SPS or the mutant SPS (C17S) gene turned blue in the assay. To compare the in vivo activities of wild-type SPS and SPS (C17S), MBO8 cells containing plasmids bearing either gene were grown anaerobically in the presence of75SeO32−. After growth, cell extracts were prepared and examined for the presence of [75Se]selenocysteine containing FDHH (Fig.2). MBO8 cells alone are unable to incorporate selenocysteine into FDHH. However, the selD lesion in MBO8 cells can be complemented either by a plasmid bearing the SPS gene or a plasmid bearing the SPS (C17S) mutant gene, thus restoring incorporation of selenocysteine into FDHH. Quantitation of the amount of radioactivity in FDHH in response to the two gene products (Fig. 2) revealed that the level of selenophosphate synthesis by the SPS (C17S) gene product was sufficient to allow incorporation of 44% as much75Se into FDHH as observed with the wild-type SPS. The fact that the activity of the SPS (C17S) mutant could be detected in vivo is indicative of an essential component present in E. coli that is absent in our in vitroassay containing purified SPS and free selenide. The low amount of lyase required for detectable SPS activity suggests a complex may form between a NifS-like protein and SPS. This complex would allow the direct delivery of selenium as a putative Se0 to the active site of SPS. As a means of detecting complex formation with a NifS-like protein and SPS, competition assays were performed. As a potential competitor, a catalytically inactive mutant CsdB (R379A), 3H. Mihara, T. Kurihara, and N. Esaki, unpublished results. which is unable to bind l-selenocysteine, was added to assay mixtures containing CsdB(1 μm), l-selenocysteine (10 mm), and SPS (10 μm). If SPS and CsdB actually bind to form a complex, then the addition of CsdB (R379A) would displace CsdB. To observe the possible competitive capability of CsdB (R379A), reaction mixtures were prepared that contained 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μm CsdB (R379A). The SPS selenium-dependent hydrolysis of ATP to AMP was measured in each sample. Over the range of added CsdB (R379A) examined, the observed rate of AMP formation was unaffected (data not shown), indicating that a 5–10-fold molar excess of this mutant is ineffective as a competitor of putative complex formation between SPS and the active delivery protein. Although no decrease in SPS activity was observed in the presence of excess CsdB (R379A), the substitution of alanine for arginine, which is known to affect selenocysteine binding, might also affect binding to SPS (23Fujii T. Maeda M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Hata Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because wild-type CsdB has both l-cysteine desulfurase andl-selenocysteine-lyase activities, it is possible that binding of l-selenocysteine induces a conformational change that allows complex formation with SPS, and this change cannot occur in the mutant. Previously, it was shown that the SPS (C17S) mutant enzyme is unable to catalyze the selenide dependent conversion of ATP to AMP (13Kim I.Y. Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of the SPS (C17S) mutant to complement MBO8 in the in vivobenzyl viologen overlay assay and incorporate selenocysteine into FDHH suggests either free selenide in the in vitro assay does not mimic the actual in vivo substrate or, alternatively, an additional factor is needed for selenophosphate formation and is supplied by MBO8. To determine whether a selenium delivery protein might be the factor required, the SPS (C17S) mutant enzyme was assayed in the presence of a selenocysteine-lyase protein. Fig. 3 A shows that replacement of free selenide with 10 μm CsdB, CSD, or IscS andl-selenocysteine results in detectable activity in the SPS (C17S) in vitro assay. Fig. 3 B shows that in the presence of a lyase (IscS), SPS (C17S) is saturated with Se0 and activity is detected. Maximum activity is observed when concentrations of IscS approach one-half or greater the concentration of SPS (C17S). In contrast, maximum activity of wild-type SPS is observed in the presence of a selenium delivery protein at concentrations as low as 0.25 μm. The ability to detect catalytic activity of the SPS (C17S) mutant further supports the involvement of a lyase protein in selenophosphate biosynthesis and provides additional evidence that cysteine-17 of SPS does not have a direct catalytic role. Biological roles of NifS proteins include the mobilization of sulfur [S0] from cysteine to a specific protein acceptor. The mobilized sulfur can be distributed throughout the cell for iron-sulfur cluster assembly such as those found in nitrogenase (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These additional functions, together with the identification of multiple NifS-like proteins support roles for NifS-like proteins that are not limited to iron-sulfur cluster assembly. The generation of Se0 by the NifS-like proteins reflects an additional in vivo function in which these enzymes participate as components of a selenium delivery system for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins and selenium modification of tRNA nucleosides (Fig. 4). The chemical similarity between selenium and sulfur allows selenium to enter bacterial metabolism via the cysteine biosynthetic pathway where it can be incorporated into free selenocysteine (39Muller S. Heider J. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Free selenocysteine can be inserted into proteins nonspecifically, in place of cysteine, or a NifS-like protein can utilize it to generate selenium for SPS. The biological relevance of the NifS-like proteins in selenophosphate biosynthesis is particularly evident in the case of the SPS (C17S) mutant. Catalytic activity of this mutated SPS enzyme could be detected in the presence of CsdB, CSD, or IscS (Fig. 3). In the in vitro coupled assays, all three E. coliNifS-like proteins were able to function well as selenium delivery proteins with SPS. However, in vivo concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds are much higher compared with their selenium analogs. For the E. coli NifS-like proteins to be effective selenium delivery proteins under normal conditions additional proteins may be involved to assist in the discrimination between cysteine and selenocysteine. Future work will be focused on identifying additional cellular components and proteins that participate in selenium metabolism and selenophosphate biosynthesis. Clearly, generation of Se0 at or in proximity to SPS may be the mechanism whereby the essential substrate of the enzyme is made available and the obstacle of free selenide toxicity is avoided."

The activity of luminal, epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC)1 is rate-limiting for trans-epithelial Na+ reabsorption across the renal collecting duct and other Na+ reabsorbing epithelium. Thus, understanding regulation of ENaC activity is relevant to physiology as well as to treating disease with associated fluid imbalance.ENaC is a heterotetrameric channel complex composed of at least three homologous but distinct subunits: α, β, and γ (1Canessa C.M.

Studies of single channel properties show that in amphibian, rat, and rabbit distal tubule cells, ENaC activity is decreased within 5–10 min after activation of PKC (12Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A rapid initial decrease in ENaC open probability is, in part, responsible for the early change in activity; however, it appears that PKC may also subsequently affect the number of functional channels (14Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although most studies are consistent with PKC decreasing ENaC open probability initially and then subsequently reducing channel number, Els et al. (16Els W.J. Liu X. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C120-C129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed with blocker-induced noise analysis in A6 cells that PKC activation, besides producing the initial decrease in open probability and a longer term decrease in channel number, might also lead to a small initial compensatory increase in channel number presumably in response to decreased open probability. Nevertheless, actions on channel open probability likely precede effects on number and both reduce overall sodium transport. In a provocative study, Ishikawa and colleagues (15Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) report biphasic actions of Ca2+-dependent processes (e.g. activation of PKC) on repression of ENaC activity with time constants ranging between 1–2 and 100–160 min. The current results are consistent with the latter time constant representing a decrease in ENaC number.Recently, Shimkets et al. (17Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed for the first time that PKC directly phosphorylates ENaC when this ion channel is overexpressed and PKC is substantially activated. It is unclear how PKC-mediated phosphorylation relates to ENaC kinetics and number and, thus, Na+ reabsorption. Moreover, the long term actions of PKC on transport and ENaC protein levels have not been studied.Because ENaC subunit levels can be differentially regulated in response to various factors and PKC is known to affect ENaC activity, perhaps, in part, through regulation of channel number, we tested the hypothesis that PKC differentially regulates subunit protein levels. This is the first report directly showing that ENaC subunit protein levels are differentially affected by PKC with both γ and β, but not αENaC, decreasing in response to kinase activation. The decrease in subunit levels is consistent with the long term actions of PKC on ENaC resulting in decreased Na+ channel number and, thus, transport.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll experiments were performed on A6 cells (American Tissue Type Culture; passages 75–80). A6 cells were cultured, as described previously (14Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G. Al-Baldawi N.

High resistance (>2 KΩ) A6 cell monolayers plated on permeable 3.8-cm2 inserts (0.02 μm Anopore membrane; Nalge NUNC International, Naperville, IL) avidly reabsorbing Na+ were used for all experiments.Trans-epithelial Na+ current was calculated as the ratio of trans-epithelial voltage to trans-epithelial resistance under open circuit conditions using a Millicel Electrical Resistance System with dual Ag/AgCl pellet electrodes (Millipore Corp.) to measure trans-epithelial potentials and resistances. If the current-voltage relationship of the monolayer is close to linear, this measurement is exactly equivalent to short circuit current. However, trans-epithelial currents calculated in this fashion do not require long term short circuiting of the tissue, which alters intracellular ion concentrations and, therefore, may alter single channel properties. The open circuit measurements, in addition, ensured that larger numbers of monolayers could be routinely sampled, thus ensuring that adequate cellular material was available for subsequent biochemical analysis, as well as enabling the pairing of electrical and biochemical measurements. Movement of cations from the lumen to serosal fluids is represented as positive current. With this preparation, the majority of trans-epithelial current was amiloride-sensitive and carried by Na+ via ENaC from lumen to serosal fluid.A6 cells were extracted with RIPA buffer: 10 mmNaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, supplemented with 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.2). After clearing of cellular debris, standardization of total protein, and addition of sample buffer (containing 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 20 mmdithiothreotol), lysates were boiled at 85 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gels) and subsequently electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis was performed using standard techniques and appropriate antibodies (see below). 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% dried milk (Carnation) were used as blocking agents. All secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugates were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Western blots were developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified with densitometric scanning using Sigmagel (Jandel Scientific). When possible, the flood configuration was used to measure band density.Protein kinase C was detected with the commercially available antibody PKC (MC5) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech. (Santa Cruz, CA). This antibody identifies α, β, and γ isoforms of PKC. The anti-γ-xENaC antibody used in this study was a kind gift from John P. Johnson (Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). This affinity purified, polyclonal antibody, developed against Xenopus laevis γENaC (residues 608–660) in chicken, has been described previously (19Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

The polyclonal anti-αENaC antibody used in this study was raised in rabbit (by Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) against residues 137–161 of X. laevis αENaC linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through an amino-terminal cysteine. Antiserum was subsequently affinity purified against inoculating immunogen using standard protocols to produce the final anti-αENaC antibody, AB586. Development and use of this antibody has been described previously (6Middleton, P., Al-Khalili, O. K., Yue, G., Zuckerman, J. B., Kleyman, T. R., and Eaton, D. C. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). This antibody specifically recognizes a membrane protein of appropriate size (85–90 kDa), as well as in vitro translated αENaC. The polyclonal anti-βENaC antibody used in this study was developed with a similar procedure. The anti-βENaC antibody (AB592) was against residues 624–647 of β-xENaC. Affinity purified AB592 specifically recognizes an intrinsic membrane protein of appropriate size (90–95 kDa) and in vitro translated βENaC. These three anti-ENaC subunit-specific antibodies have no detectable, inappropriate cross-reactivity with other subunits.All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), or Bio-Rad unless indicated otherwise. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 4α-PMA were prepared fresh in Me2SO prior to each experiment. Final concentrations of Me2SO never exceeded 0.05% and were without effect when applied alone. For time course experiments, PMA was replenished for the longer time points every 24 h.Data are reported as the means ± S.E. The t test and a one-way analysis of variance plus the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to compare data where appropriate. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Changes in relative protein levels and electrical parameters were fit using least squares nonlinear minimization (SigmaPlot 5.0, San Rafael, CA). Decreases were fit to a single exponential of the form f(t) =e−t/τ; increases were fit to a function of the form f(t) = (1 −e−t/τ)n wheret is time, τ is the time constant, and n is a factor that is a measure of the delay before an increase occurs.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA6 cells are models of the principal cell frequently used for the study of regulated Na+ reabsorption. These cells have been specifically used for investigating the contribution and modulation of ENaC during transport. A6 cell signal transduction and electrophysiological properties are believed to be similar to those of mammalian collecting duct principal cells. A6 cells express the epithelial Na+ channel in the luminal membrane with the this channel's gating kinetics and number influenced by cortico-steroids (2Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Verrey F. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Ling B.N. Kemendy A.E. Kokko K.E. Hinton C.F. Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 99: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used the A6 cell line to investigate the regulation of ENaC subunit levels by protein kinase C. We show directly for the first time with ENaC subunit-specific antibodies that activation of PKC with PMA results in a decrease in γ and β but not αENaC protein levels; γENaC decreased prior to βENaC. PKC also decreased Na+reabsorption. Decreases in subunit levels and transport in response to PMA were reduced or eliminated with PKC inhibitors. Our results are consistent with activation of PKC resulting in long term (>4 h) depression of β and γENaC levels leading, in part, to a sustained (up to 48 h) decrease in Na+ reabsorption.The Western blot analysis in Fig. 1 is consistent with A6 cells expressing all three ENaC subunits: α, β, and γ. It is well documented both biochemically and electrophysiologically that A6 cells contain typical, fully functional (heteromultimeric) ENaC (2Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Verrey F. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Ling B.N. Kemendy A.E. Kokko K.E. Hinton C.F. Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 99: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In fact, the cDNAs encoding these subunits have been cloned from A6 cells (20Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly for the current study, results in Fig. 1 show that we have antibodies that specifically recognize each of the ENaC subunits.For Western blot analysis (representative blots shown in Fig. 1), each lane within a gel contained lysate with the same amount of total protein (∼80 μg). The blots of A and C in Fig. 1 were probed with anti-αENaC antibody AB586 and anti-βENaC antibody AB592, respectively. The first andthird lanes in these blots contained lysate harvested form A6 cells serum and aldosterone starved for >72 h (−). Thesecond and fourth lanes (+) had lysate from cells treated with aldosterone for >72 h. The right two lanes (+pep) of A and C were probed with antibody preabsorbed with 0.1 mg/ml of the respective immunogens. The top blot of B was probed with AB586. This blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-γ-xENaC (lower blot of B, where − and + have the same meaning). The effects of aldosterone on α and γENaC in A6 cells were inconsistent with steroid clearly increasing αENaC in two of four experiments (an increase is shown in A, and no effect is shown in the top blot of B) and increasing γENaC in one of four experiments (refer to bottom blot of B). In contrast, long term exposure to aldosterone (1.5 μm; ≥ 72 h), as shown by the Western blot of C and summarized in D, consistently and significantly increased βENaC 20.8 ± 5.5-fold (seven of seven experiments). For all experiments, aldosterone-treated cells had significantly more Na+ transport. These blots suggest interesting characteristics for ENaC subunits in A6 cells: 1) the relative molecular weight of subunits are α < γ < β and 2) β and possibly α are often observed as doublets perhaps indicating glycosylation. Both subunits contain putative glycosylation sites and previously have been reported to be glycosylated (5Masilamani S. Kim G.h Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 6Middleton, P., Al-Khalili, O. K., Yue, G., Zuckerman, J. B., Kleyman, T. R., and Eaton, D. C. (2000) Am. J.

Moreover, β but neither γ nor αENaC subunit levels correlated well with the actions of aldosterone to increase transport suggesting that βENaC may be limiting for long term steroid-regulated reabsorption across A6 cells. However, these results are preliminary in this regard, and thus, this notion needs to be investigated further prior to making more definitive statements on this topic.It is well documented in A6 cells that ENaC transcript and protein subunit levels are differentially regulated by aldosterone and other factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Verrey F. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, and 8Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 1 are consistent with findings we have published previously (6Middleton, P., Al-Khalili, O. K., Yue, G., Zuckerman, J. B., Kleyman, T. R., and Eaton, D. C. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar) showing that β (detected with an antibody distinct from the one used in the current study) but not α and γENaC protein levels are reproducibly increased in response to long term administration of aldosterone. Similarly, J. P. Johnson and colleagues 2J. P. Johnson, M. D. Rokaw, and R. S. Edinger, personal communication. also find in A6 cells that β but not α and γENaC protein is increased by aldosterone. It is unclear why these results differ from those of Mayet al. (21May A. Puoti A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in A6 cells and Masilamani et al. (5Masilamani S. Kim G.h Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) in rat collecting duct principal cells showing that only αENaC is consistently increased in response to aldosterone. Nonetheless, our antibodies, as well as those of others, are useful tools for studying the regulation of ENaC subunit protein levels.Although PKC is known to decrease ENaC activity (reviewed in Refs. 9Duchatelle P.

Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the direct actions of PKC on ENaC subunit levels has not been investigated. In addition, a temporal correlation between PKC effects on ENaC subunit levels and Na+ reabsorption has not been established. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that PKC differentially regulates ENaC subunit levels and also temporally correlated effects on subunit levels with changes in transport.The representative Western blots of Fig.2 A show that γ (bottom blot) and β (middle blot) but not αENaC (top blot) levels are decreased within 24 h in response to PMA (100 ng/ml) activation of PKC. This effect was not observed with inactive phorbol ester (4α-PMA; 100 ng/ml). The Western blots and bar graph of Fig. 2 (B and C) summarize the actions of PMA at differing concentrations on β and γENaC subunit levels after 24 h (n = 3). Neither PMA (100 ng/ml) nor 4α-PMA affected αENaC with relative (to time 0) levels being 1.0 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.1 before treatment and 0.9 ± 0.1 (n = 5) and 0.9 ± 0.1 (n = 2) after 24 h of treatment, respectively. In contrast, PMA (100 ng/ml) decreased βENaC levels from 1.0 ± 0.03 to 0.4 ± 0.04 (n = 10) and γENaC levels from 1.0 ± 0.02 to 0.2 ± 0.02 (n = 8). 4α-PMA did not affect either γ (relative density at 24 h was 0.9 ± 0.03;n = 3) or βENaC levels (relative density at 24 h was 1.2 ± 0.1; n = 5). Note that 10 but not 0.1 ng/ml PMA decreased β and γENaC levels. The dose response of PMA on Na+ transport (measured after 24 h.) is summarized in Fig. 2 D. Relative transport in the absence of PMA and in the presence of PMA at 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.001 ng/ml were 0.95 ± 0.04, 0.05 ± 0.01, 0.70 ± 0.06, 0.79 ± 0.06, 1.1 ± 0.06, and 1.1 ± 0.05 (n = 6), respectively. These results show that PKC differentially regulates ENaC subunits levels. The mechanism by which PKC decreases γ and βENaC protein levels remains to be determined.Figure 2PMA decreases the levels of β and γ but not α ENaC. A, top,middle, and bottom blots probed with AB586, AB592, and anti-γ-xENaC, respectively.

(7Zentner M.D. Lin H.h Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in which PKC was found only to decrease αENaC transcript levels in this latter study. Also in this latter study, preliminary evidence was provided that PKC effects on αENaC transcript levels translated into decreased subunit protein expression. Thus, even though they have not directly examined subunit protein levels, it seems likely that there is a difference in the response to PMA of salivary gland cells and A6 cells. There are many possible explanations of the difference. The simplest would be that the complement of transcription factors present in salivary cells and A6 cells is different and that, therefore, regulation of gene expression is different. A second simple possibility is that the signaling pathways activated by PMA are different in the two cell types so that the relative activation of different transcription factors would be different. Interestingly, the time course of PKC action on ENaC subunits agrees with the results of Zentner et al. (7Zentner M.D. Lin H.h Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, more research is necessary to understand the regulation of ENaC subunits in different epithelia.Fig. 3 shows the time course of PMA actions on ENaC subunit and PKC levels. The representative blots of Fig. 3 (A–C) show that although αENaC levels (A) are not effected by PMA (100 ng/ml) for up to 96 h, βENaC (B) and γENaC (C) levels decrease prior to 24 h after activation of PKC. Both β and γENaC increase toward pretreatment levels 72 h after PMA addition. PMA also decreased PKC levels beginning 2–3 h after addition. PKC levels remained substantially depressed throughout the course of these experiments (n = 6). In contrast, 4α-PMA had no effect on PKC levels between 0–96 h (n = 4; not shown). These findings show that PMA addition to A6 cells does in fact activate PKC because phorbol activation of PKC is well known to cause self-inhibition via a cellular negative feedback loop resulting in decreased kinase expression.Figure 3Temporal effects of PMA on PKC and ENaC protein subunit levels. A, typical blots probed with AB586. Lysate was extracted from cells after the indicated PMA (100 ng/ml; 162 nm) treatment time. αENaC did not consistently decrease in response to PMA. B, typical blots probed with AB592. Numbers indicate in hours the time cells were treated with PMA. βENaC consistently decreased with the decrease reaching maximal by 24 h. Note that by 96 h βENaC levels tended toward pretreatment levels. C, typical blots probed with anti-γ-xENaC antibody. γENaC levels begin to decrease soon after PMA treatment with decrease reaching a maximum by 8 h. After 48 h of sustained PMA addition γENaC tended toward pretreatment levels. D, typical blots probed with anti-PKC antibody. PMA treatment leads to a decline in PKC levels within 2 h with maximal decline by 48 h. PKC levels remained suppressed in the presence of chronic PMA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of PMA on ENaC subunit levels (A) and calculated current (B), and trans-monolayer resistances (C) and voltages (D) are summarized in Fig.4. The mean ± S.E. (n ≥ 3) describing the relative (compared with time 0) density of each subunit at the indicated times are shown with the short dashed (●), long-dashed (○), and solid (▿) regression lines fitting α, β, and γENaC, respectively. γENaC begins to decrease soon after PMA addition with a time constant of 3.7 ± 1.0 h. The decrease in βENaC levels is described by a time constant of 13.9 ± 3.0 h. The change in αENaC over 96 h was not significantly different from that at time 0 (p < 0.01). 4α-PMA had no effect on α, β, and γENaC levels at any time point (times detected = 2, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h; not shown). The decrease in both γ and βENaC were fit best by a single exponential, suggesting that PMA had only one major effect on ENaC protein levels. Currently, it is unclear whether the action of PMA results in a decreased subunit expression or increased subunit degradation. In the continued presence of PMA, presumably because of self-inhibition of PKC, β and γENaC subunits levels began to return to pretreatment levels after 24–48 h (with time constants of 32 ± 8.1 and 52 ± 10 h for β and γENaC, respectively, which are not statistically different from one another;p = 0.128). The levels of γ and βENaC at 96 h were significantly greater then the levels of these subunits at 24 h. Importantly, the increase toward pretreatment levels for γ and βENaC after 48 h demonstrate the reversibility of PKC actions on subunit levels. It is unclear why there is an extended lag time after PKC self-inhibition prior to β and γENaC levels returning toward pretreatment values. This observation needs to be more carefully examined but suggests some prolonged suppression of ENaC levels that is first triggered by PKC and then sustained after kinase down-regulation. Alternatively, the results imply that ENaC synthesis is quite slow.Figure 4Summary graphs showing the time course of PMA decreases on relative ENaC protein subunit levels, calculated Na+ current, and trans-monolayer voltages and resistances.

We have over-expressed Ets1 as a tagged protein in brain capillary endothelial cells and in 3T3 fibroblasts using a retroviral vector. Over-expression of Ets1 reduced by nearly half cell density at confluence of endothelials but not of fibroblasts. As density at confluence is controlled in part by cadherins, this growth arrest could be due to the up-regulation of these cell contact molecules. Indeed, Ets1 increased the expression of the endothelial-specific VE-cadherin without affecting N-cadherin expression levels. In parallel, both a dominant negative mutant of Ets members and an Ets1 anti-sense oligonucleotide inhibited VE-cadherin expression in endothelial cells. Ets1 bound to two Ets-binding sites located in the proximal region of the VE-cadherin promoter. Mutation of these sites abolished Ets1-induced transactivation of the promoter. The present work is the first demonstration of a function of Ets1 in the regulation of a specific endothelial marker based on its endogenous gene and protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2078901357,"Signal transduction via protein kinase C (PKC) is closely regulated by its subcellular localization. In response to activation of cell-surface receptors, PKC is directed to the plasma membrane by two membrane-targeting domains, namely the C1 and C2 regions. This is followed by the return of the enzyme to the cytoplasm, a process shown recently to require PKC autophosphorylation (Feng, X., and Hannun, Y. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 26870–26874). In the present study, we examined mechanisms of translocation and reverse translocation and the role of autophosphorylation in these processes. By visualizing the trafficking of wild-type as well as mutant PKCβII in live cells, we demonstrated that in response to cell-surface receptor activation, the function of the C1 region is required but not sufficient for recruitment of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. The C2 region is also critical in anchoring the enzyme to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the inability of a kinase-deficient PKC to undergo reverse translocation was restored by the addition of intracellular calcium chelators, suggesting a role for the C2 region in the persistent phase of translocation. On the other hand, the inability of a C2 deletion mutant (C1 region intact) to translocate in response to agonist was reversed in mutants lacking kinase activity or by mutation of the Ser660autophosphorylation site to alanine, suggesting that autophosphorylation of this site is required for opposing the action of the C2 region. Therefore, the membrane-targeting function of the C1 region is facilitated by the C2 region and appears to be opposed by autophosphorylation. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence of the functional regulation of reversible PKC membrane localization by autophosphorylation, and they show that the dynamic translocation of PKC in response to agonists is tightly regulated in a collaborative fashion by the C1 and C2 regions in balance with the effects of autophosphorylation.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). Members of the PKC family are involved in transducing a large variety of signals, including those from cell-surface receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. These receptors trigger the activation of phospholipase C, which, upon activation, leads to the generation of two important second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate. Inositol trisphosphate elevates intracellular Ca2+ by binding to its intracellular receptors (1.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 2.Kater L.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17236-17242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased intracellular Ca2+ and membrane DAG promote the trafficking of PKC to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation (1.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 4.Farrar W.L. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). By catalyzing phosphorylation of various substrates, PKC has been shown to play important roles in a diverse variety of biological processes, including cytoskeletal function, secretion, cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression (1.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 5.Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical and immunocytochemical studies have indicated that the biological activity of PKC is intimately regulated by its subcellular localization (7.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 8.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). By localizing to specific subcellular locations, PKC effectively responds to its physiological activators such as membrane lipids and gains access to its specific substrates. Activation of the plasma membrane receptor triggers the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, resulting from changes in the cellular levels and intracellular localization of Ca2+ and DAG. This is mediated by the amino-terminal regulatory domain in classic PKCs (i.e. PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ), which contains an autoinhibitory sequence (i.e. the pseudosubstrate in the V1 region) and two membrane-targeting protein modules, namely the C1 and C2 regions (see Fig. 1) (9.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The C1 region contains the binding site for DAG in a phosphatidylserine-dependent mechanism, whereas the C2 region interacts with anionic phospholipids whose binding is allosterically facilitated by the association of Ca2+ with the same region. The interaction of PKC with Ca2+ results in the displacement of the pseudosubstrate in the V1 region from the enzyme catalytic domain, relieving autoinhibition (10.Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It is believed that the C1 and C2 regions, in the presence of Ca2+, DAG, and other membrane components, provide membrane-binding sites with very high affinity that recruit the enzyme to the plasma membrane and allow for the maximal activation of PKC (11.Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the detailed molecular events that lead to PKC membrane mobilization in response to cell-surface receptor activation have not been fully understood. In particular, it is not clear what specific role the C1 and C2 regions each play in this process. Increasing lines of evidence support that the phosphorylation of PKC itself is critical for the regulation of its cellular distribution and enzymatic activity (7.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 12.Edwards A. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that PKC is phosphorylated at multiple serine/threonine sites during its biogenesis (13.Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the case of PKCβII, three major in vivo phosphorylation sites, Thr500, Thr641, and Ser660, have been identified (15.Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16.Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The inability of PKCβII itself to phosphorylate at Thr500 has suggested that the phosphorylation of this residue involves a protein kinase distinct from PKC (18.Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Thr641 and Ser660 are identified as the residues that are sequentially autophosphorylated following phosphorylation of Thr500 during PKC maturation (16.Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of PKC has been shown to regulate the enzyme regulatory and catalytic domains by enhancing their binding affinity for Ca2+ and ATP, as well as peptide substrates (19.Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown to be important for PKC dynamic cellular trafficking, probably by enhancing reverse translocation (20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, like DAG, Ca2+, and many other lipid mediators, autophosphorylation provides another effective way to regulate the activity and localization of PKC, but at the level of the enzyme itself. In previous studies, by visualizing real time cellular trafficking of PKCβII conjugated to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in live cells, we showed that PKC undergoes a dynamic and reversible redistribution between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm in response to physiological stimuli such as activation of cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (21.Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Shortly after its membrane translocation, PKC dissociates from the plasma membrane and rapidly returns to the cytoplasm. This is different from the effects of phorbol esters such as PMA or Ca2+ ionophores such as A23187, which promote a stable association of PKC with the membrane (21.Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22.Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that the autophosphorylation activity of PKC is essential for its membrane dissociation and therefore plays a key role in the reversible translocation of PKC in response to GPCR activation (20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we address how PKC autophosphorylation interacts with membrane targeting through the C1 and C2 regions to achieve a balanced and dynamic movement of PKC in live cells upon activation of the Gqα-coupled angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR). Our results support that the GPCR-promoted PKC membrane trafficking consists of at least three distinct steps,i.e. membrane recruitment, membrane anchorage, and membrane dissociation. The C1 and probably the C2 regions are required for recruiting PKC to the plasma membrane upon receptor stimulation. The C2 region then persistently anchors the enzyme to the membrane. When extracellular signals are turned off, the enzyme returns to the cytoplasm, a process dependent on the autophosphorylation status of PKC. Therefore, although each plays a specific role, the functions of the C1 and C2 regions and autophosphorylation are cooperative and interactive, thus ensuring appropriate timing, duration, and magnitude of dynamic PKC trafficking.

All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. pBK-CMV-GFP-PKCβII, pBK-CMV-GFP-S660A, and pBK-CMV-GFP-K371R were constructed as described previously (20.Feng X.

Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). pBK-CMV-GFP-ΔC2 and pBK-CMV-GFP-KR/ΔC2 were constructed from pBK-CMV-GFP-PKCβII and pBK-CMV-GFP-K371R, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction to remove 80 amino acids from Lys173 to Arg252. The autophosphorylation mutants (pBK-CMV-ΔC2/SA and pBK-CMV-ΔC2/SE) were generated from pBK-CMV-ΔC2 by polymerase chain reaction to mutate TAA (Ser660) to either GCC (Ala) or GAA (Glu) (see Fig. 1). The DNA sequences of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method with 1–5 μg of plasmids. The expression of the hemagglutinin-tagged AT1AR in the presence of wild-type or various mutant GFP-PKCβII constructs was assessed by flow cytometry following antibody staining. The levels of the AT1AR in cells transfected with various mutant GFP-PKCβII constructs were either equivalent to or higher than that in the presence of wild-type GFP-PKCβII. For assaying PKC activity in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant GFP-PKCβII, the cell lysates (200 μg) were first immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-PKCβII antibody. The immunoprecipitation was performed 48 h after transfection as described previously (21.Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The PKC autophosphorylation activity was assessed using the vesicle assay for PKC as described previously (26.Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP-PKCβII and its mutants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-phospho-PKCβ(Ser660) (1:1000) and/or anti-PKCβII (1:2000) antibody and exposed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK 293 cells were transfected with GFP-PKCβII or one of its mutants together with the AT1AR. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Mattek Corp.) at a density of 4 × 105 and incubated for another 24 h for the cells to attach to glass. The cells expressing GFP-PKCβII or its mutants were observed by confocal microscopy, which was performed on a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 40× 1.2 NA water immersion lens. The cells were at room temperature in culture medium containing 20 mm HEPES. GFP fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using the Zeiss LSM software time series function with single line excitation (488 nm) with a time interval of 20 or 60 s between two scannings. Angiotensin II, A23187, PMA, and EGTA/BAPTA-AM were applied to the cells during the scannings. Quantitative analysis of relative fluorescence intensity was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. The relative change in plasma membrane fluorescence intensity was calculated according to a previously reported method (27.Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, from a series of images recorded before and after angiotensin II stimulation, line intensity profiles across each cell were determined. The relative fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane was calculated by the formula (I mb −I cyt)/I cyt, whereI mb is the amplitude of the fluorescence signal on the plasma membrane and I cyt is the average cytosolic fluorescent intensity. Previously, we showed that GFP-PKCβII is fully functional in terms of its kinase activity and its ability to undergo membrane translocation (21.Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, the inherent fluorescence of GFP allowed us to visualize the trafficking of GFP-PKCβII in live HEK 293 cells and to demonstrate that autophosphorylation is essential for the reversibility of PKC membrane translocation in response to GPCR activation (20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of autophosphorylation in association with the membrane-targeting function of the C1 and C2 regions in the dynamic translocation of PKC, a series of GFP-PKCβII mutants were constructed (Fig. 1), and their trafficking properties were studied in live HEK 293 cells. Initial experiments examined the effects of the C1 region mutation on PKC membrane translocation by altering two essential Cys residues in the two cysteine-rich motifs of the C1 region to Ser (Fig. 1). This C1 region mutant (i.e. GFP-mC1), similar to wild-type GFP-PKCβII, was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm under normal unstimulated conditions (Fig.2 A). Consistent with the role of the cysteine-rich motifs of the C1 region in DAG binding, the GFP-mC1 mutant lost the ability to translocate to the plasma membrane upon stimulation by 1 μm PMA, a phorbol ester commonly used to mimic the action of DAG in targeting PKC to the membrane, but with higher affinity and longer effects (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, GFP-mC1 underwent substantial membrane translocation in response to 10 μm A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore that causes a maximal increase in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, indicating that the C2 region remained functional in its ability to associate with the membrane (Fig. 2 A). As a control, under parallel conditions, wild-type GFP-PKCβII responded to both PMA and A23187 (Fig. 2 A). To further explore the function of the C1 region in the reversible membrane trafficking of PKC in response to physiological stimuli, GFP-mC1 localization was examined in HEK 293 cells in response to activation of cotransfected AT1AR by its physiological agonist angiotensin II. GFP-mC1 was found to lack the ability to undergo membrane redistribution in response to angiotensin II (Fig. 2 B), whereas wild-type GFP-PKCβII underwent a rapid and reversible membrane translocation. When quantitated, >90% of GFP fluorescence from wild-type GFP-PKCβII was translocated to the plasma membrane and subsequently returned to the cytoplasm within 100 s of agonist stimulation. In contrast, there was no significant agonist-dependent increase in membrane fluorescence intensity in cells expressing GFP-mC1 (Fig. 2 C). As the C2 region of GFP-mC1 was functional (Fig.2 A), the inability of GFP-mC1 to traffic to the plasma membrane suggests that the C1 region is essential for PKC targeting to the plasma membrane following receptor activation and that the C2 region is not sufficient for membrane translocation in response to physiological agonist. To exclude the possibility that the inability to observe GFP-mC1 mobilization is due to the masking of membrane translocation by very rapid membrane dissociation, we examined the distribution of a kinase-deficient GFP-mC1 mutant (namely GFP-KR/mC1) because loss of kinase activity prevents membrane dissociation in the wild-type enzyme and therefore would serve to trap any translocated enzyme at the plasma membrane (20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GFP-KR/mC1 was generated from the previously described GFP-K371R (20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Converting the conserved Lys at the enzyme ATP-binding site to Arg completely abolishes the ability of PKC to autophosphorylate. Similar to GFP-mC1, when transfected in HEK 293 cells, GFP-KR/mC1 was found mainly in the cytoplasm, and its redistribution to the membrane was induced only by the Ca2+ionophore A23187, but not by PMA (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, when examined in HEK 293 cells cotransfected with the AT1AR and stimulated with angiotensin II, like GFP-mC1, no significant membrane redistribution of GFP-KR/mC1 was observed (Fig. 2,B and C). These results further confirm that the failure of GFP-mC1 and GFP-KR/mC1 to redistribute to the membrane is due to the inability of their C1 regions to respond to DAG. The inability of these mutants to trigger PKC membrane localization indicates that the recruitment of PKC to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation requires the function of the C1 region. To investigate the possible function of the C2 region in the transient PKC membrane redistribution stimulated by receptor activation, two C2 deletion mutants (GFP-ΔC2 and GFP-KR/ΔC2) were generated by removing 80 amino acids from the C2 regions of wild-type GFP-PKCβII and the kinase-deficient mutant GFP-K371R, respectively. In the unstimulated HEK 293 cells, similar to wild-type GFP-PKCβII, GFP-ΔC2 and GFP-KR/ΔC2 distributed mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig.3). Stimulation with 1 μmPMA induced a membrane redistribution of both GFP-ΔC2 and GFP-KR/ΔC2, whereas 10 μm A23187 failed to trigger redistribution of the two mutants (Fig. 3). This indicates that the C1 regions, but not the C2 regions, in GFP-ΔC2 and GFP-KR/ΔC2 are functional. Consistent with a role of the C2 region in membrane anchoring, upon deletion of the C2 region from wild-type GFP-PKCβII, the resulting mutant (GFP-ΔC2) demonstrated a dramatic decrease in its ability to undergo membrane translocation in response to angiotensin II compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig.4 A). Only very weak membrane highlightings were observed in some cells (Fig. 4 A,arrows). These results are quantitated in Fig.4 B. Therefore, similar to the C1 region, the C2 region is necessary but not sufficient for translocation of PKC in response to agonists. A major difference between the C1 and C2 regions became apparent when the interaction of these regions with the kinase activity of the enzyme was investigated. Upon agonist stimulation of HEK 293 cells cotransfected with the AT1AR, GFP-KR/ΔC2 was observed to translocate rapidly to the plasma membrane within 40 s (Fig.4 A). However, unlike GFP-K371R, which remained on the membrane, GFP-KR/ΔC2 returned to the cytoplasm within ∼1 min following its membrane translocation (Fig. 4 A). The difference between the two mutants was further quantitated by changes in the membrane fluorescence intensity as a function of agonist exposure time (Fig. 4 B). Significantly, 120 s after stimulation by receptor agonist, >90% of GFP-KR/ΔC2 fluorescence was found to return to the cytoplasm, whereas >90% of GFP-K371R remained on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the GFP-KR/ΔC2 mutant behaved similar to the wild-type enzyme and unlike the KR/mC1 mutant. These results suggested an important role for the kinase activity of the ΔC2 mutant. Therefore, it became important to demonstrate that PKCβII mutants lacking the C2 region were capable of undergoing autophosphorylation. GFP-PKCβII and GFP-ΔC2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCβII polyclonal antibody from HEK 293 cells overexpressing these two proteins, and their autophosphorylation activities were assessed. Using an in vitro protein kinase assay, it was found that similar to the wild-type enzyme, GFP-ΔC2 was capable of autophosphorylation (Fig.5 A). More important, when thein vivo autophosphorylation status of the kinases was assessed using anti-phospho-PKCβ(Ser660) antibody, which is specific for phosphorylated Ser660, a conserved PKC autophosphorylation site (15.Tsutakawa S.E.

Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), both wild-type GFP-PKCβII and GFP-ΔC2 were found to be phosphorylated to a similar extent at Ser660 (Fig. 5 B), further indicating that GFP-ΔC2 retains the ability to autophosphorylate in cells. On the other hand, only little Ser660 phosphorylation was detected in cells overexpressing GFP-K371R proteins (Fig. 5 B), a PKCβII mutant deficient in autophosphorylation (17.Benn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20.Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, as expected from the nature of the antibody, anti-phospho-PKCβ(Ser660) antibody also failed to detect the mutant GFP-S660A, in which Ser660 was converted to Ala (data not shown). Therefore, the deletion of the C2 region does not interfere with the ability of the enzyme to autophosphorylate. Given that GFP-KR/ΔC2 behaves, more or less, similar to the wild-type enzyme, the deletion of the C2 region therefore appears to negate the effects of lack of kinase activity on reversal of translocation, strongly suggesting opposing roles for the C2 region and kinase activity in the regulation of translocation. It is important to note that the kinase-deficient C1 mutant did not show this behavior (Fig. 2). Therefore, this additional role for the C2 region in the regulation of membrane association was only revealed by comparing the different abilities of GFP-K371R, GFP-KR/mC1, and GFP-KR/ΔC2 to be retained on the plasma membrane following AT1AR-mediated membrane translocation. Given the role of the kinase activity in reversal of membrane translocation and the above results on the opposing effects of the C2 region and the kinase activity, these results suggest a role for the C2 region in anchoring translocated PKC to the plasma membrane, resulting in the persistent membrane localization of PKC in the absence of autophosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, the function of the C2 region was further evaluated by adding the Ca2+ chelators E"

Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). When grown in a monolayer and treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA), P19 cells undergo differentiation along endodermal and mesodermal pathways (19.Roguska M.A. Gudas L.J. J. Biol.

When treated with low (1–10 nm) concentrations of tRA, P19 cell aggregates differentiate primarily via the endodermal pathway, while high concentrations (>300 nm) of this retinoid induce differentiation into neurons, glial, and fibroblast-like cells (20.Jones-Villeneuve E.M.

In contrast to the retinoid signals, which are generally anti-proliferative and promote cellular differentiation, signaling by members of the Ras superfamily of small guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins typically promote cellular proliferation, alteration in cellular morphology, or changes in vesicular trafficking pathways (22.Moss J.

Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), attempts were made to analyze the cellular consequences of overexpression of these proteins on the function of the Golgi apparatus. Monier and co-workers (36.Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of ARNO (cytohesin-2) leads to a disassembly of the Golgi complex in transfected HeLa cells, a phenomenon that has also been observed upon treatment of cells with BFA (34.Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed in BHK-21 cells upon overexpression of ARNO3, the human homologue of GRP1 (37.Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, endogenous ARNO does not cofractionate with Golgi membranes, but rather does so with plasma membrane markers (38.Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ARNO colocalizes at the cell periphery with ARF6 in transfected cells (38.Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In a later study, ARNO was demonstrated to function as a GEF for ARF6 in transfected HeLa cells as evidenced by its ability to induce remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (39.Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a known function of ARF6 (23.Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar results implicating GRP1 as a GEF for ARF6 were obtained by other laboratories (40.Clodi M. Vollenweider P.

With the aim of identifying potential target genes that mediate the effects of tRA on induction of cellular differentiation, we isolated cDNAs corresponding to differentially expressed mRNAs from P19 cells treated with tRA. We report herein the cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel gene that is induced by tRA in P19 cells. GRASP is strongly up-regulated by tRA in P19 cells and the protein encoded by this gene displays a plasma membrane localization. GRP1 was isolated as a GRASP interaction partner and GRASP was shown to colocalize with both GRP1 and ARFs at the plasma membrane of transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Coexpression of GRASP and GRP1 resulted in an increased partitioning of GRP1 into the particulate fraction of cells suggesting that the two proteins are part of a stable complex at the plasma membrane. The presence of putative protein-protein interaction motifs within GRASP is highly suggestive that GRASP may function as an adaptor or scaffolding protein. We propose that GRASP may aid in the localization of GRP1 to discrete signaling networks and facilitate stimulation of ARF-mediated events at the plasma membrane. P19 cells were cultured and treated with tRA essentially as described (42.Berg R. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (43.Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Lee S.H. Dowell P. Leid M. J. Biol.

Subtractive hybridization was performed as described (45.Bouillet P. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Vicaire S. Garnier J.M. Schuhbaur B. Dolle P. Chambon P. Dev.

Chambon and J.-M. Garnier. Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by two rounds of purification on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Northern analyses, 5–10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a ZetaProbe (Bio-Rad) membrane, and probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragments. Multiple exposures of the blots were used for quantitative densitometric scanning using the MCID Imaging software as described previously (46.Leid M. J. Biol.

Antisera was raised in the goat against purified GST-GRASP by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The anti-GRASP antisera was affinity-purified by passing serum from the immunized goat multiple times over a GST immunosorbent to absorb anti-GST antibodies. The serum was then passed over a GST-GRASP immunosorbent to capture antibodies specific for GRASP, and this column was eluted at low pH. The extent of anti-GST contamination in the affinity-purified ant-GRASP antisera was found to be less than 5%. Twenty-four hours following transfection, HEK293 cells growing on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in two changes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Triton X-100. Antibody incubations were performed using standard techniques with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), anti-GRASP polyclonal antibody, or the monoclonal antibody ID9 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Kahn), which has been reported to recognize all human ARF proteins (48.Cavenagh M.M.

Myc-GRASP immune complexes were detected using fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.). FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat and TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse were used as secondary antibodies for the detection of anti-GRASP and ID9, respectively. Images were captured on a Leica inverted confocal microscope model TCS4D and processed using Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) Cytoplasmic and membrane extracts of HEK293 cell extracts were prepared essentially as described (49.Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of protein from the various extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (46.Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14175-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-Myc (Invitrogen) or anti-GFP (CLONTECH) monoclonal antibodies. For coimmunoprecipitation analysis, HEK293 cells were collected in solubilization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Three hundred micrograms of lysate protein was incubated with the anti-Myc antibody in a volume of 1.5 ml for 30 min at 4 °C, after which a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose (100 μl, 50 mg/ml in solubilization buffer; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C with rotation for an additional 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 1 min at 4 °C) and subsequently washed gently six times with 1.0 ml of solubilization buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Various exposures of the blots were used for quantitative densitometric scanning as described previously (46.Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14175-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of GRASP, a tRA-induced Gene—Subtractive hybridization was used to identify tRA-induced genes in P19 EC cells grown in monolayers. A 2.1-kilobase pair transcript, referred to hereafter as GRASP, was shown to be induced by tRA in a dose-dependent manner by Northern analysis of P19 cells grown in monolayer culture (Fig.1 A, middle panel). As a control, the blot was also probed for RARβ, a gene known to be strongly induced by RA in P19 cells (4.Song S. Siu C.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and for 36B4, which encodes the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, a highly expressed “housekeeping” gene (50.Krowczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that is unresponsive to tRA treatment. Induction of GRASP in the Presence of Cycloheximide—In order to determine if induction of GRASP occurred independently of protein synthesis, mRNA was isolated from P19 cells treated with 1.0 μm tRA in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml; Ref. 51.Obrig T. Culp W. McKeehan W. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed by Northern blotting. GRASP mRNA levels in P19 cells were increased by cycloheximide treatment (Fig.1 B, middle panel, lane 3) and this was further augmented by treatment with tRA (compare lanes 3 and 4 of Fig.1 B), suggesting that at least part of the induction of GRASP expression by tRA in P19 cells did not require protein synthesis. Induction of RARβ by tRA was not attenuated by cycloheximide treatment under these conditions (Fig. 1 B, top panel). Time Course of tRA-induced Expression of GRASP in P19 Cells—Northern analyses were performed to determine the time course of tRA induction of GRASP in P19 cells grown in monolayer and aggregate cultures, as induction of P19 cell differentiation by tRA under these two conditions results in markedly distinct phenotypes (19.Roguska M.A. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13893-13896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20.Jones-Villeneuve E.M. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Induction of GRASP was observed within 2 h of initiation of tRA treatment in both monolayer and aggregate cultures (Fig.1 C, middle panel, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 6 and 7). Growth of P19 cells in aggregates resulted in a higher basal expression of GRASP (2-fold induction) relative to cells grown in monolayer culture (Fig. 1 C,middle panel, compare lanes 1 and6), whereas there was no difference in basal RARβ levels when comparing monolayer and aggregate cultures (Fig. 1 C,top panel, lanes 1 and6, respectively). GRASP transcripts increased gradually following tRA treatment of P19 cells grown in a monolayer, reaching a maximum of 18-fold induction at 24 h (Fig. 1 C,lanes 1–4, middle panel). In contrast, tRA induction of RARβ expression in P19 cells grown in monolayers reached maximal levels at 8 h (56-fold induction) and further induction of this gene was not observed over the remainder of this experiment (Fig. 1 C, top panel). GRASP and RARβ exhibited similar induction patterns of tRA inducibility in P19 cells grown in aggregate culture with the corresponding mRNA levels continuing to increase during the entire 48 h of RA treatment (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6–10). Thus, although RARβ and GRASP both appear to be direct targets of tRA in P19 EC cells, the pattern of inducibility of these two genes is subtly distinct, suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms may exist for one or both genes. GRASP Contains Multiple Sites for Protein-Protein Interactions—The GRASP fragment isolated by subtractive screening was used to isolate a full-length clone from a randomly primed mouse embryo cDNA library. The 1,978-base pair GRASP clone obtained contained an open reading frame encoding a 392-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 42,382 Da. This open reading frame is preceded by a single, in-frame stop codon (nucleotides 35–37) and is followed by a polyadenylation-like motif (nucleotides 1944–1949, Fig.2 A). In addition, the 3′-untranslated region of the GRASP transcript contains an AU-rich cluster (nucleotides 1264–1276) similar to those found in and proposed to account for the very low level expression of many immediate-early genes (52.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 53.Jones T.R. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell.

A data base search revealed that GRASP is a novel gene that displayed very little overall similarity with known sequences. However, analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed that GRASP contains several known protein-protein interaction motifs (see Figs. 2,A and B), including 1) a putative Src homology 3 domain binding site (PXXP) within an alanine/proline-rich region (57.Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), 2) a PDZ domain (see below and Fig. 2 B; Ref.58.Kennedy M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and 3) a leucine-rich region predicted to be α-helical in nature (data not shown). Amino acid alignment of the PDZ domain of GRASP with those of various other proteins (Fig. 2 B) revealed that GRASP exhibited substantial similarity to members of the MAGUK family of proteins (59.Woods D.F.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analyses revealed that GRASP was very highly expressed in brain relative to the other tissues examined, but expression was also detected in lung and heart, and to a lesser extent in embryo (10–12.5 days post coitum), kidney, and ovary (Fig. 2 C). Expression of GRASP was not observed in thymus, spleen, liver, or testis. Subcellular Localization of GRASP in HEK293 Cells—To study the subcellular localization of GRASP in mammalian cells and sequence determinants thereof, constructs encoding Myc epitope-tagged full-length and deletion mutants of GRASP were used to transfect HEK293 cells transiently, and the fusion proteins were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Although GRASP does not harbor predicted membrane-spanning domains, both Myc-GRASP and Myc-GRASP 1–186 appeared to be primarily localized to the plasma membrane (Figs. 3, A andB) but also exhibited a degree of diffuse cytosolic staining. In contrast, Myc-GRASP 189–392, which la"

Recently, human UBC12 was identified as a putative NEDD8 conjugation enzyme (E2). While investigating the in vivo function of UBC12, we found that the point mutant, UBC12(C111S), showed a dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation. This mutant, with a single Cys-to-Ser substitution at the conserved Cys residue in the E2 family, could specifically inhibit NEDD8 conjugation. We observed the dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation to substrates, including the C-terminal fragment of cullin-2 (Cul-2-ΔN), full-length cullin-1, and also other uncharacterized target proteins. Interestingly, UBC12(C111S) formed a heterodimeric conjugate with NEDD8. This conjugate was stable under stringent conditions, including 6 m guanidine HCl, 8 m urea, 2% SDS, or 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that UBC12(C111S) sequesters the NEDD8 monomer by forming a UBC12(C111S)-NEDD8 conjugate and, in turn, inhibits the subsequent transfer of NEDD8 to its targets. To examine the biological role of NEDD8 conjugation, this dominant-negative form of UBC12 was applied to a cell growth assay. Overexpression of UBC12(C111S) led to inhibition of growth in U2OS and HEK293 cells. Thus, this dominant-negative form of UBC12 could be useful in defining the role of NEDD8 modification in other biological systems.

These proteins share a common distinction in which the mature form of proteins is always translated in precursor form, with one or more amino acids following a Gly-Gly dipeptide that forms the C terminus of the mature protein (10.Yeh, E. T. H., Gong, L., and Kamitani, T. (2000) Gene (Amst.), in pressGoogle Scholar). In the NEDD8 conjugation process, the C-terminal tail of the precursor protein is cleaved off by a C-terminal hydrolase, such as UCH-L3 (11.Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem.

The mature form has been shown to conjugate to a large number of nuclear proteins, including the cullin family members (1.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The first step is an ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 leading to the formation of a thioester linkage between Gly-76 of ubiquitin and a Cys residue of E1. Next, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to a Cys residue of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to form another thioester conjugate. Finally, an isopeptide bond is formed between Gly-76 of ubiquitin and a lysyl ε-amino group of a substrate protein. This reaction is catalyzed either directly by the E2 enzyme or via a third enzyme, designated ubiquitin ligase (E3). The pathways of Rub1 and NEDD8 conjugation are also thought to be catalyzed by E1, E2, and E3 in a manner analogous to ubiquitination. In fact, yeast Rub1 conjugation has been shown to require at least three proteins, including Ula1p/Enr2p, Uba3p, and Ubc12p in vivo(3.Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4.Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Ula1p/Enr2p and Uba3p are related to the N- and C-terminal domains of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, respectively, and together fulfill E1-like functions for Rub1 activation. Rub1 conjugation also requires Ubc12p, a protein related to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which functions analogously to E2 enzymes in Rub1-protein conjugate formation (4.Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the mammalian NEDD8 conjugation system, APP-BP1, hUBA3, and hUBC12 have been recently identified as human homologues of Ula1p/Enr2p, Uba3p, and Ubc12p, respectively (12.Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15.Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). APP-BP1 and hUBA3 are homologous to the N- and C-terminal domains of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, respectively. In vitrotranslated hUBA3 has been shown to conjugate to GST-NEDD8 by thioester linkage in the presence of APP-BP1 (12.Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15.Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslated hUBC12 has also been shown to conjugate to GST-NEDD8 by thioester linkage in the presence of both APP-BP1 and hUBA3 (15.Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo functions of these human homologues are still unknown. It has not been shown in vivo that a heterodimeric complex of APP-BP1/hUBA3 has E1-like function in NEDD8 conjugation. Also, hUBC12 has not been shown to function as an E2-like enzyme in vivo. In order to test the function of hUBC12in vivo, we generated and overexpressed mutants of hUBC12 in COS cells. One of the mutants, UBC12(C111S), clearly showed a dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that hUBC12 plays a role of E2 in NEDD8 conjugation in vivo. In this paper, we characterized UBC12(C111S) and investigated the mechanism of its dominant-negative effect. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Mouse mAb 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 16B12 (Covance, Richmond, CA), and rabbit polyclonal HA.11 (Covance) are antibodies to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA of influenza hemagglutinin (HA). Mouse anti-RH (specific for the amino acid sequence RGSHHHH) mAb was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA). Mouse anti-c-myc (specific for the amino acid sequence EQKLISEEDL) mAb, 9E10, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit anti-polyclonal anti-NEDD8 antiserum was generated by immunization with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 20–32 (TDKVERIKERVEE) (1.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Cul-1 (catalog number 71-8700; recognizing human cullin-1) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA). To express proteins tagged with epitope at the N terminus in COS cells, pcDNA3/HA-N (7.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), pcDNA3/3HA-N, pcDNA3/RH-N (1.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), pcDNA3/3RH-N, or pcDNA3/c-myc-N was used as described previously (1.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3/3HA-N or pcDNA3/3RH-N, was constructed by inserting triple-repeated epitope of HA or RH into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). By using pcDNA3/3HA-N or pcDNA3/3RH-N, proteins can be tagged with triple-repeated epitope at their N terminus and expressed in mammalian cells. This system allows us to detect proteins expressed at low level. pcDNA3/c-myc-N was constructed for N-terminal tagging of c-myc epitope. c-myc adaptor duplexes were inserted into pcDNA3 for the construction of pcDNA/c-myc-N. The human cDNA of UBC12, UBA3, UBC9, Cul-2-ΔN (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or Cul-1 (GenBankTM accession number AF062536) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using appropriate primers from human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was carried out by PCR from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). These cDNAs were inserted into plasmid vectors described above. The sequence of each cDNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HA-tagged NEDD8 mutants such as HA-NEDD8(GGGGLRQ), HA-NEDD8(GGGG), HA-NEDD8(GGG), HA-NEDD8(GG), and HA-NEDD8(G) were expressed by plasmids constructed previously (1.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into COS-M6 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were harvested for Western blotting or cobalt precipitation 20 h after transfection. A Cys-to-Ser or Cys-to-Ala substitution was generated in UBC12 at Cys-111 by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (16.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mutant was named as UBC12(C111S) or UBC12(C111A), respectively. By using the same method, a Cys-to-Ser substitution was generated in UBC9 at Cys-93 to make UBC9(C93S) and also in UBA3 at Cys-216 to make UBA3(C216S). In addition to E2 enzymes, Cul-1 was mutated by this method. The Lys-720, which is a NEDD8 conjugation site (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was substituted to Arg to generate Cul-1(K720R). The mutated cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3/RH-N or pcDNA3/c-myc-N. To investigate the conjugation of NEDD8 to Cul-2-ΔN or UBC12(C111S), HA-tagged NEDD8 was co-expressed with RH-tagged Cul-2-ΔN or UBC12(C111S) in COS cells by the co-transfection method. Since the sequence of the RH tag is RGSHHHHHH, RH-tagged protein can be purified by cobalt-immobilized resin beads (TALON beads,CLONTECH) (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The total cell lysate of the transfectants expressing RH-tagged protein and HA-NEDD8 was prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0)). DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle, and then the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C. The supernatant was incubated with TALON beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, followed by washing twice with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mmimidazole, 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0)). Finally, the beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 1 h at 50 °C in sample treating solution containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Western blotting was performed by the protocol of ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (7.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8.Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

As a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The immunoprecipitation method described by Wada et al. (18.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36025-36029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. 5 × 106 COS cells were transfected with empty vector or the plasmid for expression of 3HA-Cul-1, followed by trypsinization 20 h after transfection. Cell pellets were transferred to liquid nitrogen and lysed in 1.25 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The cell lysis was performed for 30 min on ice, and DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were added to 10 μg of mouse anti-HA mAb (12CA5) coupled to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bead suspensions were rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer. The immunoprecipitates were treated with 30 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 μl of solubilized samples were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Then, Western blotting was performed using three different antibodies. Rabbit anti-HA antibody (HA.11) and anti-Cul-1 antibody were used to detect 3HA-tagged Cul-1 derivatives. Rabbit anti-NEDD8 antibody was used to detect 3HA-tagged Cul-1 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8. Naviglio's method (19.Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was modified and performed for this assay. U2OS cells (2.3 × 105) or HEK293 cells (1.0 × 105) were plated in a 6-cm dish and transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) either with 5 μg of control empty pcDNA3 vector, pcDNA3/RH-UBC12(C111S), or pcDNA3/RH-UBC12(wild type). After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418. The medium was changed every 2 days. Ten days after transfection, drug-resistant cells were harvested and counted. The data was statistically analyzed by Fisher's protected least significant difference method. To examine the in vivo function of NEDD8-related enzymes, we first generated two mutants, hUBA3(C216S) and hUBC12(C111S). hUBA3(C216S) has a single Cys-to-Ser substitution at the conserved Cys residue (Cys-216) in the E1 family. Since hUBA3 was a component of the putative E1 enzyme for NEDD8 activation, and its Cys-216 was recently shown to link to NEDD8 by a thioester bond (15.Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), hUBA3(C216S) was expected to be a dominant-negative mutant for the inhibition of the NEDD8 modification pathway. In addition, we generated a mutant, hUBC12(C111S), of putative E2 enzyme for NEDD8 conjugation. hUBC12(C111S) has a single Cys-to-Ser substitution at the conserved Cys residue (Cys-111) in the E2 family. Since hUBC12 appeared to link to NEDD8 via a thioester linkage, hUBC12(C111S) was also expected to show a dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation. By using hUBA3(C216S) and hUBC12(C111S), we examined whether they have a dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 modification. As shown in Fig.1 A, there was no difference in the NEDD8 conjugation pattern between control (lane 2) and UBA3(C216S)-expressing sample (lane 3), indicating that the expression of UBA3(C216S) did not affect NEDD8 conjugation. The expression level of UBA3(C216S), however, was poor in COS cells. This weak expression might be the reason for its ineffectiveness as a dominant-negative mutant. In contrast, the overexpression of UBC12(C111S) inhibited NEDD8 conjugation (lane 4), because bands of NEDD8-conjugated proteins could not be detected except for the reduced band of p90. Interestingly, a prominent ∼33-kDa doublet (indicated by a square bracket) could be detected by both anti-HA mAb (lane 4) and anti-RH mAb (lane 9) in the lysate co-expressing HA-NEDD8 and RH-UBC12(C111S). The doublet was predicted to be a heterodimeric complex, where NEDD8 was bound to UBC12(C111S) by a covalent linkage (see below). This 33-kDa protein was not a complex linked through a thioester bond because it was stable in SDS-treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Although the 33-kDa doublet was detected strongly in lane 4, the HA-NEDD8 monomer was not detected, most likely due to the consumption of NEDD8 monomer in the formation of the 33-kDa complex. Thus, the UBC12(C111S) mutant is extremely useful because it sequesters NEDD8 monomers and prevents the formation of NEDD8 conjugates. We also examined whether UBA3(C216S) could synergize with UBC12(C111S) (lanes 5 and10). No difference could be detected between both samples shown in lanes 4 and 5, suggesting that the overexpression of UBA3(C216S) did not synergize with UBC12(C111S). In order to examine the dominant-negative effect of UBC12 mutant on NEDD8 conjugation in more detail, we generated another point mutant, UBC12(C111A), which has a Cys-to-Ala substitution at residue 111. By using the same method as described above, we estimated the dominant-negative effect. As shown in lane 4 of Fig.1 B, NEDD8-conjugated proteins could be detected above the p90 band, indicating that the overexpression of UBC12(C111A) (lane 4) did not inhibit NEDD8 conjugation as much as UBC12(C111S) (lane 3). The UBC12(C111S) formed a ∼33-kDa doublet (lane 3) but UBC12(C111A) did not, suggesting that the Ser-111 residue in UBC12(C111S) was involved in the generation of the heterodimeric complex NEDD8-UBC12(C111S). Furthermore, this stable conjugation of UBC12(C111S) with NEDD8 might be involved in its dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation. UBC12(C111S) might capture unconjugated NEDD8 molecules and prevent the transfer of NEDD8 molecules to their target proteins. In lanes 4 and 5 of Fig. 1 A andlane 3 of Fig. 1 B, we detected a 33-kDa doublet. When we made the expression plasmid RH-UBC12(C111S), we did not remove the original start codon from UBC12(C111S) cDNA. Since the cDNA of RH-UBC12(C111S) contains two start codons, the expression plasmid generates RH-tagged UBC12(C111S) and untagged UBC12(C111S) in COS cells. In Fig. 1, A and B, we used total cell lysates expressing both RH-tagged UBC12(C111S) and untagged UBC12(C111S). The upper band of the doublet (lanes 4 and5 of Fig. 1 A, lane 3 of Fig. 1 B) is most likely HA-NEDD8 conjugated RH-UBC12(C111S), whereas the lower band is most likely HA-NEDD8-conjugated UBC12(C111S). When HA-NEDD8 was co-expressed with RH-UBC12(C111S) in COS cells, a 33-kDa protein complex was generated (lanes 4 and 9 of Fig. 1 A and lanes 3 and 7 of Fig.1 B). The complex was detected by both antibodies against HA tag and RH tag, implying that the complex was formed from HA-NEDD8 and RH-UBC12(C111S). To prove this hypothesis, the complex was purified by TALON precipitation method and characterized by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2 A, RH-UBC12(C111S) was precipitated as 26-, 31-, and 33-kDa proteins (lane 7). The 26-kDa protein represented RH-UBC12(C111S) unconjugated with HA-NEDD8 because the molecular size was equivalent to RH-UBC12(wild type) (lane 6) and RH-UBC12(C111A) (lane 8). The 33-kDa protein represented RH-UBC12(C111S) conjugated with HA-NEDD8 because it could be detected by anti-HA antibody (lane 3). The 31-kDa protein was most likely RH-UBC12(C111S) conjugated by endogenous NEDD8 from COS cells. This was further supported by the observation that anti-HA could not detect the 31-kDa band (lane 3). In contrast with RH-UBC12(C111S) (lane 3 and7), negative control (lanes 1 and 5), RH-UBC12(wild type) (lanes 2 and 6), and RH-UBC12(C111A) (lanes 4 and 8) did not form any stable complex conjugated with endogenous or HA-tagged NEDD8. The NEDD8-UBC12(C111S) complex was resistant to denaturing conditions, including 6 m guanidine HCl, 8 m urea, and 2% SDS (see “Experimental Procedures”) and also stable under reducing conditions such as 5% β-mercaptoethanol. This stability indicated that the complex was formed by a strong covalent bond but not a thioester linkage. Although UBC12(wild type) and UBC12(C111A) shared a similar amino acid residue with UBC12(C111S) at position 111, they did not form the stable complex with NEDD8. These results suggest that the hydroxyl group of Ser-111 in UBC12(C111S) plays an important role in forming the linkage between UBC12(C111S) and NEDD8. NEDD8 has been shown to utilize its Gly-76 for the thioester linkage with UBC12(wild type) (12.Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It is not known whether NEDD8 also utilizes the same Gly-76 for the conjugation with UBC12(C111S). In order to address this question, RH-UBC12(C111S) was co-expressed in COS cells with wild type or C-terminal deletion mutants of HA-tagged NEDD8. After we confirmed the protein expression level of HA-tagged NEDD8 wild type and mutants in the total cell lysates (upper panel of Fig.2 B), the co-expressed RH-UBC12(C111S) was precipitated from the lysates with TALON beads. Then, the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting to detect RH-UBC12(C111S) conjugated with HA-NEDD8 mutants. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2 B, RH-UBC12(C111S) formed a conjugate with HA-NEDD8(wild type) (lanes 2 and 8), HA-NEDD8(GGGG) (lanes 3 and 9), HA-NEDD8(GGG) (lanes 4 and10), or HA-NEDD8(GG) (lanes 5 and 11), but not with HA-NEDD8(G) (lanes 6 and 12). Thus, Gly-76 of NEDD8 is required for the formation of the conjugate. Taken together, Gly-76 of NEDD8 seems to conjugate to Ser-111 of UBC12(C111S) by covalent bond. In order to examine the dominant-negative effect of UBC12(C111S) on NEDD8 conjugation to a specific substrate, we used the C-terminal 171 amino acids of human cullin-2 (Cul-2-ΔN) that has been shown to be a sufficient substrate for NEDD8 conjugation (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Cul-2-ΔN can be conjugated by NEDD8 much more intensively than full-length Cul-2, even when expressed without promoting proteins for NEDD8 conjugation such as pVHL, elongin B, and elongin C (18.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36025-36029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Liakopoulos D. Buesgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, we first characterized the NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN. When 3RH-tagged Cul-2-ΔN was co-expressed with an empty vector, two protein bands (28-kDa and 34-kDa) could be detected in TALON precipitates by Western blotting using anti-RH mAb (lane 2). The upper 34-kDa band was weakly detected by anti-NEDD8 antiserum, whereas the lower 28-kDa band was not (lane 5). This result indicated that the 28-kDa protein was an unconjugated form of 3RH-Cul-2-ΔN, and the 34-kDa protein was 3RH-Cul-2-ΔN conjugated with endogenous NEDD8 of COS cells. When 3RH-tagged Cul-2-ΔN was co-expressed with 3HA-tagged NEDD8, three protein bands (28, 34, and 39 kDa) could be detected in TALON precipitates by Western blotting using anti-RH mAb (lane 3). The 39-kDa band was detected by both anti-NEDD8 antiserum (lane 6) and anti-HA mAb (lane 9), indicating that it was 3RH-Cul-2-ΔN conjugated with 3HA-NEDD8. By using this NEDD8 conjugation system of Cul-2-ΔN, the dominant-negative effect of UBC12(C111S) was further tested. As shown in upper panel of Fig. 3 B, overexpression of UBC12(C111S) suppressed the generation of 34- and 39-kDa proteins (lane 3). Notably, the 34-kDa protein generation was completely inhibited. In contrast, the generation of these proteins could not be inhibited by control (GFP) (lane 1) or UBC12(wild type) (lane 2). Thus, NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN was inhibited by UBC12(C111S) but not by UBC12(wild type) or GFP. In addition to the dominant-negative effect, we detected conjugates consisting of NEDD8 and UBC12 (lower panel of Fig. 3 B). UBC12(C111S) formed conjugates with endogenous NEDD8 of COS cells and co-expressed 3HA-NEDD8 (lane 3), whereas UBC12(wild type) could not (lane 2). Taken together, UBC12(C111S) inhibited NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN by sequestering NEDD8. To examine the enzymatic specificity of the dominant-negative effect by UBC12(C111S), we tested whether NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN can be inhibited by a mutant of an E2 enzyme for other ubiquitin-like protein. For this purpose, UBC9, a sentrin-conjugating enzyme (21.Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), was applied to the experimental system described above. We generated UBC9(C93S), which has a Cys-to-Ser substitution at the enzymatic active site (Cys-93), and then tested its dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.4 A, UBC9(C93S) did not inhibit NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN (lane 2) as well as UBC9(wild type) (lane 1) or empty vector (lane 3). Also, UBC9(C93S) did not form any conjugates with endogenous NEDD8 or 3HA-tagged NEDD8 in COS cells (lane 2 oflower panel). Thus, the dominant-negative effect on NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2-ΔN was not led by an E2 mutant that catalyzes other ubiquitin-like proteins. In order to show the specificity of dominant-negative effect by UBC12(C111S) in more detail, we examined whether UBC12(C111S) inhibited conjugation between other ubiquitin-like proteins and their substrates. For this purpose, we used sentrin-1 (6.Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.-F. Chang H.-M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P.

As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4 B, UBC12(C111S) (lane 3), as well as GFP (lane 1) and UBC12(wild type) (lane 2), did not inhibit sentrinization of RanGAP1. Also, UBC12(C111S) did not form any conjugates with endogenous sentrin-1 or HA-tagged sentrin-1 in COS cells (lane 3 of lower panel). Finally, we examined whether UBC12(C111S) stably conjugated with ubiquitin or sentrin-1. For this purpose, RH-UBC12(C111S) was co-expressed with 3HA-tagged NEDD8, ubiquitin, or sentrin-1 (Fig.4 C). After we confirmed the expression level of 3HA-tagged proteins in the total cell lysates (upper panel of Fig.4 C), the co-expressed RH-UBC12(C111S) was precipitated from the lysates with TALON beads. Then, the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting to detect RH-UBC12(C111S) conjugated with 3HA-proteins. As shown in the lower panel of Fig.4 C, UBC12(C111S) formed a stable conjugate only with NEDD8 (lanes 4 and 10) but not with ubiquitin (lanes 5 and 11) or sentrin-1 (lanes 6and 12). Thus, UBC12(C111S) forms a conjugate with NEDD8 specifically, and its dominant-negative effect is specific to NEDD8 conjugation system. By using Cul-2-ΔN as a substrate, we showed a dominant-negative effect of UBC12(C111S) on NEDD8 conjugation in Fig. 3 B. Although the dominant-negative inhibition was clear, the substrate was an “artificial” protein. In order to examine the effect on a “natural” substrate, we chose full-length Cul-1 which was recently shown to be conjugated by NEDD8 (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Before testing the dominant-negative effect, we characterized NEDD8 conjugation to full-length Cul-1 by using the same assay system as used in Fig. 3 B. We expressed 3HA-tagged Cul-1 in COS cells, and we purified 3HA-Cul-1 derivatives from the total cell lysate by immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-HA mAb. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-HA antibody and anti-Cul-1 antibody to detect 3HA-Cul-1 derivatives and anti-NEDD8 antibody to detect 3HA-Cul-1 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8. As shown in Fig. 5 A, 80- and 85-kDa proteins were immunoprecipitated clearly (lane 2). By using anti-Cul-1 antibody, we confirmed that these two proteins were Cul-1 derivatives (lane 4). The precipitated 85-kDa protein could be detected by anti-NEDD8 antibody, but the 80-kDa protein could not (lane 6). This result indicated that the 85-kDa protein was 3HA-Cul-1 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8, whereas the 80-kDa protein was an unconjugated form of 3HA-Cul-1. Interestingly, more than 90% of 3HA-Cul-1 was transiently expressed as an unconjugated form (lanes 2, 4 and 6). Next, we tested the dominant-negative effect of UBC12(C111S) on NEDD8 conjugation to full-length Cul-1. As shown in upper panel of Fig. 5 B, overexpression of UBC12(C111S) suppressed the generation of the 85-kDa protein (lane 4). The expression pattern of full-length Cul-1 (lane 4) was almost identical to that of Cul-1(K720R) (lane 5), which has a Lys-to-Arg substitution at the NEDD8 conjugation site (Lys-720) and cannot be conjugated with NEDD8 (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, the generation of the 85-kDa protein could not be inhibited by control (lane 2) or UBC12(wild type) (lane 3). Thus, NEDD8 conjugation to full-length Cul-1 was inhibited by UBC12(C111S) but not by UBC12(wild type) or empty vector expression. In addition, we detected a conjugate consisting of NEDD8 and UBC12 (lower panel of Fig. 5 B). UBC12(C111S) formed a conjugate with endogenous NEDD8 of COS cells (lane 4), whereas UBC12(wild type) could not form any conjugates (lane 3). Taken together, UBC12(C111S) inhibited NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 by sequestering of NEDD8. In this paper, we showed that UBC12(C111S) specifically forms a stable complex with NEDD8 and inhibits NEDD8 conjugation to target proteins such as Cul-2-ΔN, full-length Cul-1, and other uncharacterized proteins. To explain the molecular mechanism of this dominant-negative inhibition, here we propose a potential model. In NEDD8 conjugation, the following pathway was proposed previously (12.Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15.Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). At the initial step, NEDD8 binds to a thiol site in E1 complex (APP-BP1/UBA3). Then, NEDD8 is transferred to a NEDD8 conjugation enzyme, UBC12. The wild type of UBC12 contains a Cys residue at the position 111. The thiol group of Cys-111 is thought to be an acceptor for the transfer of NEDD8, because this Cys residue is conserved in all UBC family members, and this site is the actual acceptor for the ubiquitin transfer in ubiquitination (22.Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the final step, a NEDD8 E3 ligase, such as VBC complex (von Hippel-Lindau protein-elongin B-elongin C) (18.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36025-36029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Liakopoulos D. Buesgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), appears to transfer NEDD8 from the NEDD8-UBC12 conjugate to target proteins. The UBC12 is recycled for the next NEDD8 conjugation after this reaction. In contrast with the wild type, UBC12(C111S) contains a Ser-residue at the same position. The hydroxyl group of Ser-111 might be an acceptor for the transfer of NEDD8 and form a stable ester bond with Gly-76 of NEDD8. This ester bond might be too stable for NEDD8 to be transferred to target proteins by an E3 ligase. Thus, UBC12(C111S) inhibits NEDD8 conjugation to target proteins by sequestering NEDD8. Yu et al. (23.Yu Z.K. Gervais J.L. Zhang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11324-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) showed that human Cul-1 associates with Skp1-Skp2 complex and regulates p21 (CIP1/WAF1) and cyclin D proteins. Feng et al. (24.Feng H. Zhong W. Punkosdy G. Gu S. Zhou L. Seabolt E.K. Kipreos E.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that Cul-2 is required for the G1-to-S phase transition and mitotic chromosome condensation inCaenorhabditis elegans. Cul-3 has also been shown to target cyclin E for ubiquitination and control S phase in mammalian cells (25.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, cullin family members regulate cell cycle transition. Since all human cullins can be conjugated with NEDD8 (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the NEDD8 conjugation may regulate cullin function and control cell cycle transition. To examine this hypothesis, we applied UBC12(C111S) to a cell growth assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the overexpression of UBC12(C111S) caused the inhibition of cell growth in U2OS and HEK293 cells. This result implied that UBC12(C111S) inhibited NEDD8 conjugation to cullins and affected cell cycle transition. NEDD8 conjugation may be required for the biological function of cullins. To date, the biological function of NEDD8 is unknown. However, cullin family members have been identified as target proteins of NEDD8 conjugation. Since cullins form E3 ubiquitin ligase such as SCF (26.Latres E. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M.

Interestingly, the NEDD8 conjugation site has been recently mapped on a Lys residue in its putative nuclear localizing signal sequence of cullins (13.Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The NEDD8 conjugation to cullins might control their nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 6, UBC12(C111S), which sequesters NEDD8 in vivo, will provide a useful tool to investigate these potential biological functions of NEDD8 conjugation. We thank H. P. Nguyen and Dr. T.

https://openalex.org/W2014552752,"One of the common features of cellular response to stress is cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. E2F is one of the key factors which controls cell cycle progression. Overexpression of E2F-1 can also induce apoptosis. In order to understand the role of E2F-1 in cellular response to stress, we studied the E2F-1 response in various cell lines to different types of stress signals including UV irradiation, cisplatin, etoposide and hypoxia. We showed here that the expression level of E2F-1 can be up regulated by the treatment of DNA damage agents as well as hypoxia. The kinetics of E2F-1 increase was dependent on the types of inducer and was similar to that of p53. However, stress signals can induce E2F-1 expression independently of p53 and Rb. Furthermore, the induced E2F-1 was transcriptionally inactive. All these results suggested that E2F-1 may play a very important role in cellular response to stress and this novel role of E2F-1 is independent of its transactivation function."

We have previously demonstrated that NF-κB is activated in neuronal cultures treated with kainic acid or nitric oxide. We show here that kainic acid or nitric oxide also increase the levels of NCAM mRNA and protein in neurons and that this induction of NCAM expression is sensitive to dexamethasone and to antisense, but not missense, oligonucleotides designed to suppress NF-κB synthesis. Nitric oxide also stimulates protein binding to an NF-κB site in the promoter of the NCAM gene. This indicates that NF-κB, which has recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity and also in the etiology of neurodegenerative disease, plays a crucial role in the activity-dependent regulation of NCAM gene expression.

This may at least partially reflect the requirement for durable structural rearrangement of the synapses.

The effects on the dendritic spine reflect actions either on the spine itself or on the post-synaptic density (psd), a specialized structure within the dendritic spine that receives and transduces the neurotransmitter signals from the presynaptic terminal. Although it is likely that these structural changes are necessary to sustain long term functional plasticity, there are few indications as to the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. One possibility is that nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role. In many situations, NO release appears to be necessary for the generation of LTP (7.Böhme G.A. Bon C. Stutzmann J.-M. Doble A.

We have reported that exposure to NO increases dendritic CamKIIα mRNA levels (25.Johnston H.M. Morris B.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 31: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an effect likely to be mediated by post-transcriptional mechanisms acting on CamKII mRNA present in the neuronal dendrites (26.Roberts L.A.

The neuronal cell adhesion molecule NCAM is also present in the psd (28.Persohn E. Pollerberg G.E. Schachner M. J. Comp.

Similarly, inactivation of the NCAM gene in mice results in deficits in spatial learning (37.Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W. Nature. 1994; 367: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and in attenuation of hippocampal LTP (38.Cremer H. Chazal G. Carleton A. Goridis C. Vincent J.-D. Lledo P.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13242-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has recently been discovered that, in an analagous manner to CamKII, the levels of NCAM in dendritic spines and psds are increased after LTP induction (29.Schuster T. Krug M. Hassan H. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that NCAM may also be important for the sustained functional change. This hypothesis is supported, in other models by evidence that NCAM levels are increased after learning behaviors (39.Skibo G.G. Davies H.A. Rusakov D.A. Stewart M.G. Schachner M. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by genetic evidence that theDrosophila homologue of NCAM is involved in the regulation of synaptic structure and function at the neuromuscular junction (40.Schuster C.M. Davis G.W. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and by the modulation of the Aplysia homologue of NCAM during synaptic plasticity (41.Mayford M. Barzilai A. Keller F. Schacher S. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in elevating NCAM expression are likely to be different from the post-transcriptional regulation of CamKII expression, since NCAM mRNA is not found in neuronal dendrites. 2B. J. Morris, unpublished information. 2B. J. Morris, unpublished information. Increased transcription of the NCAM gene is probably involved, since enhanced activation of AMPA/kainate receptors, which facilitate the induction of LTP and enhance learning, elevates the activity of the NCAM promoter (42.Holst B.D. Vanderklish P.W. Krushel L.A. Zhou W. Langdon R.B. McWhirter J.R. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular link between AMPA/kainate receptors and increased NCAM gene transcription therefore becomes of major interest in understanding how the properties of synapses and of the psd, in particular, can be modulated by patterns of afferent activity. In the immune and vascular systems, two nonneuronal homologues of NCAM, the intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), show increased expression when cells are exposed to cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In both the ICAM-1 gene and the VCAM-1 gene, the promoter region contains an NF-κB site upstream of the transcription start site, and NF-κB activation appears to be required for gene induction (43.Autieri M.V.

Inspection of the NCAM promoter reveals a potential NF-κB site in a similar position (48.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). There is evidence linking activation of NF-κB to neuronal plasticity (49.Meberg P.J. Kinney W.R. Valcourt E.G. Routtenberg A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and interestingly, NF-κB has been detected in the psd in cortical and hippocampal neurons (50.Suzuki T. Mitake S. Okumura-Noji K. Yang J.-P. Fujii T. Okamoto T. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), where the inactive form may be tethered to the PDZ domains of the psd structural network (51.Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Naito A. Harada S. Yoshie O. Takagi S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This location in the psd would place NF-κB in a unique position to carry transcriptional signals from the synapses to the cell nucleus. We have recently shown that kainic acid and also NO, which is released in striatal cultures in response to AMPA/kainate receptor stimulation, activate NF-κB in striatal neurons (52.Simpson C.S. Morris B.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that neuronal NF-κB might be involved in NCAM induction following kainate receptor stimulation or release of NO. If correct, this would identify a novel pathway that links the psd to the nucleus and acts to couple synaptic stimulation to morphological plasticity. Neuronal cultures were prepared as described (53.Morris B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24740-24744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in supplemented serum-free medium. On day 12 drugs were added, and after 24 h the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min. Dexamethasone was added 3 h before drug treatment. When wells were treated with antisense oligonucleotide or control (missense) oligonucleotide, these agents were added 2 days before drug treatments. Cells were plated at equal densities, and samples were treated identically in every experiment. In addition, different treatments were always performed in parallel so that relative staining intensities could be monitored both between groups and also relative to vehicle-treated wells. Antisense oligonucleotides and controls directed to NF-κB p50 have been designed and manufactured by Biognostik, Germany. The sequences were: antisense, atc ctg aaa ccc cac; randomized mismatch control with same AT/GC ratio (missense), gtc cct ata cga acg. Oligonucleotides were introduced into neurons essentially according to published procedures (54.Boussif O. Lezoualch F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (27.Morris B.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with antibodies against p50 and p65 (1:2000, 1:2000 dilution, respectively, Santa Cruz), neurofilament-200 (1:1000 dilution, Sigma), NCAM, integrin αV, or Elk-1 (1:2000, 1:1000, 1:4000 dilutions, respectively, Santa Cruz). Staining was visualized using an ABC peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories). To check for linearity of staining intensity relative to protein concentration, varying concentrations of NCAM antigen peptide (Santa Cruz) were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected as above. The staining intensity was found to be proportional to the amount of peptide present over a range of 2 orders of magnitude, spanning the staining intensities observed in cultured neurons in these experiments (not shown). In situ hybridization was performed at high stringency as described (27.Morris B.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 53.Morris B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24740-24744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an35S-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to the region of NCAM mRNA encoding amino acids 334–347. Computerized image analysis was used either to measure the intensity of immunocytochemical staining over individual neurons (mean number of pixels/unit area) or the intensity of autoradiographic signal following in situ hybridization (pixel area occupied by silver grains/neuron) using Image NIH 1.52 software (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health). For each drug treatment, five measurements were taken from different fields of view, and no less than four animals were used per treatment group. Each field of view represented between 50 and 100 neurons, but this small variation in number did not affect the measurements, which are assessed over individual neurons. Pooled data were analyzed for significance using ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's test for multiple pairwise comparisons (>2 groups) or Wilcoxon/Mann-WhitneyU test (2 groups). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) received intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg NOR3 (Calbiochem) or 1 ml/kg vehicle (saline). After 30 min, the rats were killed by anesthetic overdose, and the striatum was dissected out and homogenized. Similarly, cultured neurons were scraped from the culture wells and homogenized. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to standard procedures and incubated for 30 min with radiolabeled NF-κB binding site oligonucleotide (Promega) or an oligonucleotide corresponding to bases 905–926 of the NCAM promoter region. DNA-protein complexes were then resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels. To control for specificity of shifted bands, a 20-fold excess of NF-κB competitor oligonucleotide (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the incubation in some cases. Cultured neurons were scraped from the culture wells, homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and centrifuged. After a second centrifugation step, proteins in the supernatant were denatured and run on 3–8% polyacrylamide-Tris acetate gels with size markers (Santa Cruz). After blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the proteins under investigation were visualized using primary antisera as above and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated 2nd antibodies, according to standard procedures. Exposure of cultures of rat striatal neurons to the NO-releasing agent S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) increased the levels of NCAM mRNA (Fig.1, a and b). The NO scavenger hemoglobin prevented SNAP from increasing NCAM mRNA levels (Fig. 1, a and b). Similarly, increases in immunoreactive NCAM (NCAM-ir) were detected after treatment with SNAP (Fig. 1, c and d). In addition, exposure of striatal neurons to LPS, which activates NF-κB in cultured cells, and kainic acid produced increases in NCAM-ir (Fig. 1, c andd). These results demonstrate that the neuronal expression of the NCAM gene is subject to regulation by neurohumoral factors. Compounds widely used to suppress NF-κB activation in cell lines, (dithiocarbamate, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and curcumin), were found to be neurotoxic on the neuronal cultures (not shown). However, dexamethasone prevents the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (55.Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. IhrigBiedert I. Forstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar), and we observed that in the absence of any neurotoxic effects, the increases in NCAM-ir protein levels caused by SNAP, LPS, and kainic acid were blocked by pretreatment with dexamethasone, (Fig.2, a and b). If NO release elevates NCAM expression via the transcription factor NF-κB, then it should be possible to detect protein binding to the NF-κB site in the NCAM promoter following exposure to NO. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that the NO-releasing agent NOR3 increased protein binding both to a consensus NF-κB site (52.Simpson C.S. Morris B.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and to the potential NF-κB site in the NCAM promoter (48.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 c). To provide a direct test of the hypothesis that NO enhances NCAM expression via NF-κB, we utilized an antisense oligonucleotide designed to suppress the synthesis of the p50 subunit of rat NF-κB. The utility of antisense oligonucleotides in primary neuronal cultures is usually limited by problems with neurotoxicity due to the oligonucleotides. However, we employed a polyethyleneimine carrier (54.Boussif O. Lezoualch F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar) to aid cell penetration and reduce the concentrations required for translational inhibition. Although, in our hands higher concentrations of oligonucleotide (>500 nm) showed neurotoxic effects (not shown), no toxic effects were observed at concentrations of 300 nm or below. The uptake of oligonucleotide was assessed using a fluorescein-labeled NF-κB p50 oligonucleotide. A very high proportion of cultured striatal neurons showed fluorescent labeling under the conditions used (Fig. 3 a). Pretreatment of cultures for 2 days with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the mRNA encoding NF-κB p50 resulted in a decrease in p50-ir of more than 60% (Fig. 3, b–d). A missense oligonucleotide with the same base composition had no significant effect on p50-ir (Fig. 3. b–d). A smaller decrease in immunoreactivity for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (p65-ir) was detected using the p50 antisense oligonucleotide, although the missense oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 3 c). The gene encoding high molecular weight neurofilament (NF-H) is apparently not regulated in association with synaptic plasticity, and the promoter region of the NF-H gene does not contain any potential NF-κB sites (48.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ensure that there were no nonspecific effects on protein synthesis occurring, we studied the effect of antisense or missense oligonucleotide treatment on the levels of NF-H-ir. No significant changes in NF-H-ir could be detected with either the antisense or missense oligonucleotides or with any of the drugs used (Fig. 4 b). We also monitored the expression of the cell adhesion molecule integin αV and the transcription factor Elk1 to provide additional information of any nonspecific effects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment. No changes in the levels of integin αV-ir or Elk1-ir were observed after antisense oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 4 c). To determine whether the degree of suppression of NF-κB activity following antisense oligonucleotide treartment is sufficient for a functional blockade of NF-κB activity, we studied the induction of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Induction of the iNOS gene by cytokine or LPS treatment occurs via activation of NF-κB binding to the promoter region (55.Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. IhrigBiedert I. Forstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When iNOS protein levels were assessed using a specific iNOS antiserum, both kainate and LPS treatment increased iNOS-ir (Fig. 4 a). The increased iNOS-ir protein levels were prevented by pretreatment with the NF-κB p50 antisense oligonucleotide but not by pretreatment with the missense oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 a). Similar effects were observed when NOS activity in the striatal cultures was monitored by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry (not shown). The induction of NCAM-ir by SNAP, LPS, and kainate was completely blocked by pretreatment with the NF-κB p50 antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 5, a and b) but not affected by the missense oligonucleotide under identical conditions. We demonstrate here that kainate, SNAP, and LPS are all able to increase NCAM expression in striatal neurons. In each case the doses of agents used were substantially below the doses that result in neurotoxicity, suggesting that the effect on the NCAM gene is part of the normal repertoire of plasticity-related responses. The lack of toxicity is confirmed by the absence of any effect of SNAP, kainate, or LPS on NF-H expression. In addition, this illustrates the specificity of the actions of these agents for the NCAM gene, emphasizing that there is not a generalized elevation in the expression of all cellular genes. The level of immunocytochemical signal is unlikely to be directly proportional to the amount of antigen in the tissue, considering the various amplification steps involved in the detection procedure, and so it is not possible to relate the magnitude of the change in NCAM-ir detected to the magnitude of the increase in NCAM protein. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that even a small increase in NCAM expression is thought to produce a dramatic functional change in cell adhesion properties (57.Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone attenuated the increased NCAM expression due to kainate and SNAP treatment. Among other actions, dexamethasone acts to suppress the transactivating potential of NF-κB (55.Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. IhrigBiedert I. Forstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar, 58.DeBosscher K. Schmitz M.L. VandenBerghe W. Plaisance S. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 59.Wissink S. vanHeerde E.C. vanderBurg B. vanderSaag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 355-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition of NCAM induction by dexamethasone is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that NF-κB is involved in the regulation of neuronal NCAM expression. This also provides a likely explanation for the observation that hippocampal NCAM levels and dendritic arborization are enhanced by removal of endogenous glucocorticoids (60.Rodriguez J.J. Montaron M.F. Petry K.G. Aurousseau C. Marinelli M. Premier S. Rougon G. Le Moal M. Abrous D.N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2994-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), where their absence would remove any inhibition of NCAM expression mediated by this mechanismin vivo. Furthermore, in view of the importance of NCAM expression for learning and memory processes, our results provide a framework to explain the well known suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on acquisition and retrieval of memories (61.de Quervain D. Roozendaal B. McGaugh J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 62.Kirschbaum C. Wolf O.T. May M. Wippich W. Hellhammer D.H. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide directed against NF-κB p50 decreased immunostaining for p50 by more than 50%, whereas no significant suppression of staining was observed with an equivalent missense oligonucelotide. These results suggest that a sequence-specific suppression of neuronal NF-κB p50 levels has been achieved via this approach. The lack of any effect of the oligonucleotide treatments on NF-H immunostaining provides evidence that there is no toxic effect of the treatment and, equally, that there is no generalized, nonselective suppression of protein synthesis within the neurons. Furthermore, the lack of any effect of antisense treatment on the levels of integin αV-ir suggests that there are no generalized nonspecific effects on cell adhesion molecule synthesis, whereas the lack of any effect of antisense treatment on the levels of Elk1-ir confirms that there is no generalized suppression of transcription factor synthesis and, hence, that the treatment is likely to be selectively inhibiting translation of NF-κB p50. Interestingly the levels of NF-κB p65-ir were decreased by the p50 antisense treatment but not by the missense treatment. This is probably a reflection of the fact that NF-κB p50 homodimers or p50/p65 heterodimers participate in maintaining the basal levels of neuronal expression of the p65 gene, since the p65 promoter contains a NF-κB site, and dexamethasone shows a greater inhibition of p65 activity relative to p50 activity (52.Simpson C.S. Morris B.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In consequence, it can be concluded that the antisense oligonucleotide produces a suppression of NF-κB activity by inhibiting the synthesis of both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB. The major influence on expression of the iNOS gene in a variety of cell types is known to be NF-κB (55.Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. IhrigBiedert I. Forstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63.Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We observe that in striatal neurons, kainate and LPS both produced a clear induction of iNOS, providing further evidence that these agents activate NF-κB. This induction of iNOS was not observed after antisense oligonucleotide treatment, confirming that the antisense pretreatment produces a functional blockade of NF-κB activity. The induction of NCAM-ir by SNAP, LPS, and kainate was completely blocked by pretreatment with the NF-κB p50 antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 b) but not affected by the missense oligonucleotide under identical conditions. This confirms that the induction of NCAM expression is critically dependent on the activation of NF-κB. In occasional experiments the basal levels of NCAM-ir were reduced by antisense treatment (Fig. 5 b), perhaps reflecting a higher level of endogenous synaptic activity in these cultures. Overall there was no significant effect of antisense treatment on the basal levels of NCAM-ir (Fig. 5 a), implying that basal levels are not maintained by the constitutive NF-κB activity in neurons (64.Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but rather that NF-κB participates in activity-dependent regulation of NCAM expression. Basal levels of NCAM expression are likely to be mainly sustained by other transcription factors. For example, the homeobox-binding proteins have been shown to be important for the developmental regulation of NCAM expression (65.Holst B.D. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (573): 573Google Scholar). Activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB has been detected following the induction of LTP in the hippocampus (49.Meberg P.J. Kinney W.R. Valcourt E.G. Routtenberg A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) during neuronal development (66.Guerrini L. Molteni A. Wirth T. Kistler B. Blasi F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6057-6063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as part of the response to neuronal injury (67.Perezotano I. McMillian N.K. Chen J. Bing G.Y. Hong J.S. Pennypacker K.R. Glia. 1996; 16: 306-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the activation of NF-κB during injury is relatively easy to reconcile with known NF-κB target genes such as cyclooxygenase 2, until now it has not been clear what role NF-κB might play in physiological as opposed to pathological plasticity. Our results suggest that one of the consequences of NF-κB activation will be increased expression of NCAM, which in turn is expected to lead to plasticity in synaptic architecture and, particularly, to sprouting of nerve terminals or dendritic processes (31.Schachner M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32.Fields R.R. Itoh K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The presence of NCAM in the psd suggests that activity-associated rearrangement of the psd (5.Geinisman Y. de Toledo-Morrell L. Morrell F. Brain Res. 1991; 566: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) may involve this pathway. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that extracellular binding of NCAM will itself activate NF-κB (69.Krushel L.A. Cunningham B., A. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2432-2439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since NF-κB can be present presynaptically as well as post-synaptically, this provides an elegant mechanism whereby activity-stimulated NCAM induction (via NF-κB) in the psd could then activate presynaptic NF-κB and, hence, cause a complementary increase in presynaptic NCAM expression. Over a few hours, this would then produce a reciprocal stabilization of the new synaptic structure. It is worth noting that activated neuronal NF-κB has been detected in the immediate vicinity of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease tissue (70.Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Volk B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), where there is also extensive aberrant axon terminal sprouting. Furthermore, the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, which show particularly pronounced terminal sprouting during the course of Alzheimer's disease (71.Gertz H.J. Cervos-Navarro J. Ewald V. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 76: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 72.Geddes J.W. Monaghan D.T. Cotman C.W. et al.Science. 1985; 230: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), are also prominent in terms of their high levels of activated NF-κB (73.Boissiere F. Hunot S. Faucheux B. Duyckaerts C. Hauw J.J. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2849-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the light of a recent report showing increased NCAM expression in the regions of abberant sprouting (68.Mikkonen M. Soininen H. Tapiola T. Alafuzoff I. Miettinen R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the novel NF-κB-NCAM link reported here contributes to the inappropriate terminal hypertrophy that is a feature of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. We thank Dr. J. Quinn (University of Edinburgh) for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2008169313,"The subtilisin propeptide functions as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) that facilitates correct folding of the catalytic domain while acting like a competitive inhibitor of proteolytic activity. Upon completion of folding, subtilisin initiates IMC degradation to complete precursor maturation. Existing data suggest that the chaperone and inhibitory functions of the subtilisin IMC domain are interdependent during folding. Based on x-ray structure of the IMC-subtilisin complex, we introduce a point mutation (E112A) to disrupt three hydrogen bonds that stabilize the interface between the protease and its IMC domain. This mutation within subtilisin does not alter the folding kinetics but dramatically slows down autoprocessing of the IMC domain. Inhibition of E112A-subtilisin activity by the IMC added in trans is 35-fold weaker than wild-type subtilisin. Although the IMC domain displays substantial loss of inhibitory function, its ability to chaperone E112A-subtilisin folding remains intact. Our results show that (i) the chaperone activity of the IMC domain is not obligatorily linked with its ability to bind with and inhibit active subtilisin; (ii) degradation and not autoprocessing of the IMC domain is the rate-limiting step in precursor maturation; and (iii) the Glu112 residue within the IMC-subtilisin interface is not crucial for initiating folding but is important in maintaining the IMC structure capable of binding subtilisin.

Doi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo this protein exists as a precursor, namely pre-pro-subtilisin (1.Wong S.L. Doi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presequence acts as a signal peptide and facilitates the secretion of pro-subtilisin across the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas the pro-region or propeptide functions as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC)1 that guides correct folding of the subtilisin domain (2.Ikemura H.

Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) mature from higher molecular weight precursor proteins. Although propeptides of several proteins can function as IMCs, not all propeptides can directly catalyze folding reactions (18.Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19.Shinde, U. P., Liu, J. J., and Inouye, M.

Such propeptides can exert their biological functions using a myriad of mechanisms (19.Shinde, U. P., Liu, J. J., and Inouye, M. (1997) Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins, 1st Ed., pp. 467–490, 2000, 11(1), 3544, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Close scrutiny of such propeptides suggests that they may actually be post-translational “modulators” of protein function because they are directly or indirectly involved in the structural organization (20.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The conservation of propeptide function across unrelated protease families suggests that, similar to proteases, propeptides may have evolved in multiple parallel pathways and may share a similar mechanism of action (18.Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is also possible that propeptides have evolutionarily preceded the formation of the protease families (21.Shinde U.P Inouye M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IMC-mediated protein folding is best understood in subtilisin and α-lytic protease (20.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The in vitro folding pathway of pro-subtilisin involves precursor folding (22.Shinde U.P. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), followed by autoprocessing (24.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that coincides with structural changes that lead to degradation of the IMC domain (23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Folding of denatured subtilisin in the absence of its IMC domain traps the protease into an inactive molten-globule like intermediate state (8.Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25.Eder J. Rheinnecker M.

Addition of the IMC domain in trans helps this intermediate adopt an active conformation (8.Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25.Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent data show that the IMC domain can impart structural information onto its protease (27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar) and that this imprinting occurs after autoprocessing but before degradation of the IMC from the precursor (28.Shinde U.P. Fu X. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15615-15621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such results suggest that IMCs promote protein folding by direct stabilization of the rate-limiting folding transition state and support the notion that the IMC is essential only during late stages of the folding process (29.Ellis R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5194) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues Asp32, His64, and Ser221 constitute the catalytic triad of subtilisin and mediate both autoprocessing and degradation of the IMC domain (3.Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these two activities are distinctly different from one another. As a result the IMC-S221C-subtilisin can autoprocess its IMC domain but is unable to degrade it, resulting in the formation of a stable IMC-subtilisin complex (31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2 Å resolution x-ray structure of such a complex was recently solved (32.Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33.Jain S.C. Shinde U.P. Li Y Inouye M. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is evident from this structure that degradation of the IMC domain subsequent to autoproteolysis is essential because the C-terminal end of the IMC domain interacts with the substrate-binding loop of the protease through numerous hydrogen bonds. The C-terminal end therefore inhibits the enzymatic activity of the protease by steric occlusion of its active site (32.Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33.Jain S.C. Shinde U.P. Li Y Inouye M. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the proteolysis of even a single peptide bond within the IMC can dramatically decrease its affinity for the protease domain resulting in protease activation (34.Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the IMC domain and its fragments are devoid of secondary and tertiary structures when isolated from subtilisin (22.Shinde U.P. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25.Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35.Bryan P. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). Hence, specific interactions between IMC-subtilisin appear to be important to stabilize the complex. Results obtained through mutational studies within the IMC domain suggest the existence of a direct correlation between the chaperone function and the inhibition of proteolytic activity (34.Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35.Bryan P. Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). In the present manuscript we maintain the IMC domain intact but destroy three specific hydrogen bonds that exist between the Glu112 and the backbone of the IMC domain. These H bonds, along with hydrophobic interactions, appear to dominate the forces that stabilize the IMC-subtilisin complex. Our results indicate that the E112A substitution does not affect the folding of IMC-E112A-subtilisin. This mutant precursor undergoes efficient processing into an active protease, and the substitution does not significantly affect maturation. However, the autoprocessing and degradation of the IMC domain are dramatically altered. This result is attributed to the inability of the precursor to form a stable IMC-subtilisin complex because of E112A mutation. Hence, the IMC becomes a poor competitive inhibitor of the mutant subtilisin as the K i value is increased approximately 35-fold, and these results show that the chaperone and inhibitory functions of the IMC domain are not obligatorily related. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Strategene Inc. The hydrophobic dye, 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonic acid (ANS), phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the synthetic substrate for subtilisin, succincyl-Ala-l-Ala-l-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, were purchased from Sigma. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at 0.2 μm scale on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 380B synthesizer using reagents obtained from Applied Biosystems Inc. Purification of these oligonucleotides was done using oligo-purification cartridges supplied by Applied Biosystems Inc. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were estimated spectrophotometrically by recording the absorbance at 260 nm. These oligonucleotides were used to introduce the desired mutations into plasmids pET11a-pro-sub (27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar) and pET11a-proS221C-sub (31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit purchased from Strategene Cloning Systems. The mutations were subsequently confirmed through DNA sequencing performed on an Applied Biosystems Inc.-310 Genetic Analyzer purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. Plasmids pET11a-pro-sub and pET11a-proS221C-sub were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and grown in M9 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar). At an absorbance of 0.8 A 600 nm, the proteins were induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm). After 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with a wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The cells were resuspended in 30 ml of wash buffer supplemented with 20 μl of a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml each) and DNase I. The suspension were lysed at 4 °C using a French press cell (10,000 p.s.i.). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant and pellet were separated. Because the constructs are under the control of the T7 promoter, the levels of expression are very high (∼50 mg/liter of culture). As a result, the induced protein was localized in inclusion bodies (27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar, 28.Shinde U.P. Fu X. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15615-15621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After confirming that the protein of interest was located inside the inclusion bodies, the pellets were rinsed twice with wash buffer to carefully remove traces of cell lysate. The pellet was solubilized in 30 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 4.8, by sonication. The solution was incubated overnight (with constant shaking) at 4 °C. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 2 h), and the supernatant was used to purify the proteins. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 100 volumes of Buffer A (50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 m urea) with one buffer change. The dialyzed protein was centrifuged (100,000 × g for 2 h) to remove precipitated proteins. Soluble protein was applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (3 × 30 cm) that was equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A until proteins were no longer detected in the flow-through, and the protein was eluted using a NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Wild-type pro-subtilisin eluted between 0.15 and 0.2 m NaCl, and fractions containing the precursors were pooled and concentrated to approximately 2.0 ml by an Amicon ultrafiltration system using a YM10 membrane. The proteins were dialyzed as described earlier, but this time using Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5m urea). The protein were again centrifuged (100,000 × g for 2 h), and the supernatant was applied to a QAE-Sephadex Q-50 column (1.5 × 15 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. After thoroughly washing the column with Buffer B, proteins were eluted using a gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing the precursor were pooled and concentrated as described earlier. Protein samples were finally dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 m urea and stored at −20 °C until use. The precursor proteins (1.25 mg/ml) were denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 4.8. The temperature for renaturation was maintained at 4 °C, and folding was initiated through rapid dilution of 200 μl of the protein into 2800 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.5m (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT. The kinetics of folding were monitored by rapidly diluting the denatured precursors (15-fold dilution) into a quartz cuvette (1-cm path length) and simultaneously recording the changes in CD spectra at 222 nm. Data were collected at 1-s time intervals with a bandwidth of 3 nm. Each kinetic trace was recorded for 3000 s and represents the average of three independent experiments. By using nonlinear regression the traces were found to fit a single exponential rate constant. The Prism Graph-Pad software, version 2.01, was used for the data fitting analysis and graph plotting. Denatured proteins (100 μg/ml) are loaded into a dialysis tubing (12.0-kDa cut-off) and dialyzed against 100 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm DTT that contains 4 murea. After 4 h, the buffer was replaced with one containing 3m urea. This procedure is repeated in a stepwise manner until complete removal of urea is achieved (23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar, 28.Shinde U.P. Fu X. Inouye M. J. Biol.

The proteins were allowed to incubate in the final buffer for up to 1 week (31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then concentrated using an ultrafiltration unit with a YM10 membrane. An aliquot of the sample is incubated at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2. For measuring the K m the substrate concentrations were varied between 0.05 and 2.5 mmsuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. Enzymatic activity of subtilisin is estimated by monitoring the release ofp-nitroaniline through changes in absorbance at 405 nm (34.Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Readings are collected at 12-s time intervals using a Bio-Rad UV microplate reader to estimate the reaction velocity. One unit is defined as the activity releasing 1 μm ofp-nitroaniline/min. An A 405 of 8.5 corresponds to 1 mm of p-nitroaniline. CD measurements were performed on an automated AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer maintained at 4 °C. The spectra were taken from 260 to 190 nm. The protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml, and a path length of 0.1 cm was used. In thermal denaturing measurements, temperatures were increased from 10 to 90 °C at 0.5 °C intervals, equilibrated for 6 s at each temperature. Data were collected at each temperature for 5 s. Folding kinetics were monitored by rapidly diluting 200 μl of precursor proteins (1.25 mg/ml) into 2800 μl of buffer and simultaneously monitoring changes in the CD absorbance at 222 nm. Fluorescence studies were carried out on an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminiscence spectrometer at 4 °C. Protein concentration was 100 nm and ANS concentration was 100 μm (27.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389, 5: 20-522Google Scholar). The proteins were excited at 395 nm, and the emission scan was recorded from 410 to 600 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were maintained at 4 nm throughout the experiments. For the intrinsic fluorescence experiments, the proteins were excited at 295 nm, and the emission scans were recorded from 310 to 410 nm. The maturation pathway of subtilisin involves at least four distinct stages (28.Shinde U.P. Fu X. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15615-15621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar): (i) folding of the protease domain that is mediated by its IMC domain; (ii) autoprocessing of the peptide bond between the C terminus of the IMC domain and the N terminus of subtilisin; (iii) structural changes within the autoprocessed complex during which IMC continues to facilitate folding; and (iv) degradation of the IMC domain that renders maturation irreversible. Specific mutations within the catalytic triad of subtilisin facilitate the analysis of individual steps on this pathway. For example, when the catalytic residue Ser221 is substituted with Cys, the precursor undergoes folding, autoprocessing, and structural changes subsequent to its autocleavage to give a complex in which the IMC domain remains associated with subtilisin through noncovalent interactions (31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 A depicts the x-ray structure of such an autoprocessed IMC-S221C-subtilisin complex (33.Jain S.C. Shinde U.P. Li Y Inouye M. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which is similar to the complex obtained by adding the IMC domain to folded subtilisin (32.Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The β-sheet of the IMC domain packs tightly against the two surface parallel α-helices of the mature domain. There are 26 hydrogen bonds that connect the IMC with mature subtilisin. These include the region of the IMC domain that interacts with the active site of subtilisin. The folded IMC domain has a compact structure with shape complementarity and high affinity to the protease domain (32.Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,33.Jain S.C. Shinde U.P. Li Y Inouye M. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Residue Glu112 forms three hydrogen bonds with the backbone of residues 42, 43, and 44 within the IMC domain and appears to play a major role in maintaining the IMC domain interactions with subtilisin in a “side-on” fashion (Fig. 1 B). The interface is also stabilized by hydrophobic side chains between the interface of the β-sheets of the IMC domain and the two α-helices in subtilisin (Fig. 1 B). On the basis of the structure of the complex, it has been proposed that the central αβα substructures within subtilisin were stabilized by the IMC domain (36.Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S Strausberg S. Alexander P Almog O. Gilliland G. Gallagher T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10310-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hence, to understand the role of Glu112 in stabilizing interactions of the two parallel α-helices with the β-sheets in the IMC domain in an autoprocessed complex and to investigate its importance in the overall maturation process, this residue was substituted with an Ala using site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). This mutant protein is used to map the role of Glu112 on the maturation pathway of IMC-subtilisin. The E112A substitution was carried out in plasmids pET11a-WTpro-sub and pET11a-proS221Csub that contain wild-type IMC-subtilisin and IMC-S221C-subtilisin, respectively. Because the IMC-S221C-subtilisin can autoprocess but not degrade its IMC domain, amino acid substitutions within this construct enables one to analyze the effects of mutations on autoprocessing and the stability of the autoprocessed complex in the absence of IMC degradation (23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant precursors were expressed, purified, and refolded using a stepwise dialysis procedure established earlier (23.Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31.Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both IMC-subtilisin and IMC-E112A-subtilisin can undergo maturation to give active mature subtilisin (Fig.2 A). The secondary and tertiary structures of the 275-residue protease domain in both wild-type and E112A-subtilisin were monitored using CD spectroscopy. Fig. 2 B indicates that the secondary structures of the two proteins are almost identical. E112A-subtilisin displays a very slight increase in the negative ellipticity at 208 nm. This suggests that the E112A substitution does not dramatically alter the secondary structure of the protease domain. The tertiary structures of the two proteins were monitored using near UV-CD, and the spectra show similar patterns. However, E112A-subtilisin shows a reduction in the negative ellipticity at 278 nm (Fig.2 C). To ascertain change in the environments of the three tryptophan residues, two of which may be directly affected by the E112A substitution, the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the two proteins were monitored (Fig. 2 D). The proteins were excited at 295 nm, and the emission spectra of the proteins were recorded from 310 to 410 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence and near UV-CD spectra display small differences, and a reason for such changes can be attributed to perturbations in the α-helix within residues 104–116 caused by the E112A substitution. This residue is adjacent to Trp113 and in close proximity with Trp104. The intrinsic fluorescence absorption at 350 nm increases by approximately 10% in case of E112A-subtilisin and suggests that local changes in tryptophan environment can occur as a result of the substitution. However, the overall secondary structures and the enzymatic properties of both wild-type and E112A-subtilisin are almost identical (TableI). Moreover, the two proteins also do not display exposed hydrophobic surface area that can bind with a fluorescent hydrophobic probe ANS (data not shown). It is important to note that although identical concentrations of precursors were utilized for folding, the yield of mature E112A-subtilisin is less than that of the wild-type subtilisin. Hence, the amount of the reaction mixture that had to be loaded in lane 5 of Fig. 2 A was 5-fold greater (by volume) than that for the wild-type subtilisin (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The mutant protease melts approximately 2 °C lower than the wild-type protein as observed using CD spectroscopy (data not shown). This may be due to destabilization of α-helix 4 within subtilisin, and the lower yield of mature E112A-subtilisin may be attributed to its relative instability as compared with that of wild-type subtilisin. Hence, the Glu112 substitution within subtilisin allows the precursor to undergo maturation into an active pro"
https://openalex.org/W2015435476,"The crystal structure of the bacterial K+ channel, KcsA (Doyle, D. A., Morais, C. J., Pfuetzner, R. A., Kuo, A., Gulbis, J. M., Cohen, S. L., Chait, B. T., and MacKinnon, R. (1998) Science280, 69–77), and subsequent mutagenesis have revealed a high structural conservation from bacteria to human (MacKinnon, R., Cohen, S. L., Kuo, A., Lee, A., and Chait, B. T. (1998)Science 280, 106–109). We have explored this conservation by swapping subregions of the M1-M2 linker of KcsA with those of the S5-S6 linker of the human Kv-channel Kv1.3. The chimeric K+channel constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their multimeric state was analyzed after purification. We used two scorpion toxins, kaliotoxin and hongotoxin 1, which bind specifically to Kv1.3, to analyze the pharmacological properties of the KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras. The results demonstrate that the high affinity scorpion toxin receptor of Kv1.3 could be transferred to KcsA. Our biochemical studies with purified KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras provide direct chemical evidence that a tetrameric channel structure is necessary for forming a functional scorpion toxin receptor. We have obtained KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras with kaliotoxin affinities (IC50 values of ∼4 pm) like native Kv1.3 channels. Furthermore, we show that a subregion of the S5-S6 linker may be an important determinant of the pharmacological profile of K+ channels. Using available structural information on KcsA and kaliotoxin, we have developed a structural model for the complex between KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras and kaliotoxin to aid future pharmacological studies of K+ channels. The crystal structure of the bacterial K+ channel, KcsA (Doyle, D. A., Morais, C. J., Pfuetzner, R. A., Kuo, A., Gulbis, J. M., Cohen, S. L., Chait, B. T., and MacKinnon, R. (1998) Science280, 69–77), and subsequent mutagenesis have revealed a high structural conservation from bacteria to human (MacKinnon, R., Cohen, S. L., Kuo, A., Lee, A., and Chait, B. T. (1998)Science 280, 106–109). We have explored this conservation by swapping subregions of the M1-M2 linker of KcsA with those of the S5-S6 linker of the human Kv-channel Kv1.3. The chimeric K+channel constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their multimeric state was analyzed after purification. We used two scorpion toxins, kaliotoxin and hongotoxin 1, which bind specifically to Kv1.3, to analyze the pharmacological properties of the KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras. The results demonstrate that the high affinity scorpion toxin receptor of Kv1.3 could be transferred to KcsA. Our biochemical studies with purified KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras provide direct chemical evidence that a tetrameric channel structure is necessary for forming a functional scorpion toxin receptor. We have obtained KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras with kaliotoxin affinities (IC50 values of ∼4 pm) like native Kv1.3 channels. Furthermore, we show that a subregion of the S5-S6 linker may be an important determinant of the pharmacological profile of K+ channels.

In particular, the blockade of the voltage-gated K+ channel encoded by Kv1.3 inhibits T-cell activation, lymphokine secretion, and cell proliferation (3.Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Kv1.3 is very scorpion toxin-sensitive (4.Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). These toxins constitute useful molecular tools to study physiological and structural properties of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels (5.Miller C.

The toxins bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry and may inhibit Kv channel activity by plugging the external pore entryway (2.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T.

Amino acid residues between hydrophobic transmembrane segments S5 and S6 (the S5-S6 linker region with the P domain) form the receptor site for scorpion toxin as well as the outer entrance to the Kv channel pore and a substantial part of the ion conduction pathway (2.MacKinnon R.

Based on the hypothesis that complementary surfaces of scorpion toxin and Kv channel interact, the known three-dimensional structure of scorpion toxins has been exploited to study the topology of the external mouth of Kv channels,e.g. Shaker and Kv1.3 (11.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12.Naranjo D. Miller C.

Thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis has been used to identify specific amino acid residues in the S5-S6 linker region as part of the scorpion-toxin receptor site (11.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H.

The strength of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between potentially interacting amino acid residues of Kv1.3 channel and scorpion toxin, e.g. kaliotoxin (KTX)1 (9.Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), was shown to influence the affinity of the scorpion toxin to its receptor. Recent studies have demonstrated a remarkable structural conservation between the pore structures of a prokaryotic K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans (14.Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), KcsA, and eukaryotic Kv channels (2.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The determination of the three-dimensional structure of KcsA by x-ray analysis has provided the first molecular description of an ion-selective channel (1.Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar). Although KcsA subunits contain only two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2) and not six like Kv-channel subunits, KcsA and Kv channels are believed to share essentially the same pore structure. KcsA does not normally bind scorpion toxins. However, mutation of three KcsA channel residues (Q58A, T61S, R64D) in the KcsA pore region sufficed to generate a competent, low affinity agitoxin 2 (AgTX2) binding site with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of about 0.6 μm (2.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This value differed by 6 orders of magnitude with the one reported for AgTX2 binding to Kv1.3 (∼0.3 pm) (15.Helms L.M. Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Garcia M.L. Stevens S. Leonard R.J. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Wanner S.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Obviously, some energetically coupled residue pairs were absent at the recognition interface needed for a high affinity toxin binding site. We have generated a high affinity toxin binding site on KcsA using an alternative approach. Various parts of the S5-S6 linker region of Kv1.3 were transferred to KcsA to generate a panel of KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras. They were expressed in Escherichia coli and, when possible, were solubilized, purified, and assayed for toxin binding. The results demonstrated that KcsA-Kv1.3 channels could be obtained that bound KTX with a K d (∼4 pm) similar to the one reported for native Kv1.3 (∼3 pm) (15.Helms L.M. Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Garcia M.L. Stevens S. Leonard R.J. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Wanner S.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, the results showed that certain Kv1.3 amino acid residues in the S5-S6 linker region were not suitable for transfer to KcsA, possibly interfering with a correct subunit fold and/or subunit assembly. We have used our results in combination with the known structures of KcsA (1.Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar) and KTX (9.Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B.

The chimeras developed here can also be exploited in putting forward an understanding of potassium channel pharmacology and in developing promising therapeutic agents. For the production of recombinant proteinsE. coli strains were grown in super broth (25 g of bacteriological peptone, 15 g of yeast extract (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 g of NaCl per liter). Antibiotics were from Sigma. Ampicillin and kanamycin were added to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Roth. n-Decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (16.Lara B. Zapater P. Montiel C. de la Fuente MT Martinez-Sierra R. Ballesta J.J. Gandia L. Garcia A.G. Biochem.

All other reagents were from Fluka or Merck. For polymerase chain reactions, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200. Eam1104I was supplied by Stratagene; other restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from MBI Fermentas. E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) served as host for the propagation of pQE-32 (Qiagen) and constructs; E. coliM15 pREP4 (Qiagen) was used for the production of recombinant proteins. The KcsA K+channel gene (GenBank™ accession number Z37969) was amplified fromS. lividans strain 66 genomic DNA (DSMZ 46482) using SKC1F and SKC1R primers, as described by Schrempf et al. (14.Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned in pT7Blue (Novagen), and the 546-base pair SphI-SalI fragment encoding KcsA was subcloned into pQE32 (Qiagen). The kcsA-pQE32 construct and Kv1.3 cDNA from human T lymphocytes (GenBank™ accession number L23499) in pRcCMV (17.Swanson R. Marshall J. Smith J.S. Williams J.B. Boyle M.B. Folander K. Luneau C.J.

Chi I was constructed according to the Seamless method (Stratagene). Chimeras II to VIII were prepared by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction (18.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) or by using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). At the N terminus and at the C terminus, each chimera contained a His tag and a streptavidin affinity tag, respectively (19.Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The His tag allowed purification using Ni2+-chelating column. Recombinant clones were analyzed using standard methods (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing both strands. E. coli M15 pREP4 cells were transformed with constructs as described previously (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformed cells were plated on a LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics, and a single colony was picked for overnight pre-culture. The pre-culture was diluted into 500–1000 ml of super broth (containing antibiotics) to obtain a final absorbance of 0.2 at 600 nm and grown at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μmpepstatin A, 2 μm leupeptin), and disrupted by a French press. Unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min), and membranes were extracted from the supernatant by high speed centrifugation (110,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). The membranes were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm NaPiand 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0), and proteins were extracted with 40 mm n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C using a rotary mixer. This mixture was centrifuged for 45 min at 85,000 × g, and imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 30 mm for affinity purification on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose, as described previously (21.Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry and the BCA test (Pierce). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on a 15% gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by electrotransfer. Immunodetection was carried out using the polyclonal anti-Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)4 antibodies (Qiagen) as described previously (21.Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For binding assays, the membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline before incubation with 0.2 nm125I-KTX in the binding buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4)), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl). After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were briefly washed three times with binding buffer B containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was assayed in the presence of 100 nm KTX. Binding was detected after overnight exposure in densitometer cassette using PhosphorImager. 125I-KTX and125I-HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F were prepared as described previously (23.Romi R. Crest M. Gola M.

In each experiment, recombinant proteins were incubated at room temperature in binding buffer B containing 2 mm n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. When using membrane preparations of E. coli, the incubations were performed in binding buffer B. At the end of the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 4 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum), and the solution was filtered through a GF/C glass fiber filter. The filters were washed twice with 4 ml of the wash buffer. Filter-retained radioactivity was determined by γ counting. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 100 nmunlabeled toxin. In each experiment, triplicate assays were carried out, and the data were averaged. For competition experiments, recombinant channels were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer with radiolabeled toxin (30–100 pm) and a series of cold toxin concentrations in a total volume of 250 μl. Equation 1, B=Bmin+Bmax−Bmin1+10[toxin]−LogIC50Equation 1 where B min is the minimum binding,B max is the maximum binding, and IC50 is the inhibitory concentration at 50% inhibition, was fit to the data. For saturation binding, the incubation time was 2 h. Equation2, B=Bmax×[ 125I−toxin]Kd+[ 125I−toxin]Equation 2 where K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant, was fit to the data. Association data were analyzed as a single exponential according to Equation 3 below. B=Bmax(1−e−kt)Equation 3 where k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of the association process. k is related to the second-order rate constant of the association process (k on), the labeled toxin concentration, and the first order rate constant of the dissociation process (k off) according to Equation 4, as follows. k=kon[ 125I−toxin]+koffEquation 4 Dissociation data were analyzed as a one-phase exponential decay according to Equation 5, as follows.

Our modeling is based on the crystal structure of KcsA solved at 3.2 Å resolution (1.Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank, accession number 1BL8). To create a model of a chimeric channel KcsA-Kv1.3, the following mutations were introduced: R52A, G53D, A54D, G56T, A57S, Q58G, L59F, I60S, T61S, Y62I, R64D, respective to the KcsA amino acid sequence number. A model of the chimeric channel KcsA-Kv1.3, Chi VIII, was generated by the mutations L81M and Y82H to Chi IV. Both models can be viewed on the Internet (information is available online at the website of the AFMB laboratory). Given the reported structural conservation between the pores of bacterial KcsA channels (2.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic Kv channels, we explored possibilities of transferring the scorpion toxin receptor site of human (h)Kv1.3 channels to the toxin-insensitive KcsA channels. Accordingly, we replaced parts of the KcsA M1-M2 linker region by a homologous sequence of the Kv1.3 S5-S6 linker region, which most likely contains the complete scorpion toxin receptor. We divided the S5-S6 linker from hKv1.3 into three subregions (Table I) similar to the ones that were previously transferred independently from Kv1.3 to Kv2.1 subunits (25.Gross A. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 961-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). First, we constructed KcsA-Kv1.3 chimera Chi I, displaying the complete Kv1.3 S5-S6 linker, and Chi II, containing subregions I and III of the linker (see Table I). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of KcsA-Kv1.3 protein expression in E. coli transformed with Chi I or Chi II DNA constructs produced an immediate arrest of bacterial growth followed by cell lysis (data not shown). For that reason, no recombinant Chi I or Chi II protein could be obtained for analysis. Then we transferred only subregion I from Kv1.3 to KcsA (chimera Chi III). This time, we achieved chimeric KcsA-Kv1.3 protein expression. The yield of purified Chi III protein, however, was too low (0.03 mg of protein/liter of bacterial culture) for detailed biochemical and pharmacological studies. Next, we expressed KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras Chi IV and Chi V containing shortened versions of subregion I (Table I). Now, the yields of purified Chi IV and Chi V proteins (1 to 1.5 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture) were comparable with the one of KcsA protein (Table I). Thus, we assayed primarily Chi IV and Chi V preparations for their ability to bind K+channel toxins. In filter binding assays we showed that Chi IV and Chi V were competent for binding 125I-KTX and125I-HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F, respectively (Fig.1, A and B). Similar data were obtained with Chi VI (Fig. 1 A), which contained, in addition to subregion I sequences, Met-81 of subregion III (Table I). In contrast, the iodinated scorpion toxins did not bind to wild-type KcsA in agreement with previous data obtained with AgTX2 (2.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Table ISequence and yields of KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras expressed in E. coliIn A, alignment of the M1-M2 linker sequence of KcsA (from residue 47 to residue 91) and the S5-S6 linker sequence of hKv1.3 (from residue 364 to 408) is shown.

Yields of purified proteins are given at the right (n = 4). The mobility of solubilized and purified Chi IV and Chi V proteins in SDS-PAGE correlated with a molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig.2 A). This indicated a tetrameric structure for purified Chi IV and Chi V. After boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, Chi IV and Chi V migrated in SDS-PAGE as monomers (Fig. 2 A). A similar behavior has been observed with KcsA (Fig. 2 A) (21.Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), indicating that the tetrameric channel structure had been disrupted by the heat treatment. The SDS-PAGE results showed that it was possible to prepare Chi IV and Chi V, respectively, either in tetrameric or in monomeric form. Chi IV tetramers and monomers were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and tested for their 125I-KTX binding activity. The results showed that 125I-KTX bound to Chi IV tetramers but not to Chi IV monomers (Fig. 2 B). It demonstrated that the dissociation of Chi IV tetramers to monomers had also disrupted the toxin receptor site in Chi IV, providing direct biochemical evidence for a tetrameric structure of the scorpion toxin receptor. The selectivity of Chi IV and Chi V against other K+channel toxins like apamin, PO5, and α-dendrotoxin (α-DTX) was investigated. Apamin as well as PO5 bind with high affinity to SK channels (26.Sabatier J.M. Zerrouk H. Darbon H. Mabrouk K. Benslimane A. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Van Rietschoten J.

Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). 0.1 μm concentrations of PO5, apamin or α-DTX had no effect on 125I-KTX binding to Chi IV (n = 3). Apamin and PO5 interfered only at 1 μm concentration to some extent with 125I-KTX binding (n = 3) (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained using Chi V (not shown). Collectively, the results suggested that the Kv1.3 subregion I sequences sufficed to transfer a selective scorpion toxin receptor site to KcsA. This observation was further corroborated after transferring subregions I from the S5-S6 linker region of KTX-insensitive Kv1.4 or Kv1.5 to KcsA (see Fig.3 B). The Kv1.4-KcsA (Chi IX) and Kv1.5-KcsA (Chi X) chimeras were expressed, purified in tetrameric form (data not shown), and tested for 125I-KTX binding in filter binding assays (Fig.3 C). The results demonstrated that chimeras Chi IX and Chi X, like native Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 channels, did not interact with125I-KTX to a significant extent (4.Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-KTX to chimeric KcsA-Kv1.3 proteins was quantitatively assessed in competition experiments with KTX, such as those shown in Fig. 4 A for Chi IV. The KTX concentrations, with which half-maximal binding of125I-KTX was obtained, were determined for Chi III to Chi VI (Table II). Apparently, KTX had the highest affinity for Chi III and Chi IV (IC50 ∼ 0.2 nm). Chi VI, containing an additional modification (Met-81) in subregion III, showed a 6-fold reduced KTX binding affinity in comparison to Chi IV. The results showed a saturable specific binding of 125I-KTX to Chi IV (and Chi V) under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 4 B). A single isotherm was fit to the data, with K d = 0.37 nm andB max = 12.2 fmol/ng of purified Chi IV protein and with K d = 2.25 nm andB max = 13.1 fmol/ng purified Chi V protein (Table II). The B max values were in the expected range for active purified KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras, which theoretically should be 12.3 fmol/ng. This indicated that the KTX binding activity of the purified KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras was close to 100%. Also, the fitted equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were in good agreement with the IC50 values obtained in the competition experiments (Table II). In additional competition experiments with125I-KTX, we have assayed the binding of HgTX1and AgTX2 to Chi IV. The toxin concentrations, with which half-maximal binding of 125I-KTX was obtained (IC50), were 2.2 nm (n = 3) for HgTX1 and 6.4 nm (n = 3) for AgTX2 (F"

We performed a detailed analysis of the binding of GDNF and neurturin to their receptors and investigated the influence of cRET on the binding affinities. We show that the rate of dissociation of125I-GDNF from GFRα1 is increased in the presence of 50 nm GDNF, an effect that can be explained by the occurrence of negative cooperativity. Scatchard plots of the ligand concentration binding isotherms reveal a pronounced downward curvature at low 125I-GDNF concentrations suggesting the presence of positive cooperativity. This effect is observed in the range of GDNF concentrations responsible for biological activity (1–20 pm) and may have an important role in cRET-independent signaling. A high affinity site with a KD of 11 pm for 125I-GDNF is detected only when GFRα1 is co-expressed with cRET at a DNA ratio of 1:3. These results suggest an interaction of GFRα1 and cRET in the absence of GDNF and demonstrate that the high affinity binding can be measured only when cRET is present.

It was reported that persephin binds to GFRα4 and that co-expression of GFRα4 and cRET results in a receptor complex that can be activated by persephin and not by GDNF and NTN (25Enokido Y. de Sauvage F.

In this report we describe the first detailed characterization of125I-GDNF and 125I-NTN binding to the GFRα1 and GFRα2 receptors. We have established conditions for the binding of GDNF and NTN to the full-length receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and to recombinant fusion proteins, thus permitting a detailed pharmacological characterization. This study demonstrates that the presence of cold GDNF influences the rate of dissociation of iodinated GDNF. Further, we provide evidence for positive and negative cooperative interactions and propose a binding model that includes the cooperativity and the influence of cRET on binding kinetics. Our investigations demonstrate that the presence of the high affinity site can only be detected if a sufficient amount of cRET is present. 125I-GDNF (2100–2400 Ci/mmol) and125I-NTN (2100–5500 Ci/mmol) were custom labeled by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant human GDNF and the expression vector Signal pIg plus containing a cDNA for human IgG1-Fc domain were purchased from R&D Systems Europe Ltd. (Abingdon, UK). Recombinant protein A-Sepharose, polyvinyl toluene protein A-coated SPA beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Multiscreen filter plates (MW 96, 0.65 μm) and Durapore membranes (25 mm, 0.65 μm) were from Millipore (Brussels, Belgium). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F12 (1:1) medium, fetal calf serum and LipofectAMINE plus transfection reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. Serum-free HyQ CCM5 medium was from HyClone Europe S.A. (Erembodegem-Aalst, Belgium). The full-length cRET cDNA (long isoform) inserted into pRc/CMV plasmid was a gift from Dr. Masahide Takahashi, Nagoya University, Japan. Pioneer sensor chip F1, amine coupling kit, HEPES-buffered saline containing 3.5 mm EDTA and 0.05% P-20 buffer, and acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were from Biacore (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Native Taq polymerase, PCR buffer with MgCl2, the ExpandTM high fidelity PCR system, ampicillin, and all restriction enzymes used were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A 10 mm dNTP mixture was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The Qiagen plasmid mini- and maxi-DNA purification kits, the Qiaquick gel extraction kit, and the Qiaquick PCR purification kit were purchased from Qiagen GmbH (Düsseldorf, Germany). All PCR reactions were performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 9600 cycler (Perkin-Elmer). A human substantia nigra cDNA library and placenta Marathon ReadyTM cDNA were fromCLONTECH Laboratories. The human GFRα1 coding sequence was cloned from a human substantia nigra cDNA library. The translated cDNA sequence obtained is identical to protein sequences found by other groups (GenBankTM accession numbers AF038421and AF042080). The human GFRα2 coding sequence was cloned using an EST clone detected as a GFRα1 homologue in the EMBL data base (accession numberH12981) in combination with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions on placenta Marathon ReadyTM cDNA. The translated cDNA sequence of the full-length plasmid construct was identical to the GFRα2 protein sequence present in the SwissProt data base (accession number O00451). The cDNA regions of GFRα1 and GFRα2 (coding for amino acid residues 27–427 and 28–371, respectively) excluding the sequences coding for the signal peptide and for the COOH-terminal hydrophobic region involved in glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchoring were amplified by PCR using primers incorporating HindIII andBamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The resulting products were cloned in-frame in the expression vector Signal pIg plus. The inserts of all constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. The resulting proteins expressed from these constructs contain a 17-amino acid NH2-terminal CD33 signal peptide, the respective GFRα protein region, and a 243-amino acid COOH-terminal human IgG1-Fc fusion domain. Because of the highly GC-rich nature of the human NTN DNA sequence (Accession no.U78110) a synthetic gene was prepared covering the coding sequence of mature human NTN using the codon preferences of highly expressed enteric bacteria genes. Primer set pairs were denatured to 90 °C in a heating block and slowly cooled to room temperature at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The resulting annealed double-stranded fragments were ligated together and amplified by PCR using the Expand High FidelityTM PCR system according to the manufacturer instructions. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pRSETb, which added a 6-His tag at the amino terminus of the mature NTN protein. NTN expression and purification were performed as described previously (14Credoon D.J. Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Osborne P.A. Lampe P.A. Fahrer T.J. Heuckeroth R.O. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 89: 9509-9513Google Scholar). CHO cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with GFRα1 cloned into pcDNA3 using a calcium phosphate method. All other transfections with GFRα1–2 in pcDNA3, cRET in pIREShygro, and GFRα1–2 in Signal plg plus were performed using an optimized LipofectAMINE PLUS method. For this, a total amount of 6.5 μg of DNA was incubated with 17.5 μl of PLUS reagent in 750 μl of serum-free medium for 15 min at room temperature. LipofectAMINE was diluted 50-fold into serum-free culture medium; 750 μl of this mixture was added to the DNA solution. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 3.5 ml of serum-free medium was added, and the mixture was brought onto the cells (in a 100-mm Petri dish). The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, after which a 5-ml culture medium, containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, was added. 24 h later, the medium was changed into regular culture medium. Transfection efficiencies using these optimized conditions were typically ∼50–60%. For permanent transfections the selection medium contained either 800 μg of G418 or 800 μg of G418 and 800 μg of hygromycin. Antibiotic-resistant clones were expanded and assayed for GFRα1 expression by binding to 125I-GDNF. A CHO clone permanently expressing GFRα1 was used for generation of a GFRα1/cRET-expressing clone. Clones were assayed for cRET expression or GFRα1–2-Fc expression using specific antibodies. For some experiments, transiently transfected cells were used 48 h following a transfection. For purification of GFRα-Fc fusion proteins, CHO cells permanently expressing fusion proteins were grown in serum-free medium (HyQ CCM5) that was collected every 3 days. Medium was centrifuged and applied to a recombinant protein A column. Bound protein was eluted with 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 3.0, and collected into 1m Tris buffer, pH 8.4 (dilution ratio 1:6). Protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.5. For cell suspension binding experiments, CHO cells were collected, counted, and transferred to prewetted Multiscreen filter plates (MW 96, Millipore, 0.65 μm). Routinely, 100,000–120,000 cells were used/well. Plates were kept on ice. Cells were incubated with 0.25 ml of binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 125I-GDNF or125I-NTN with or without cold ligands for 2 h at 4 °C. Following the 2-h incubation, plates were transferred on a Multiscreen vacuum filtration manifold, and supernatants were filtered. Cells were washed two times with washing buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and filters were punched out and counted in a γ counter. In some experiments transiently transfected cells were used. Following transient transfection, binding was performed 48 h later as described above. The rate of association of GDNF to GFRα1 or GFRα1/cRET was determined using transiently transfected cells (GFRα1/cRET DNA transfection ratio 1:1). Whole cells were incubated at 4 °C with 50 pm125I-GDNF in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of cold GDNF. At different time points after the addition of 125I-GDNF, samples were filtered on a Multiscreen vacuum filtration manifold. The rate of dissociation was determined at 4 °C in two different ways, by adding excess cold ligand and by a large dilution of assay medium. For each method, permanently transfected cells were incubated with 50 pm125I-GDNF for 2 h to achieve binding equilibrium. To initiate displacement, a 1000-fold excess of cold GDNF was added at different time points, and samples were filtered on a Multiscreen vacuum filtration manifold. For the dilution method, cells preincubated for 2 h were diluted 100-fold with cold incubation medium and filtered using a single filter filtration flask and 25-mm Durapore filters, 0.65 μm at different time points after dilution. Binding was performed in MW 96 plates. GFRα-Fc fusion proteins at a concentration of 100–300 ng/ml were precoated to protein A SPA beads (0.5 mg/ml) overnight. Following precoating, beads were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Precoated SPA beads were then incubated with 125I-GDNF or 125I-NTN in the presence or absence of cold ligands. After a 24-h incubation at room temperature, plates were counted in a MicroBeta Trilux scintillation counter (Wallac). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses were performed at 25 °C with a BIAcore 2000 biosensor. The carboxylated matrix of a F sensor chip was first activated with a 1:1 mixture of 400 mm N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminepropyl)-carbodiimide and 100 mm N-hydroxy-succinimide. Then, recombinant GDNF or NTN was applied on the activated surface in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% P-20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Unoccupied reactive groups were deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine HCl. For kinetic experiments, soluble fusion proteins were applied at concentrations of 0.8–25 nm for GFRα1-Fc and 1.5–100 nm for GFRα2-Fc in HEPES-buffered saline containing 3.5 mm EDTA and 0.05% P-20 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmEDTA, 0.05% P-20, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). GFRα1-Fc and GFRα2-Fc were perfused over the immobilized ligands at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 2 min. The dissociation was monitored for 3 min followed by regeneration with 5 mm NaOH. The BIAcore evaluation software, 3.0.1 was used to calculate the association rate (ka ), dissociation rate (kd ), and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD ). Data on equilibrium binding were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm with the mass transfer to the primary data. Ligand concentration binding isotherms and competition binding isotherms were analyzed via nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA) to determine the maximal number of binding sites (B max) and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD ) or the IC50 values. Assuming simple competition, the competition data were fitted according to both one- and two-site mass action binding models, and the better model was determined by an extra-sum-of-squares test using Prism. Data from dissociation and association kinetic experiments were analyzed by Prism according to both monoexponential and biexponential models to estimate kd and k ob, the radioligand dissociation and association apparent rate constants. The association and dissociation rates of the GDNF-receptor and NTN-receptor complexes were studied using CHO cells and a filtration assay at 4 °C. The association curves are shown in Fig. 1,A–B. The observed rate of association (k ob) of 125I-GDNF with GFRα1 receptors transiently expressed in CHO cells was 8.9 × 10−4 s−1 (TableI). A similar observed rate of association of GDNF was obtained with GFRα1/cRET receptors. The DNA ratio used for transient expression of GFRα1 and cRET was 1:1. The association rate of NTN with GFRα2 and NTN with GFRα2/cRET were in the same range (Table I). To study dissociation, intact CHO cells permanently expressing GFRα1 and GFRα2 with or without cRET were incubated with a radiolabeled ligand for 2 h at 4 °C, and dissociation was induced either by an addition of excess of cold ligand or by dilution. The dissociation curves are shown in Fig. 1,C–F. Dissociation, induced by the addition of unlabeled GDNF (50 nm) was very rapid. The derived rate of dissociation (kd ) of 125I-GDNF from GFRα1 receptor was 9.1 × 10−3 s−1(Table I). In contrast, the rate of dissociation initiated by a 100-fold dilution was 10 times slower. The rate of dissociation obtained with the GFRα1-cRET receptor complex was in the same range. The dissociation constants obtained with 125I-NTN and GFRα2 receptors, measured by the addition of unlabeled NTN (50 nm) were much slower in comparison to 125I-GDNF dissociation from GFRα1 receptors (Table I). When the rate of dissociation was determined by dilution, it was also very slow, with at½ of more than 130 min for both GFRα2 and GFRα2-cRET receptor complexes (Table I).Table IApparent association and dissociation constants for 125 I-GDNF and 125 I-NTN on GFRα receptors obtained in whole cell assays at 4 °CReceptorLigandk obt 1/2k d 50 nmligandt 1/2k d Dilutiont 1/2s −1ss −1ss −1sGFRα1GDNF8.9 × 10−4 (3)7799.1 × 10−3 (2)769.0 × 10−4 (4)766GFRα1/cRETGDNF11.7 × 10−4 (3)6035.4 × 10−3 (2)1286.4 × 10−4 (4)1091GFRα2NTN2.5 × 10−4 (2)27221.3 × 10−4 (3)55697.3 × 10−5 (1)9561GFRα2/cRETNTN2.7 × 10−4 (2)25811.1 × 10−4 (3)61448.5 × 10−5 (1)8141Radioligand binding studies were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Association and dissociation equilibrium constants were derived from (n) individual curves.

Mean curves are shown in Fig. 1. Equilibrium saturation isotherms of 125I-GDNF binding to cells expressing either GFRα1 alone or with cRET were determined using intact cells in suspension at 4 °C. Equilibrium saturation binding isotherms are shown in Figs.2 and 3. When GFRα1 was expressed alone either transiently or as a permanent clone, only a low affinity site was observed (TableII), with apparentKD values of 613 and 317 pm,respectively. The binding levels (B max values) were 571 and 273 fmol/mg protein, respectively. A higher level of binding was obtained with cells permanently expressing GFRα1 and cRET (B max = 981 fmol/mg protein) with aKD of 356 pm (Fig. 3 B and Table II). When GFRα1 was transiently co-expressed with cRET at DNA ratios GFRα1/cRET 3:1 and 1:3, the affinity was increasing with an increased amount of cRET cDNA (Fig. 2, B–D), whereas the B max declined (Table II). Although no high affinity site with a KD below 20 pmwas observed, Scatchard analysis of the binding in the permanently and transiently expressing cell lines showed curvilinear plots at concentrations below 10 pm. These results suggest the presence of positively cooperative interactions at low concentrations of the ligand. Only when the DNA ratio in transiently transfected cells was 1:3, was there an indication of the presence of a small percentage of high affinity sites (Fig. 2 D). To confirm the presence of the high affinity site with this DNA ratio, a detailed analysis of binding was performed at concentrations of 125I-GDNF below 20 pm (Fig. 2, E–F). With a GFRα1/cRET DNA ratio of 1:3, the high affinity site with a KD of 11 pm and a B max of 12 fmol/mg protein was revealed. In contrast, a DNA ratio of 3:1 did not result in a saturable binding at these low concentrations of iodinated GDNF (result not shown). These data clearly demonstrate the presence of the high affinity site when cRET is expressed in a sufficient amount. Only when a sufficient number of cRET receptors is present, interaction of cRET and GFRα1 results in the presentation of a small number of GFRα1-cRET receptor complex in a high affinity conformation. Control experiments with varying amounts of GFRα1 alone (1–6.5 μg) did not result in a saturable binding at low concentrations of iodinated GDNF, suggesting that changes in GFRα1 protein levels are not responsible for the presence of the high affinity site.Figure 3Saturation binding isotherms and Scatchard plots of 125I-GDNF binding to GFRα1 and GFRα1/cRET receptors using permanently transfected CHO cells. Binding was performed on whole cells with a range of 125I-GDNF concentrations for 2 h at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 500-fold excess of cold GDNF. The data represent a typical saturation experiment (A) and derived Scatchard plots (B) with CHO cells permanently expressing GFRα1 (●) and GFRα1/cRET (○).

Glucose stimulation (2–20 mm) resulted in a 4-fold increase in Egr-1 mRNA at 30 min, as did the depolarizing agents KCl and tolbutamide. This response was inhibited by diazoxide and EGTA, indicating that β-cell depolarization and Ca2+ influx, respectively, are essential. Pharmacological inhibition of the Egr-1 induction by H89 (48%) and calmidazolium (35%), but not by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 and 2 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, implied that protein kinase A and Ca2+/calmodulin pathways are involved. Deletion mapping of the Egr-1 promoter revealed that the proximal −198 base pairs containing two serum response elements (SREs) and one cAMP-response element retained the depolarization response.

The ability to produce insulin is proportional to the islet mass that is defined by a balance between rates of proliferation and apoptosis. Several growth factors have been shown to stimulate pancreatic β-cell replication (1Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Welsh M. Mares J. Oberg C. Karlsson T. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1993; 9: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During pregnancy, insulin resistance results in a marked increase in β-cell mass, and growth hormone and prolactin treatment have been shown to increase β-cell proliferation (3Nielsen J.H. Linde S. Welinder B.S. Billestrup N. Madsen O.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H.

Other growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1, hepatocyte growth factor, and nerve growth factor, have also been implicated in β-cell mitogenesis and differentiation (1Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6Swenne I. Hill D.J. Strain A.J. Milner R.D. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 288-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Beattie G.M.

Nutrients including glucose and certain essential amino acids have been shown to increase β-cell proliferation and increase islet β-cell mass (1Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In insulin resistance states, such as obesity for example, impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal results in increased plasma glucose levels, and this mechanism is thought to be essential for the hyperinsulinemic response of β-cells. Glucose induces pleiotropic effects in islet β-cells, and these effects are potentially mediated by activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Glucose metabolism results in the alteration of ATP/ADP levels leading to closure of nucleotide regulated K+ channels (KATP). KATP channel inhibition results in depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx has been implicated in the activation of calmodulin (CaM)1 kinases (CamKs) II and IV, protein kinases A (PKA) and C, extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in islet β-cells (9Khoo S.

The relationships between activation of these pathways and growth responses induced by glucose have not been defined. Changes in gene expression profiles that result from the activation of these signaling pathways are responsible for the adaptation of β-cell mass to physiological and pathological states. The specific expression profile includes the induction of immediate early genes (IEGs). IEGs are rapidly activated by initiation of signal transduction pathways, and their activation does not require protein synthesis (13Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways for induction of IEGs exhibit considerable stimulus and tissue specificity and in general involve activation of kinase/phosphatase cascades (13Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Often, IEGs are transcription factors that in turn activate expression of downstream target genes generating distinct biological responses by inducing specific long term programs of gene expression (13Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). The IEG responses are not restricted to genes that control cell cycle reentry but also include genes that participate in other biological processes. IEGs are universally expressed, and the signal transduction pathways leading to activation of these genes have been extensively studied in numerous tissues. Glucose and other nutrients have been shown to transcriptionally activate several IEGs, including Egr-1 in insulinoma cell lines and pancreatic islets, in a Ca2+-dependent manner (14Susini S. Roche E. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Josefsen K. Sorensen L.R. Buschard K. Birkenbach M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Egr-1 is a zinc-finger DNA binding transcription factor that is expressed in multiple tissues and is induced by diverse stimuli of which the best studied examples have been the treatment with peptide mitogens (16Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 17Lemaire P. Revelant O. Bravo R. Charnay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Egr-1 mRNA has been shown to be increased by treatment with glucose, cAMP, and several glucoincretins in insulinoma cells and rat islets (14Susini S. Roche E. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Josefsen K. Sorensen L.R. Buschard K. Birkenbach M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The promoter elements involved in Egr-1 transcription by depolarization have not been defined. The genomic 5′-flanking sequence of the murine Egr-1 contains activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites, a cAMP-responsive element (CRE), and serum response elements (SRE). Of these elements only the CRE has been implicated in Ca2+ induction of the glucagon gene in pancreatic β-cells (19Susini S. van Haasteren G. Li S.L. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CRE was also essential for the induction of c-fos by the combination of glucose and glucoincretins in INS-1 cells (19Susini S. van Haasteren G. Li S.L. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, nothing is known about SRE-dependent transcription of any gene in pancreatic islet β-cells. In the current studies, we sought to define the mechanisms whereby glucose-induced depolarization and Ca2+ influx activates Egr-1 transcription in insulinoma cells. We describe the signal transduction pathways, trans-activating factors, and thecis-regulatory elements involved in this process. We demonstrate that β-cell depolarization triggers a cascade of events in which Ca2+ influx leads to the activation of PKA and Ca2+/CaM. The initiation of these signaling pathways leads to activation of CREB and SRF, a transcription factor involved in growth responses. This activation results in Egr-1 induction predominantly through five SRE elements in its proximal promoter. These studies for the first time link the potential role of SRE-dependent transcription as a mechanism for glucose effect in pancreatic β-cell mass.

Efrat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) were cultured in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% FBS. βTC6-F7 and MIN6 cells were used between passages 16–42 and 26–35, respectively. For the analysis of expression, cells that were 70–80% confluent were switched to regular DMEM containing 2 mm glucose for 20–24 h (time zero of the experiments). The indicated agent was added directly to the medium, and cells were incubated as described in the figure legends followed by a 45-min incubation in the same medium containing the indicated agents. Pharmacologic inhibitors were added 60 min prior to stimulation of the cells with glucose or other agents, using the concentrations of inhibitors given in the figure legends. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by the capillary blotting technique. RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation. The cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the High-Prime Labeling System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization (2–4 h) and hybridization were carried out at 56 °C in Church solution (22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Hybridized blots were washed once with 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice at 54 °C for 15 min. The membranes were exposed overnight at −80 °C using intensifying screens. Messenger RNA levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics) and were normalized to those of β-actin. For reverse transcriptase-PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Superscript Preamplification System and random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was done according to the manufacturer's protocol with addition of [32P] dCTP to the PCR mixture. PCR products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray films. Results were normalized to those of β-actin. The primers for Egr-1, Egr-3, and NGFI-C have been described previously (23Mack K.J. Yi S.D. Chang S. Millan N. Mack P. Mol. Brain.

Pancreatic islets were cultured in RPMI medium containing 5 mm glucose for 48 h and stimulated by adding glucose to a final concentration of 25 mm for 45 min. Plasmids containing the rat Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, and NGFI-C cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Milbrandt (Washington University School of Medicine). The plasmids containing the murine Egr-1 promoter linked to the luciferase vector pXP2 constructs were generously provided by Dr. David Cohen (Oregon Health Sciences University) and have been described in detail previously (26Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The pmEgr-1200 contains 1.2 kilobase of 5′-flanking region of the mouse Egr-1 gene (GenBankTM accession numberX12617). The pmEgr-510 construct included sequences −511 to −1013 bp; the pmEgrAP1 construct contains nucleotides −1 to −386 plus −886 to −1000 (from sequence X12617). Plasmids containing nucleotides −532 to +100 (prEgr-532), −198 to +100 (prEgr-198), and −109 to +100 (prEgr-109) of the rat gene subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2 (Promega) were obtained from J. Milbrandt. Thecis-reporter plasmid pSRE-luc (5XSRE-luc) contains the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) joined to five tandem repeats of the c-fos SRE and CRE, respectively (Stratagene). The CREB-GAL4 system includes atrans-activator plasmid that expresses a fusion protein containing the activator domain of CREB fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (residues 1–147) (CREB-GAL4) (Stratagene), cotransfected with a reporter gene containing a synthetic promoter with five tandem repeats of the yeast GAL4 binding sites that control expression of the luciferase gene pRC-LUC (Stratagene). The SRF-GAL4 fusion vector and a constitutively active form of CaMKIV (CaMKIVCT) were a gift from Dr. Michael Greenberg and have been described previously (27Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the catalytic unit of PKA (pFC-PKA) was purchased from Stratagene. The killer CREB (KCREB) construct was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Goodman and has been described previously (28Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, KCREB contains an amino acid substitution within the leucine zipper that results in KCREB-CREB heterodimers with no DNA binding function. The pRL-TK control vector contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the Renilla luciferase (Promega). MIN6 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE and Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the suggested amounts of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were plated in 6-well plates 4 days prior to transfection. Cells at about 80% confluence were transfected by mixing the indicated amount of DNA described in the figure legends, and a lipid mixture containing a 1:2 ratio of LipofectAMINE and Plus Reagent in 1 ml of OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following 4 h of incubation, 1 ml of DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 2% serum was added to the cells. After 12 h, the medium·DNA complexes were replaced by preincubation medium containing DMEM with 5 mmglucose, 2% FBS, and the cells were left for 24 h. At the end of the 24 h the specific stimulating agent was added to the medium, and the cells were harvested 6 h later. For the overexpression experiments with pFC-PKA and CaMKIVCT, MIN6 cells were transfected as above, followed by incubation in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 2% FBS for 30 h until harvesting. Total DNA was maintained constant in all the transfection experiments by using the empty vector of the respective cDNA to be overexpressed. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, 1 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid was simultaneously transfected. All results are normalized for transfection efficiency and expressed as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase.

Nuclear extracts from MIN6 cells cultured under regular DMEM containing 25 mm glucose were prepared essentially as described previously (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), and protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lysates (5 μg of protein) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl containing binding buffer (final concentrations, 4% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothretinol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 200 ng of poly(dI-dC), and double-stranded γ-32P-oligonucleotide. Binding reactions proceeded at room temperature for 30 min and were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In assays where antibodies directed against SRF (1:10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and SRF phosphorylated at Ser103 (1:10) were tested, these were preincubated with the nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature (30Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cell lysis was performed using 400 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renillaluciferase were measured by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using 20 μl of cell lysate. Luciferase activity was measured in a Monolight 3010 luminometer. Because of the absence of an f1 origin in pmEgr-1200, the pmEgr1.2 64 CRE construct was made by subcloning the 1.2-kilobase insert from pmEgr1.2 into pBluescript SK(+). Mutagenesis was performed in the pBluescript SK(+) construct, and the mutated insert was then subcloned back into the original luciferase reporter vector PXP2. The CRE mutation was performed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis without the phenotypic selection method (31Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 8.0.3-8.5.9Google Scholar). In brief, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA template was obtained by transforming CJ236 and growing overnight in TY medium with lambda phage followed by polyethylene glycol/NaCl and ethanol precipitation. A kinased oligonucleotide that produced a CRE mutation proven to be effective in other promoters were used: 5′-GGA TGG GAG GGC TCA TCA CAA CTC CGG GTC CTC (mutated nucleotides are underlined) (32Taupenot L. Mahata S.K. Wu H. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Double-stranded template was obtained by primer extension and T4 DNA ligase. Finally, Jm109 competent cells were transformed with 1 μl of the primer extension reaction. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Cells were lysed with buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 0.01 mdithiothreitol, and half a tablet of “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After boiling, proteins were separated by electrophoresis though 10% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 0.2% I-Block (Tropix) and 1:1000 Tween 20. Subsequently, the membranes were hybridized at 4 °C overnight in blocking buffer containing the CREB and the phospho-CREB antibody with the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). After three washes at room temperature the membranes were incubated in secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody for 1 h. After washing for 1 h, immunodetection was performed with ECL Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. To establish a model system to study the transcriptional regulation of Egr-1 in pancreatic β-cells, insulinoma cell lines that have been shown to secrete insulin in response to glucose in the physiological range were investigated (20Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Following preincubation of βTC6-F7 cells for 20 h in 2 mm glucose, the addition of glucose to a final concentration of 25 mm resulted in increased Egr-1 mRNA levels between 30 and 60 min (4-fold, p < 0.01) that returned to basal levels by 2 h (Fig.1 A). Similar responses to glucose stimulation were also noted in MIN6 insulinoma cells and in primary cultures of isolated rat pancreatic islets (data not shown), and these responses were shown to be glucose dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). The half-maximal response of Egr-1 transcription is in the same range as that observed for insulin secretion in this cell line (20Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Egr-2 (NGFI-B or Krox 20) mRNA, but not Egr-3 mRNA, was also induced by glucose under the same conditions (data not shown). Mannose, the metabolizable epimer in position 2 of glucose, increased expression of Egr-1 mRNA, whereas nonmetabolizable sugars 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methylglucose had no effect (data not shown). These results are similar to those previously reported and confirm that glucose metabolism is required for Egr-1 induction (15Josefsen K. Sorensen L.R. Buschard K. Birkenbach M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Glucose metabolism is known to have several effects, the major one being depolarization through inhibition of KATP channels. Egr-1 mRNA was induced in insulinoma cells by tolbutamide and KCl, agents known to depolarize islet β-cells, with the same time course as that following glucose stimulation (data not shown), and this induction was Ca2+-dependent (Fig.1 C). To determine whether glucose induction of Egr-1 resulted solely from inactivation of KATP channels or additionally through increased glycolytic intermediates insulinoma cells (βTC6-F7) were treated with glucose in the presence of diazoxide, an agent that hyperpolarizes the cell through activation of islet KATP channels. Treatment with this agent resulted in complete inhibition of Egr-1 mRNA induction (Fig. 1 D), indicating that this response to glucose was solely dependent on depolarization and subsequent Ca2+ influx. Activation of PKA by cAMP has been shown to be one of the major regulators of c-fos transcription in INS-1 insulinoma cells (19Susini S. van Haasteren G. Li S.L. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, to evaluate the effect of PKA activation on Egr-1, MIN6 cells were treated with forskolin. This treatment resulted in similar induction of Egr-1 mRNA, and the response to both stimuli was greater than that to either alone (Fig. 1 D). Specific pharmacological inhibitors were utilized to begin to define the signal transduction pathways involved in glucose and depolarization induction of Egr-1. The CaM and PKA pathways were assessed by the addition of the CaM inhibitor calmidazolium (10 μm) or the PKA inhibitor H89 (20 μm) (33Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T.

Niidome T. Sawada K. Nishizawa Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 587-593PubMed Google Scholar). Calmidazolium and H89 independently reduced the glucose induction of Egr-1 mRNA to 70% (p < 0.01) and to 56% (p < 0.01), respectively (TableI). Simultaneous inhibition of the PKA and CaM pathways resulted in a combined suppression to 40% of control (p < 0.001). Glucose has been shown to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in a Ca2+-dependent manner (9Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

The specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor PD98059 (100 μm) used at concentrations known to inhibit these enzymes in other systems had no significant effect on Egr-1 mRNA induction by glucose (34Kuwada M.

https://openalex.org/W2020831379,"Fibrillarin is a key nucleolar protein in eukaryotes which associates with box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) directing 2'-O-ribose methylation of the rRNA. In this study we describe two genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtFib1 and AtFib2, encoding nearly identical proteins conserved with eukaryotic fibrillarins. We demonstrate that AtFib1 and AtFib2 proteins are functional homologs of the yeast Nop1p (fibrillarin) and can rescue a yeast NOP1-null mutant strain. Surprisingly, for the first time in plants, we identified two isoforms of a novel box C/D snoRNA, U60.1f and U60.2f, nested in the fifth intron of AtFib1 and AtFib2. Interestingly after gene duplication the host intronic sequences completely diverged, but the snoRNA was conserved, even in other crucifer fibrillarin genes. We show that the U60f snoRNAs accumulate in seedlings and that their targeted residue on the 25 S rRNA is methylated. Our data reveal that the three modes of expression of snoRNAs, single, polycistronic, and intronic, exist in plants and suggest that the mechanisms directing rRNA methylation, dependent on fibrillarin and box C/D snoRNAs, are evolutionarily conserved in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2063737459,"The non-protein amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), owing to its structural similarity to the protein amino acids methionine, isoleucine, and leucine, enters first steps of protein synthesis and is activated by methionyl-, isoleucyl-, and leucyl-tRNA synthetases in vivo. However, translational incorporation of Hcy into protein is prevented by editing mechanisms of these synthetases, which convert misactivated Hcy into thiolactone. The lack of efficient interactions of the side chain of Hcy with the specificity subsite of the synthetic/editing active site is a prerequisite for editing of Hcy. Thus, if the side chain thiol of Hcy were reversibly modified with a small molecule that would enhance its binding to the specificity subsite and prevent editing, such modified Hcy is predicted to be transferred to tRNA and incorporated translationally into protein. Here I show thatS-nitroso-Hcy is in fact transferred to tRNA by methionyl-tRNA synthetase and incorporated into protein by the bacterium Escherichia coli. S-Nitroso-Hcy-tRNA also supports translation of mRNAs in a rabbit reticulocyte system. Removal of the nitroso group yields Hcy-tRNA and protein containing Hcy in peptide bonds.

Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press, New York1998: 573-607Google Scholar). The non-protein amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), an obligatory precursor of methionine in all cell types, presents a major problem for translation, because it is misactivated by MetRS, IleRS, LeuRS, ValRS, and LysRS (2.Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, www.els.net. Nature Publishing Group, London2000Google Scholar). However, the misactivated Hcy is never transferred to tRNA (4.Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8088-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Essentially absolute selectivity of these enzymes against Hcy is maintained by proofreading, or editing, mechanisms that convert the Hcy∼AMP intermediate to Hcy thiolactone (6.Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Continuous editing of Hcy is maintained during the process of charging a tRNA with its cognate amino acid by MetRS, IleRS, and LeuRS in vivo(7.Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2000; 87: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). MetRS directs methionine and Hcy into the synthetic and editing pathways, respectively, by employing the following three subsites of the synthetic/editing active site (3.Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, www.els.net. Nature Publishing Group, London2000Google Scholar, 13.Kim H.Y. Ghosh G. Schulman L.H. Brunie S. Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar): (i) a subsite containing Asp-52 and Arg-233 that bind α-amino and -carboxyl groups, respectively, of the amino acid substrates; (ii) the specificity subsite, containing Trp-305, Phe-197, and Tyr-15, that preferentially binds the side chain of the cognate substrate methionine; (iii) the thiol-binding subsite that interacts with the side chain thiol of Hcy and facilitates thioester bond formation during editing; this site also accepts any thiol mimicking the side chain of Hcy. IleRS employs a similar thiol-binding subsite to facilitate editing of Hcy (15.Jakubowski H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2505-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the synthetic pathway, intermolecular reaction of the activated carboxyl group of methionine with the 2′-hydroxyl of the terminal adenosine of tRNAMet yields Met-tRNAMet. In the editing pathway, intramolecular reaction of the activated carboxyl group of Hcy with the sulfur of its side chain yields thiolactone. Whether an amino acid is transferred to tRNA or edited is determined by the competition for its activated carboxyl group between the side chain of the amino acid and the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNA (13.Kim H.Y. Ghosh G. Schulman L.H. Brunie S. Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 87: 11553-11557Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MetRS transfers methionine to tRNA, because the side chain of methionine is firmly bound in the specificity subsite of the active site by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions with Trp-305, Phe-197, and Tyr-15, respectively. In contrast, the side chain of Hcy, missing the methyl group of methionine, cannot interact with the specificity subsite as strongly as the side chain of methionine does. This allows the side chain of Hcy to bind in the editing (or thiol-binding) subsite (3.Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, www.els.net. Nature Publishing Group, London2000Google Scholar, 14.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which facilitates the intramolecular reaction between the activated carboxyl group and the side chain thiol of Hcy (Fig. 1). Thus, keeping the side chain of Hcy in the specificity subsite is predicted to prevent its editing and favor the transfer to tRNA. A possible way to achieve this is by utilizing S-nitrosothiol chemistry. Here I show that MetRS uses S-nitroso-Hcy as a substrate in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction, formingS-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA, and that S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA transfers S-nitroso-Hcy into protein. Plasmid-encoded gene forEscherichia coli MetRS was overexpressed in E. coli strain JM101 as described before (16.Gao W. Goldman E. Jakubowski H.

Tirrell (Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). The strain requires methionine for growth because of the insertion of the transposon Tn10 into the metE gene, which is essential for the final step of methionine biosynthesis. E. coli MetRS was purified to homogeneity from the overproducing strain as described before (13.Kim H.Y. Ghosh G. Schulman L.H. Brunie S. Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), based on the digestion of methionine to Hcy thiolactone in the presence of hydriodic acid, was used with the following modifications. 250 nmol of l-Met was combined with 5 mCi of carrier-freel-[35S]Met (0.3-ml aqueous solution containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 1-ml glass ampoule and lyophilized on a Speed-Vac. The residue was dissolved in 0.15 ml of 57% hydriodic acid containing 1% hypophosphorous acid (Aldrich). To serve as a refluxing tube, a 12-cm glass tube was attached, by flame-sealing, at the tip of the ampoule. The ampoule was then placed on a heating block, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 4.5 h at 128 °C. After digestion, the resulting crude preparation of l-[35S]Hcy thiolactone was lyophilized, dissolved in 20 μl of water, and purified by 2D TLC on cellulose plates (20 × 10 cm) (Eastman Kodak Co.) using butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1, v/v) as the first-dimension solvent and 2-propanol/ethyl acetate/water (5:5:1, v/v) as the second-dimension solvent (7.Jakubowski H.

Thiolactone spot, localized under UV light and by autoradiography, was scraped off the plate and eluted with 2 mm HCl. The overall yield of the procedure was 65%. The preparation of l-[35S]Hcy thiolactone was at least 96% pure on analytical 2D TLC. Maximum levels of contamination with Met, Hcy, and homocysteine were <1, <0.8, and <1%, respectively. l-[35S]Hcy thiolactone (5 mm, 20,000 Ci/mol) was hydrolyzed to completion by treatment with 0.1 m NaOH at room temperature for 10 min. Because the hydrolysis was carried out in normal room atmosphere, [35S]Hcy was mostly oxidized to [35S]homocystine. The solution was neutralized with 0.1m NaH2PO4, and [35S]homocystine was reduced to [35S]Hcy by treatment with 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 15 min. Fresh [35S]Hcy was prepared for each experiment. S-Nitrosylation of 1 mml-[35S]Hcy (20,000 Ci/mol) or 50 mml-Hcy was carried out using equimolar amounts of NaNO2 in 0.1 m HCl (19.Stamler J.S.

The solution of l-[S-nitroso-35S]Hcy, neutralized with Na2HPO4, can be stored at −70 °C for at least two weeks. All assays were performed at 37 °C in a standard buffer containing 0.1 m potassium-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA.

Radiolabeled ATP and PPi, separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) using 3 mammonium sulfate as a solvent, were quantitated by scintillation counting.

For tRNA aminoacylation with methionine, 5 μm [35S]Met and 0.02–2 μmMetRS were used. Radiolabeled aminoacyl-tRNA were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and quantitated by scintillation counting. Unless stated otherwise, editing activity was measured as amino acid-dependent AMP formation from 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (50 Ci/mol) in the presence of 1 mm amino acid and 0.2 μm MetRS in the standard buffer (16.Gao W. Goldman E. Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11528-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 20 μm tRNAMet or tRNAfMet (1600 pmol/A 260, Subriden RNA), 30 μmradiolabeled amino acid (20,000 Ci/mol), 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 μm MetRS in the standard buffer. After 15 min at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol (saturated with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5), and aminoacyl-tRNA was recovered from aqueous layers by precipitation with ethanol. Residual low molecular weight components from aminoacylation mixtures were removed by repeated washes with 70% ethanol. The amounts of aminoacyl-tRNA purified by phenol extraction corresponded to the amounts present in the aminoacylation mixtures, as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The disappearance of [35S]aminoacyl-tRNA, incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of MetRS in the standard buffer, was monitored by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (14.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). First order rate constants, k, were calculated from reaction half-lives, t0.5, according to k=ln2/t0.5.

After the culture reached cell density of 2 × 108 cells/ml, cells were washed twice with unsupplemented M9 and resuspended in M9 containing 10 μm [35S]amino acid (20,000 Ci/mol) in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm IPTG. To monitorl-[S-nitroso-35S]Hcy and other [35S]metabolites, aliquots of bacterial cultures were subjected to TLC (5.Jakubowski H.

Translation of luciferase and globin mRNAs (Promega) was carried out in methionine-free rabbit reticulocyte system according to the manufacturer's procedure (20.PromegaPromega Technical Bulletin 127. Madison, WI1998Google Scholar) using 5 μml-[S-nitroso-35S]Hcy-tRNA or [35S]Met-tRNA. Products of in vivo andin vitro translation were analyzed on 13% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (21.Ausubel, F. M.

Catalytic efficiency forS-nitroso-Hcy was intermediate between those for methionine and Hcy. The k cat value forS-nitroso-Hcy (11.2 s−1) was 7- and 2-fold lower than the k cat values for methionine and Hcy, respectively. The K m value forS-nitroso-Hcy (0.37 mm) was 18.5-fold higher and 14.3-fold lower than the K m values for methionine and Hcy, respectively. The enzyme-bound S-nitroso-Hcy∼AMP intermediate was relatively stable and, in contrast to the Hcy∼AMP intermediate (6.Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was not edited, as determined by the lack ofS-nitroso-Hcy-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Fig.2 B).Table IMethionyl-tRNA synthetase activates S-nitroso-HcyAmino acidk catK mk cat/K ms −1mms −1 m −1S-Nitroso-Hcy11.20.372.9 × 105Hcy235.34.3 × 104Met760.023.8 × 106Activation of S-nitroso-Hcy was measured at pH 7.4, 37 °C in the ATP/PPi exchange reaction as described under “Materials and Methods.” For comparison, data for activation of Hcy and methionine from Ref. 13.Kim H.Y.

S-Nitroso-Hcy was also a substrate in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by MetRS (Fig. 2 A). Non-saturating kinetics were observed with 2–160 μm S-nitroso-Hcy (not shown). Catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) indicate that tRNA aminoacylation with S-nitroso-Hcy is about 80-fold less efficient than the tRNA aminoacylation with methionine (TableII). More than 50% of tRNAMet or tRNAfMet could be charged withS-nitroso-Hcy (Fig. 2 A). As expected (4.Fersht A.R. Dingwall C.

S-Nitroso-Hcy-tRNA, like Met-tRNA, can be isolated from reaction mixtures by phenol extraction. Like Met-tRNA, purified S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA underwent relatively slow deacylation, both in the absence and presence of MetRS (Table III). In the presence of free thiols, S-nitrosothiols undergo fast transnitrosylation reactions (22.Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Similarly, S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA was converted to Hcy-tRNA by treatment with an excess thiol. Hcy-tRNA was about 100 times less stable than S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA (Table III). Deacylations of Hcy-tRNA and S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA yielded Hcy thiolactone and S-nitroso-Hcy, respectively, as products (not shown).Table IIIMethionyl-tRNA synthetase does not deacylate AA-tRNAAA-tRNAHalf-life in the absence of MetRSHalf-life in the presence of MetRSminminS-NO-Hcy-tRNAMet2850S-NO-Hcy-tRNAfMet2570Met-tRNAMet27140Met-tRNAfMet26130Hcy-tRNAMet0.250.5[35S]Aminoacyl-tRNAs (2–5 μm) were deacylated at pH 7.4, 37 °C in the absence and presence of 10 μmMetRS.

Once an amino acid is attached to tRNA, it is destined to become incorporated translationally into protein (23.Chapeville F. Lipman R. von Ehrenstein G. Weisblum B. Ray W.J. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, the facile aminoacylation of tRNA with S-nitroso-Hcy catalyzed by MetRS suggested that S-nitroso-Hcy could be incorporated into protein. To test this, E. coli strain CAG1849/pREP4/pQE15 (17.van Hest J.C.M. Tirrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which produces mouse DHFR protein upon induction with IPTG was employed. The strain is a methionine auxotroph, unable to metabolize Hcy to methionine because of the insertion of the transposon Tn10 into the metE gene. As shown in Fig. 4 A, E. coliutilized S-nitroso-Hcy for incorporation into proteins and, after induction with IPTG, into recombinant mouse DHFR.S-Nitroso-Hcy-DHFR co-migrated with the Met-DHFR on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 B). When [S-nitroso-35S]Hcy-labeled proteins were subjected to hydrolysis by hydrochloric acid (11.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [35S]Hcy was released (not shown). TLC analyses confirmed that, like other metE strains (7.Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4504-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,10.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17672-17673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), 2H. Jakubowski, unpublished data. the CAG1849 strain metabolized Hcy to thiolactone. Whereas [S-nitroso-35S]Hcy was stable in M9 medium, it was converted into [35S]homocystine and [35S]thiolactone in cultures of E. coli strain CAG1849; no other [35S]metabolites were observed (not shown). The conversion of S-nitroso-Hcy to homocystine in E. coli was most likely because of the presence of enzymes denitrosylating S-nitrosothiols (24.Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 25.Hausladen A. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14100-14105Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). After reduction to Hcy, homocystine is subsequently converted to thiolactone by MetRS, IleRS, and LeuRS in E. coli (7.Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4504-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17672-17673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because post-translational reaction of thiolactone with protein lysine residues may also lead to incorporation of Hcy into protein (26.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), control experiments in which E. coli cultures were incubated with Hcy or thiolactone were carried out. There was no incorporation of Hcy (Fig. 4 B) or thiolactone (not shown) into bacterial proteins under these conditions. Taken together, these data indicate thatS-nitroso-Hcy is incorporated translationally into proteins synthesized by E. coli. As shown in Fig. 5,S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNA supported translation of globin mRNA and luciferase mRNA in a methionine-free rabbit reticulocyte translation system. Globin and luciferase proteins labeled with [S-nitroso-35S]Hcy were indistinguishable from the corresponding [35S]Met-labeled proteins on polyacrylamide gels. The data thus indicate thatS-nitrosylation provides a mechanism for the translational incorporation of Hcy into protein. In cultured human cells, Hcy can be incorporated into proteins post-translationally in a two-step mechanism (11.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27.Jakubowski H. J.

In the first step, Hcy is converted into thiolactone as a result of an error-editing reaction of MetRS. In the second step, thiolactone acylates side chain amino groups of protein lysine residues. Protein damage caused by N-homocysteinylation may underlie involvement of Hcy in vascular diseases (11.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27.Jakubowski H. J.

Because translational incorporation of S-nitroso-Hcy into protein is also likely to lead to protein damage, the present data illustrate an additional mechanism that may explain Hcy-induced pathology associated with atherosclerosis. Specifically, translational incorporation ofS-nitroso-Hcy into protein would explain why atherosclerosis is originating mostly at branch points in arteries (29.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar) that are subject to mechanical stress leading to increased production of nitric oxide (19.Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). S-Nitroso-thiols are present in human blood (30.Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), and S-nitroso-Hcy has been detected in cultures of human endothelial cells (19.Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). It is likely that, in subjects with elevated serum Hcy levels, local concentrations of nitric oxide andS-nitroso-Hcy are higher at arterial branch points than elsewhere. Therefore, at branch points, the incorporation ofS-nitroso-Hcy into endothelial cell proteins, and resulting protein damage, would be greater than at other points in arteries. Preliminary data suggest that Hcy is incorporated both translationally and post-translationally into proteins from endothelial cell cultures maintained on Hcy in folate-limited media. One cycle of Edman degradation of proteins modified with Hcy thiolactone releases all incorporated Hcy (26.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, similar Edman degradation of Hcy-labeled proteins from endothelial cell cultures releases only 37% of total incorporated Hcy. 3H. Jakubowski, unpublished data. Thus, both translational (via S-nitroso-Hcy) and post-translational (via Hcy thiolactone) incorporation of Hcy into protein provide plausible mechanisms whereby Hcy can affect physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W2325740123,"The impact of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 on paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity was investigated in RKO human colon adenocarcinoma cells with the ecdysone-inducible expression of p21Waf1 or p27Kip1. Ectopic expression of p27Kip1 arrested cells at G1 phase, whereas p21Waf1 expression arrested cells at G1 and G2. Expression of p21Waf1 after paclitaxel treatment produced much greater resistance to paclitaxel than did expression of p27Kip1. We attributed this difference to the additional block at G2 induced by p21Waf1, which prevented cells from entering M phase and becoming paclitaxel susceptible. Expression of p21Waf1 inhibited p34cdc2 activity and markedly reduced paclitaxel-mediated mitotic arrest, from 87.5 to 23%. In contrast, p27Kip1 expression also inhibited p34cdc2 but reduced mitotic arrest only slightly, from 87. 4 to 74.5%. We concluded that the G2 block produced by p21Waf1, but not by p27Kip1, contributed to their unequal modulation of sensitivity to paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in RKO cells, and there is no causal relationship between paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity and elevation of p34cdc2 activity."

Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The low pH within this compartment leads to the release of the receptor-bound hydrolases; MPRs can then return to the Golgi complex to initiate another round of lysosomal enzyme delivery. Two MPRs have been described to date (2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). One is a 300-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that also contains a high affinity binding site for insulin-like growth factor II. This receptor is known as the cation-independent MPR (CI-MPR) because it does not require divalent cations for ligand binding in vitro. A second, smaller, 46-kDa MPR requires divalent cations for ligand binding and is referred to as the cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR). Both receptors share common pathways of intracellular transport and bind to an overlapping set of lysosomal enzymes (2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We study the recycling of MPRs from endosomes back to the Golgi complex. We have established a cell-free system that reconstitutes this process in vitro (3Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Itin C.

We recently discovered a protein named TIP47 (tail-interacting protein of47 kDa) that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of the CI- and CD-MPRs and is required for their recycling to the Golgi complex both in vitro and in vivo (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). TIP47 recognizes a Phe-Trp motif in the CD-MPR (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R.

Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is not yet known what TIP47 recognizes in the CI-MPR, which does not contain a related, Phe-Trp motif. Nevertheless, TIP47 does not recognize tyrosine or dileucine motifs in either the CD- or CI-MPRs (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), a feature that distinguishes it from clathrin AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes (10Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In addition to MPRs, other proteins also cycle between endosomes and the Golgi complex. For example, TGN38 is a ∼90-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of unknown function that is localized to the trans Golgi network (11Luzio J. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K. Braghetta P. Stanley K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Its 33-amino acid cytoplasmic domain contains the sequence, YQRL that is essential for TGN localization (12Bos K. Wraight C.

Rabouille C. Luzio P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although TGN38 is found predominantly in the TGN at steady state, the protein cycles continuously between the cell surface, endosomes, and the TGN (12Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Reaves B. Horn M. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, furin (17Molloy S. Thomas L. Van Slyke J. Stenberg P. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) (18Varlamov O.

Like TGN38, furin and CPD also appear to cycle with some frequency between the cell surface, endosomes, and the TGN (17Molloy S. Thomas L. Van Slyke J. Stenberg P. Thomas G.

Since TIP47 recognizes MPRs and is required for their retrieval from endosomes, we think of TIP47 as a cargo selection device for endosome-to-Golgi transport. It was therefore of interest to determine if TIP47 interacts with other proteins that traverse similar intracellular transport pathways. We report here that TIP47 fails to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of TGN38, furin, phosphorylated furin, or CPD. These observations suggest that these proteins may utilize a distinct type of transport vesicle for their transport from endosomes to the Golgi complex. His-tagged TIP47 was purified after expression inEschericha coli as described (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recombinant cytoplasmic domains (GST-CI-MPR, GST-CI-MPR Y24A/Y26A/V29A, GST-CD-MPR, GST-LDL receptor, GST-furin (gift of Gary Thomas, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), GST-carboxypeptidase (gift of Oleg Varlamov, Albert Einstein University, New York), and GST-HIV-Nef (gift of Didier Trono, University of Geneva)) were prepared and purified as described (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) followed by S100 gel filtration chromatography. GST-TGN-38 (gift of Sharon Milgram, University of North Carolina) was purified as follows. Bacteria were lysed by incubation with lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 (in HKE buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA)) (instead of a French press), and the cleared lysate (100 ml) was loaded onto a 5-ml, SP-Sepharose cation exchange resin. The resin was washed with 50 ml of HKE buffer without Triton X-100 and eluted with 15 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The eluate was applied onto 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose with recycling, and the column was washed with 50 ml of HKE, pH 8.0. GST-TGN38 was then eluted by resuspension in 2 × 1.25 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm reduced glutathione) plus 0.01% Triton X-100. Glutathione was removed by passage over a P6DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100. All protein preparations contained a small amount of free GST; GST background was minimal and subtracted. Phosphorylation of GST-furin was achieved by incubating GST-furin (20 μm), ATP (200 μm), and casein kinase II (250 units/ml, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, after which glutathione-Sepharose was added to capture the GST-furin. With small scale reactions, quantitation of [γ-32P]ATP incorporation suggested incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of cytoplasmic domain; under identical conditions, GST was not a substrate for the kinase. Texas Red® sulfonyl chloride (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR; 60 μl at 10 mg/ml in anhydrous dimethyl formamide), was combined with 2 ml of ice-cold TIP47 (3 mg/ml in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5). The reaction was mixed end-over-end for 45 min at 4 °C. Labeled TIP47 was subsequently purified on a Sepharose S-100 size exclusion column to remove unincorporated dye. Fractions containing labeled TIP47 were pooled and analyzed for protein content; Texas Red® content was determined by absorbance at 596 nm. The molar ratio of Texas Red® to TIP47 was calculated to be 1.9. All of our calculations assume that His-tagged TIP47 has a monomeric molecular mass of 52 kDa. However, recombinant TIP47 chromatographs as a somewhat heterodisperse oligomer (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar); thus, all of our K D determinations may be underestimates of the actual binding affinity. TIP47 protein binding capacity is highly dependent upon expression and storage conditions. Most active preparations were obtained from cells induced to express the protein at low cell densities (A 600 = 0.1) and contained glycerol during the purification and for storage. We estimate that TIP47 preparations contain 10% active molecules as determined by the fraction that were capable of binding to saturating amounts of the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain. It is possible that the tendency of recombinant TIP47 to oligomerize is responsible for the relatively low recovery of active molecules. Nevertheless, we observe the same selectivity for MPR wild type and mutant forms when partially purified, native TIP47 is compared with the recombinant protein studied here. Finally, Texas Red labeling does not influence the activity of our preparation; control immunoblot experiments using unlabeled recombinant TIP47 and assuming 10% active molecules yielded identicalK D values. Binding was determined in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a 500-μl total volume. Receptor cytoplasmic domain GST fusion proteins (0–15 μm) were mixed with TIP47 (50 nm active protein) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) for an additional 45 min. The slurry was subsequently passed through an empty 1-ml column fitted with a porous support and washed rapidly with 1 ml of binding buffer to remove unbound TIP47. GST fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose by a 15-min incubation in 500 μl of elution buffer. The eluate was analyzed for fluorescent labeled TIP47 using λex = 596 nm and λem = 611 nm with an AMINCO Bowman series 2 Luminescence spectrometer (Urbana, IL). Receptor cytoplasmic domain-GST fusions (3.6 nmol) were mixed end-over-end with 950 μl of K562 cytosol (8.4 mg/ml) in 0.01% Triton X-100 plus 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A for 90 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry) were added for another 60 min. Beads were pelleted at low speed and washed five times with 1 ml of HKE buffer (pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted by a 15-min incubation of the beads in 100 μl of elution buffer containing 50 mm reduced glutathione. The elution was repeated, eluates were combined, and 40 μl was analyzed by immunoblotting for TIP47. Clathrin adaptors AP-1 and AP-2 were purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles as described (22Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity using hydroxyapatite (23Méresse S. Ludwig T. Frank R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 and AP-2 concentrations were determined as follows. Known amounts of a marker protein were compared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with various amounts of AP-1 and AP-2; the amount of the AP-1 and AP-2 μ-chains were quantified by densitometric scanning relative to the standard. Receptor cytoplasmic domain-GST fusion constructs (2.0 μm) were incubated with AP-2 (50 nm) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Triton X-100. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, glutathione-Sepharose beads (30 μl of a 50% slurry) were added for 1 h. Beads were then pelleted at low speed and washed three times in HKE buffer, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted by incubation with elution buffer for 15 min and separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose, AP-1 and AP-2 were detected by Western blotting analysis using the anti-γ-adaptin antibody (100:3) or anti-α-adaptin monoclonal antibody (100:2) (Sigma). Protein was determined using Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. We established a fluorescence-based assay to examine the interaction of recombinant TIP47 with receptor cytoplasmic domains. For this purpose, we attached Texas Red to free amino groups present on bacterially expressed, N-terminally His-tagged TIP47 (TxRed-TIP47). As shown in Fig. 1, as many as 18 mol of Texas Red could be incorporated into TIP47. However, at high levels of dye substitution, a significant amount of fluorescence quenching was observed, possibly due to protein aggregation. We therefore utilized a molar ratio of 2:1 (Texas Red:TIP47) for the experiments described here. The binding assay was carried out as follows. TxRed-TIP47 was incubated with the cytoplasmic domains of mannose 6-phosphate receptors, in the form of GST fusion proteins. Receptor-bound TIP47 was then collected on glutathione-Sepharose and quantified using a fluorimeter after elution of the resin with excess glutathione. Fig. 2 shows that the specificity of TIP47 binding determined previously using an immunoblot assay (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) can be recapitulated using the fluorescence-based assay. TIP47 bound to the CD-MPR cytoplasmic domain in strong preference to the LDL receptor cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, TIP47 failed to interact with a CD-MPR in which the FW motif was replaced by two alanine residues. Thus, the fluorescence assay was well suited to investigate the affinity of the binding interaction and the selectivity of TIP47 for a variety of potential transmembrane cargo proteins. Equilibrium binding constants for TIP47-receptor cytoplasmic domain interactions were then determined using the fluorescence assay (Fig.3). These experiments revealed that TIP47 interacts more strongly with the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain, with an apparent K D of 1 μm. A weaker interaction with the CD-MPR cytoplasmic domain (K D = 3 μm) may be due to the possible oligomerization of this cytoplasmic domain construct (24Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11458-11467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also performed experiments to determine the rates of association and dissociation of TIP47 with both CI-MPR and CD-MPR cytoplasmic domains. TIP47 association was measured by adding the protein to receptor cytoplasmic domains prebound to glutathione-Sepharose. Rapid mixing and separation was achieved by carrying out the incubations in a syringe that could be cleared rapidly by air pressure. These experiments confirmed that binding was complete in 15 min (data not shown). TIP47 dissociation was measured by forming TIP47-receptor cytoplasmic domain complexes, collecting them on glutathione-Sepharose, and then washing the samples under continuous flow and monitoring the amount of TIP47 remaining on the beads as a function of time. From these experiments, we determined the TIP47 dissociation rate to be 0.9–1.0 × 10−2min−1. The relatively slow dissociation rate ensured that the brief wash step for the removal of unbound TIP47 would result in a minimal loss of MPR-bound TIP47. The specificity of TIP47 binding was examined by carrying out binding reactions using other GST-cytoplasmic domain constructs. In this study, we included HIV-Nef, a 206-residue, myristoylated cytoplasmic protein that enhances the endocytosis of the CD4 glycoprotein by linking CD4 to the clathrin AP-2 adaptor complex at the plasma membrane (25LeGall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L. Benarous R. Heard J-M. Schwarz O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 26Piguet V. Chen Y-L. Mangasarian A. Foti M Carpentier J. Trono D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2472-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Oldridge J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 302-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nef can also link CD4 to β-COP (28Piguet V. Gu F. Foti M. Demaurex N. Gruenberg J. Carpentier J-L Trono D Cell. 1999; 97: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HIV-1-Nef recruits clathrin adaptors via a dileucine based signal near its C terminus and β-COP via a diacidic sequence, also near its C terminus (26Piguet V. Chen Y-L. Mangasarian A. Foti M Carpentier J. Trono D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2472-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Piguet V. Gu F. Foti M. Demaurex N. Gruenberg J. Carpentier J-L Trono D Cell. 1999; 97: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Since Nef binds AP-2 and β-COP, it was worth checking if it also bound TIP47. As shown in Fig. 4, fluorescent TIP47 failed to bind the cytoplasmic domains of furin and carboxypeptidase D, under conditions in which significant binding to the CI-MPR was detected. Compared with the CI-MPR (K D = 0.8 μm), furin and CPD displayed apparentK D values of ≥50 and ≥70 μm, respectively. It is hard to imagine that these proteins are ever found at this high a level in the membranes of mammalian cells. Similarly, HIV-Nef bound TIP47 with an apparentK D of 12.2 μm (not shown). Altogether, the lack of interaction of furin and carboxypeptidase D with TIP47 was unexpected, because these proteins cycle between endosomes and the trans Golgi network. Furin sorting has been shown to be dependent upon the specific phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain (29Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction of furin with a key sorting protein named PACS-1 is dependent upon furin phosphorylation (30Wan L. Molloy S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether phosphorylated furin cytoplasmic domain showed enhanced interaction with TIP47. Fig. 4shows that the phosphorylated furin cytoplasmic domain did not show any difference in its ability to interact with TIP47 as nonphosphorylated furin cytoplasmic domain. Another important substrate to test was TGN38. Although the function of this protein is not known, it is a steady-state resident of the trans Golgi network and continually cycles between the cell surface and the TGN (31Ghosh R. Mallet W. Soe T. McGraw T. Maxfield F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Initial experiments suggested strong binding of recombinant GST-TGN38 cytoplasmic domain to Texas Red-labeled TIP47. However, experiments using other fluorescently labeled control proteins strongly suggested that the observed binding was entirely nonspecific, in contrast to the other proteins tested (data not shown). It is important to note that the TGN38 cytoplasmic domain is more difficult to purify than all of the other constructs and can only be eluted from glutathione-Sepharose in the presence of detergent. Also, the TGN38 cytoplasmic domain-GST fusion protein has a pI of 8.9 compared with all of the other constructs, which have predicted pI values of 5.5–6. Thus, we sought an alternative binding assay strategy that would decrease potential nonspecific binding. We reasoned that unlabeled cytosolic TIP47, present within a mixture of cytosolic proteins, would provide a physiologically relevant test of TIP47-TGN38 cytoplasmic domain interaction. Thus, GST-TGN38 cytoplasmic domain was incubated with cytosolic proteins, and the bound material was tested for the presence of TIP47 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, only background levels of binding were observed for cytosolic TIP47 interaction with LDL receptor and TGN38 cytoplasmic domains. In contrast, significant TIP47 bound to the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain under identical conditions. These experiments show that TIP47 does not interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 under relatively physiological conditions. All of the experiments described thus far rely on the proper folding and functionality of the recombinant, GST fusion proteins. To verify that the proteins used in this study were active, we tested their capacities to interact with the clathrin adaptor, AP-2. AP-2 binds to tyrosine-based signals in receptor cytoplasmic domains and mediates their endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles (10Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To monitor potential AP-2 association, receptor cytoplasmic domain-GST fusion constructs were incubated with purified, bovine AP-2; bound AP-2 was then quantified after collection of receptor-AP2 complexes using glutathione-Sepharose beads followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig.6 A shows an experiment carried out to validate the assay procedure. As expected, AP-2 failed to bind GST alone and bound efficiently to the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain. Binding was entirely dependent on the presence of a tyrosine-based motif, because when a CI-MPR construct was employed in which Tyr24, Tyr26, and Val29 were converted to alanine, no binding was observed. Lack of binding to this construct was not due to its misfolding, since it was fully capable of interacting strongly with TIP47 (Fig. 6 B) and AP-1 (data not shown). We then used this assay to compare the interaction of our various cytoplasmic domain preparations with either TIP47 or AP-2. As shown in Fig. 6 C, while the CD-MPR bound significantly more TIP47 than LDL receptor, TGN38, or furin cytoplasmic domains (dark bars), LDL receptor, TGN38, and furin all bound more strongly to AP-2 than the CD-MPR (lighter bars). The cytoplasmic domain of CPD did not bind AP-2 in these experiments (not shown); thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that this construct is misfolded. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domains of LDL receptor, TGN38, and furin are fully functional in terms of their capacities to interact with cytoplasmic domain-interacting proteins. Moreover, they confirm the high level of selectivity of TIP47 for mannose 6-phosphate receptors. In these experiments, CI-MPR bound more AP-2 than CD-MPR. It is important to note that GST fusion proteins will dimerize via GST. Moreover, it was possible that in the context of a GST fusion, the smaller, 67-residue CD-MPR cytoplasmic domain is less accessible than the larger, 163-residue, CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain. If true, this would suggest that our estimate for TIP47-CD-MPR interaction might be an underestimate of the true affinity. To explore this possibility in greater detail, we compared the binding of AP-1 and AP-2 to both MPR cytoplasmic domains. As shown in Fig.7, AP-1 actually bound preferentially to the CD-MPR cytoplasmic domain, whereas AP-2 showed preference for the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain. AP-1 also bound to furin but not LDL receptor (data not shown), as would be expected given previous studies on the sorting of these two proteins (cf. Ref. 29Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data add confidence to our conclusions that the cytoplasmic domains are fully folded and have distinct affinities for interactions with TIP47. We have shown here that TIP47 binds highly selectively to MPR cytoplasmic domains. Recombinant TIP47 binds to the CI-MPR and CD-MPR with apparent K D values of 1 and 3 μm, respectively. Our initial estimates for the affinity of recombinant TIP47 for MPRs are in the same range as that observed for other cargo adapters (cf. Ref. 23Méresse S. Ludwig T. Frank R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and would be consistent with the intracellular concentrations of these proteins. TheK D values are probably more accurate than those we reported previously (8Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) because of the greater sensitivity and reliability of the assay employed. Surprising were our findings that TIP47 does not interact with TGN38, furin, or CPD. Like MPRs, these three proteins cycle continuously between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the Golgi complex. Since only a small percentage of total cell surface proteins are transported back to the Golgi complex (32Duncan J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it might have been expected that this subset of proteins would share a common route of intracellular transport. Clues to the existence of multiple pathways for endosome-to-TGN transport are already numerous and suggest new levels of complexity in the endosomal system. Shiga toxin (33Mallard F. Antony C. Tenza D. Salamero J. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 973-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and TGN38 (31Ghosh R. Mallet W. Soe T. McGraw T. Maxfield F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), for example, appear to return to the Golgi complex by a process that bypasses late endosomes entirely and occurs via a compartment referred to as the “recycling endosome” (Fig. 8). Mallet and Maxfield (34Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed further that TGN38 and furin are differentially sorted in endosomes and use distinct routes for their return to the Golgi. Moreover, it appeared from this work that both furin and TGN38 were transported from compartments that were distinct from those containing MPRs (34Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The data of Mallet and Maxfield (34Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) fit well with our findings. If TGN38, furin and MPRs are present in different compartments, they must in some way, be differently sorted. When thinking about endosomal sorting, it is important to keep in mind the dynamics of this membrane-bound compartment. It is now fairly well established that endosomes undergo homotypic fusion and also membrane fission; for example, hyperactivity of the Rab5 GTPase can alter the balance between these events for early endocytic compartments (35Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Sorting into different endosome classes could be accomplished by protein association with different adapter complexes. As shown in Fig. 8, binding of MPR cytoplasmic domains by TIP47 could lead to their segregation from other cargoes. Subsequent organelle fission could then segregate the two cargo classes into distinct membrane-bound vesicles. Failure to bind TIP47 and/or binding instead to other proteins may very well be responsible for the sorting of furin and TGN38 into different compartments. Other proteins that are likely to be important for furin sorting include APB-280 (36Liu G. Thomas L. Warren R. Enns C. Cunningham C. Hartwig J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and PACS-1 (30Wan L. Molloy S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which bind furin in the endocytic pathway. Moreover, as stated earlier, furin phosphorylation is clearly important for its intracellular transport and for its binding to PACS-1 (29Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 37Jones B. Thomas L. Molloy S. Thulin C. Fry M. Walsh K. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 38Molloy S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our observation that furin phosphorylation did not influence TIP47 interaction supports a model in which PACS-1 and TIP47 play distinct roles in the cell. TGN38 is likely to utilize Rab11 for transport from recycling endosomes to the TGN (39Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), unlike MPR transport, which is dependent upon Rab9 (5Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 40Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). More work will be needed to elucidate the pathway-specific molecules driving these probably distinct intracellular transport pathways. Taken together, all of these findings suggest that transport from the endocytic pathway to the biosynthetic pathway is a carefully regulated process that uses an unexpectedly diverse number of proteins and possibly also a larger than expected number of transport events. Much more work will be needed to define the molecular requirements for each of these pathways and the physiological advantages of this complexity. A challenge for the future will be to identify any coat proteins with which TIP47 may interact in its role as a cargo selection device for MPR trafficking from endosomes to the Golgi complex.

Gary Thomas, Oleg Varlamov, Lloyd Fricker, Vincent Piguet, Didier Trono, and Sharon Milgram for generous gifts of GST-fusion constructs and Elva Diaz for helping to initiate this project."

Unlike related KAAT1, CAATCH1 possesses a methionine-inhibitable constitutive leakage current and is able to switch its narrow substrate selectivity, preferring threonine in the presence of K+ but preferring proline in the presence of Na+. polymerase chain reaction N-methyl-d-glucamine γ-aminobutyric acid base pair(s) untranslated region 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid The distinction between ion-activated transporters and channels is becoming blurred. For example, the Na+ and Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, which serve substrates such as dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), GABA (GATx), and selected amino acids (via EAATx, GLAST, GLT, GlyTx, PROT, or ASCTx) act as both solute carriers and ion channels (1Galli A.

The presence of a ligand-modulated leakage current (7Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 36Google Scholar) (i.e. a small background conductance of undetermined ionic basis) was identified in DAT by an inverted U-shaped current-voltage relationship (8Amara S.G.

Rare examples of dual solute-transporter/leakage-channel activity have been reported in membrane proteins cloned from sources other than excitable tissues (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a new membrane protein, CAATCH1 (cation-anion-activated amino acidtransporter/channel), from a caterpillar absorptive epithelium. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, CAATCH1 acts as a Cl−-independent, and Na+- or K+-activated nutrient amino acid transporter that also yields current-voltage relationships like those ascribed to ligand-modulated leakage behavior in DAT (8Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Zahniser N.R. Povlock S.L. Daniels G.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin.

These unusual characteristics of CAATCH1, which are different from those of the structurally related KAAT1 (18Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggest that CAATCH1 plays a broader role in the Manduca midgut epithelium than that of a simple nutrient solute transporter. Moreover, CAATCH1 exhibits pH dependence and electrogenic activity that are appropriate for the caterpillar midgut in which the transapical voltage is about −240 mV in a highly alkaline luminal milieu (pH ∼10.5) (19Harvey W.R. Maddrell H.H.P. Telfer W.H. Wieczorek H. Am. Zool. 1999; 38: 426-441Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using a unique PCR1-based strategy, we obtained a cDNA clone from a Manduca sexta larval midgut library that had previously yielded several V-ATPase subunit clones (20Feldman D.F. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A249Google Scholar, 21Graf R. Novak F.J. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our cloning strategy employed inosine degenerate primer touchdown PCR (22Hecker K.H. Roux K.H. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using a mass-excised phagemid library as initial template, combined with specific primer-based PCR screening of phage lysates to isolate a clone that we designated CAATCH1. Subsequently, the functional CAATCH1 cRNA expression product was characterized inXenopus oocytes. The entire M. sexta midgut λZAP-XR cDNA library was mass-excised to generate plasmid dsDNA template, which was then used to generate unique target sequences that were isolated by degenerate primed PCR. An initial set of inosine-containing degenerate primers were designed to target conserved peptide motifs from invertebrate and vertebrate members of a subfamily of Na+,Cl−-dependent transporters serving various neurotransmitters and amino acids (23Griffith J.K. Sansom C.E. The Transporter Facts Book. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar). The sense primer, S34 (5′-GGIAA(C/T)GTITGG(A/C)G(A/G/C/T)TT(C/T)CC-3′), was based on a GNVWRFP peptide motif, whereas the antisense primer, S21 (5′-IGC(A/G/T)ATIGCITC(A/G/C/T)GG(A/G)TA-3′), was based on a YP(D/E)AIA peptide motif. Another sense primer, S22 (5′-GGIAA(C/T)GTITGG(G/T)G(A/G/C/T)TT(C/T)CC-3′), a tolerated alternative to S34, was also used in conjunction with S21 antisense primer for initial screening. “Touchdown” hot start PCR conditions (22Hecker K.H. Roux K.H. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1.5 mm MgCl2 were employed. Twenty cycles with decrementing annealing temperatures (60–46 °C, 0.7 °C steps) were followed by 30 cycles at the final annealing temperature. For each cycle, denaturation was at 92 °C for 40 s, annealing (60–46 °C during first 20 cycles, 46 °C for final 30 cycles) was for 40 s, extension was at 60 °C for 40 s, and then a final 75 °C extension for 5 min was performed. The resulting 943-bp PCR fragment from the dsDNA library was TA-cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced; the fragment was related to various transporters (23Griffith J.K. Sansom C.E. The Transporter Facts Book. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar), including the KAAT1 neutral amino acid transporter (18Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on the unique sequence of the 943-bp fragment, a second nested PCR primer set was designed for use in subsequent screening steps. This primer set was designed specifically to exclude KAAT1, while amplifying a unique 328-bp segment. In this case, sense (S25) was 5′-AACACTTGCTGCATCAGTCAC-3′ and antisense (S26) was 5′-CTCAAGGAGTTTCGCCCATTG-3′. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of denaturation at 92 °C, 40 s; annealing at 57 °C, 40 s; extension at 74 °C, 30 s. A final 5-min extension step at 75 °C was employed. The exclusion specificity of the S25/S26 set was confirmed by the failure to create any PCR product from negative control templates (e.g. purified full-length KAAT1 in plasmid DNA. However, we were able to generate the appropriate fragment from the cloned 943-bp template positive control. The S25/S26 set was used for subsequent phage lysate PCR screening steps and was used with the cloned 943-bp fragment to create a 328-bp digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) double-stranded DNA plaque hybridization probe for the isolation of a single clone. Phage lysate screening (24Amaravadi L. King M.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 98-103PubMed Google Scholar) was initiated by infecting XL1-Blue MRF′ host cells with the λZAP-XR library (5 × 104plaque-forming units total). Following plaque formation, SM buffer lysates were collected from the plate and screened by PCR to identify a positive 328-bp band using the S25/S26 primers. The positive lysates were further screened by PCR using vector T3 sense primer with S26 antisense primer, and four clones with long 5′-UTR sequences were obtained. The lysates positive for both S25/S26 and T3/S26 primer combinations were then replated at greater dilution, and the resulting lysates were rescreened by PCR. After three rounds of screening progressively smaller pools of clones, a positive lysate derived from plates seeded with 80 plaque-forming units was subsequently plated (∼200 plaque-forming units total) on a single 10-cm dish with XL1-Blue MRF′ host cells, and a standard plaque lift was performed; the membrane (Hybond; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was probed using the 328-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe (above) hybridized under high stringency conditions (66 °C), yielding five positive plaques. Plasmid DNA from two plaques was excised in vivo and cloned. One clone containing a ∼3-kilobase insert (CAATCH1) was used in all subsequent analyses including sequencing and physiological studies. The complete coding sequence ofCAATCH1, as well as 5′- and 3′-UTRs, was determined by primer walking the insert between M13 sites of the pBluescript vector (Stratagene). DNA samples were sequenced in the DNA Sequencing Core Laboratory of the Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Sequencing was carried out in both directions of the plasmid using TaqDyeDeoxy terminator and DyePrimer Cycle Sequencing protocols developed by Applied BioSystems using fluorescence-labeled dideoxynucleotides and primers. The labeled extension products were analyzed with an Applied BioSystems model 373A DNA sequencer. The plasmid containing full-length CAATCH1 cDNA was linearized byXhoI digestion, and m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro by using the T3 RNA polymerase promoter with the mMessage mMachine (Ambion) kit. Xenopus laevisoocytes at stage V or VI were injected with 50 nl of water with or without 50 ng of cRNA and then incubated at 17 °C in Barth's saline for 3–10 days. Injected oocytes were superperfused (22 °C) with modified ND96 medium (98 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm TAPS plusN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG), pH 8.0) at a constant rate (∼3 ml/min unless otherwise noted) using a peristaltic pump. The pH of the medium was 8.0 unless otherwise noted. To determine the cationic specificity of CAATCH1, Na+ was completely replaced by K+,N-methyl-d-glucamine+, choline+, Rb+, or Li+ in all buffer salts. To determine its anionic specificity, gluconate−was completely replaced by Cl− in all buffer salts. Transmembrane currents were measured in intact oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp (Warner model OC725-B, Hamden, CT) with agar-bridged bath electrodes (25Colville C.A. Gould G.W. Gould G.W. Membrane Protein Expression Systems: A User's Guide. Portland Press, London1994: 243-274Google Scholar). Data were filtered at 8 Hz (−3 db Bessel filter), digitized at 20 Hz, and analyzed with our custom programs utilizing LabView software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Current-voltage relations were generated using voltage steps or ramps (36 mV/s, 1.8 mV/point) between −150 and +30 mV from a given holding potential (usually −60 mV unless noted). Substrate-dependent, current-voltage data were obtained by subtracting control current values measured in the absence of substrate. Leakage I-V data that represented CAATCH1-associated leakage currents exposed by a substrate, were computed by digital subtraction of current in the presence of leakage-exposing substrate from control current (I CON minus I S). Transport-associated I-V data represent CAATCH1 currents appearing only in the presence of a solute substrate, computed by the inverse operation (I S minusI CON). Experiments were replicated at least three times, with confirmation in at least two separate injection batches of oocytes. Data means were derived from n ≥ 3 replicate measurements, and figures show representative plots. For radiotracer uptake experiments (26Mackenzie B. Harper A.A. Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 426: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), media contained 5 μCi/ml3H-labeled l-amino acids (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oocytes (4–10 per assay) were exposed to3H-labeled l-amino acids at 22 °C during a 30-min interval. Real time measurements of perioocyte extracellular pH were obtained using a model MI-419-E/MV-ADPT pH microelectrode in a 21-gauge needle (Microelectrode, Inc., Bedford, NH) placed 50 μm from the oocyte surface and referenced to the same agar-bridged reference electrode that was used for the voltage clamp circuit. Data captured with this pH microelectrode and LabView software gave a resolution of ±0.003 pH units. For these experiments, the extracellular bathing solution consisted of 98 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm CAPSO/NaOH at pH 8.410. Media containingl-proline were also adjusted to pH 8.410 ± 0.003. To deliberately maximize pH changes, we employed CAPSO buffer (pK 9.6) at a low buffer concentration and reduced the bath perfusion rate to 0.5 ml min−1. Buffer reagents were obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of Florida DNA synthesis core facility. A single clone was obtained with a full-length sequence of 2858 base pairs (CAATCH1; GenBankTM accession no.AF013963). It contains an open reading frame of 1899 base pairs that encodes a polypeptide with 633 amino acid residues (Fig.1) and has an unglycosylated relative molecular mass of 69,934 with pI = 7.37. A 5′-UTR of 100 bases and a polyadenylated 3′-UTR of 859 bases flank the open reading frame. The predicted topology of CAATCH1 (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar, 28Argos P. Rao J.K. Hargrave P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) includes 12 putative transmembrane domains, with cytosolic N- and C-terminal segments rich in proline, as well as acidic and basic amino residues (Fig.1 A). Seven consensus phosphorylation sites are located within cytoplasmic loops, and two N-linked glycosylation sites exist on the extracellular loop between the third and fourth membrane-spanning segments. Scanning the GenBankTM data base reveals that the sequence of CAATCH1 is related to Na+,Cl−-dependent solute transporters (e.g. human dopamine transporter hDAT; Fig.1 B) in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens with 35–45% nucleotide sequence identity and 35–39% amino acid sequence identity (∼50% similar); such transporters mediate the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, glycine, and proline (8Amara S.G.

The most closely related clone is the M. sextaKAAT1 neutral amino acid transporter (18Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) with overall 92% nucleotide identity and 90% amino acid identity (94% similarity) with CAATCH1. Amino acid differences are scattered throughout the sequence; however, conspicuous sequence differences are found within or near predicted transmembrane domains 6, 11, and 12 as well as in their adjacent hydrophilic, cytosolic C- and N-terminal regions. For example, between CAATCH1 residues Leu496 and Ile577, 25 amino acids (or 31%) diverge, often with nonconservative differences. Moreover, as the results below indicate, KAAT1 and CAATCH1 exhibit striking differences in physiology and function. Parallel experiments conducted on the wild types and several site-directed mutants of both KAAT1 and CAATCH1 cDNAs confirmed that they are functionally distinct transporters. 2B. R. Stevens, Z. Liu, D. H. Feldman, M. A. Hediger, and W. R. Harvey, unpublished observations. The functional characteristics of CAATCH1 expressed inXenopus oocytes were unexpected and collectively did not conform to any known transport system, including KAAT1 or the excitable tissue transporters (18Castagna M.

Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4): 1) net inward currents, typified by proline; 2) apparent net “outward” responses typified by methionine; and 3) a mixed net effect of elicited inward current plus apparent “outward” current, typified by threonine. Furthermore, the amino acid-elicited responses were modulated by Na+, K+, pH, and the transmembrane voltage but not by Cl−.Figure 3Changes in amino acid-dependent current-voltage relations as a function of Na+ or K+. All recordings were made from the same representative cell. Voltage ramps (+30 to −150 mV during 5 s) were applied during constant superfusion of each amino acid (500 μm) in either Na+ or K+ medium.A, proline- or threonine-elicited currents in Na+ medium. The threonine-elicited CAATCH1 current was slightly greater than the concomitant block of the constitutive CAATCH1 leakage current, yielding a convex shaped I-V relationship due to the additive effects of the inwardly rectifying transport-associated current with the inverted outwardly rectifying leakage current. B, leakage block I-V curve elicited by methionine in Na+. Values represent CAATCH1 constitutive leakage current inhibited in the presence of the amino acid; the CAATCH1 reversal potential of this particular example was −15 mV.

A, effects of methionine and proline on CAATCH1 currents in Na+ medium. Proline alone (P; 500 μm) elicited an inward transport-associated current, whereas methionine alone (M; 500 μm) blocked the constitutive CAATCH1 leakage current. The proline-elicited steady-state inward current was increasingly inhibited by 0.005–500 μm methionine. Blanked voltage ramp recordings are marked by triangles. Membrane voltage was clamped at −60 mV. B, CAATCH1 current-voltage relations with proline and methionine combinations in Na+medium. I-V relations were derived from voltage ramp commands as in A. For clarity, a limited number of proline and/or methionine I-V curves are shown. For each steady-state I-V curve except Met only (leak), the data were plotted according to the convention for transport-associated currents, i.e. corrected for base line by digital subtraction of control base-line ramp currents (measured immediately prior to the application of amino acids) from the ramp current measured during the amino acid application. Met only (leak) shows the leakage I-V relation (dashed line) in its conventional form, in which current in the presence of methionine was subtracted from the base-line control current. Met only (inverse leak) represents the data (dotted line) plotted in the form normally used for transport-associated currents. C, methionine inhibition of inward proline-induced CAATCH1 current. To isolate net transport-associated currents (at leakage current = 0 nA), measurements were obtained from the current records during the voltage ramps (see A and B) at a voltage representing the reversal potential of the leakage current (i.e. −24 mV in this example). These data represent methionine inhibition of only the proline-associated net current in Na+ medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first type of substrate, such as l-proline and its analogue l-pipecolate, elicited the greatest net inward currents of any test substrates in alkaline Na+ medium (Fig. 2, A and C). These currents were voltage-dependent over the range from −150 to +30 mV (Fig.3 A). The second type of substrate, such as methionine or leucine, blocked the CAATCH1-associated leakage current, thereby giving apparent “outwardly directed” current traces in Na+ medium (Fig.2, A and C). The blockage of a CAATCH1-associated leakage current by these amino acids was characterized by a reduced slope of the current-voltage relation in the presence of substrate, compared with the control conditions. The CAATCH1 leakage currentI-V relationship for methionine (Fig. 3 B) was obtained by subtracting I-V traces measured in the presence of this leakage-blocking substrate from those measured in its absence. Sonders et al. (10Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used this method to reveal the cocaine blockage of the hDAT leakage current, which was independent of cocaine's competitive inhibition of dopamine carrier-mediated uptake via hDAT. Methionine-blocked CAATCH1 leakage currents in Na+ medium (Fig. 2, A and C) gave an outwardly rectifying I-V relationship (I CON − I MET) with reversal potentials occurring between −10 and −25 mV (Fig.3 B). The third type of amino acid, exemplified by threonine, elicited no current or small inward currents (Fig. 2, A andC), yielding an inverted U-shaped (convex) I-V relationship (Fig. 3 A), since their CAATCH1-associated inward currents were balanced by their blockage of the CAATCH1-associated leakage current in Na+ medium (Fig. 2,A and C). Complete replacement of extracellular Na+ with K+ changed the apparent substrate selectivity; thus, threonine (Fig. 2, B and D) elicited larger voltage-dependent inwardly rectifying currents than proline (Fig. 2, B and D; Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, amino acids that blocked the leakage current in Na+ medium (Fig. 2 C) generated net inward currents in K+ medium (Fig. 2 D). Methionine elicited only inward current in K+ medium, whereas it blocked the leakage current in Na+ medium. In K+ medium, test amino acids elicited I-V curves with strong inward current rectification from +30 mV to at least -150 mV (Fig. 3 C). Na+ and K+ were the favored activator cations; completely replacing all extracellular buffer Na+ and K+ with Rb+, Li+, NMG+, or choline+(chloride salts) attenuated amino acid-associated currents by 75–99% (Fig. 2 E). Choline activated a small current with amino acid substrates, while NMG was virtually inert. Threonine elicited small net inward currents (<10 nA) in some oocytes expressing CAATCH1 but elicited “outward” responses (i.e. CAATCH1-associated leakage current block) in other oocytes. This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon was resolved by analysis of threonine's unusual inverted U-shaped I-V relationship (Fig. 3 A); this trace represented the combined effects of the inward threonine uptake-associated current and the simultaneous threonine inhibition of the CAATCH1-associated leakage current. At sufficiently negative voltages (e.g. −75 mV), current via the voltage-dependent transporter (uptake) pathway exceeded that of the exposed leakage current, resulting in a net inward current; however, at less negative voltages, the inhibition of leakage current approached or exceeded the transport-associated current, resulting in either a very small inward current or a net “outwardly directed” deflection. This behavior led to the complex I-V relationship of Fig. 3 A. A simila"

This finding prompted us to ask whether two classical G-protein-coupled signaling pathways requiring activated protein kinase A (PKA) or kinase C (PKC) may also regulate apoAI. Therefore, human hepatoma, Hep G2 cells stably transfected with pAI.474-CAT, a reporter construct spanning −474 to −7 of apoAI DNA fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were treated with 10 μm forskolin (FSK) or 50 nm phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) to activate PKA and PKC, respectively. Results showed that the apoAI promoter activity increased 4–5-fold following 24 h of treatment with either FSK or PDBu. Induction by either agent was blocked with actinomycin D but not the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The PKA inhibitor, PKI 14–22 amide, abrogated induction by FSK, 100 μm8-bromo-cAMP, or 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, but it had no effect on activation via PKC. Similarly, PDBu induction was attenuated by 2 μm of the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, but it did not affect FSK activity. Next we used deletional constructs to show that the actions of FSK and PDBu required the insulin-responsive core element (IRCE). This motif matched the consensus binding site for the transcription factor, Sp1. The binding of Sp1 to the IRCE was confirmed by gel-retardation and supershift analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the IRCE eliminated Sp1 action and induction by FSK or PDBu. Whereas overexpression of Sp1 enhanced basal and FSK or PDBu induced promoter activity, transfection of an antisense oligomer against Sp1 mRNA attenuated both parameters. In summary, activation of PKA or PKC increases apoAI promoter activity. The activity of both signaling pathways is mediated by the IRCE, a motif that binds the transcription factor, Sp1.

Enhanced activity of this enzyme augments a normal physiologic process, so called “reverse cholesterol transport” (RCT), whereby cholesterol is transported from extra-hepatic cells to the liver for excretion in the form of bile salts or free cholesterol (3Miller N.E.

Increased RCT lowers total body cholesterol, and therefore, it is not surprising that numerous epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between plasma concentrations of HDL and the risk of coronary heart disease (5Barter P.J.

Given the pivotal role of apolipoprotein AI, apoAI in the function of HDL, and the antiatherogenic properties of these particles, the identification of the mechanisms that increase levels of apoAI synthesis and HDL is of great interest and potential therapeutic importance. Hormonal control of apoAI expression is an attractive way to manipulate apoAI gene activity, because the simple addition or removal of the agent will regulate gene activity. Therefore, many laboratories, including our own, have examined the ability of thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, estradiol, androgens, retinoic acid, and insulin to modulate activity of the gene (8Hargrove G.M.

This latter finding (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) suggests new avenues for controlling apoAI gene expression and prompted us to ask whether other intracellular signal transduction pathways initiated from the cell membrane might also affect apoAI expression. To investigate this possibility, we examined the potential role of activated protein kinase A (PKA) and kinase C (PKC). These kinases play critical roles in separate classical intracellular signaling pathways regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors. Unexpectedly, the stimulatory effects of both pathways are mediated by a single transcription factor that converges on the insulin-responsive core element, IRCE (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Construction of the reporter, pAI.474-CAT, was described previously (12Romney J.S. Chan J. Carr F.E. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar). The deletional constructs; pAI.425-, pAI.375-, pAI.325-, and pAI.235-CAT that contained rat apoAI DNA spanning −425, −375, −325, and −235 to −7 were synthesized using the parent pAI.474-CAT as template in separate PCR as described previously (12Romney J.S. Chan J. Carr F.E. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type IRCE (−411 to −404), GAGGCGGG, was mutated to TCTTATTT by using a primer containing these transverse mutations in a PCR. The construct containing an internal deletional of nucleotides −208 to −193 in the apoAI promoter was created by digesting pAI.474-CAT with PstI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which deletes a 46-base pair insert followed by ligation to circularize the large fragment. Expression plasmids for Sp1, TRα, HNF-3, or HNF-4 were kind gifts from Drs. R. Tjian (University of California, Stanford, CA), M Phfal (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA), R. Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and M. Sladek (University of California, Irvine, CA), respectively. The human hepatoma cells, Hep G2, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. Cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium prior to adding the agent(s) of interest. The Hep G2 cells have been used previously by ourselves and others for studying both signaling pathways and apoAI expression (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J.

Hep G2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of plasmids transfected is indicated in the figure legends. Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting 1 μg of the plasmid, Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase (16Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Stably transfected Hep G2 cells were created by cotransfecting pAI.474-CAT (12Romney J.S. Chan J. Carr F.E. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar) and the plasmid, pRc/CMV2 (Invitrogen), that carried neomycin resistance, at a ratio of 10:1, respectively. Colonies that grew in media containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin, G418 were assayed for CAT activity (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and used for further studies. The Sp1 antisense (5′-CTGAATATTAGGCATCACTCCAGG-3′) and sense (5′-CCTGGAGTGATGCCTAATATTCAG-3′) phosphorothioated deoxynucleotides were commercially synthesized (IDT, Coraville, IA) (17Yoshida S.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 632-640PubMed Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides (2 μm) were transfected into stable Hep G2 cells using LipofectAMINE. Transfected cells were allowed to recover overnight in standard culture medium and then exposed to serum-free media containing either 10 μm FSK or 50 nm PDBu or both for 24 h. CAT activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction, and Sp1 protein level was assayed in whole cell extract as described below. Whole cell extract from control cells or those transfected with Sp1 oligodeoxynucleotides were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 2 mm orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and apoprotin, 1 mg/ml each benzamidine and bacitracin, 600 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm sodium molybdate. An aliquot of each sample was separated by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Waters Corp.), and then Sp1 protein was identified using a rabbit anti-human monoclonal antibody (PharMingen), and the signal was located using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blot analysis of apoAI protein in lysates from Hep G2 cells or culture media was assessed using a monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem). Nuclear extracts from Hep G2 cells were prepared as described previously (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Synthetic DNA duplexes spanning −419 to −388, ACTTTGAGGCGGGGATGTGAGT, or the recognition site for TFIID (Promega) were radiolabeled at the 5′-ends by incubating each strand separately with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to annealing. Each binding reaction of 20 μl contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 fmol of radiolabeled probe, and 10 μg of nuclear extract. In competition studies, 200-fold m excess of unlabeled homologous (−419 to −388 or Sp1 consensus, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG) or nonhomologous competitor DNA (mutant IRCE, ACTTTtcttatttGATGTGAGT, where bold letters indicate mutated nucleotides) was present in the reaction prior to the addition of nuclear extracts. Antibodies used in supershift experiments were added to nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 60 min prior to their use in EMSA. The antibodies against human Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then separated on a 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at 10 volts/cm2 for 3 h at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRI®-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). The RNA was reverse-transcribed with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit using pd(N)6 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocol. 3 μl of this solution was amplify using PCR primed with a forward primer 5′CCTGATGAATGCTCATCCG3′ and reverse primer 5′AAGCATTCTGCCGACATGG3′ homologous to the CAT gene. The RT-PCR signal from CAT mRNA transcripts was normalized with the signal obtained from β-actin using the primer pair (forward: 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′; reverse: 5′-TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGG-3′) as described previously (19Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following studies were facilitated by the creation of Hep G2 cells that were stably cotransfected with pAI.474-CAT and a plasmid carrying neomycin resistance. We isolated 14 colonies that were resistant to neomycin, but only 6 of these had measurable CAT activity. All 6 colonies were tested for their response following exposure to either 10 μm FSK or 50 nm PDBu to activate PKA and PKC pathways, respectively. CAT activity in all treated cells increased 4–5-fold in comparison with untreated cells (Fig.1, A and B, shows results of one colony). The -fold induction by either agent was similar regardless of whether the cells had high or low basal CAT activity. Furthermore, the abundance of apoAI protein in lysates of treated Hep G2 cells was higher compared with control (Fig. 1 A). ApoAI is a secreted protein. Thus, abundance of the protein in culture media from cells treated with FSK or PDBu (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel) were higher versus control. These findings show that both FSK and PDBu increase not only activity of the promoter but also endogenous expression of the apoAI protein.Table IEffect of adjacent cis-acting sites on FSK and PDBu induction of the apoAI promoterTreatmentTransfectionNoneTRαHNF-3βHNF-4FSK (10 μm)−10.6 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.3+4.6 ± 0.54.8 ± 0.84.8 ± 0.74.3 ± 0.8PDBu (50 nm)−10.6 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.3+5.1 ± 0.65.4 ± 0.95.2 ± 0.85.0 ± 0.7Table I, shows FSK or PDBu induction of CAT activity in stably transfected Hep G2 cells containing the reporter pAI.474-CAT following the introduction of no additional plasmid (none) or ones that over express TRα, HNF-3β, or HNF-4, which are known to modulate the function of sites A, B, and C, respectively.

A schematic diagram showing the relative location of the sites appears in the map below the table. The effect of inhibitors and other activators (Fig. 1, A–C) were tested to confirm further the role of both PKA and PKC pathways in regulating apoAI activity. 8-Bromo-cAMP and cholera toxin (CTX) are two additional activators of PKA. CAT activity (Fig. 1 C) in stably transfected cells increased 4- and 3.5-fold following 24 h of exposure to 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP or 10 ng/ml CTX, respectively (20Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction by FSK, 8-bromo-cAMP, or CTX was inhibited in the presence of 1 μm amount of a PKA inhibitor, PKI (21Glass D.B. Cheng H.C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, apoAI induction by PDBu was blocked in the presence of 2 μm GFX (Fig. 1 B), a specific inhibitor of PKC (23Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The inhibitors acted specifically on their respective pathways, because PKI did not affect induction by PDBu, and the actions of FSK were not inhibited by GF (data not shown). Additionally, promoter activity in cells exposed to both 10 μm FSK plus 50 nm PDBu was no greater than either one alone (Fig. 1, A and B). Together these findings show that activation of signaling pathways, mediated by PKA or PKC, increase apoAI promoter activity. Next we examined the time course associated with the induction by FSK and PDBu (Fig.2 A). The results showed a significant increase in CAT activity within 3 h following exposure to either 10 μm FSK or 50 nm PDBu. The initial increase was followed by a progressive rise in CAT activity that reached submaximal levels within 24 h (Fig.2 B). The rapid induction of apoAI promoter activity by FSK and PDBu prompted us to ask whether it required a transcriptional or post-transcriptional process. The results (Fig. 2, C and D) showed that induction by FSK and PDBu was abrogated by 1 μmactinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. As expected, induction of CAT activity by either FSK or PDBu was completely abolished in the presence of 10 μm cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, because it blocked translation of CAT-mRNA. Therefore, to assess activity of pAI.474-CAT in the presence of cycloheximide, we used RT-PCR to measure the levels of CAT-mRNA. Whereas, actinomycin D blocked the induction of CAT-mRNA by either agent, cycloheximide had no effect on FSK or PDBu induction of CAT-mRNA (Fig.2 C, lower panel, and D). These observations show that FSK and PDBu increases transcriptional activity of the apoAI promoter. The preceding observation raises the question of how two separate intracellular signaling pathways enhance the activity of a single promoter? To address this question, we used transient transfection to assay deletional constructs containing from −474, −425, −375, −325, and −235 to −7 of the promoter fused to CAT. The results (Fig.3 A) showed that induction by either FSK or PDBu decreased by 90% following removal of the −425 to −376 segment of the promoter. Furthermore, induction by either FSK or PDBu was completely abolished upon deletion to nucleotide −235. In previous studies (9Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we showed that the −425 to −375 segment of the promoter contained an insulin-responsive core element, IRCE, which mediated induction by insulin. Therefore, we postulated that the IRCE may also mediate the actions of FSK or PDBu. To test this hypothesis, we assayed activity of a construct that was identical to the pAI.474-CAT, except for transverse mutations of the IRCE. Results (Fig.3 B) showed the expected induction of the parent construct by FSK and PDBu, but these agents had no effect on activity of the mutated motif. The studies in this section show that the stimulatory actions of two separate signaling pathways are mediated by a common cis-acting element, IRCE. To understand further the mechanism by which FSK and PDBu induces apoAI promoter activity, we want to identify the transcription factor(s) that interacts with the IRCE. Two clues that raised the possibility of the motif being a Sp1 binding site are: 1) it was GC-rich, and 2) it matched the consensus recognition site for the protein (24Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used EMSA to measure IRCE binding activity in nuclear extract from Hep G2 cells following treatment with FSK or PDBu. Results (Fig. 4 A) showed that binding to the IRCE increased in cells treated with either agent but that bound to the TFIID motif was the same in control and treated cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–9). The IRCE binding activity was specific, because formation of the protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 4 B) was completely abolished by including either excess of nonradioactive IRCE or consensus Sp1 binding motif; but the mutant IRCE failed to affect formation of the complexes. There are at least three isoforms belonging to the Sp family of proteins. To determine the specific isoform bound to the IRCE, antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 were added to separate EMSA reactions. Whereas, Sp1 antibody supershifted the complexes, neither Sp2 nor Sp3 (data not shown) affected their mobility. The preceding studies show that the transcription factor, Sp1, binds to the IRCE. In addition to binding of Sp1 to the IRCE, it should also exert a functional effect. To examine the functional role of Sp1, we transfected an expression vector that overexpressed Sp1 into three (numbers 2, 8, and 10) separate colonies of stable Hep G2 cells. Enhanced Sp1 expression increased basal apoAI promoter activity in all three clones by 2-fold (Fig. 5, data for one clone) compared with cells transfected with empty vector. If Sp1 mediated the effects of FSK and PDBu, then enhanced expression of the factor should augment apoAI induction by these agents. To test this hypothesis, we treated stable Hep G2 cells that overexpressed Sp1 with submaximal doses of FSK (2 μm) or PDBu (10 nm). Either agent alone caused a 2–2.5-fold increase of CAT activity in stable cells without exogenous Sp1. In contrast, CAT activity increased 6–7-fold in cells that overexpressed Sp1. These findings show that Sp1 overexpression increases apoAI promoter activity and augments its induction by FSK and PDBu. If Sp1 plays an important role in mediating the actions of FSK and PDBu, then the converse of the above approach, i.e. decreasing levels of Sp1, should attenuate the actions of these agents. To test this hypothesis, we lowered intracellular levels of Sp1 using an antisense approach (17Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 18Zheng X.L. Gui Y. Sharkey K.A. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 632-640PubMed Google Scholar). Results showed that in the presence of antisense Sp1, basal CAT activity in stably transfected cells decreased by 60% relative to control cells (Fig. 6,A and B). In contrast, the sense oligomer that targets the same sequence in Sp1 mRNA had no effect on CAT activity. Furthermore, induction of apoAI promoter activity by either FSK or PDBu was abrogated in cells containing Sp1 antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides (Fig. 6, C and D). Next we used Western blot analysis to confirm that Sp1 antisense oligonucleotides did indeed reduce levels of the protein. Results (Fig.6, E and F) showed a 65–68% reduction in the level of Sp1 protein in cells containing Sp1 antisense but not sense oligonucleotides compared with nontransfected cells. Furthermore, neither FSK nor PDBu had a significant effect on the levels of Sp1 protein in these stably transfected cells. Together these findings show that Sp1 plays a key role in mediating FSK and PDBu induction of apoAI promoter activity. The following studies examine whether the actions of the IRCE may be linked to adjacent cis-acting elements. To address this question we performed separate transfections with vectors that enabled the stable cells to overexpress the thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα), HNF-3β, or HNF-4. These factors modulate the actions of sites A, B, and C, respectively, in the apoAI promoter (reviewed in Ref. 8Hargrove G.M. Junco A. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CAT activity in the transfected cells was compared with the untreated control. Results (TableI) showed that FSK and PDBu induction of CAT activity in the transfected with TRα, HNF-3β, or HNF-4 cells were not different from that in the control cells exposed to these agents (compare induced values in the “None” column with those in adjacent three columns). This observation suggests that IRCE-mediated induction by FSK and PDBu was not affected by adjacent elements A, B, and C. Next we wondered whether the consensus Sp1 motif (−220 to −211) located 3′ to the IRCE contributed to activity of the promoter. To investigate this possibility, we created a construct that contained an internal deletion from −208 to −193. CAT activity in cells transiently transfected with the deletional mutant was activated 5.6 ± 0.8- and 6.5 ± 0.9-fold by FSK or PDBu, respectively, compared with control. This response is similar to that of the wild type promoter (“None” column in Table I). Together these findings show that IRCE activity was not influenced by adjacent cis-acting elements A, B, and C. In addition, removal of the Sp1 site 3′ to the IRCE played an insignificant role in the FSK and PDBu induction of apoAI promoter activity. The pivotal role of apoAI in HDL particles, and their function in mediating RCT (3Miller N.E. La Ville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), underlies our interest to investigate the expression of this gene. Increased abundance of apoAI enhances RCT, thereby lowering the levels of cholesterol in the body. Decreased levels of cholesterol reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the induction of the apoAI gene will help us find new ways to decrease heart disease. Our previous studies (9Murao K. Wada Y.

Insulin regulation of the apoAI promoter differs from previous reports that examine hormonal regulation of this gene. Whereas most reports document the regulation of apoAI by a family of small lipophilic ligands including thyroid/steroid hormones, which bind to a nuclear receptor with transcriptional activity (reviewed in (8Hargrove G.M. Junco A. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)), we recently showed that insulin, a peptide hormone, also activates the gene. This finding prompted us to ask whether other intracellular signaling pathways may also regulate apoAI expression. Therefore, we examined the"

To study the effect of Met-HGF/SF signaling in breast cancer cells, we transfected met, hgf/sf and dominant negative (DN) forms of met into the poorly differentiated metastatic murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line DA3. These cells express moderate levels of endogenous Met, which is rapidly phosphorylated in response to HGF/SF treatment. Met+hgf/sf transfection results in significantly increased tumorigenic and metastatic activity in vivo accompanied by reduced tubule formation. DA3 cells transfected with DN forms of Met (DN-DA3) exhibit reduced Met phosphorylation following exposure to HGF/SF. Furthermore, as compared to the parental cells, the DN-DA3 cells exhibit diminished in vitro scattering and invasiveness, while in vivo they display greatly reduced tumorigenicity and spontaneous metastasis. Tumors emanating from DN-DA3 cells injected to BALB/C mice are highly differentiated and display extensive tubule formation. These results suggest that Met-HGF/SF signaling is a determining factor in the delicate balance between differentiation/tubule formation and tumorigenicity-metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2006191070,"In an attempt to study molecules that play a regulatory role early in adipocyte differentiation, we identified by differential display ENC-1, a Drosophila kelch-related protein. ENC-1 colocalizes with actin filaments. ENC-1 is expressed in adipose tissue, specifically in the adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction. ENC-1 mRNA levels are transiently increased 8–12-fold early in in vitro adipocyte differentiation of primary cells of the adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction and of 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment with the adipogenic inducers dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine causes an increase in ENC-1 mRNA levels specifically in preadipocytes, and methylisobutylxanthine is the main effector of ENC-1 expression. The induction of ENC-1 precedes expression of the transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα), and other adipocyte markers including adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein. The ENC-1 induction correlates with the subsequent differentiation of primary stroma-vascular cells into adipocytes. Furthermore, decreasing the endogenous ENC-1 levels by stable antisense transfection, thereby preventing the transient induction, effectively inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.

Fibroblastic preadipocytes stop dividing, undergo differentiation, and attain the biochemical profiles and rounded, lipid-filled morphology typical of mature adipocytes. Both established preadipocyte cell lines such as 3T3-L1 cells and primary culture of adipose-derived stroma-vascular precursor cells have been used in examining the process of adipogenesisin vitro. Adipocyte differentiation is induced by adipogenic mixture, typically a combination of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine (MIX)1in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Subsequent to this treatment, cells start to change shape and undergo postconfluent mitoses, and subsequently the majority of the cells attain adipocyte phenotype in 5–7 days (1.Smas C.M. Sul H.S.

Adipocyte differentiation involves changes in the levels of more than 100 proteins (3.Sidhu R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11111-11118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those proteins involved in the specialized metabolic role of mature adipocytes, including lipid transport and metabolism and hormone responsiveness, are induced (1.Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem.

It is now well established that two families of transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα), are induced early in adipocyte differentiation and activate adipocyte genes and thereby promote adipogenesis (4.Tontonoz P.

Whereas these adipogenic transcription factors have been extensively studied in recent years, less attention has been focused on the morphological alteration during adipocyte differentiation. The type and level of extracellular matrix components secreted (7.Dani C. Doglio A. Amri E.Z. Bardon S. Fort P. Bertrand B. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) are altered during adipocyte differentiation. For example, expression of actin and tubulin and cytoskeleton assembly decrease as cells change from a fibroblastic to a spherical shape of adipocytes (11.Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of the actin and tubulin precedes the overt changes in morphology and the expression of adipocyte-specific gene expression (11.Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These changes in cell shape reflect a distinct process in differentiation and are not the result of lipid accumulation. Cells induced to differentiate in the absence of biotin, a cofactor for lipogenesis, or in the presence of lipolytic agents do not accumulate lipids but still undergo biochemical and morphological differentiation (12.Kuri-Harcuch W. Wise L.S. Green H. Cell. 1978; 14: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the shape change from fibroblastic preadipocytes to rounded mature adipocytes, determined by the changes in cytoskeletal organization and/or contacts with extracellular matrix, is required for adipocyte differentiation. Maintaining 3T3-F442A preadipocytes on fibronectin matrices, non-hydrated, non-deformable extracellular matrices or highly charged molecules like polylysine prevented not only the cell shape changes but also the expression of lipogenic enzymes, resulting in a decrease in triacylglycerol accumulation (13.Spiegelman B.M. Ginty C.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 657-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 14.Rodriguez Fernandez J.L. Ben-Ze'ev A. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Disrupting actin filaments by cytochalasin D treatment could overcome the inhibitory effect of fibronectin (13.Spiegelman B.M. Ginty C.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 657-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells maintained in regular culture dishes was also promoted by the cytochalasin B treatment perhaps by allowing the necessary cytoskeletal remodeling. Moreover, with long term exposure, even non-differentiating 3T3-C2 cells underwent morphological and biochemical adipocyte differentiation (15.Pairault J. Lasnier F. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that cytoskeletal remodeling that accompanies the cell shape change is a distinctive process and is a prerequisite for adipocyte differentiation. The regulatory molecule(s) that are involved in this cytoskeletal reorganization during adipocyte differentiation have been largely unidentified to date. Here we report the identification of ENC-1 by differential display of mRNA prepared from the primary culture of the stroma-vascular fraction of adipose tissue. ENC-1 is a kelch-related actin-binding protein and has been previously identified to be expressed in a brain-specific manner (16.Hernandez M.C. Andres-Barquin P.J. Martinez S. Bulfone A. Rubenstein J.L. Israel M.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3038-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that ENC-1 is expressed in adipose tissue, specifically in the adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction. ENC-1 is transiently induced early during the hormonal induction phase of the adipocyte differentiation of primary cells from the adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction and of 3T3-L1 cells. The transient induction of the ENC-1 precedes expression of the transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, and other adipocyte-specific markers including adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aFABP). We found that the ENC-1 induction correlates with the degree of differentiation of primary preadipocytes in culture and that decreasing the endogenous ENC-1 levels by stable antisense transfection thereby preventing transient induction greatly inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Overall, these studies indicate that ENC-1 plays a regulatory role early in adipocyte differentiation. The adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction from rats was prepared as described previously (17.Gregoire F.M. Johnson P.R. Greenwood M.R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: 664-670PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the subcutaneous inguinal fat deposits from female Zuker rats were dissected under sterile conditions, and the lymph nodes were carefully removed. The stroma-vascular cells were obtained from the minced fat tissues by collagenase (Sigma, 540 units/mg) digestion at 1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 45 min in Hepes-phosphate buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, 2.17 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mmd-glucose, and 2% w/v bovine serum albumin) under agitation. The resulting cell suspension was homogenized by pipetting with a 10-ml serological plastic pipette, filtered through a 100-μm nylon filter, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The floating top layer of mature adipocytes was removed, the pellets were washed several times, and the suspended cells were filtered through a 25-μm nylon filter to eliminate residual aggregates. After examination for viability and counting, the cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 into 100-mm culture dishes (Falcon) in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. When the cells reached confluence, the differentiation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μmdexamethasone, 0.25 mm MIX, and 17 nm insulin in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the differentiation medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus insulin only. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For differentiation, confluent cells were treated with 1 μmdexamethasone/0.5 mm MIX for 72 h, after which the differentiation medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For stable transfection, 3T3-L1 cells were plated at 40% confluence the day before transfection. 20 μg of ENC-1 antisense plasmid per 100-mm2 dish were transfected into 3T3-L1 cells by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method. Cells were selected in DMEM containing 7 μg/ml blasticidin for 10 days, and individual clones were isolated into 24-well plates, expanded, and analyzed for expression of endogenous ENC-1. COS cells were plated at 20% confluence the day before the transfection, and 10 μg of ENC-1 expression construct were transfected per 100-mm2 dish via the DEAE-dextran method. Differential display was performed using RNAimag Kit (GeneHunter) essentially as described (18.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4699) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from primary cultured cells at day 0, 12 h, 36 h, and day 9 was treated with RNase-free DNase. 0.2 μg of RNA samples were used for reverse transcription-PCR with each of the three different one-base-anchored H-T11M primers with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μl containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 37.6 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmdithiothreitol. 2 μl of the reaction mixture were used for PCR amplification in the presence of one of the 13-mers arbitrary in sequence (AP primers) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 2 μmdNTP (except dATP), 0.25 μl [α-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 unit of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The sequences of the two primers used for isolation of ENC-1 were 5′: 5′-AAGCTTCGGCATA-3′ and 3′: 5′-AAGCT11A-3′. PCR conditions were 94 °C, 30 s, 40 °C, 2 min, 72 °C, 30 s for 40 cycles and 72 °C, 5 min. 3.5 μl of each sample with 2 μl of loading dye were incubated at 80 °C for 2 min immediately before loading onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Differentially amplified cDNA fragments were visualized by exposing the dried gel to x-ray film. Candidate products were picked and excised from the sequencing gel, and the DNA was eluted from the gel slice by boiling it in TE buffer for 10 min. The eluted DNA was reamplified using the same set of primers used for the display and cloned into TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The original PCR product for the ENC-1 clone isolated from the differential display was ∼250 bp in length. A mouse brain λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened for the full-length cDNA with radiolabeled PCR fragment. A GenBankTM data search was performed using the Blast program. A hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length ENC-1 fragment was prepared by PCR amplification. Primers containing BamHI in the 5′-primer (5′-CGCGGATCCCAGCCGCCACTACTGAGT-3′) and EcoRI in the 3′-primer (5′-GCGGAATTCTTACAAGCTGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGGAAGGCAGGTGTTTCCA-3′) were used. The resultant PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen), which had been cut by the same restriction enzymes. The sequence of the resultant plasmid was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The antisense ENC-1 construct was also prepared by PCR from the ENC-1 cDNA clone using the following primers, 5′-CAGCCGCCACTACTGAGTTGAAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTACATTAGGAAGGCAGGTG-3′. The resultant PCR product was ligated into pPCR 3.1 (Invitrogen), and the insert was released by EcoRI digestion followed by ligation into the precut pcDNA6. The antisense construct was confirmed by restriction mapping. The rat tissues were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and were homogenized in the presence of 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate plus β-mercaptoethanol. Total RNA was isolated by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. Cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS; total RNA was harvested in TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The indicated amount of total RNA from tissues of rat or from cells was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in 2.2 mformaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After UV cross-linking, the membranes were prehybridized with ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) for 30 min at 65 °C and hybridized under the same condition to the32P-labeled cDNA in fresh hybridization solution for 1 h. After the hybridization, the membranes were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 40 min at room temperature and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min with several changes of washing solution. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screen, the autoradiograms were developed, and signals were quantitated by scanning with an imaging densitometer and analyzed with Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). After 72 h of transient transfection, COS cells were washed with PBS twice, lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice, and the solubilized fraction was clarified by brief spinning. The protein content was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty μg of protein was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid, 10% methanol transfer buffer. For immunodetection, the membrane was blocked with TBS-Tween buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at room temperature followed by incubation with mouse anti-HA antiserum (Covance) at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times and further incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) at 1:3000 dilution. Finally, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-Tween buffer, and the band was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Bio-Rad). The cells stably transfected with ENC-1-HA plasmid were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and the nonspecific binding was blocked by 10% goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS followed by incubation of mouse HA monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Covance) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h. For F-actin staining, the cells were further incubated with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 units/ml in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, mounted, examined, and photographed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss). To identify novel gene(s) that are differentially expressed in early stages of adipocyte differentiation and that may play an important role in initiating and/or maintaining adipocyte phenotype, we employed differential display techniques. RNA was prepared from primary culture of rat adipose-derived stroma-vascular cells. We employed primary culture, which may reflect in vivo physiological conditions better than the established preadipocyte cell lines. At confluence, the differentiation of primary preadipocytes to adipocytes was induced by treatment with 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 0.25 mmMIX, and 17 nm insulin in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h, after which the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 17 nm insulin only. The total RNA was harvested at day 0, 12 h, 36 h, and day 9 of the differentiation. The total RNA from rat liver and muscle was also prepared and used as a negative control for the differential display. Two candidates that were highly expressed at 12 and 36 h after treatment with the adipogenic mixture but at a low level at days 0 and 9 (fully differentiated adipocytes) and undetectable in liver and muscle were further examined. We report herein one such cDNA sequence to a 4.8-kb mRNA. Because Northern blot analysis revealed that the corresponding RNA was most abundantly expressed in brain, a mouse brain cDNA λZAPII library was screened for a full-length cDNA sequence. We isolated and fully sequenced a cDNA clone with an insert size of 4718 bp containing an open reading frame of 1767 bp in length. A 5′-noncoding region of 0.4 kb and 3′-noncoding region of 2.5 kb were present. The polyadenylation signal of AATAAA was present at nucleotide 4690. Subsequent to our cloning and sequencing, a GenBankTM search revealed that this gene had been cloned by PCR amplification as a brain-specific sequence and named ENC-1 (16.Hernandez M.C. Andres-Barquin P.J. Martinez S. Bulfone A. Rubenstein J.L. Israel M.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3038-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the coding region of our clone is exactly the same as the published ENC-1 sequence, our clone had an additional 0.18 kb at the 5′-noncoding and 2.3 kb at the 3′-noncoding regions representing a complete cDNA sequence. ENC-1 shares an approximately 50% amino acid sequence homology with Drosophila kelch, a component of ring canals that connect the nurse cells with the developing oocyte in egg chambers (19.Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Like kelch, ENC-1 was shown to be associated with F-actin in transfected medulloblastoma Daoy cells (16.Hernandez M.C. Andres-Barquin P.J. Martinez S. Bulfone A. Rubenstein J.L. Israel M.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3038-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike Kelch containing two open reading frames in a single transcript (19.Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), ENC-1 contains only one open reading frame. To confirm the protein encoded by the ENC-1 cDNA sequence, we transiently transfected COS cells with an expression plasmid containing the full-length ENC-1 tagged with a HA epitope at the C terminus. As shown in Fig.1 A, Western blot analysis of the cell lysates detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa, which is the predicted size of full-length ENC-1 plus a HA tag. We also stably transfected ENC-1 into 3T3-L1 cells and examined subcellular localization of ENC-1 by immunofluorescence. As shown inB, ENC-1 was colocalized with F-actin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, suggesting its function as an actin-binding protein in the context of adipocyte differentiation. Similar to kelch, in addition to the C-terminal kelch repeat domain, ENC-1 contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain. While the kelch repeat domain is implicated in mediating the interaction with actin filaments (20.Kim I.F. Mohammadi E. Huang R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Schmid M.F. Agris J.M. Jakana J. Matsudaira P. Chiu W. J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2361-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the BTB/POZ domain, as in some of the zinc finger proteins, defines a conserved protein-protein interaction interface for either homodimeric or heterodimeric formation (23.Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bardwell V.J. Treisman R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3424-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ENC-1 may interact with other BTB/POZ domain-containing proteins, either as a homodimer or by interaction with a yet to be identified protein, ENC-1 may bundle or cross-link actin filaments resulting in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. ENC-1 was cloned from the primary culture of stroma-vascular cells isolated from adipose tissue. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Northern blot analysis indicates a significant but low level of ENC-1 mRNA in adipose tissue. ENC-1 mRNA was highly expressed in brain and at a low level in testis but not in other tissues, such as adrenal, spleen, kidney, liver, muscle, heart, lung, and intestine. Because the level of ENC-1 mRNA in adipose tissue was lower than that observed in brain and because adipose tissue is comprised of mature fat cells together with the stroma-vascular fraction, we separated the adipocyte fraction from the stroma-vascular fraction. As shown in Fig. 2 B, mRNA for PPARγ, an adipocyte transcription factor, was found at a high levels in the mature adipocyte fraction but was barely detectable in the stroma-vascular fraction. In contrast, ENC-1 was predominantly expressed in the stroma-vascular fraction of the adipose tissue at a high level and was barely detectable in the mature adipocyte fraction. This is in accord with the fact that the stroma-vascular fraction is mainly comprised of precursor cells at different stages of adipose development, which we employed for primary culture from which we prepared the mRNA template for differential display. The fact that ENC-1 was abundantly expressed in the stroma-vascular fraction but not in the mature fat cell fraction from adipose tissue also suggests that ENC-1 might play a role early in the development of adipose tissuein vivo. In light of the differential expression pattern in the two fractions of adipose tissue, we examined ENC-1 expression during differentiation of primary culture of stroma-vascular cells into adipocytes. Consistent with the fact that we identified ENC-1 by differential display as a sequence that is highly induced early during differentiation, as shown in panel B of Fig. 3, the level of ENC-1 mRNA increased 12-fold as early as 12 h upon the adipogenic treatment of 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 0.25 mm MIX, and 17 nm insulin, and the level remained high through 36 h. mRNAs for adipocyte markers, PPARγ and aFABP, on the other hand, were not detectable at confluence or at 12 h upon dexamethasone/MIX/insulin treatment, and by 36 h, the expression of adipocyte markers was induced and easily detectable. At day 9 when the majority of the cells had differentiated into fat cells, as judged by cell morphology of rounded lipid-filled and high levels of expression of PPARγ and aFABP, ENC-1 mRNA was not detectable. The decrease in ENC-1 mRNA levels observed in in vitrodifferentiated adipocytes of primary cells is consistent with the fact that ENC-1 is predominantly expressed in the stroma-vascular fraction but only barely detectable in the mature adipocyte fraction from fat pads. As shown in panel A of Fig. 3, we also examined a preparation of primary cells that did not show the early transient induction of ENC-1. Because of the nature of the primary culture, the preadipocytes from primary culture vary in their response to the differentiation treatment. For example, the differentiation of primary cells has been shown to be dependent on the donor of the tissue and the age of the donor (17.Gregoire F.M. Johnson P.R. Greenwood M.R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: 664-670PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Kirkland J.L. Hollenberg C.H. Gillon W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C206-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Bjorntorp P. Karlsson M. Pettersson P. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 366-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Comparison of these two different preparations of the primary culture designated A (minimal differentiation) and B (full differentiation) provided us with insight into the role of the transient induction of ENC-1. Both preparations were treated in the exactly the same manner. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas cells in panel B showed a 80–90% differentiation, reflected by higher levels of PPARγ and aFABP mRNA, the cells inpanel A showed poor differentiation, reflected by the absence of increases in PPARγ and aFABP mRNA levels. Whereas the photomicrograph of the Oil Red O-stained primary cells of panel B at day 9 showed rounded lipid-filled adipocytes, the cells inpanel A at day 9 showed fibroblastic morphology with no significant lipid staining, further confirming the differences in the degree of the differentiation (Fig. 3). As indicated above, whereas cells in panel B showed 12-fold induction of ENC-1, the cells in panel A showed barely detectable levels of ENC-1 at all time points examined. This indicates that transient early induction of ENC-1 in primary preadipocytes in culture predicted the subsequent adipose conversion of these cells. To further examine the potential role of ENC-1 in adipocyte differentiation, we studied the time course of ENC-1 expression during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. As shown in Fig.4, upon treatment with 1 μmdexamethasone, 0.5 mm MIX, the levels of ENC-1 mRNA increased significantly at 20 h, continued to increase at 40 h, and reached the maximum of approximately 8-fold at day 3. After the replacement of the differentiation medium with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum only, ENC-1 mRNA levels decreased sharply back to the basal level at day 4 and remained at the low level throughout the remaining period of differentiation. The kinetics of ENC-1 expression were quite different from those of differentiation-related genes including aFABP. As shown in Fig. 4, aFABP mRNA was undetectable until 40 h upon differentiation, but the levels increased as cells progressed through the differentiation program. Clearly, the maximal induction of ENC-1 during differentiation is earlier than those of the adipocyte-specific markers including aFABP (Fig. 4) and the transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα (shown in Fig. 6), that are known to activate adipocyte genes, suggesting that the stage when ENC-1 elicits its function, if it does, is earlier than those for PPARγ and C/EBPα.Figure 6Antisense transfection of ENC-1 inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with ENC-1 antisense plasmid or control vector were plated and treated at confluence with 1 mm dexamethasone, 0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine in the presence of fetal bovine serum. At indicated time points, total RNA was harvested and 20 μg of RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis for ENC-1, PPARγ, C/EBPα, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and aFABP. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is shown as a control. The ethidium bromide staining of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA is shown below.

However, the target genes whose expression are modulated by each of these agents are far from being identified to date. Because the induction of ENC-1 was detectable early upon the dexamethasone/MIX treatment, we examined the effects of each of these agents on ENC-1 mRNA levels. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, treatment with the dexamethasone and MIX in combination for 24 h caused ENC-1 induction. Furthermore, MIX alone induced the same degree of the ENC-1 expression as that by dexamethasone/MIX treatment. Treatment with dexamethasone alone did not show any significant effect on ENC-1 mRNA levels. Clearly, the increase in ENC-1 expression during adipocyte differentiation was brought about by MIX present in the differentiation mixture. To test the specificity of the MIX effect on ENC-1 expression during adipogenesis, we also treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts with dexamethasone/MIX as we did for 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, both of these cell types expressed detectable levels of ENC-1 mRNA. However, unlike in 3T3-L1 cells, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts, ENC-1 mRNA levels did not change upon dexamethasone/MIX treatment. These data suggest that the induction of ENC-1 gene expression by MIX may be specific to the adipogenic pathway. It has been well documented that MIX present in the differentiation mixture causes cell shape change in 3T3-L1 cells. Upon MIX treatment, the cells decrease their surface and become spindle-shaped. Interestingly, this change in cell shape correlated with the transient induction of ENC-1, an actin-binding protein during MIX treatment. Hernandez et al. (28.Hernandez M.C. Andres-Barquin P.J. Holt I. Israel M.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 242: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that ENC-1 expression was increased during differentiation of SMS-KCNR cells to neural cells causing an extensive network of neurites. Changes in ENC-1 expression during differentiation, whether transient (adipocytes) or persistent (neuronal cells), are consistent with the fact that ENC-1 was expressed in fat tissue as well as brain, implicating its role in the development of these tissues. So far, we have demonstrated that ENC-1 was induced early in adipocyte differentiation of primary cells from adipose-derived stroma-vascular fraction and of 3T3-L1 cells; the transient induction of ENC-1 was earlier than that of transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, and that of terminal adipocyte markers, aFABP; the induction of ENC-1 in primary cells was correlated with the degree of subsequent adipocyte differentiation. To further address the role of ENC-1 expression during adipocyte differentiation, i.e. whether the induction of ENC-1 is required for adipocyte differentiation, we attempted by stable antisense transfection to decrease endogenous ENC-1 expression and to block the transient induction of ENC-1 observed early during differentiation. ENC-1 antisense plasmid was stably transfected into 3T3-L1 cells. Individual stable clones were isolated and screened for their low endogenous ENC-1 expression at confluence. Two antisense clones with the lowest endogenous ENC-1 expression were identified and subjected to the differentiation protocol. Although not shown, both antisense clones gave the same results. Vector-transfected cells were used as controls. The cells were plated at the same density and received the same differentiation treatment at confluence. The cells were harvested at days 0 (at confluence), 3, 4, and 7, and total RNA were prepared. As shown in Northern blot in Fig.6, the transient increase in ENC-1 mRNA levels was evident at day 3 in control cells. In antisense cells, not only was the ENC-1 mRNA level low at day 0 (at confluence) but also the induction of ENC-1 that normally occurred at day 3 was blocked and ENC-1 mRNA was barely detectable upon dexamethasone/MIX treatment. Furthermore, stable antisense transfection greatly inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation; control cells showed a 90% differentiation, reflected by the high levels of expression of a panel of adipocyte differentiation markers. PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA were barely detectable at day 0 but increased greatly during adipose differentiation. Similarly, other adipocyte genes including lipoprotein lipase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid synthase, and aFABP were induced dramatically during adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, antisense cells showed only a minimal, if any, degree of differentiation. Increases in mRNA levels for the various adipocyte markers were not detectable even at day 7. No apparent change in control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was seen in either antisense or control cells. Similar differences in the degree of adipocyte differentiation was observed as judged by lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining (data not shown). Interestingly, whereas control cells responded to dexamethasone/MIX at day 2 by forming long and narrow processes, the antisense cells showed no such changes in response to the adipogenic treatment (Fig. 6 B). By day 4, control cells became polygonal and started to accumulate lipid droplets, whereas the antisense cells showed no morphological changes that are characteristic of adipocyte differentiation (data not shown). The undifferentiated state of antisense cells persisted to day 8 at which time the control cells clearly showed uniform adipocyte differentiation (Fig.6 B). This antisense experiment clearly demonstrates that the transient induction of ENC-1 is required for subsequent adipocyte differentiation. At present, we do not know the exact function of ENC-1, whose expression is transiently increased early during adipose conversion. However, we postulate that ENC-1, an actin-binding protein, plays a critical role in dynamic changes that occur in the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular signals that trigger adipocyte differentiation. These events lead not only to changes in cell shape, but also to changes in gene expression (29.Ben-Ze'ev A. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30.Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). During adipocyte differentiation, as fibroblastic preadipocytes become spherical in shape, various adipocyte genes (including transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, and terminal markers, aFABP) are induced (2.Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). It has been reported that actin and fibronectin levels decreased somewhat, and this decrease preceded an increase in adipocyte gene expression (11.Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, preventing changes in actin assembly by maintaining the cells on a fibronectin-coated dish blocked adipose conversion of 3T3-F442A cells whereas cytochalasin D reversed this inhibition (13.Spiegelman B.M. Ginty C.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 657-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that dihydrocytochalasin B treatment not only efficiently triggered adipose conversion of the primary culture of cells from the stroma-vascular fraction, prolonged treatment caused, albeit at a low level, adipose conversion of even differentiation-defective 3T3-C2 cells (15.Pairault J. Lasnier F. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The dynamic changes of actin organization probably occur by the temporal and spatial controls of actin assembly/disassembly and cross-linking by various actin-binding proteins. ENC-1 association with actin filaments and its expression pattern during adipogenesis suggest that ENC-1 may be required for reorganization of actin cytoskeleton necessary for cell shape change from fibroblastic to rounded adipocyte morphology that precedes adipocyte differentiation. Further studies addressing the biochemical function of ENC-1 will provide insights into the process of adipocyte differentiation."

Control of intracellular polyamine levels is important, because depletion of polyamines leads to decreased cell growth and alterations in cellular differentiation (3Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J.

Thus, polyamine levels are tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including feedback regulation of the expression, activity, and stability of key enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis (2Morris D.R.

AdoMetDC catalyzes the decarboxylation ofS-adenosylmethionine, thus generating then-propylamine donor for the conversion of putrescine to spermidine and of spermidine to spermine. Expression of AdoMetDC is regulated by exogenous signals and also by the endogenous level of polyamines, which influence its expression at multiple levels including transcription, translation, and enzyme stability (9Shirahata A.

Translational regulation of AdoMetDC may serve as a fast response mechanism (13Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar), turning off polyamine synthesis quickly when intracellular levels reach a critical level. The mammalian AdoMetDC transcript contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) specifying a peptide of six amino acids with the sequence MAGDIS (14Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in mammalian cells suggest that translation of this uORF is necessary for polyamine regulation of AdoMetDC (15Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the AUG start codon abolishes regulation, and insertion of the uORF into the 5′ leader of a heterologous reporter gene confers polyamine regulation similar to that seen with the endogenous AdoMetDC transcript (15Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Inhibition of downstream translation by the AdoMetDC uORF requires its amino acid coding sequence but not its precise nucleotide sequence, because mis-sense codon substitutions but not synonymous substitutions abolish the suppressive influence of the uORF (15Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Saturation mutagenesis of the last three codons of the uORF in yeast demonstrate that only aspartic acid is tolerated in the fourth position, and only the homolog of isoleucine, valine, can substitute in the fifth position (16Mize G.J. Ruan H. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The precise positioning of these two amino acids relative to the stop codon may also be important, because carboxyl-terminal extensions and truncations of the peptide product of the uORF abolish its suppressive influence (16Mize G.J. Ruan H. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies imply a rather precise interaction between the MAGDIS peptide and its regulatory target. According to the ribosome stalling model of polyamine regulation of AdoMetDC translation (17Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), polyamines act to modulate an interaction of the fourth and fifth amino acids of the peptide product of the AdoMetDC uORF with some component in the translational apparatus, such as the peptidyl transferase center, the peptide channel of the ribosome, or a termination factor. The role of the sixth residue may be to position these residues in the correct orientation for this interaction to occur. This model predicts that a step in translation, such as chain termination or peptide release, would be inhibited through this interaction, causing the ribosome to stall over the termination codon. Ribosome stalling would block further scanning of ribosomes and suppress translation of both the uORF and the downstream cistron. This model implies that low polyamine levels would lead to relief of the blockade and allow translation of both the uORF and the downstream cistron. The ribosome stalling model of AdoMetDC translation is similar to that proposed for another sequence-dependent regulatory uORF found in theNeurospora crassa arg-2 transcript, with the exception that in this transcript the intracellular level of arginine regulates the stalling (19Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ribosome stalling model makes certain predictions that can be tested in an in vitro translation system. First and foremost, the AdoMetDC uORF must be translated, and its translation should be influenced by the concentration of polyamines. The effect of polyamines on translation of the uORF should be influenced by specific changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded peptide or in its length but not by changes in the ribonucleotide sequence that retain the amino acid coding content. Furthermore, for regulation of AdoMetDC to be a fine-tuned biological mechanism, we predict that uORF translation should be influenced by polyamines in a unique fashion not shared by other cellular cations such as magnesium. In the present study, these predictions were tested using an in vitro wheat germ translation system and a newly developed analytical procedure to measure synthesis of the six-residue peptide product of the uORF. Constructs were designed to produce capped transcripts driven by the T7 promoter that contain the AdoMetDC 5′ leader with wild type or altered uORFs (14Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not any of the open reading frame encoding AdoMetDC. The full 5′ leader is intact in these constructs, with the exception that the 14 nucleotides from the 5′ cap to the uORF in the mammalian transcript is replaced with 80 nucleotides from the pBluescript SK+ polylinker region. Furthermore, HindIII and BglII restriction enzyme sites were engineered for insertion of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the uORFs. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Constructs were linearized withXbaI, purified, and used as templates for in vitro transcription reactions using a T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Capped transcripts were made using trace amounts of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) to quantitate RNA. RNA concentration was determined in triplicate by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and liquid scintillation counting, using the specific activity of the [32P]UTP. The integrity of the RNA and also the relative concentration was verified by resolving duplicate samples on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel, followed by quantitation using the STORM PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). RNA was stored in aliquots at −80 °C with RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Wheat germ extract was prepared essentially as described previously (21Anderson C.W. Straus J.W. Dudock B.S.

In vitro translation was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using a modified procedure (21Anderson C.W. Straus J.W. Dudock B.S.

The final concentration of the components in the translation reactions were: 1.2 mm ATP, 80 μm GTP, 0.4 mm each amino acid (excluding methionine), 9.6 mm creatine phosphate, 2.0 mm potassium hydroxide, 64 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1.65 mm magnesium (unless otherwise stated), 53 mm potassium acetate, 2 μCi/μl [35S]methionine (specific activity, 1175 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), RNA (8 ng/μl), RNasin (0.4 units/μl), and 2 mm bestatin aminopeptidase inhibitor (Sigma). To each reaction, 20 μl of wheat germ lysate was added. The concentration of endogenous polyamines in three independent lysate preparations was determined (24Seiler N. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the lysates were found to contribute 40–70 μm spermidine, 15–25 μm spermine, and no detectable putrescine, to the final reaction volume. Additional spermidine (Sigma) or spermine (Sigma) was added to the reactions as indicated under “Results.” Reactions were incubated 20 min (unless otherwise stated) at room temperature and were terminated by placing tubes on ice. Unlabeled carrier peptides (30 nmol) with the sequence MAGDIS (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX) or MAGEIS, MAGDVS, MAGDLS, or MAGDI (United Biochemical Research, Inc., Seattle, WA) were added to samples as appropriate. Peptides were extracted from the translation mixtures by vortexing the samples with methanol (60 μl) andn-butanol (120 μl), incubating the samples at −80 °C (1 h), centrifuging the samples at 20,000 × g (10 min), and evaporating the resulting supernatant solutions to dryness (25Hackett P.B.

Extracted translation samples were resuspended in 30 μl of water (HPLC grade), followed by 130 μl water plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC grade; Pierce). Samples were loaded onto a C18 reverse phase column (inner diameter, 4.6 mm × 75 mm; Altex, Berkeley, CA), linked to a BioCAD Sprint Perfusion Chromatography System (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). Prior to loading, the column was pre-equilibrated with water plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted from the column using a gradient of acetonitrile (HPLC grade) plus 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 210 nm, and the peptides were eluted from the column at 21.5 ± 1.5 min, depending on the sequence of the peptide. This was determined by the HPLC absorbance profiles of peptide standards (30 nmol of unlabeled carrier peptides; data not shown). Fractions containing the peptide (4 fractions, 250 μl each) were collected, pooled, and evaporated. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile and spotted on silica gel 60 plates (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ). Plates were developed 5 h inn-butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (4:1:1) and dried. Carrier peptides were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.5% ninhydrin in acetone. Plates were wrapped in plastic wrap, and in vitro translation products were quantified using the STORM PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant software. HPLC/HPLC analyses were performed as described above, except evaporated samples from the first HPLC run were derivatized (26Knapp D. Handbook of Analytical Derivatization Reactions. John Wiley and Sons, New York1979: 253Google Scholar) with acetic anhydride (Sigma) and anhydrous methyl alchohol (Sigma) and then reanalyzed by HPLC. Fractions of the acetylated peptide peak were collected and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to quantitate translation products. The identity of the acetylated peptide peak was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Control translation reactions containing brome mosaic virus RNA (Promega, Madison, WI) were performed as described above, except the final reaction volume was 25 μl, and reactions contained final concentrations of 0, 1, or 2 mm bestatin, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 140 mm potassium acetate, and 70 μm spermine. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Protein synthesis was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiographs (Bio-Rad model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer). Synthetic peptides (30 nmol) were added to wheat germ translation mixtures containing 2 mm bestatin and 700 μm spermidine. Samples were incubated at room temperature or on ice (10 min), extracted, and analyzed by HPLC. The stability of the peptide was determined by comparing the HPLC peak heights of peptides incubated at room temperature versus those incubated on ice. Transcripts were added to wheat germ translation mixtures containing 700 μmspermidine and incubated at room temperature or on ice for 15 min. Transcripts were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and were resolved on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel. Transcript stability was determined in duplicate by comparing the intensity of samples incubated at room temperature versussamples incubated on ice, using the STORM PhosphorImager system. Capped transcripts of the AdoMetDC 5′ leader, containing either the wild type uORF or an altered version (Fig. 1), were synthesized and incubated in wheat germ translation mixtures with [35S]methionine. The stabilities of the transcripts in the wheat germ lysate were determined, and uniform recovery of all RNAs was obtained after incubation in translation mixtures containing 700 μm spermidine (data not shown). The peptide products encoded by the uORFs have half-lives of <1 min in wheat germ extracts (data not shown), and, thus, to stabilize the synthesized peptides, 2 mm of an aminopeptidase inhibitor (bestatin), was added to translation reactions. Using this concentration of bestatin, the recovery of wild type and altered peptides was found to be 75 ± 9% after incubation (10 min) in a wheat germ translation mixture containing 700 μm spermidine (data not shown). A similar situation was reported for the stability of other small peptides in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (25Hackett P.B. Petersen R.B. Hensel C.H. Albericio F. Gunderson S.I. Palmenberg A.C. Barany G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To ensure that the presence of bestatin did not interfere with the translational machinery, control reactions using brome mosaic virus RNA were performed. The addition of a final concentration of 2 mm bestatin had no effect on brome mosaic virus RNA translation (data not shown). Peptide synthesis from the AdoMetDC uORF was analyzed according to the scheme in Fig. 2. Briefly, after incubation of the translation mixtures, unlabeled synthetic peptide was added to act as a carrier and to monitor recovery during extraction and chromatographic separations. Unlabeled and35S-labeled peptides were then extracted from the translation mixtures with a combination of methanol andn-butanol and purified by sequential HPLC and TLC. As shown by ninhydrin staining of the TLC plate in Fig. 2, uniform recovery of the carrier peptides was achieved through the chromatographic separations. A PhosphorImager scan of the same TLC plate showed co-migration of the 35S-labeled products with the ninhydrin-stained carrier peptides. 35S-Labeled products were detected from reaction mixtures containing either the wild type uORF (MAGDIS) or the altered uORF (MAGEIS) after incubation for 20 min at room temperature (lanes 3 and5). In contrast, no signal was observed in reaction mixtures either lacking added RNA (lane 1) or incubated on ice (lanes 2 and 4). To confirm peptide production from the uORF, translation reactions were analyzed by an alternate procedure (Fig.3). After initial extraction and HPLC as in Fig. 2, the recovered peptide peak from HPLC was acetylated. Acetylation lengthens the elution time of the peptides from the HPLC column by 2 min, as determined by mass spectroscopy of HPLC fractions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the acetylated radioactive products of a translation reaction containing the wild type uORF co-eluted from the HPLC column with the absorbance peak of the acetylated MAGDIS carrier peptide. A similar observation was made for translation mixtures containing the MAGEIS uORF, but no radioactive products were detected in control reactions lacking added RNA or incubated on ice (data not shown). This result, together with the co-migration of radioactive products and the corresponding carrier peptides on TLC, establishes that uORF-encoded peptides are synthesized in the wheat germ translation reactions. Protein synthesis is strongly influenced by multivalent cations, which probably act at multiple steps ranging from aminoacyl tRNA synthesis to ribosome stability (1Marton L.J. Morris D.R. McCann P.P.

As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), synthesis of both wild type (MAGDIS) and altered (MAGEIS) peptides responded to varying concentrations of magnesium and spermidine with the expected bell-shaped curves (28Igarashi K. Sugawara K. Izumi I. Nagayama C. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Hunter A.R. Farrell P.J. Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The concentrations of magnesium and spermidine for optimal synthesis of the peptides were not far from physiological levels (30Hunter A.R. Farrell P.J. Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1964; 16: 245-300PubMed Google Scholar). Panels A and C of Fig. 4 show the final concentrations of magnesium in the translation reactions, whereas panels B andD show the final concentrations of addedspermidine. The wheat germ lysate contributes an additional 40–70 μm spermidine, 15–25 μm spermine, and no detectable putrescine to the final reaction volume of the reactions, as described under “Experimental Procedures”). At all concentrations of magnesium, synthesis of wild type and altered peptides was comparable, and, if anything, the wild type peptide was synthesized at a slightly greater rate (Fig. 4 A). Likewise, at concentrations of spermidine less than 300 μm, synthesis of the two peptides was comparable, but at concentrations of 500 μm and higher, synthesis of the wild type peptide was inhibited more strongly than that of the altered (Fig. 4 B). The differences in peptide synthesis in response to magnesium and spermidine concentration are observed clearly in the ratios of altered to wild type peptide synthesis plotted in Fig. 4 (C andD). This spermidine dose-response experiment was repeated three times, with different preparations of both wheat germ extract and RNA, with reproducible results. To investigate further the differences in peptide synthesis in response to cation concentration, time courses using low and high concentrations of magnesium and spermidine were carried out (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5, translation time courses of both wild type and altered uORFs exhibited the expected lag period (5 min), followed by linear translation (28Igarashi K. Sugawara K. Izumi I. Nagayama C. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Hunter A.R. Farrell P.J. Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In translation mixtures lacking added spermidine and including low (1.65 mm) or high (4.5 mm) magnesium concentrations, the rate of translation of the wild type uORF was somewhat greater than that of the altered (Fig. 5, A and B). Specifically, the translation rate of the altered uORF is 0.64 of the wild type uORF at low magnesium (Fig. 5 A), and 0.88 at high magnesium (Fig. 5 B), as calculated from the 5–20 min portion of the curve. In contrast, in translation mixtures containing 700 μm spermidine, the effect was reversed and the translation rate of the altered uORF was 2.4-fold higher than the wild type (Fig. 5 C). This last experiment (Fig. 5 C) was repeated three times, with different preparations of wheat germ extract and RNA, and a 2–3-fold difference in translation rates was consistently observed. This difference was even more pronounced in translation mixtures containing 900 μm spermidine (4.5-fold; data not shown). The stabilities of the wild type and altered peptides and also the corresponding transcripts were shown to be identical after incubation in a wheat germ lysate containing an increased concentration of spermidine (700 μm; data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that translation of the wild type uORF is more sensitive to increased concentrations of spermidine than an altered uORF, and furthermore, this differential effect was not observed with magnesium. It was of interest to investigate whether the sensitivity of wild type uORF translation to spermidine resulted from the ribonucleotide sequence of the uORF, the sequence of the resulting peptide, and/or the length of the peptide product. To this end, translation of the wild type uORF and various altered uORFs (Fig. 1) were compared in wheat germ translation reactions with and without added spermidine (750 μm). As shown in TableI, translation of the wild type uORF, the MAGDVS uORF, and a uORF encoding the wild type peptide but with synomynous codon substitutions (WOBBLE), were highly sensitive to the addition of 750 μm spermidine. The influence of spermidine on translation of the wild type and WOBBLE uORFs was comparable, whereas translation of the MAGDVS uORF may have been slightly more sensitive. In contrast, translation of the MAGDLS and MAGDI uORFs were much less sensitive to spermidine than were either the MAGEIS or wild type uORFs. In fact, translation of MAGDLS and MAGDI uORFs may have been slightly stimulated by 750 μm spermidine (Table I). In a similar experiment, alteration of the termination codon from wild type (UAG) to UAA yielded a transcript equally as sensitive to spermidine as wild type, but an alteration to the UGA termination codon resulted in 1.6-fold less sensitivity, as determined by comparing the ratios (no added spermidine/750 μm spermidine; data not shown).Table ISequence dependence of the sensitivity of uORF translation to spermidineuORFNo added spermidine750 μm spermidineNo Added/750 μm spermidineMAGDIS42.8 ± 0.19.6 ± 0.34.5 ± 0.1MAGD VS61 ± 311 ± 15.8 ± 0.4WOBBLE30 ± 67.3 ± 0.74.2 ± 0.5MAG EIS39 ± 219 ± 32.2 ± 0.2MAGD LS79 ± 6100 ± 30.80 ± 0.03MAGDI77 ± 483 ± 20.94 ± 0.02Wheat germ translation reactions containing the appropriate uORF and either no added spermidine or 750 μm spermidine were carried out for 20 min and analyzed using the HPLC/TLC method (Fig. 2).

Cleavage was abolished by the caspase-3-selective inhibitor, z-DEVD-CHO but not the caspase-1 selective inhibitor, z-YVAD-CHO. Caspase-3 treatment of PDE4A5, expressed either transiently in COS cells or generated in vitro by coupled transcription translation, generated a similar cleavage product of 100 kDa compared with the native 110-kDa PDE4A5.

The N-terminal truncate PDE4A5-ΔP3 was engineered to mimic the caspase-cleaved product of PDE4A5. This showed altered catalytic activity and, unlike PDE4A5, was unable to interact with the SH3 domain of the tyrosyl kinase, LYN. Although both PDE4A5 and PDE4A5-ΔP3 were localized at cell cortical regions (ruffles), the distinct perinuclear association noted for both PDE4A5 and LYN was not seen for PDE4A5-ΔP3. Staurosporine-induced apoptosis caused a marked redistribution of PDE4A5 but not PDE4A8 in stably transfected Rat-1 cells. The PDE4-selective inhibitor, rolipram together with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, caused a synergistic increase in the apoptosis of Rat-1 cells. Overexpression of PDE4A5 in Rat-1 cells protected against staurosporine-induced apoptosis in contrast to overexpression of PDE4A8, which potentiated apoptosis. PDE4A5 may be the sole PDE4 family member to provide a substrate for caspase-3 cleavage and this action serves to remove the SH3 binding domain that is unique to this isoform within the PDE4A family and to alter its intracellular targeting.

Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit a characteristic series of dramatic cellular changes, including DNA cleavage, nuclear breakdown, cell membrane blebbing, and fragmentation of cytoplasmic organelles. Ultimately, these events lead to the fragmentation of the cell, generating apoptotic bodies that are swiftly engulfed by neighboring cells within tissues, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. A wide variety of stimuli can initiate apoptosis. These include cellular stresses such as UV irradiation, heat shock, and DNA damage as well as extracellular signals initiated by peptide growth factors, interleukins, and cytokines. These diverse stimuli converge on a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases (2Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P. Van Criekinge W.

Mammalian homologues, despite their shared requirement for cleavage after aspartate residues, are highly specific in their substrate preferences with the sequence of three residues immediately N-terminal to the aspartate cleavage site conferring specificity. Caspases are synthesized in the cell as inactive forms and are activated via autoproteolysis at internal caspase cleavage sites in a cascading process similar to that of the immune complement system. They can be divided into initiator caspases and downstream (effector) caspases such as the ubiquitously expressed caspase-3 (CPP32), which are implicated in the specific cleavage of cellular proteins essential for the structured dismantling of the cell during apoptosis (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

Cellular substrates cleaved by effector caspases during the apoptotic pathway can be divided into two main groups. The first group includes those proteins that are considered to be regulators of apoptosis and that are either activated or inactivated by caspase cleavage. The second group includes members of housekeeping or structural protein families whose cleavage is required for the disassembly of the cell (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

The ubiquitous second messenger, cAMP appears to modulate apoptotic signals in a wide variety of cell types. Agents elevating cAMP levels have been shown to induce, augment, or inhibit apoptosis in a cell-type specific fashion (7Kim D.H. Lerner A.

The control of intracellular cAMP levels is achieved by a complex signaling system involving multienzyme families of adenylyl cyclases, protein kinase A (PKA)1 and cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) (13Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A seemingly important facet of this signaling system is the phenomenon of cAMP compartmentalization observed in a number of different cell types (13Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 14Murphy B.J. Scott J.D. Trends Cardiovasc.

This can arise through the distinct intracellular localization of separate adenylyl cyclase isoforms, the specific intracellular targeting of cAMP-specific PDE isoforms via alternatively spliced N-terminal regions, and the binding of PKA isoforms to specific anchoring proteins. The sole route for cAMP degradation in cells is through the action of cAMP phosphodiesterases (16Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Manganiello V.C. Taira M. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Cell.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). These enzymes are encoded by a large multigene family, which differ in regulatory properties and intracellular localization. As such, they are poised to exert a profound regulatory effect on cAMP cell signaling. Recently, rolipram, a selective inhibitor of the PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase enzyme family has been shown to induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (7Kim D.H. Lerner A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion of the use of PDE4-selective inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of lymphoid malignancies (7Kim D.H. Lerner A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to their proposed use in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS (21Torphy T.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Over 16 different PDE4, cAMP-specific enzymes have been identified (16Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These are encoded by four separate genes (A, B, C, and D), each of which generates a number of isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. PDE4 isoenzymes are uniquely characterized by upstream conserved regions UCR1 and UCR2 located between the isoform-specific N-terminal region and the catalytic unit. The “long” PDE4 isoforms, such as PDE4A5 and PDE4A8, possess both UCR1 and UCR2, whereas short isoforms, such as PDE4A1, lack UCR1 (16Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Each splice variant is then characterized by a unique N-terminal region, which appears to confer intracellular targeting (24Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and interaction with anchor/scaffold proteins (25Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol.

Thus, for example, the N terminus of PDE4D5 isoform confers an ability to interact with the scaffold protein RACK1 (25Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and the N terminus of PDE4A5 isoform confers an ability to interact with the SH3 domains of specific proteins, such as that of the SRC family tyrosyl kinase LYN (27O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I. Wakefield J. Houslay E.S. Wishart W. Bolger G. Frame M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we show that the N-terminal region of PDE4A5 uniquely possesses a cleavage site for caspase-3. Cleavage at this site is shown to occur in cells undergoing apoptosis as well as in vitro using recombinant caspase-3. An N-terminal truncated form of PDE4A5, which lacks the region cleaved by caspase-3, had altered activity and was unable to interact with the SH3 domain of the tyrosyl kinase LYN. We show that caspase-3 cleavage of PDE4A5 alters the intracellular distribution of PDE4A5 and suggest that this may have consequences for compartmentalized cAMP signaling. Protease inhibitor tablets were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Peptide caspase inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase and [3H]cAMP and ECL reagent were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dithiothreitol, Triton X-100, andN–[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad (Herts, UK). Rolipram was a kind gift from Schering. All other materials were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Rat-1 fibroblasts were obtained from M. Frame (Beatson Institute, Glasgow) and were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air in a complete growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1% v/v), penicillin (104 units/ml), streptomycin (104 μg/ml), 2 mm glutamine, and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with previously described constructs encoding PDE4A5 (pSV.SPORT-PDE4A5) (28McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and PDE4A8 (pCDNA3-PDE4A) (29Bolger G.B. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This was done as described in our previous study (30Pooley L. Shakur Y. Rena G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 271: 177-185Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 60% confluency on 10-cm plates 24 h before transfection. A “transfection mix” of 70 μl of the transfection reagent DOTAP and 10 μg of DNA in total volume of 500 μl of HBS (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was prepared and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After addition of the transfection mix to the cells, the cells were incubated for 66 h with one change of medium, and then transfected cells were selected by inclusion of 1 mg/ml geneticin G418 sulfate in the growth medium. Transfected colonies were individually picked into multiwell cell culture dishes, expanded, and maintained. PC12 cells were obtained from the European Community Animal Cell Collection. They were maintained routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (104 units/ml), streptomycin (104 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine and supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were differentiated by seeding onto collagen-coated 10-cm plates and grown for 24 h in serum-containing medium. On reaching 70% confluency, cells were incubated for 7–10 days in 2% horse serum containing growth medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). To induce apoptosis by NGF withdrawal, cells were washed three times before incubating in serum-free medium. Cells were harvested by first washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then scraping them into lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) with added protease inhibitors. They were then incubated end-on-end at 4 °C for 30 min. Unbroken cells and debris were then discarded following centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 10 min. This was done using a modified method of that described in our previous study (31MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Peden A.H. Bolger G.B. Vernon R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3549-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton-soluble extracts of cells were prepared and 300 μg of protein in 750 μl of lysis buffer was precleared on 30 μl of washed protein A beads, for 30 min at 4 °C. 15 μl of antibody was added to the precleared cell lysate, and the sample was incubated, end-over-end, for 2 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of washed protein A beads were added and the sample was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. Following this, the sample was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 × gat 4 °C for 5 min, and the resultant pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in PBS solution containing protease inhibitors before the pellet was boiled in Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-682Crossref Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained and transfected essentially as described in our previous study (33Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded at approximately 33% confluency onto 10-cm diameter plates. Immediately before transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum together with 0.1 mm chloroquine. 10 μg of DNA was diluted to 250 μl with TE buffer (10 mmTris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH7.6), and 200 μl of 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran was then added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before addition to the culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3–4 h before the medium was aspirated and the cells shocked for 2 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in a PBS solution. The culture was then rinsed twice in PBS solution before Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5%CO2 atmosphere for 72 h. Disruption of cells and the isolation of particulate and high speed supernatant fractions were done as described in our previous study (33Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fractionation was carried out in KHEM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors. Cells to be treated with staurosporine were grown to confluency and then serum-starved overnight before treatment. Staurosporine (1 μm) was added to cells in complete growth medium, and the cells were incubated for the times indicated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Where peptide caspase inhibitors were used these were added at the concentrations indicated 3 h before the addition of staurosporine. 8% acrylamide gels were used, and the samples were boiled for 5 min after being resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Gels were run at 8 mA/gel overnight or 50 mA/gel for 4–5 h with cooling. For detection of transfected PDE by Western blotting, 2- to 50-μg protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose before being immunoblotted using specific antisera. Labeled bands were identified by using anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked IgG, and the ECL Western blotting (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a visualization protocol. The peptide antisera used in this study have been described in detail in our previous work (28McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

The C-terminal antiserum was generated to detect specifically the C-terminal region found in common to all of the rodent PDE4A isoforms. The N-terminal antiserum is able to detect specifically the N-terminal region of the isoform PDE4A5 but not that of other PDE4A isoforms. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was assayed by a modification of the two-step procedure of Thompson and Appleman (35Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as we have described previously (36Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 30 °C, and in all experiments a freshly prepared slurry of Dowex:H2O:ethanol (1:1:1) was used for determination of activities. Initial rates were taken from linear time courses of activity. All kinetics measurements were performed as described previously (33Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To define K m andV max values, data from PDE assays were done over a range of cAMP substrate concentrations and then analyzed as before (33Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I.

As described before in some detail (26McPhee I. Yarwood S.J. Huston E. Scotland G. Beard M.B. Ross A.H. Houslay E.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

Gene. 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), relative V max values were obtained by using equal amounts of PDE4A immunoreactive protein in assays as determined using the PDE4A-specific C-terminal antiserum. Total PDE4 activity in cells was determined at a substrate concentration of 1 μmcAMP and defined as the amount of PDE activity that could be inhibited by the addition of 10 μm rolipram. This is a concentration at which rolipram serves as a PDE4-selective inhibitor and can completely inhibit PDE4 activity (16Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were plated out onto coverslips (18 × 18 mm) at about 40% confluency 48 h after transfection. After another 24 h, the cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline. In the case of staurosporine-treated Rat-1 fibroblasts, cells were plated onto coverslips at 30% confluency. After 24 h these cells were serum-starved overnight before treating with 1 μm staurosporine for the time indicated, and all cells were in culture for the same length of time and fixed simultaneously in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized with three changes of 0.2% Triton in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min and, following four 5-min blocking incubations with 20% goat serum and 4% bovine serum albumin, were labeled for 2 h with polyclonal antibodies raised against specific peptide sequences of the C-terminal region of PDE4A5 (28McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Labeling was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or tetramethylrhodamine β-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Co-staining of cells was achieved using a monoclonal mouse anti-LYN antibody (Transduction laboratories, Lexington, KY)) at a dilution of 1:100. Localization of proteins was visualized using the complementary FITC- or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG to the polyclonal staining. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. Cells were visualized using a laser-scanning confocal microscope using an Axiovert 100 microscope with a X63/1.4-NA plan apochromat lens, as described previously (33Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of images and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed using an Improvision Open-Lab package (kindly on loan from Improvision Labs). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuickChange DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutagenesis and deletion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Apoptotic cells were quantified using annexin V flow cytometry or qualified using DNA cleavage analysis. Annexin V flow cytometry exploits the fact that there occurs a loss of membrane lipid asymmetry in early apoptosis. This results in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which can then be detected. All cells were serum-starved for 24 h before adding ligands to evaluate action on apoptosis. These cells were either treated with staurosporine (1 μm), forskolin (50 μm), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 100 μm), or rolipram (10 μm) over the indicated time period. Briefly, cells were removed from culture plates by trypsinizing and then, following washing once in ice-cold PBS, they were resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). They were then stained with 5 μl of FITC-conjugated annexin V (Pharminogen) as well as being counterstained with 0.5 μg of propidium iodide (Calbiochem), to allow necrotic cells to be excluded. The cells were subsequently analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN. DNA ladder isolation was performed using the Oncogene Suicide Track Kit (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase-3 activity was assayed using the Calbiochem caspase-3 cellular activity assay kit as described in the manufacturer's instructions. In vitrotranscription/translation (TNT) was performed using the single tube protein system 3 (Novagen) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Radiolabeled species were generated using [35S]methionine as described previously (38Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All recombinant caspases were generated in an active form as described before by one of us in some detail (2Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). 10–50 μg of cytosolic COS-7 cell lysate expressing the indicated PDE4A isoforms or 2 μl of the TNT reaction mixture containing in vitro translated PDE4A5, were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with various recombinant caspases. As described previously (39Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6"
https://openalex.org/W1990030568,"A full-length cDNA clone encoding the human mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (h(mt)TrpRS) has been identified. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high homology to both the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase ((mt)TrpRS) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to different eubacterial forms of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS). Using the baculovirus expression system, we have expressed and purified the protein with a carboxyl-terminal histidine tag. The purified His-tagged h(mt)TrpRS catalyzes Trp-dependent exchange of PP(i) in the PP(i)-ATP exchange assay. Expression of h(mt)TrpRS in both human and insect cells leads to high levels of h(mt)TrpRS localizing to the mitochondria, and in insect cells the first 18 amino acids constitute the mitochondrial localization signal sequence. Until now the human cytoplasmic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (hTrpRS) was thought to function as the h(mt)TrpRS, possibly in the form of a splice variant. However, no mitochondrial localization signal sequence was ever detected and the present identification of a different (mt)TrpRS almost certainly rules out that possibility. The h(mt)TrpRS shows kinetic properties similar to human mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (h(mt)PheRS), and h(mt)TrpRS is not induced by interferon-gamma as is hTrpRS."
https://openalex.org/W2144597842,"Axin and Dishevelled are two downstream components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Dishevelled is a positive regulator and is placed genetically between Frizzled and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, whereas Axin is a negative regulator that acts downstream of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. It is intriguing that they each can activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) when expressed in the cell. We set out to address if Axin and Dishevelled are functionally cooperative, antagonistic, or entirely independent, in terms of the JNK activation event. We found that in contrast to Axin, Dvl2 activation of JNK does not require MEKK1, and complex formation between Dvl2 and Axin is independent of Axin-MEKK1 binding. Furthermore, Dvl2-DIX and Dvl2-ΔDEP proteins deficient for JNK activation can attenuate Axin-activated JNK activity by disrupting Axin dimerization. However, Axin-ΔMID, Axin-ΔC, and Axin-CT proteins deficient for JNK activation cannot interfere with Dvl2-activated JNK activity. These results indicate that unlike the strict requirement of homodimerization for Axin function, Dvl2 can activate JNK either as a monomer or homodimer/heterodimer. We suggest that there may be a switch mechanism based on dimerization combinations, that commands cells to activate Wnt signaling or JNK activation, and to turn on specific activators of JNK in response to various environmental cues.

Genetic studies have shown that Axin is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling in that its mutation results in axis duplication (5Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L.

Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway via ligand binding to Frizzled receptors stimulates Dishevelled to inhibit GSK-3β, thus impairing its ability to downregulate β-catenin. The accumulated β-catenin is then translocated into the nucleus where it associates with the lymphoid enhancer factor or T-cell factor transcription factors (11Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and Rho is involved in this pathway (21Strutt D.I. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As with Dishevelled, Axin also appears to have a dual function. We have recently reported that apart from its well characterized role in Wnt signaling, Axin has a novel functional role that serves to activate JNK (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Domains on Axin known to be required for Wnt signaling,i.e. the regulator of the G protein signaling homologous domain for APC binding and regions for binding GSK-3β and β-catenin are not involved in this JNK activation. A novel domain, which we term MEKK1-interacting domain (MID), flanked by the APC- and GSK-3β binding sites and the C-terminal region of Axin, which includes the oligomerization domain, is essential for JNK activation. It is intriguing that Axin and Dishevelled, which are negative and positive regulators, respectively, in the same Wnt signaling cascade, can both activate JNK when expressed in the cell. Genetic analyses have placed Dishevelled downstream of the Frizzled receptor and upstream of GSK-3β, and Axin between GSK-3β and β-catenin (4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Whether Axin and Dishevelled activate JNK through the same or different mechanisms is not clear. Whereas it has been shown that they both have dimerization domains and that they interact with each other through the DIX domain (23Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 24Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known if they are functionally cooperative, antagonistic, or entirely independent in JNK activation. Here, we report that MEKK1 is not involved in Dvl2-mediated JNK, unlike JNK activation by Axin. We examined a possible mutual regulation between the Axin- and Dvl2-mediated JNK signaling pathway, and demonstrate that whereas Dvl2-activated JNK activity is not affected by Axin, Axin-mediated JNK activation may be regulated by Dvl2 through the DIX domain. Dimerization is critical for Axin activation of JNK, whereas it appears to not be requisite for Dishevelled activation of JNK. Our data suggest that dimerization choices determine the ability of Axin and Dishevelled to activate JNK. A series of different constructs of mouse Dvl2 (Fig. 3 A) were created using convenient restriction enzyme sites. Briefly, to construct mutants HA-Dvl2-DEP and HA-Dvl2-ΔDIX, the N terminus of wild-type Dvl2 was deleted at theApaLI and XbaI sites, respectively, and fused in-frame to the HA tag. To construct HA-Dvl2-ΔPDZ, wild-type Dvl2 was digested internally at XhoI and ApaLI sites, blunted with Klenow fragment, and religated in-frame. To construct HA-Dvl2-ΔDEP, the region between NotI and HpaI of wild-type Dvl2 was released and replaced with a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment using the primers 5′-GGAAGCAGCGGCCGCCACGC-3′ and 5′-gttaacGGCCATGTCCATGTGGAC-3′. Constructs for wild-type Axin, Axin-ΔMID, Axin-ΔC, and Axin-CT (Fig. 5 A) have been previously described (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for MEKK1, MEKK1-K1255M, and MEKK1-C were gifts from Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA), and HA-Dvl1 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Kikuchi (Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Hiroshima, Japan).Figure 5Dvl2 activation of JNK is not affected by Axin. A, Axin-ΔMID, Axin-ΔC, or Axin-CT does not abolish Dvl1- or Dvl2-activated JNK activity. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of FLAG-JNK1, plus 2 μg of Myc-Axin-ΔMID, Myc-Axin-ΔC, or Myc-Axin-CT, in the presence of 1 μg of HA-Dvl1 or HA-Dvl2. Immunokinase assays were performed and are presented as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The expression of Axin proteins and Dvl proteins was detected by immunoblotting separately using anti-Myc and anti-HA, respectively. The schematic representation indicates the Axin mutants used. The binding sites for APC, GSK-3β, β-catenin, MID, and DIX domains are indicated, and dotted linesrepresent deletions. B, wild-type Dvl2 forms a complex with wild-type Axin, Axin-ΔMID, and Axin-CT, but not Axin-ΔC. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of Myc-Axin, Myc-Axin-ΔMID, Myc-Axin-CT, or Myc-Axin-ΔC in the presence of 1 μg of HA-Dvl2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc, anti-HA, or control IgG. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting separately using anti-HA and anti-Myc for Dvl2 and the Axin proteins, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using SuperfectTM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 4 μg with the empty vector pCMV5 where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h post-transfection and lysed in a lysis buffer (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y.

FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma), and the kinase activities were determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79; Stratagene) as substrate (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fold activation of the kinases was determined by an imaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics model 425E) and normalized to their expression levels. Data are expressed as -fold kinase activation compared with vector-transfected cells, and the values represent the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Transiently transfected 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. HA-tagged or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Myc (9E10), or anti-MEKK1 (C-22) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies and Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as indicated. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with anti-HA, anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22), or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. We have previously demonstrated that MEKK1 binds Axin and is critical for Axin activation of JNK (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because Dishevelled possesses the ability to activate JNK (25Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (; Correction (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 33178): 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Moriguchi T. Kawachi K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we asked whether MEKK1 played a role in JNK activation by Dvl2. 293T cells were separately cotransfected with Dvl2, FLAG-JNK1, and wild-type HA-MEKK1 or its kinase-inactive mutant HA-MEKK1-K1255M, and assayed for their abilities to activate JNK. Similar kinase assays were performed on cells cotransfected with Axin as control. As expected, Dvl2 and MEKK1 each activated JNK by about 4- and 8-fold, respectively (Fig.1 A). Coexpression of Dvl2 with MEKK1 further elevated JNK activity (∼12-fold), but the kinase-inactive form of MEKK1, which reduced Axin activation of JNK (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), did not appear to alter Dvl2 activation of JNK (Fig.1 A). These results suggest that MEKK1 does not play a role in Dvl2-mediated activation of JNK. In agreement with our above observations, we did not detect any interaction between Dvl2 and full-length MEKK1 or the C terminus of MEKK1 (MEKK1-C) in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1 B). We also addressed whether the dominant negative forms of other upstream activators of JNK such as TAK1-K63W, ASK1-K709M, Cdc42N17, and RacN17 could block Dvl2-mediated JNK activation. We found that Dvl2-induced JNK activation was significantly suppressed by dominant negative Cdc42N17 and RacN17, 2Y. Zhang, S. Y. Neo, and S.-C. Lin, unpublished results. in agreement with a report on the involvement of Rac1 and Cdc42 in Dvl1-induced JNK activation (26Moriguchi T. Kawachi K. Kamakura S. Masuyama N. Yamanaka H. Matsumoto K. Kikuchi A. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, we did not see any apparent change in Axin-mediated JNK activation in the presence of dominant negative Cdc42N17 and RacN17 (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that the JNK pathways activated by Axin and Dvl2 are distinct. Because Axin binds MEKK1-C and Dvl-2 is capable of binding Axin (Fig.2), we asked if Dvl2 would affect the binding of MEKK1-C and Axin. In the presence of Axin, MEKK1-C was detected in the Dvl2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2), albeit in lower amounts. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed a similar result (Fig. 2), indicating that the binding of Dvl2 to Axin did not affect the interaction of Axin with MEKK1-C. Dvl1, a Dishevelled family member, has been shown to interact with Axin, and the interaction is thought to be via their DIX domains, which are also capable of mediating oligomerization to form homo-oligomer (24Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated if there was cross-talk between Axin- and Dvl2-activated JNK. First we asked whether oligomerization of Dvl2 was required for JNK activation. Dishevelled is known to possess multiple domains: DIX, PDZ, and DEP (3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar, 15Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We generated a series of deletion mutants of HA-tagged Dvl2 and assayed for their abilities to activate JNK. As shown in Fig.3 B, the DEP domain, but not the N-terminal DIX and PDZ domains, was sufficient for the JNK activating activity of Dvl2, similar to studies performed on Dvl1 (25Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (; Correction (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 33178): 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,26Moriguchi T. Kawachi K. Kamakura S. Masuyama N. Yamanaka H. Matsumoto K. Kikuchi A. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We asked whether the DEP domain played a role in dimerization of wild-type Dvl2. We found that Dvl2-DEP did not complex with wild-type Dvl2 even though Dvl2 was capable of self-interaction (Fig.3 A). These results suggest that oligomerization is not a requisite for Dvl2 to activate JNK. Because Dvl2-DIX and Dvl2-ΔDEP exhibited diminished JNK activation activity compared with wild-type Dvl2 (Fig. 3 B), we cotransfected 293T cells with Axin and either of these Dvl2 mutants and asked if JNK activation by Axin would be affected. Overexpression of Axin alone robustly activated JNK (∼9-fold) as seen previously (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and this activity was increased to ∼12-fold in the presence of wild-type Dvl2 and Dvl2-DEP. However, coexpression with either Dvl2-DIX or Dvl2-ΔDEP significantly diminished the Axin-induced JNK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A), suggesting that Dvl2 mutants deleted for the DEP domain can regulate Axin activation of JNK, in which case they may bind Axin. To test this association, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using proteins tagged with different epitopes. Western blot analysis revealed that Myc-Axin coprecipitated with HA-Dvl2-ΔDEP but not HA-Dvl2-DEP (Fig.4 C). Conversely, only HA-Dvl2-ΔDEP coprecipitated with Myc-Axin. We noted that the complex formation between Axin and Dvl2-ΔDEP reduced the homodimer formation between Axin itself (Fig.4 B). The association between Myc-Axin and HA-Dvl2-DIX was also detected in similar immunoprecipitation assays, albeit with lower affinity (data not shown). HA-Dvl2-ΔDEP was capable of interacting with Axin at the C terminus (Myc-Axin-CT), which includes the dimerization domain, and removal of this C-terminal domain from Axin (Myc-Axin-ΔC) impaired its ability to associate with Dvl2 (Fig.4 D). Taken together, these results suggest that the N terminus of Dvl2, which includes DIX and PDZ domains, can complex with the C-terminal region of Axin and regulate Axin-mediated JNK activity by disrupting the homo-oligomerization of Axin, which is prerequisite for JNK activation. We have previously shown that mutant Axin proteins without the MID domain (Axin-ΔMID), the N terminus (Axin-CT), or the C terminus including the DIX domain (Axin-ΔC) are deficient for JNK activation (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We next examined whether Axin could regulate Dvl2-induced JNK activity. Cells were transfected with Dvl2 alone or together with each of these mutant Axin proteins and assayed for their JNK kinase activities. As shown in Fig.5 A, coexpression with either Myc-Axin-ΔMID or Myc-Axin-CT did not alter the level of JNK activated by Dvl2, despite their abilities to form complex with HA-Dvl2 (Fig.5 B). Myc-Axin-ΔC, which also did not affect Dvl2 activation of JNK (Fig. 5 A), did not bind Dvl2 (Fig.5 B). We obtained similar results when the same experiments were carried out with Dvl1 (Fig. 5 A). Taken together, these data suggest that the Dishevelled-mediated JNK pathway is not regulated by Axin, and homodimerization is not requisite for Dishevelled activation of JNK. It is most intriguing that Axin and Dishevelled, two critical factors that function as negative and positive regulators, respectively, in the same Wnt signaling pathway can activate a common kinase, JNK. The present study has examined if they activate JNK independently or cooperatively. We show that, whereas MEKK1 plays a critical role in JNK activation by Axin, it is not involved in Dvl2 activation of JNK, indicating that Axin and Dvl2 activate JNK through different mechanisms. Moreover, whereas Axin requires self-dimerization to activate JNK, Dvl2 does not. Heterodimerization between Axin and Dvl2 appears not to affect the ability of Dvl2 to activate JNK, yet it abolishes Axin activation of JNK. Axin and Dishevelled proteins possess the conserved DIX domain, whose structural and functional importance has been revealed by several recent studies. Both a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen and in vitro binding studies demonstrate that Axin can bind itself through the DIX domain at the C terminus (14Sakanaka C. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14090-14093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

Similarly, the N-terminal DIX domain of Dishevelled is necessary for self-interaction or the formation of heterodimers either among different Dishevelled family members or between Axin and Dishevelled proteins (24Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These biochemical interactions are supported by distribution studies in Xenopus embryos that show colocalization of Dishevelled and Axin within bright vesicular structures in the cytoplasm (8Itoh K. Krupnik V.E. Sokol S.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fagotto F. Jho E-h. Li Z. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. Chem. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, the significance of such homo- and heterodimer formation in the functions of Axin and Dishevelled remains to be clarified. Whereas it is known inXenopus that removal of the DIX domain of Dishevelled results in total loss of the axis-inducing activity of Dishevelled (30Itoh K. Antipova A. Ratcliffe M.J. Sokol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2228-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), removal of the DIX domain of Axin does not affect its ability to ventralize frog embryos (8Itoh K. Krupnik V.E. Sokol S.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown Axin also has a functional role in activating the JNK signaling pathway and attributed the homo-oligomerization of wild-type Axin to be critical for JNK activation (22Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our results here clearly show that Dvl2-ΔDEP forms a heterodimer with wild-type Axin, thereby abolishing Axin-mediated JNK activation. This suggests the formation of Axin homo- and heterodimers may provide a mode of regulation for Axin activation of JNK in that homodimers would favor JNK activation, whereas heterodimers would suppress JNK activation (Fig. 6). On the other hand, Dvl2 activation of JNK appears to be independent of the formation of homodimers/heterodimers, based on the observations (i) Dvl2-DEP, which lacks the ability to complex with wild-type Dvl2, still retains the capacity to activate JNK; and (ii) Axin mutants, which lack the MID domain or possess only the C terminus and are deficient for JNK activation, do not affect Dvl2 activation of JNK even though they are fully capable of complexing with Dvl2. Thus Dvl2 oligomerization may not be critical for activating JNK, in contrast to the strict requirement of Axin oligomerization for JNK activation. This accrues future studies to address how Axin and Dishevelled attain balances between homodimerization and heterodimerization. One intriguing possibility is that this balance may be regulated by Wnt signal. Axin is thought to be dephosphorylated and destabilized upon activation of the Wnt pathway (31Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is likely that the lowered abundance of Axin may favor its heterodimerization with Dishevelled, thereby deactivating Axin-JNK. It is equally possible that other factor(s) may be recruited to fine tune Axin function. In particular, with the advent of casein kinase as one of the major players in the Wnt pathway (32Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 33Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the regulatory signal may arise from factors other than the Wnt ligands. The functional significance of the preferential inhibition of Axin-JNK by Dvl is not immediately clear. In our study, overexpression of Axin alone is likely to mimic a situation whereby Axin is in high abundance over Dishevelled when Wnt signals are absent, favoring the homodimerization of Axin. Coexpression of Axin with Dishevelled may represent a scenario in which Dishevelled delivers Wnt signals through interaction with the Axin-GSK-3β complex. Although this process is not entirely clear, recent work indicates Dvl1-Axin binding is necessary for the ability of Dvl1 and Axin to regulate the stability of β-catenin (24Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activated Wnt cascade favors the heterodimerization of Axin and Dishevelled. Activation of JNK is mediated via many signaling cascades and has been implicated in numerous cellular physiological processes, including morphogenesis, cell proliferation, and survival or cell death (34Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 35Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 36Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 37Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Dishevelled activation of JNK in Drosophila plays a critical role in planar polarity signaling, in which cells determine their orientation in the plane of the epithelium and reorganize their cytoskeletons in a polarized array (15Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (; Correction (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 33178): 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our finding that JNK activation by Dishevelled cannot be regulated by Axin suggests that planar polarity is separate from Axin function. However, it is unclear what the functional role of JNK activation of Axin is. The ubiquitous expression of Axin in almost all tissues from early embryonic development through to adult stage raises the possibility that Axin has a general role in regulating cell signaling, in addition to its well established role in embryonic axis formation. Our preliminary data suggest JNK activation by Axin may lead to apoptotic cell death. 3S. Y. Neo, Y. Zhang, L. P. Yaw, P. Li, and S.-C. Lin, submitted for publication. Work by Adachi-Yamadaet al. (38Adachi-Yamada T. Fujimura-Kamada K. Nishida Y. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 400: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) indicates that distortion of positional information in Drosophila during normal wing morphogenesis leads to JNK-dependent apoptosis of aberrant wing cells. It is possible that apoptosis caused by Axin may arise in those cells under conditions where the Axin to Dishevelled ratio is abnormally high. Dishevelled may be predicted to provide a means of controlling this Axin-JNK function, and the regulation is unique in that Dishevelled has the capacity to attenuate Axin-JNK, whereas Axin is unable to regulate Dvl-JNK. In conclusion, our biochemical data strongly indicate that dimerization choices determine the ability of Axin and Dishevelled to activate JNK. The dimerization combination is likely to be determined by some switch mechanism that mediates which of the two should activate JNK under a given physiological situation and that commands cells to respond to various environmental cues.

KDO is incorporated into these polymers as CMP-KDO, which is produced in an unusual activation step catalyzed by the enzyme CMP-KDO synthetase. CMP-KDO synthetase activity has traditionally been considered exclusive to Gram-negative bacteria. CMP-KDO synthetase inhibitors attract great interest owing to their potential as selective bactericides. The sugar KDO is also a component of the rhamnogalacturonan II pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants and of the cell wall polysaccharides of some green algae. However, the metabolic pathway leading to its incorporation into the plant cell wall is unknown. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of a maize gene, which codes for a protein very similar in sequence and activity to prokaryotic CMP-KDO synthetases. Remarkably, the maize gene can complement a CMP-KDO synthetase (kdsB) Salmonella typhimurium mutant defective in cell wall synthesis. ZmCKS activity is novel in eukaryotes.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 2Zahringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 50: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), where it serves as the link between lipid A and core oligosaccharides. KDO is also found in some capsular polysaccharides of the Gram-negative bacteria (3Lentner M. Jann B. Jann K. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 197: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Finke A.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The incorporation of KDO into lipopolysaccharides is catalyzed by membrane-bound KDO-transferase that requires a nucleotide derivative of the molecule, CMP-KDO (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The synthesis of this activated form of KDO is catalyzed by the enzyme CMP-KDO synthetase (E.C. 2.7.7.38) in a reaction that takes place in the bacterial cytoplasm.KDO+CTP→CMP­KDO+pyrophosphateREACTION 1 Activation of a sugar by its coupling to monophosphonucleosides rather than to diphosphonucleosides is very unusual. The only other known sugar activation reaction with a similar mechanism is the formation of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (6Edwards U. Frosch M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 75: 161-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMP-KDO synthetase is an essential gene product for the growth of most Gram-negative bacterial cells. Temperature-sensitive mutations in CMP-KDO synthetase (kdsB gene) are lethal at the nonpermissive temperature because the incorporation of KDO into lipid A precursors is blocked. These lipid A precursors then accumulate, inhibit cell growth, and ultimately cause death (7Osborn M.J. Inouye M. The Bacterial Outer Membrane. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 15-34Google Scholar, 8Rick P.D. Young D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second, nonessential CMP-KDO synthetase gene involved in the synthesis of capsular polysaccharides has also been described in Escherichia coli (kpsU gene; Ref. 9Rosenow C. Roberts I.S. Jann K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMP-KDO synthetases are traditionally considered unique to Gram-negative bacteria. This and their essential role in bacterial viability make these enzymes an attractive target for the design of very selective antimicrobial agents (10Hammond S.M. Claesson A. Jansson A.M.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the sugar KDO is not restricted to Gram-negative bacteria. It is also a component of the rhamnogalacturonan II pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants (12York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 138: 109-126Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Albersheim P. An J. Freshour G. Fuller M.S. Guillen R. Ham K.-S. Hahn M.G. Huang J. O'Neill M. Whitcombe A. Williams M.V. York W.S.

Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and also of the cell wall polysaccharides of some green algae (16Becker B. Lommerse J.P.M. Melkonian M. Kamerling J.P.

Pectins are a heterogeneous group of polymers that characteristically contain acid sugars such as glucuronic and galacturonic acids and that are present in the middle lamella of the primary cell walls of higher plants. Pectins are composed of three polysaccharide components: homogalacturonans, rhamnogalacturonan I, and rhamnogalacturonan II (18O'Neill M. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Dey P.M. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. 2. Academic Press, London1990: 415-441Google Scholar). Rhamnogalacturonan II is a small, nonabundant, and highly complex carbohydrate with a very diverse array of sugars showing different linkages. It includes sugars normally considered unusual in plants, such as KDO. However, rhamnogalacturonan II is present in the primary cell walls of most plants, including dicots, monocots, and gymnosperms (13Albersheim P. An J. Freshour G. Fuller M.S. Guillen R. Ham K.-S. Hahn M.G. Huang J. O'Neill M. Whitcombe A. Williams M.V. York W.S. Darvill A.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Cosgrove D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 171-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Pectins form a gel phase in the primary cell wall in which the cellulose-hemicellulose network is embedded. They are also the source of bioactive oligosaccharides (20Frey S.C. Aldington S. Hetherington P.R. Aitken J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of the rhamnogalacturonan II fraction, the specific contribution of KDO to its function, and the metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis, activation, and incorporation of KDO into this plant polysaccharide remain unknown. This paper describes the isolation of a maize gene, ZmCKS, that codes for a protein homologous in sequence and activity to the prokaryotic CMP-KDO synthetases. ZmCKS is probably involved in the activation of KDO prior to its incorporation into the cell wall pectins. The maize gene can complement a Salmonella typhimurium mutant for the kdsB gene, defective in bacterial cell wall synthesis. This indicates a remarkable conservation of the incorporation pathways of KDO into the cell walls of bacteria and plants. The unusually high sequence homology between the maize gene and its prokaryotic counterparts and the deviation of the normal codon usage of maize shown by ZmCKS suggest a horizontal transfer event originally introduced ZmCKS related genes into plant genomes. Standard DNA manipulation techniques were used as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TheZmCKS cDNA clone was isolated from a previously described cDNA library synthesized from maize (Zea maysL. line A69Y) endosperm RNA (22Hueros G. Varotto S. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A genomic fragment corresponding toZmCKS was obtained by PCR amplification from genomic DNA of the maize line A69Y using primers 9–2E1 5′-CACAGGATCCAGCCGCGCGGTGGGGATC-3′ (nucleotide positions 211–228 in Fig. 1 plus a BamHI target 5′-end extension shown here underlined) and 9–2Eb 5′-ACACAGATCTCTGAATGTTTCTCGTTCG-3′ (nucleotide positions 954–937 in Fig. 1 plus a BglII target 5′-end extension shown here underlined), which encompass the coding region ofZmCKS between amino acid position 51 and the translation stop codon (see Fig. 1). A unique 2.2-kilobase pair amplified fragment was obtained after 35 PCR cycles (15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 2 min and 30 s at 72 °C), cloned in pBluescript, and sequenced. mRNA was prepared from total RNA using oligotex particles (Quiagen GmbH). 200-ng mRNA samples were reverse-transcribed with superscriptII Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) primer in a reaction of 20 μl. 0.5 μl of the first strand of cDNA was used in a PCR reaction using primers 9–2E1 and 9–2Eb and a PCR program (30 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C). Southern and Northern blots were prepared using standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Southern blots, 15 μg of genomic DNA from the maize line A69Y, E. coli,Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum,Hordeum vulgare, or Triticum aestivum were completely digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel before transfer. Northern blots were prepared with 2-μg mRNA samples and run in formaldehyde gels. Transfer to nylon membranes was in 10× SSC. Filters were prehybridized and hybridized in 0.5 mNa2HPO4, 7% SDS at 65 °C (high stringency) or 50 °C (low stringency). Filters were hybridized with 15 ng/ml of a digoxygenin-labeled probe comprising the coding region ofZmCKS starting at amino acid position 51 (see Fig. 1). The probe was prepared by PCR amplification of the ZmCKScDNA clone using primers 9–2E1 and 9–2Eb (see Fig. 1) and a 1:4 dUTP-DIG/dTTP ratio. Filters were washed and further processed as recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). ΔZmCKS, a truncated derivative of the ZmCKS cDNA clone, was generated by PCR using primers 9–2E1 and 9–2Eb (see Fig. 1). The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI andBglII and cloned into the pQE42 expression vector (™Quiagen GmbH) to yield pQE42-ΔZmCKS. The pQE42 vector provides a start codon and a His6 tag, resulting in a vector-derived 12-amino acid N-terminal extension of sequence MRGSHHHHHHGS that is fused to the first residue of the ZmCKS protein, the serine at position 51 in Fig. 1. The resulting protein expressed from pQE42-ΔZmCKS has a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa. The cloning junctions of the construct were checked by sequencing prior to the expression studies. E. coli cells of the strain SG13009 containing the plasmid pREP4 expressing the lac repressor protein (23Gottesman S. Halpern E. Trisler P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were electroporated with plasmid pQE42-ΔZmCKS. In a parallel negative control experiment the same strain was electroporated with an “empty” pQE42 vector. Transformed bacteria of both classes were separately grown at 37 °C in 800 ml of LB medium containing both ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml). Once the cultures reached an optical density (600 nm) of 0.6, they were induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozime, 0.5 mm PMSF). All subsequent purification steps were done at 4 °C. Bacterial suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was passed through a Ni-NTA agarose resin column which binds to the His6 tag contained in ΔZmCKS. The resin was subsequently washed with approximately 80 ml of washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 mmPMSF) until absorbance at 280 nm of the eluting fractions was lower than 0.001. Finally, proteins retained in the column were eluted from the Ni-NTA agarose in 3 ml of elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm PMSF), concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon YM-10 membranes (Millipore Corp.), and protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method. Typically, 1.2 mg of protein was obtained in this final fraction from 800 ml of bacterial culture; quantification after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining indicated that ΔZmCKS represented approximately 80% of the purified proteins (see Fig. 5 a, lane S). A second major band present in these preparations, with a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than ΔZmCKS (see Fig. 5 a,lane S), appears to be a degradation product of the protein because the band almost disappeared when proteinase inhibitors were used throughout the protein preparation procedure. A much lower yield in protein was obtained from bacteria carrying the empty pQE42 plasmid. The proteins retained in the column were nevertheless concentrated so that an amount of protein equivalent to that of ΔZmCKS could be used in SDS-PAGE and enzymatic activity analysis. No trace of any protein resembling ΔZmCKS in SDS-PAGE mobility was observed in this fraction (see Fig. 5 a,lane C). The enzymatic CMP-KDO synthetase activity of ΔZmCKS was assayed as described previously (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, different amounts of the recombinant ΔZmCKS protein fraction and of the negative control sample (5–20 μl, corresponding to 19–114 μg) (see Fig. 5) were incubated at 30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml. Reactions contained 200 mm Tris acetate buffer (final pH, 9.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KDO, and 10 mm CTP, UTP, or ATP. Reactions were quenched by the addition of two volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The CMP-KDO produced was determined by a modification of the thiobarbituric acid assay followed by comparison of the resulting optical density at 549 nm with that of known amounts of KDO standards processed in the same way (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity equals 1 μmol of CMP-KDO formed per minute (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the determination of the apparent K m values of ΔZmCKS, reactions contained a fixed amount of the recombinant protein (0.03 units) and variable amounts of either CTP or UTP. To measure the production of pyrophosphate and the KDO derivative, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min with 0.1 unit of ΔZmCKS. After quenching the reaction, the levels of the nucleotide derivative of KDO produced were measured in one aliquot of the reaction mixture as in the standard enzymatic assay (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphate was determined in another aliquot using an enzymatic determination assay kit from Sigma-Aldrich (P7275), which measures the oxidation of NADH to NAD during the conversion of d-fructose-6-phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate by four coupled enzymatic reactions (25O'Brien W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). S. typhimurium cells of the strain RG103 (26Goldman R.C. Kohlbrenner W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 256-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were co-electroporated with the plasmids pREP4, which constitutively express thelac repressor protein (23Gottesman S. Halpern E. Trisler P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and either pQE42-ΔZmCKS or an empty pQE42. In both cases, transformed bacteria were selected by growing at 30 °C on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (resistance provided by the pQE42 plasmids) and kanamycin (resistance provided by pREP4). Twelve independent colonies from the first transformation experiment and four from the control were selected for further study. The sixteen isolates were plated on two sets of LB plates containing ampicillin and kanamycin but differing in the presence or absence of 1 mm IPTG inducer. After 2 h of incubation at 30 °C (26Goldman R.C. Kohlbrenner W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 256-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one plate of each set was incubated overnight at the restrictive temperature (42 °C), and the other was incubated at a permissive temperature (30 °C). In the course of screening for maize endosperm genes, a 1.3-kilobase cDNA clone (ZmCKS) was isolated that contained a potential open reading frame for a protein of 298 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig.1) and that was highly homologous in sequence (35–41% amino acid similarity) to the CMP-KDO synthetases of Gram-negative bacteria. The maize clone also showed clear homology to an anonymous partial EST from the gymnosperm Pinus taeda(Fig. 2). The ZmCKS cDNA clone was probably nearly full length because it was very similar in size to the corresponding mRNA detected by Northern analysis (see Fig. 4). The first methionine codon of the ZmCKS open reading frame is in a good sequence context for a monocot translation start site (27Joshi C. Zhou H. Huang X. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and appears to be followed by a typical N-terminal signal peptide (underlined in Fig. 1). The most likely signal peptide cleavage site is located between residues 40 and 41, and the resulting N terminus of the mature protein closely corresponds with those of the prokaryotic CMP-KDO synthetases (Fig. 2). The mature ZmCKS protein would have a molecular mass of 29 kDa, slightly higher than that of most of the bacterial enzymes (27 kDa). None of the reported bacterial CMP-KDO synthetases possess an N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 2). The leader peptide of ZmCKS could have joined the prokaryotic mature protein region during the evolution of the eukaryotic gene and targeted the enzyme toward a specific subcellular compartment. Signs of this composite evolutionary origin of ZmCKS were sought by comparing the codon usage bias of its signal peptide and mature protein coding regions. The codon adaptation index (CAI) developed by Sharp and Li (28Sharp P.M. Li W-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 15: 1281-1295Crossref Scopus (2620) Google Scholar) was used for this. The CAI measures the extent to which codon usage of a particular gene agrees with a reference set from other genes of the same species. Here, use was made of the data set of 676 coding sequences from Z. mays compiled by Nakamura et al. (29Nakamura Y. Gojubori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 292Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Typically, CAI values range between 0.7 and 0.8 depending on factors such as the expression level or the G+C content of the gene analyzed (not shown). In the case of ZmCKS, the complete coding region had a CAI of 0.64, whereas the region corresponding to the mature protein showed a CAI of 0.63, a figure significantly lower than that of the leader peptide (0.78). A comparison was also made of the codon usage of ZmCKS with respect to a reference set of highly expressed maize genes (as compiled in CGC, Wisconsin Package Programs, January 1991): those under the highest evolutionary pressure to adapt their codon usage to the optimum value of the species. In this case, a typical nonhighly expressed maize gene showed a CAI value between 0.36 and 0.52 (data not shown).ZmCKS, however, showed CAI values of 0.29 for the whole coding region, 0.25 for the “mature” protein, and 0.71 for the “signal peptide” coding sequence, further confirming that the part of the gene that could be aligned with the prokaryotic genes shows very poor adaptation to maize codon usage. This is in contrast to the signal peptide coding sequence, which showed perfect adaptation. These differences could result from different evolutionary origins for the two regions of the ZmCKS gene.Figure 4Expression analysis of ZmCKS.

Gel loading was calibrated by hybridization with an ubiquitin probe (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the identification of ZmCKS as a maize gene, a genomic fragment amplified by PCR using primers derived from the cDNA sequence (at positions indicated in Fig. 1) was cloned. Complete sequencing of this clone (EMBL accession numberAJ250331) showed, after comparison with the corresponding cDNA sequence, that the coding region of the gene is interrupted by the presence of seven introns located at nucleotide positions 303, 349, 436, 561, 701, 753, and 864. These introns are 506, 84, 94, 264, 76, 104, and 229 nucleotides long, respectively (Fig. 1). In all cases the left and right splice sites are the canonical GT and AG dinucleotides. Southern blot analysis of maize genomic DNA probed withZmCKS cDNA indicated the presence of a unique copy of this gene per haploid genome (Fig. 3,left panel). Related genes were detectable by low stringency hybridizations with the genomes of two other cereal species, wheat and barley, and with the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli, but no signal was detected in Arabidopsis or tomato genomic DNA (Fig. 3, right panel). Further, no sequences were found homologous to ZmCKS in the data bases containing the complete genomic sequence of the eukaryotic species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorbaditis elegans. As in prokaryotes, the incorporation of KDO into plant pectins probably requires its previous activation as CMP-KDO. ZmCKS would catalyze this activation step. Consequently, given the ubiquitous presence of this polysaccharide in plant cell walls, it is not surprising thatZmCKS messenger RNA could be detected by RT-PCR in every vegetative and reproductive maize tissue tested (Fig.4 A). The gene also seems to be constitutively expressed throughout development because only a slight variation was observed in its mRNA levels during seed maturation (Fig. 4 B). The maximum levels of accumulation of mRNA are reached between 8 and 14 days after pollination, when the cellularization process, and therefore a very active synthesis of primary cell walls, takes place in the endosperm. The close sequence similarity between ZmCKS and Gram-negative CMP-KDO synthetases prompted the investigation of the enzymatic activity of the maize protein. To this end, a truncated derivative of theZmCKS cDNA, ΔZmCKS, was prepared. ΔZmCKS lacks 50 amino acids placed at the N terminus of the ZmCKS protein, including the putative signal peptide (shown underlined in Fig. 1) and a short N-terminal extension present in the maize clone but not in its prokaryotic counterparts (Fig. 2). ΔZmCKS was cloned in the bacterial expression vector pQE42 (Qiagen GmbH) by replacement of its DHFR gene. The resulting pQE42-ΔZmCKS plasmid, in which the expression of ΔZmCKS is under the control of the lac promoter, was transformed into the E. coli strain pREP4-SG13009, which constitutively expresses thelac repressor protein. The recombinant ΔZmCKS protein contained at its N terminus a His6 tag and was partially purified by binding to Ni-NTA agarose resin under native conditions (Fig. 5 a, lane S). ΔZmCKS was shown to catalyze the production of a nucleotide derivative of KDO when assayed as described by Ray and Benedict (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The specific activity of our ΔZmCKS preparation at 30 °C was 0.7 unit/mg total protein. As a negative control experiment, a protein extract from bacteria carrying an empty expression plasmid was incubated in the same way with the Ni-NTA agarose resin. The proteins retained in the resin (Fig. 5 a, lane C) did not show any enzymatic activity, excluding the possibility that any of the two E. coli CMP-KDO synthetases is contaminating the ΔZmCKS preparation. To confirm that ΔZmCKS catalyzes the synthesis of CMP-KDO and not that of CDP-KDO, the levels of pyrophosphate and KDO derivative produced in the reaction were measured. The production of pyrophosphate is only possible if ΔZmCKS catalyzes the synthesis of CMP-KDO. Our results indicate that, when assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” 0.1 unit of ΔZmCKS catalyze the synthesis of 520 nmol of the KDO derivative and 470 nmol of pyrophosphate (a 1.1:1 molar relation). Consequently, ΔZmCKS has CMP-KDO synthetase activity (Fig.5). As with its bacterial homologues, the CMP-KDO synthetase activity of ΔZmCKS showed an optimum pH of 9.5 and was inactive when ATP was used as the nucleotide donor. The CMP-KDO synthetase encoded by the E. coli kdsB gene (L-CKS) was previously reported to have, at pH 9.5, an enzymatic activity with UTP nearly half of that obtained with CTP, whereas at pH 7 no activity was detected with UTP (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, the maize protein showed a less marked preference for CTP over UTP. At pH 9.5 the enzymatic activity of ΔZmCKS was nearly the same with either CTP or UTP, and only at pH 7 was the maize enzyme significantly more active with CTP than with UTP (Fig. 5 c). However, the comparison of the apparent K m values for CTP and UTP indicates that CTP is also the preferred substrate for the maize enzyme. The apparent K m for UTP of ΔZmCKS was 1.7 × 10−4m when measured at pH 9.5 and in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, whereas the apparent K m for CTP was significantly lower at these conditions, 6.9 × 10−5m. These values are similar to the previously reported apparent K mfor CTP of the E. coli L-CKS enzyme, 2.4 × 10−4m (24Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and significantly lower than that of the E. coli K-CKS enzyme (product of the kpsUgene), 2.5 × 10−3m (9Rosenow C. Roberts I.S. Jann K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No data are available for the apparent K m for UTP of any bacterial enzyme. The differences observed in the substrate preferences between the E. coli and maize proteins further support the idea that the activity measured was due to the plant protein rather than to a contamination from the endogenous bacterial activity. Expression of the ΔZmCKS protein in E. coli pREP4-SG13009 cells after IPTG induction had a drastically detrimental effect on their growth (data not shown).

In astrocytes, this ∼200-kDa, membrane-bound enzyme is composed of at least one p29 subunit, an ∼60-kDa, cAMP-induced activation protein, and one or more uniden- tified catalytic subunit(s). Recently, an artificial type II-like selenodeiodinase was engineered by fusing two independent cDNAs together; however, no native type II selenodeiodinase polypeptide is translated in the brain or brown adipose tissue of rats. These data suggest that the native type II 5′-deiodinase in rat brain is unrelated to this artificial selenoprotein. In this report, we describe the cloning of the 29-kDa subunit (p29) of type II 5′-deiodinase from a λzapII cDNA library prepared from cAMP-induced astrocytes. The 3.3-kilobase (kb) cDNA encodes an ∼30-kDa, 277-amino acid long, hydrophobic protein lacking selenocysteine. Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.5-kb p29 mRNA was present in tissues showing type II 5′-deiodinase activity such as brain and cAMP-stimulated astrocytes. Domain-specific, anti-p29 antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated enzyme activity. Overexpression of exogenous p29 or a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged p29 fusion protein led to a >100-fold increase in deiodinating activity in cAMP-stimulated astrocytes, and the increased activity was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP antibodies. Steady-state reaction kinetics of the enzyme in GFP-tagged p29-expressing astrocytes are identical to those of the native enzyme in brain. Direct injection of replication-deficient Ad5-p29GFP virus particles into the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats leads to a ∼2-fold increase in brain type II 5′-deiodinating activity. These data show 1) that the 3.3-kb p29 cDNA encodes an essential subunit of rat type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase and 2) identify the first non-selenocysteine containing subunit of the deiodinase family of enzymes.

However, appending a heterologous SECIS to the 3′-UTR of these inert clones generated artificial cDNA chimeras (SeD2SECIS) that yielded catalytically active ∼30-kDa selenoproteins in transient expression studies (30Croteau W.

In this report, we identify and characterize an essential substrate binding subunit of this key enzyme and the first non-selenocysteine-containing subunit of the deiodinase family of enzymes.D2 was first identified by affinity labeling with BrAcT4, an alkylating analog of the D2 substrate (46Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This substrate analog selectively labeled a 29-kDa protein (p29) with all of the properties of the substrate binding subunit of D2 (46Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both T4 and rT3 specifically block the selective labeling of p29 and the affinity label-dependent loss of D2 activity, whereas the product, T3, had no effect on either affinity label incorporation or BrAcT4-dependent inhibition of D2 activity (46Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rate inactivation studies confirmed that accumulation of BrAcT4 by p29 led directly to D2 inactivation (46Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that p29 was an essential subunit of the enzyme (14Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J.

This 29-kDa protein is encoded by a 3.5-kb mRNA that is found in all native tissues expressing D2 activity. Domain-specific, anti-p29 antibodies raised against synthetic peptides based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the C terminus of the p29 cDNA, selectively immune-depleted native D2 activity from detergent extracts of both the brain and BAT of rats. Importantly, cAMP stimulation was required before either exogenous p29 or the GFP-tagged p29 increased D2 activity in astrocytes. This finding is consistent with prior work showing that a ∼60-kDa, cAMP-induced protein was required to produce a catalytically active enzyme (37Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and suggests that composition of D2 is more complex than that of the other deiodinases. Both its short biological half-life and steady-state kinetic analysis confirmed that the enhanced D2 activity present in p29GFP-expressing cells was identical to that of the native enzyme in vivo, and that overexpression of p29GFP fusion protein directly increased D2 activity in the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats locally infected with a replication-deficient adenovirus carrying the p29GFP fusion protein cDNA. This is the first demonstration of an increase in functional D2 activity in the brain resulting from the expression of a exogenous cDNA encoding a D2 subunit. The ability of the p29 cDNA to directly increase brain D2 activity, together with the properties of the D2 activity generated by expression of exogenous p29 in cAMP-stimulated astrocytes confirms that this cDNA encodes an essential subunit of native D2 in rodents.The identification and molecular characterization of D2 has been a goal of many laboratories, because of its key role in maintaining levels of T3 in the brain.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The cloning of the first non-selenoprotein subunit of D2 allows this polypeptide to be used for the characterization of the remaining D2 subunit(s), especially the 60-kDa cAMP-induced subunit required to assemble a catalytically active enzyme and to direct D2 to the plasma membrane (37Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together with the well characterized, T4-dependent intracellular trafficking of the native p29 polypeptide, the p29GFP fusion protein provides a readily visualized reporter that can monitor intracellular trafficking of D2 in real time and allow the molecular events that regulate D2 levels in vivo to be characterized. Preliminary results indicate that the p29GFP fusion protein shows thyroid hormone-dependent endocytosis 2Stachelek, S. J., Kowalik, F. A., Farwell, A. P., and Leonard, J. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in press. with properties identical to those described for the D2 activity and native p29. Thus, the cloning of the p29 subunit of native D2 provides a key enzyme polypeptide for the characterization of the non-genomic events mediating D2 regulation and the first non-selenocysteine member of the deiodinase family of enzymes. The enzyme-catalyzed deiodination of thyroxine (T4)1 generates the bioactive thyroid hormone, T3, and is the essential first step in the mechanism of thyroid hormone action. In the brain, type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase (D2) generates up to 75% of the T3 found within the cell and plays a key role in regulating intracellular T3 levels (1Crantz F.R. Larsen P.R. J.

N174, we have calculated theoretical pK a values of the ionizable groups of this protein using a combination of the boundary element method and continuum electrostatics. The pK a value obtained for Arg205, which is located in the catalytic cleft, was abnormally high (>20.0), indicating that the guanidyl group may interact strongly with nearby charges. Chitosanases possessing mutations in this position (R205A, R205H, and R205Y), produced byStreptomyces lividans expression system, were found to have less than 0.3% of the activity of the wild type enzyme and to possess thermal stabilities 4–5 kcal/mol lower than that of the wild type protein. In the crystal structure, the Arg205 side chain is in close proximity to the Asp145 side chain (theoretical pK a, -1.6), which is in turn close to the Arg190 side chain (theoretical pK a, 17.7). These theoretical pK a values are abnormal, suggesting that both of these residues may participate in the Arg205 interaction network. Activity and stability experiments using Asp145- and Arg190-mutated chitosanases (D145A and R190A) provide experimental data supporting the hypothesis derived from the theoretical pK a data and prompt the conclusion that Arg205 forms a strong interaction network with Asp145 and Arg190 that stabilizes the catalytic cleft.

In chitinolytic enzymes, which hydrolyze β-1,4-linked polysaccharides ofN-acetylglucosamine or GlcN, the catalytic carboxylates have been identified (1Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T.

J. 1997; 322: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and their environments within the crystal structures discussed (4Tews I. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7954-7959Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5Brameld K.A. Goddard III, W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The carboxylate acting as the proton donor is usually in a specific environment, favorable to efficient proton donation; for example in hen egg white lysozyme, Glu35, which acts as the proton donor, is in a hydrophobic environment because of the van der Waals' contacts with the indole group of Trp108 (6Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar). This hydrophobic environment results in Glu35 possessing a pK a value (6.3) higher than normal and creates a widely extended bell shape profile in the pH activity relationship (7Inoue M. Yamada H. Yasukochi T. Kuroki R. Miki T. Horiuchi T. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5545-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Clearly, the interaction of the proton donor carboxylate with other amino acid residues is a very important structural factor in determining the maximum activity of glycosyl hydrolases. Chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. N174 has been extensively characterized in terms of both its structure and function (8Fukamizo T. Brzezinski R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 687-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chitosanase substrate is a linear polysaccharide of GlcN, which exhibits a polycationic (basic) property. Consequently, it is important to investigate the electrostatic properties of the chitosanase because the acidic side chain of the enzyme might participate in the substrate recognition as well as in the catalysis. In this particular enzyme, Glu22 was found to act as a proton donor, in cooperation with Asp40, thereby activating the water molecule to attack the anomeric carbon of the glucosamine residue in substrate (2Boucher I. Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Willick G.E. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31077-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the chitosanase deduced by Marcotte et al. (10Marcotte E.M. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Brzezinski R. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), these two carboxylates are 13.8 Å apart, indicating that the catalytic reaction takes place through an inverting mechanism (9Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Wang Q. Graham R.W. Trimbur D. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11594-11595Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, as is observed with hen egg white lysozyme, the proton donor Glu22 might not work independently but instead require some assistance derived from interactions with other amino acids. In fact, the carboxylate of Glu22 is in close proximity to the guanidyl group of Arg205 (see Fig. 1). To better understand the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, we have examined in detail the environment of Glu22. When an ionizable side chain interacts with nearby charges, this interaction should affect the pK a value of the said ionizable group. Thus, a shift in the pK a value of an ionizable side chain in protein from that of a model compound of the corresponding amino acid reflects the influence of the environment on the ionizable group. In recent years, theoretical methods for calculating the pK a values of the ionizable amino acid residues in proteins have been developed by several investigators (12Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi T. Nakamura H. Wada A. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Oberoi H. Allewell N.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 48-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Beroza P.

Most of these methods are based on the finite difference method for the calculation of electrostatic potentials in and around solvated proteins and have been improved by modifications to more accurately calculate the pKa values. Recently, Juffer et al. (17Juffer A.H. Vogel H.J. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1998; 12: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Juffer A.H. Botta E.F.F. van Keulen B.A.M. van der Ploeg A.

B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have developed a novel method for calculatingpK a values using the boundary element method in combination with continuum electrostatics. This method yielded theoretical pK a values very close to those obtained experimentally. For example the calculated and experimental pK a values for hen egg white lysozyme have a correlation efficient of 0.97 (19Juffer A.H. Argos P. Vogel H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on this result, the theoretical calculation of the pK a values of the ionizable groups in chitosanase should provide useful information on their environment. Intramolecular interactions in proteins can also be studied by unfolding experiments comparing wild type and mutated proteins. The thermal unfolding of Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase has been investigated using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy (20Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Okajima T. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and led to the observation that mutagenesis of the tryptophan residues that participate in the hydrophobic interaction in the core structure not only destabilizes the protein but also enhances the formation of molten globules in its unfolding process. Such an interesting phenomenon in the unfolding process might afford significant information on the intramolecular interactions of the chitosanase. In this study, we attempt to identify the amino acid residue that makes the largest contribution to the catalytic activity of Glu22in Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase. We initially calculate the pK a values of the ionizable amino acid residues using the method of Juffer et al. (19Juffer A.H. Argos P. Vogel H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and then use this data in conjunction with the crystal structure to select a site to mutate. Examination of the enzymatic activities and stabilities of the mutated chitosanases leads us to conclude that Arg205 is essential for sustaining the catalytic potential of Glu22in this chitosanase. Wild type chitosanase fromStreptomyces sp. N174 was purified as described previously (21Boucher I. Dupuy A. Vidal P. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. Appl. Microbiol.

Glucosamine oligosaccharides ((GlcN)n,n = 3–6)1were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. pK a values were calculated by the method reported by Juffer et al. (19Juffer A.H. Argos P. Vogel H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structure of the chitosanase was taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (chain A from entry 1CHK) (10Marcotte E.M. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Brzezinski R. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A surface enclosing the protein is described as a triangulated surface and acts as a dielectric boundary such that mutual polarization effects between the solvent and the protein are included. The surface roughly follows the solvent-accessible surface of the protein. The triangulation algorithm employed in this work is described elsewhere (17Juffer A.H. Vogel H.J. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1998; 12: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Partial charges were taken from Gromacs (23van der Spoel D. van Buuren A.R. Apol E. Meulenhoff P.J. Tieleman D.P.

Calculations were performed with an ionic strength of 0.15 m, the dielectric constant of the protein was set at 20, and that of the solvent was taken to be 78.5.

(Madison, WI).Streptomyces lividans TK24 was kindly provided by D. A. Hopwood (John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK). The vector pALTER-1 (Promega) was used for site-directed mutagenesis, whereas the shuttle vector pFD666 used for expression of wild type and mutated genes inS. lividans has been described previously (24Denis F. Brzezinski R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into the csn gene using the Altered Site System (Promega, Madison, WI) in which we subcloned the wild type chitosanase gene in pALTER-1, creating pALTER-csn (2Boucher I.

All mutated genes were sequenced in their entirety. After sequence verification, the mutated genes were excised by HindIII and XbaI digestion, subcloned in pFD666 vector, and transformed into S. lividans for expression. The mutated chitosanases were purified from S. lividans as described (2Boucher I. Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Willick G.E. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31077-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except that a MacroPrep High S cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad) was used in the first step of the purification. All of the purified mutant chitosanases (R205A, R205H, R205Y, and R190A) were found to almost retain the global conformation of the wild type enzyme when analyzed by CD spectroscopy. Preliminary evaluation of enzyme activity levels was performed by evaluating the clearing halos around colonies of S. lividans transformants growing on mineral plate medium containing chitosan as the sole carbon source (2Boucher I.

The enzyme activity was more precisely evaluated by measuring the chitosanase-catalyzed release of reducing sugars from the substrate chitosan by the method of Lever (25Lever M. Analyt. Biochem. 1972; 46: 273-279Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity on glucosamine hexasaccharide [(GlcN)6] was determined by HPLC using a gel filtration column of TSK-GEL G2000PW (9Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants (k cat and K m) were obtained from Eadie-Hofstee plots of the initial velocities as determined from the increase in reducing sugar concentration and the concentration (μg/ml) of substrate chitosan. Thermal unfolding curves of the chitosanases were experimentally obtained in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (cell length, 0.1 cm). The CD value at 222 nm was monitored while raising the temperature of the solution at a rate of 1 °C/min. The temperature was directly measured using a model DP-500 thermometer (Rikagaku Kogyo). Unfolding curves were also obtained under the same conditions by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 295 nm; emission wavelength, 330 nm) using a Hitachi F-3010 spectrofluorometer. To facilitate comparison between the two sets of unfolding curves, the experimental data were normalized by calculating the fraction of unfolded protein from either the CD or fluorescence intensity by linearly extrapolating the pre- and post-transition base lines into the transition zone and then plotting against temperature. Assuming that the unfolding equilibrium of chitosanase follows a two-state mechanism (26Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IPL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar), the unfolding curves obtained by fluorescence were subjected to a least squares analysis to determine the midpoint temperatures (T m) and thermodynamic parameters. The enthalpy and entropy changes at T m(ΔH m and ΔS m) were calculated using van't Hoff analysis. The difference in the free energy change of unfolding (at T m of the wild type protein) between the mutant and wild type proteins (ΔΔG m) was estimated using the formula ΔΔG m = ΔT m·ΔS m(wild type) (27Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), in which ΔT m is the difference inT m between the mutant and wild type proteins and ΔS m (wild type) is the entropy change of the wild type protein at T m. The unfolding curves obtained by CD were analyzed by a three-state transition model, and the thermodynamic parameters were calculated as described above for the individual transition phases (20Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Okajima T. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of mutant chitosanase was performed on a Silicon Graphics (Personal Iris) station using SYBYL molecular modeling software version 5.4. Total energy (bond stretching energy, angle bending energy, out of plane bending, van der Waals', and electrostatic energy) was calculated for the whole molecule. The conformation of the mutated chitosanase molecule was modeled by local energy minimization. Theoretical pK a values of the ionizable side chains ofStreptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase were deduced using the method of Juffer et al. (19Juffer A.H. Argos P. Vogel H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To date, most theoretical calculations of protein pK a values have been done for relatively small proteins such as lysozyme, ribonuclease, and trypsin inhibitor. Here we report the successful calculation of pK a values for chitosanase, a protein of 26 kDa. To our knowledge, this is the largest protein for which pK a values have been calculated using the boundary element method (28Juffer A.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The calculated pK a values are listed in Table I.Table ICalculated pKa values of the ionizable side chains of Streptomyces sp.

The calculated pK a value for Arg205 is greater than 20.0, a result that usually indicates that the side chain is involved in a strong interaction with nearby charges (19Juffer A.H. Argos P. Vogel H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7664-7673Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Juffer A.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure indicates that Glu22is located at about 3 Å from Arg205 (Fig.1), and could possibly interact with Arg205 (10Marcotte E.M. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Brzezinski R. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the calculated pK avalue for Glu22 is normal (3.4), and mutation of Glu22 has been shown to have little effect on the stability of the chitosanase (29Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 411: 346-350Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the Arg205 side chain interacts with that of Glu22. A closer examination of the crystal structure indicates that Glu22 is not only close to Arg205 but also to a hydrophobic residue, Val148. It is a generally accepted rule that a hydrophobic environment can raise the pK a of an acidic residue. This might compensate for the effect of the proximity of Arg205, which would tend to lower the pK a. Thus, the normal pK a value calculated for Glu22 might be the result of this polar-apolar environment. In hen egg white lysozyme, an abnormal pK a value of 6.3 was experimentally obtained for Glu35, which acts as the proton donor (6Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar, 7Inoue M. Yamada H. Yasukochi T. Kuroki R. Miki T. Horiuchi T. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5545-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and this is regarded as an important factor in this enzyme ability to retain its activity over a wide pH range. As described above, the corresponding proton donor carboxylate, Glu22, has a normal theoretical pK avalue of 3.4 in chitosanase. The pH activity profile of chitosanase (21Boucher I. Dupuy A. Vidal P. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 188-193Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) indicates that the enzyme is quite active even at higher pH values (∼6.0), suggesting that the actual pK a value of the proton donor carboxylate should be higher than the theoretical pK a value of 3.4. The theoretical pK a values were obtained on the basis of the crystal structure of the free enzyme. However, the pK a value for the catalytic carboxylate estimated from the experimental pH activity profile is that for the chitosanase-substrate complex in which the conformation of the catalytic cleft is altered from that of the free enzyme because of substrate binding. In fact, the distance between Glu22 and Asp40 is 13.8 Å in the free state but is estimated to be only 12.0 Å in the complexed structure obtained by energy minimization (10Marcotte E.M. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Brzezinski R. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Such a conformational change induced by substrate binding might increase the hydrophobicity of the environment around the Glu22 side chain, thereby raising its pK a and resulting in the considerable activity observed at higher pH values. Arg118 and Asp119 were found to have theoretical pK a values of >20 and 0.8, respectively, suggesting a strong interaction between these adjacent residues. Similar interactions might exist between His9(theoretical pK a of 10.3) and the C terminus (theoretical pK a of 0.8) and between Tyr143 (theoretical pK a of >20.0) and Asp133 (theoretical pK a of 1.2); however, these interactions are not directly involved in catalytic activity. For this reason, we decided to focus our attention on Arg205, which is considered to be directly involved in the catalytic activity. To investigate the role of Arg205 in chitosanase activity, we examined the enzymatic activities of four chitosanases mutated in this residue (R205H, R205Y, R205A, and R205K). Initially, we examined thein vivo activity of S. lividans clones transformed with mutated chitosanase genes by the formation of clearing halos on chitosan medium (Fig. 2). AllS. lividans clones carrying the Arg205-mutated genes showed no halo (colonies 2, 3, 7, and 8), whereas that carrying the wild type gene formed a wide and clear halo (colony 1). Next, we tried to produce these mutant chitosanases using 1% glucosamine liquid medium. R205A, R205H, and R205Y could be produced and purified by the method reported previously (2Boucher I. Fukamizo T. Honda Y. Willick G.E. Neugebauer W.A. Brzezinski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31077-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but not R205K. The R205K-mutated enzyme was also produced at levels comparable with the other mutants but could not be purified because of its high tendency to precipitate at the moderately acidic pH levels used in the purification procedure. Most likely, the protein was misfolded, thereby exposing hydrophobic amino acids at the molecular surface. When the enzymatic activities were determined using the purified enzymes and chitosan as substrate, only R205A was found to have a measurable level of activity. Its K m andk cat values were determined to be 0.014 (wild type, 0.029) mg/ml and 0.83 (wild type, 727.5) min−1, respectively. The overall activity (k cat/K m) of R205A was 0.24% that of the wild type enzyme. Similar results were obtained using (GlcN)6 as substrate. The reaction time course profiles are shown in Fig. 3. The relative activity of R205A toward (GlcN)6 was 0.16% of that of the wild type enzyme. As observed with chitosan, both R205H and R205Y showed no activity with (GlcN)6. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Arg205 is essential for the activity of the chitosanase. Thermal unfolding curves of the mutated chitosanases, obtained by monitoring CD at 222 nm are shown in Fig.4 A. The individual profiles were biphasic showing a first cooperative phase followed by a second phase that is less cooperative. Each arginine mutation was found to greatly lower the transition temperature of the first transition phase and to enhance the formation of the intermediate state. Unfolding curves were also obtained by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 B. These unfolding profiles differ from those obtained by CD and agree with theoretical curves obtained by assuming a two-state mechanism. At 38 °C, the mutant chitosanases were completely unfolded as judged from their tryptophan environments (Fig. 4 B), whereas 25–35% of the total α-helices were still folded as observed in Fig. 4 A, indicating that the intermediate is in a molten globule-like structure. These phenomena are very similar to those obtained with tryptophan-mutated chitosanases (20Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Okajima T. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), for which the unfolding data were successfully explained using a three-state transition mechanism. For this reason, we tried to analyze our data using a three-state model identical to that reported by Honda et al. (20Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Okajima T. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The theoretical unfolding curves that best agreed with the experimental ones are represented by the solid lines in Fig. 4 A, and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters are listed in TableII. The loss of stability is about 5 kcal/mol for each mutant chitosanase in the first transition phase, a value that cannot be explained by disruption of a single intramolecular interaction. It is likely that the Arg205 mutation results in the disruption of a strong interaction network formed by the Arg205 side chain, in agreement with the explanation for the theoretical pK a value for Arg205.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for unfolding transition of wild type and Arg205-mutated chitosanasesEnzymeFirst transition phaseSecond transition phaseT mΔT mΔH mΔS mΔΔG mT mΔT mΔH mΔS mΔΔG m°C°Ckcal/molkcal/mol/°Ckcal/mol°C°Ckcal/molkcal/mol/°Ckcal/molR205Y32.8−11.21600.523−5.241.0−10.5870.277−3.6R205H32.0−11.51450.475−5.442.2−9.3850.270−3.2R205A34.0−9.21450.471−4.344.2−7.3650.200−2.5Wild type44.001480.467051.501100.3390The values were obtained from experimental unfolding curves shown in Fig. 4 A.

Decreased stability of elastin mRNA contributes to this developmental decrease in chick aortic elastin production. We have previously shown that destabilization of elastin mRNA is correlated with decreased binding of cytosolic protein(s) to a large, GC-rich region of secondary structure in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of elastin mRNA. In this study, using gel migration shift assays, deletion constructs, and antisense competition assays, we identify a major protein-binding site in the 3′-UTR of elastin as a GA-rich sequence (UGGGGGGAGGGAGGGAGGGA), which we have designated the G3A motif. This motif is present in the 3′-UTR of elastin from several species. Binding proteins are present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, and their abundance is associated with tissues producing elastin and correlated with circumstances in which elastin mRNA is stable. These results suggest that the conserved GA-rich sequence of the elastin 3′-UTR is an important element in the regulation of stability of the elastin mRNA.

Together with collagen, elastin is essential for the structural integrity and physiological function of the arterial blood vessels. Synthesis and accumulation of elastin in the aorta takes place over a relatively short period of time during development and growth, and is essentially complete by early adult life (1Lefevre M. Rucker R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Davis E.C. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, production of elastin in the aorta of the chicken is very rapid around the time of hatching but decreases markedly by 4 weeks and can no longer be detected after 10–12 weeks of age (3Keeley F.W. Hussain R.A. Johnson D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This developmental decrease in elastin synthesis is reflected in a marked reduction in steady-state levels of mRNA for elastin (3Keeley F.W. Hussain R.A. Johnson D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that decreased stability plays a role in the developmental decline in steady-state levels of elastin mRNA (5Johnson D.J. Robson P. Hew Y. Keeley F.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, in the 2-day-old chicken, a period at which elastin synthesis is rapid and elastin mRNA is abundant, the half-life of aortic elastin mRNA is approximately 25 h. In contrast, by 8 weeks after hatching when elastin synthesis and steady-state mRNA levels for elastin have fallen to low levels, the half-life of this mRNA has decreased to approximately 7 h. Decreased stability of elastin mRNA has also been reported to be important in developmental regulation of elastin synthesis in rat lung (6Swee M.H. Parks W.C. Pierce R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14899-14906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and alterations in elastin mRNA stability have been suggested in at least one form of cutis laxa, a connective tissue disease manifested by defective elastic fiber formation (7Zhang M.C. He L. Giro M. Yong S.L. Tiller G.E. Davidson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 981-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, protein binding to a sequence element in exon 30 of the coding region of elastin has been reported to be important for destabilization of elastin mRNA in adult rat lung fibroblasts, and it has been suggested that increased elastin production induced by treatment of cells with transforming growth factor β may be mediated through this mechanism (8Zhang M. Pierce R.A. Wachi H. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7314-7326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years the regulation of mRNA stability has emerged as an important mechanism for controlling gene expression. It is now clear that the stability of different mRNAs can vary greatly in eukaryotes, with half-lives ranging from a few minutes to days. The decay rates of many eukaryotic mRNAs have been shown to be regulated by a variety of developmental or environmental stimuli such as hypoxia (9Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), hormones (10Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokines (11Stoeckle M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Most of the mechanisms that control mRNA stability share common features, including specific interactions between trans-acting factors and cis-acting elements in the mRNA (12Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions serve to modulate the susceptibility of the mRNA to degradation. Such cis-acting elements might be actual ribonuclease target sites or sites that facilitate or hinder ribonuclease attack elsewhere in the mRNA. Although suchcis elements could be present anywhere in the mRNA, many of these sequences are situated in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR).1 In addition, two common structural elements, the 5′-cap structure and the 3′-poly(A) tail, also appear to have important roles in protecting the mRNA from degradation by ribonucleases. Although it is now clear that destabilization of mRNA plays a role in the down-regulation of aortic elastin synthesis during development and growth (5Johnson D.J. Robson P. Hew Y. Keeley F.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Zhang M. Pierce R.A. Wachi H. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7314-7326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the precise molecular mechanisms contributing to the control of elastin mRNA stability remain to be defined. Previous evidence from our laboratory indicated that cytosolic proteins binding to a large region of stable secondary structure in the 3′-UTR of elastin was associated with the stabilization/destabilization of elastin mRNA. Here, using deletion and competition analyses, we map this cis-acting sequence to an approximately 20-nucleotide (nt) purine-rich sequence within this region of secondary structure. This sequence is conserved in the 3′-UTRs of elastins of several species. Furthermore, trans-acting proteins binding to this sequence, apparently present in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, are enriched in tissues in which elastin is synthesized and are particularly abundant at developmental periods when elastin mRNA is stable. The cDNA containing the full-length 3′-UTR of elastin was produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) synthesis using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the 3′-UTR. The upper primer contained a 5′HindIII and the lower primer contained a 3′ XbaI site for subsequent cloning into a pGEM-4Z vector (Promega). PCR solutions included 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen), 5% Me2SO, 0.2 mm of each dNTPs, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm of both upper and lower primers, 1.25 units ofTaq polymerase (Qiagen), and either 0.5 μg of genomic DNA or 12.5 ng of pTE2, a cDNA containing the full-length 3′-UTR of chicken elastin mRNA (a gift from Dr. Shingo Tajima, National Defense Medical College, Japan), as template. Each PCR reaction was denatured for 4 min at 94 °C, followed by PCR amplification using a Robocycler 480 (Stratagene) (denaturation, 1 min at 95 °C; annealing, 1 min between 51 °C and 65 °C; extension, 1 min at 72 °C). The full-length elastin 3′-UTR insert was cloned into the pGEM-4Z vector and sequenced. Deletions of various domains in the elastin 3′-UTR were made using a PCR approach (13) with either chicken heart genomic DNA or pTE2 as the primary template. One PCR reaction used an upper primer containing a 5′HindIII site, as described above, and a lower primer corresponding to approximately 18 bases of sequence upstream of the deleted sequence together with approximately 18 bases downstream of the deleted sequence. A second PCR reaction used a lower primer containing a 3′ XbaI site as described above, and an upper primer corresponding to approximately 18 bases of sequence upstream of the deleted sequence together with approximately 18 bases downstream of the deleted sequence. The DNA fragments generated in this way were purified using a QiaEx II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and used as a template for primer extension and subsequent PCR amplification using the HindIII upper primer and theXbaI lower primer. This PCR step generated the full-length construct incorporating the desired deletion in the 3′-UTR of elastin, which was subsequently cloned into pGEM-4Z and sequenced. PCR conditions were as described above. All oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized at the Center for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Primer sequences used were as follows: Upper HindIII, CGGAAGCTTCCGCCCACCATCACCGAT; lower XbaI, GCCTCTAGACCATTAAAAACTTGTCCT; domain B deletion (5′-fragment, lower), GGGGTCCCTGCCGGGAGCTTGGTGGGGATTTACATT; domain B deletion (3′-fragment, upper), AATGTAAATCCCCACCAAGCTCCCGGCAGGGACCCC; domain D deletion (5′-fragment, lower), CACCGGGGACCCTTCTTTACCCCTGAGTGCCCCGCG; domain D deletion (3′-fragment, upper), CGCGGGGCACTCAGGGGTAAAGAAGGGTCCCCGGTG; domain E deletion (5′-fragment, lower), CAAAGTGAGTAACATGAACCCGGGGCCGGCAGTGTC; domain E deletion (3′-fragment, upper), GACACTGCCGGCCCCGGGTTCATGTTACTCACTTTG; region 3 deletion (5′-fragment, lower), TCCCCCGCCACCGGGACCCCCTCGTGCTCAGCCCGGC; region 3 deletion (3′-fragment, upper), GCCGGGCTGAGCACGAGGGGGTCCCGGTGGCGGGGGA; region 4 deletion (5′-fragment, lower), CAAAGTGAGTAACATGAAGTTCTTTCCTTCCCTGCGT; and region 4 deletion (3′-fragment, upper), ACGCAGGGAAGGAAAGAACTTCATGTTACTCACTTTG. A construct containing the elastin 3′-UTR, but lacking the sequence from domains B through E (ΔB–E), was prepared as described previously (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Constructs containing sequence from either region 4 or region 5 of the elastin 3′-UTR were prepared by cloning a double stranded oligodeoxynucleotide into the multiple cloning region of the pGEM-4Z vector. The sense strand sequence of the oligodeoxynucleotide used to synthesize the region 4 construct was GGGTCCCCGGTGGCGGGACACTGCGGGGACACTGCCGGCCCCGGGTCCCCCCGGCCCC, with additional 5′ EcoRI and 3′ HindIII sites. The sense strand sequence of the oligodeoxynucleotide used to synthesize the region 5 construct was TGGGGGGAGGGAGGGAGGGACGGAGGGAAGGAAAGAAGGGGT, with additional 5′ XbaI and 3′ HindIII sites. To prepare double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, the sense and antisense strands were heated to 100 min for 5–10 min and then cooled rapidly on ice. An in vitrotranscription system (Promega) was used to produce RNA transcripts (riboprobes) from 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA. Plasmids containing full-length elastin 3′-UTR cDNA and its deletion constructs were linearized using XbaI, with the exception of the ΔB–E construct, which was linearized using EcoRI. RNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. Plasmids containing either region 4 or region 5 of the elastin 3′-UTR were linearized withHindIII, and RNA was transcribed using Sp6 RNA polymerase. For the synthesis of radioactively labeled probes, the reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of [α-32P]CTP or -GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), nucleotides, RNase inhibitor, and buffer mixture as recommended by the manufacturer. 1 unit of RNase-free DNase was added to the reaction mixture for 15 min at 37 °C to remove template DNA. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the transcripts were precipitated using 2.4 m ammonium acetate and ice-cold 100% ethanol for 1.5 h at −70 °C. The RNA pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of RNase-free 10mm Tris-Hcl, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and purified on an RNase-free G-25 RNA purification column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Determination of percentage incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into transcripts was done by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unlabeled RNA transcripts were generated in a similar manner, except that the [α-32P]CTP or -GTP was replaced with 0.5 mmCTP or GTP. Crude tissue extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenization of tissues (20–30 strokes) in 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were removed and quickly frozen at −70 °C. A standard protocol was used for preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (14). Briefly, aortic tissues were homogenized in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). After centrifugation of the homogenate for 15 min at 4 °C at 3300 × g, the nuclei-containing pellet was separated from the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction and resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Gentle addition of a high salt buffer (same components as the low salt buffer except the replacement of 0.02 m KCl with 1.2 m KCl) released soluble proteins from the nuclei. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant containing soluble nuclear proteins was dialyzed into a moderate salt solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). For the preparation of cytoplasmic fractions, the supernatant obtained after the initial centrifugation of the tissue homogenate was mixed with 0.11 volume of 10× cytoplasmic buffer (0.3 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.4 m KCl, and 0.03 mMgCl2) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was dialyzed against the moderate salt solution described above. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations for all extracts were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For cross-species analyses, tissues used for crude protein extracts were either freshly isolated or previously frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aortic tissue from 2-day-old chickens was dissected and incubated in organ culture for 16 h. Conditions of organ culture have been described previously (15Johnson D.J. Keeley F.W. Connect Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After incubation, the aortic tissues were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and protein extracts were prepared as described above. Protein extracts were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with 2–4 × 104 cpm of32P-labeled transcripts in 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5–1 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.12 mm EDTA, and 200 ng/μl yeast tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 20 μl. The binding reaction mixture was then incubated with a 1:150 to 1:200 dilution of RNase Plus (0.83–1.25 units/ml RNase T1, 0.005–0.007 units/ml RNase A, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) for a further 10–15 min at 37 °C. Electrophoresis of RNA-protein complexes was carried out on 6% or 7% native polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio = 30/1) with 0.3× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) running buffer, pH 8.4. The gels were subsequently dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C or to the PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). All oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Center for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. For competition experiments with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, radiolabeled riboprobe was mixed with the indicated amounts of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and left to cool to room temperature for at least 15 min before the addition of protein extracts. For competition experiments with unlabeled sense riboprobes containing either region 4 (RP4) or region 5 (RP5) of the elastin 3′-UTR, protein extracts were first incubated with the indicated amounts of unlabeled competitors for 15 min at room temperature. Radiolabeled riboprobes were then added to the reaction mixtures for another 15 min of incubation at room temperature. All binding reaction mixtures were then subjected to RNase digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Sequences of competitive antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (asODNs) used were as follows: asODN3a (17 nt), CCCCTGAGTGCCCCTCG; asODN3b (18 nt), CCTCCCTCCCTCCCCCCA; asODN3c (19 nt), TTCTTTCCTTCCCTGCGTC. RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described above for mobility shift assays. After ribonuclease digestion, the protein-RNA complexes were put on ice and UV-irradiated for 10 min in a UV-Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene). Samples were then boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to the PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). RNA gel shift analyses were performed as described above but in the presence of 50–100 ng of non-radiolabeled riboprobes and 8–10 μg of protein extracts. After RNase digestion and subsequent electrophoresis on 7% native polyacrylamide gels, the RNA-protein complexes on the gel were transferred to a HyBond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting (10 V for the first hour, 25 V for the following 2 h in 0.3× TBE transfer buffer). RNA was cross-linked to the membranes using a UV-Stratalinker (Stratagene). The blot was prehybridized for at least 1 h at 42 °C with 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (SSPE), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, then hybridized for 16–18 h at 42 °C using oligodeoxynucleotide probes radiolabeled with [32P]dATP by end labeling. Blots were washed with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30–45 min at 55 °C, followed by 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15–20 min at 55 °C and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) at −70 °C or to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Sequences of asODN3a, asODN3b, and asODN3c are given above. The sequences of asODN2 and asODN3 were: asODN2, CCCCGCAAGGAGCGATCAGACCAAGGGGGACGGCTGCTCCCCGCAGTTTATTCCGCGC; asODN3, TTCTTTCCTTCCCTCCGTCCCTCCCTCCCTCCCCCCACCCCTGAGTGCCCCGCG. Sequence comparisons of the 3′-UTRs of chicken, rat, human, and bovine elastins are shown in Fig.1 A. Chicken elastin has the shortest of these UTRs, with a total of 491 nucleotides from the first nucleotide beyond the stop codon to the polyadenylation signal (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), compared with the longer bovine (965 nt) (16Raju K. Anwar R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5755-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human (1181 nt) (17Indik Z. Yeh H. Ornstein-Goldstein N. Sheppard P. Anderson N. Rosenbloom J.C. Peltonen L. Rosenbloom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5680-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and rat (1168 nt) (18Pierce R.A. Alatawi A. Deak S.B. Boyd C.D. Genomics. 1992; 12: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) untranslated sequences. The chicken elastin 3′-UTR contains two polyadenylation signals, although the first of these does not appear to be used. All of these 3′-UTRs are notably GC-rich, with the chicken elastin sequence containing ∼70% GC nucleotides. The region of stable secondary structure in the chicken 3′-UTR reported previously by us to be required for cytosolic protein binding (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is indicated in Fig. 1 A. Cross-species examination of elastin 3′-UTR sequences revealed several regions of sequence similarity, which have been designateddomains A through E in Fig. 1 A. Making the assumption that 3′-UTR protein-binding sequences important for mRNA stability might be conserved across species, the effect of deletion of these domains on the ability of riboprobes (Fig.1 B) to bind to cytosolic proteins extracted from 2-day-old chicken aorta was investigated, concentrating particularly on domains B, D, and E, because these were contained within the region of secondary structure, which we had previously shown to be required for cytosolic protein binding (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Gel migration shift assays using riboprobes made from these deletion constructs are shown in Fig.2 A. Deletions of domains B and E had no effect on protein binding. In contrast, deletion of domain D consistently decreased cytosolic protein binding. Deletion of domain A also had no effect on the formation of RNA-protein complexes in these assays (data not shown). The importance of domain D for protein binding was supported by the fact that deletion of a larger region of the 3′-UTR, which included domain D, designated region 3 in Fig.1 B, also strongly diminished protein binding (Fig.2 B). In contrast, deletion of a region of the 3′-UTR not containing domain D, designated region 4 in Fig.1 B, had no effect on protein binding (Fig.2 B). Identification of domain D as the site of protein binding was further confirmed by gel migration shift assays using a 42-nucleotide riboprobe corresponding to region 5 in Fig. 1 B. This riboprobe included the entire domain D as well as 12 additional nucleotides on the 3′-side of domain D. Protein binding to this riboprobe was strong with cytosolic extracts from aortic tissues of 2-day-old chickens but significantly diminished with extracts from 15-week-old chicken aorta (Fig. 3 A, left panel). This was consistent with data published previously from our laboratory using full-length 3′-UTR riboprobes (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unlabeled RP5 effectively competed for this labeled riboprobe (RP5, Fig.3 A, right panel), but protein binding was not diminished by competition with another riboprobe (RP4) corresponding to a region of 3′-UTR not containing domain D. Differences in position of the labeled band and the presence of double bands in some lanes are related to the amounts of cytosolic protein used in the gel shift assays, with the upper band predominating when increased amounts of protein are used. Mapping of sequences important for protein binding also utilized competition experiments in which antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed to the radiolabeled riboprobe before the addition of protein extracts (19Fraboulet S. Boudouresque F. Delfino C. Ouafik L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For these experiments, three antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were made, spanning regions 3a, 3b, and 3c in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1 B). These were designated asODN3a, asODN3b, and asODN3c. Using a 1000-fold molar excess of these antisense oligonucleotides, effective inhibition of RNA-protein complex formation was seen only with asODN3b (Fig. 3 B). These data indicated that the major protein-binding site mapped to an approximately 20-nt purine-rich sequence (UGGGGGGAGGGAGGGAGGGA) corresponding to region 3b (Fig. 3 C), and containing at least a 4-fold repeat of a GGGA motif. This region was therefore designated as the G3A site. Consistent with the GA-rich nature of the identified binding site, unlabeled poly(G) and poly(GA) RNA polymers could compete with the radioactively labeled elastin riboprobe for cytosolic protein binding in gel shift experiments, but neither poly(A) nor poly(C) RNA polymers were effective competitors (data not shown). To characterize proteins binding to the G3A site, radioactively labeled riboprobes were incubated with cytosolic extracts followed by UV cross-linking. After RNase digestion, the resulting RNA-protein complex was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.4). Using the 3′-UTR as a riboprobe, major protein bands corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 36 and 62 kDa could be detected. No protein bands were seen when cytosolic extracts were incubated with a riboprobe (ΔB–E) lacking the region of secondary structure in the 3′-UTR of elastin. This was consistent with earlier results showing that protein binding required the presence of this region of stable secondary structure (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, consistent with earlier gel migration shift data both shown here (Fig. 3) and published previously (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), protein binding was significantly stronger in cytosolic extracts from aortic tissue of 2-day-old chickens as compared with similar extracts from 15-week-old animals. Furthermore, protein binding activity was stronger in nuclear extracts as compared with cytosolic extracts (Fig. 4 B), although the patterns of protein bands in nuclear and cytosolic extracts were essentially identical. Age differences in protein binding activity similar to those seen in cytosolic extracts were also observed for nuclear extracts (data not shown). A novel Northern blotting strategy involving probing of the RNA-protein complex with radiolabeled antisense ODNs was also used to confirm the G3A sequence as the binding site. Conventional RNA gel shift assays were carried out using non-radiolabeled riboprobes and cytosolic extracts from 2-day-old and 15-week-old chicken aortas. After RNase digestion and electrophoresis on native gels, the RNA-protein complexes were transferred to nylon membranes and subsequently probed with radioactively labeled antisense ODNs. Results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5 A. A single band was detected using either asODN3 or asODN3b as radiolabeled probes to hybridize to the protein-protected, RNase-resistant region. No signal was detected when asODN2, asODN3a, or asODN4 (data not shown) were used as radiolabeled probes for Northern blotting. A faint band corresponding to the RNA-protein complex was detected using asODN3c after longer exposure time. Gel migration shift data (Fig. 3), UV cross-linking data (Fig. 4), and previous reports from our laboratory (4Hew Y. Grzelczak Z. Lau C. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14415-14421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) had shown that the RNA-protein complex detected in gel shift assays was more prominent in cytosolic extracts from aortic tissue of 2-day-old chicken, when elastin mRNA is stable, as compared with similar extracts from 15-week-old chicken in which elastin mRNA is relatively unstable. Consistent with these results, the RNA-protein complex detected using a radiolabeled asODN3b probe was also more prominent in aortic extracts from 2-day-old as compared with 15-week-old chickens (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, the RNA-protein complex detected with asODN3b was also more prominent in extracts of fresh aortic tissue from 2-day-old chickens as compared with similar tissue, which had been subjected to organ culture for 16 h (Fig. 5 B). This result was consistent with earlier evidence from our laboratory for destabilization of elastin mRNA during organ culture (5Johnson D.J. Robson P. Hew Y. Keeley F.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the absence of unlabeled riboprobe, no band could be detected with radiolabeled asODN3b, indicating that this labeled"

Here, we have sought to determine whether constitutively active receptor can be created in the absence of the extracellular domain by substituting it with high affinity leucine zippers to create dimers of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) signaling domain. The entire extracellular domain of the GHR was replaced by the hemagglutinin-tagged zipper sequence of either the c-Fos or c-Jun transcription factor (termed Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR, respectively). Transient transfection of Fos-GHR or Jun-GHR resulted in activation of the serine protease inhibitor 2.1 promoter in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells to a level equal to that achieved by fully activated wild type GHR. Furthermore, stable expression of Jun-GHR alone or Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR together in the interleukin 3-dependent BaF-B03 cell line resulted in cell proliferation after interleukin 3 withdrawal at a rate equal to maximally stimulated wild type GHR-expressing cells. Activation of STAT 5b was also observed in Fos-Jun-GHR-expressing cells at a level equal to that in chronically GH-treated GHR-expressing cells. Thus, forced dimerization of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the GHR in the absence of the extracellular domain can lead to the constitutive activation of known GH signaling end points, supporting the view that proximity of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) kinases is the essential element in signaling.

Its wide variety of effects on target cells are mediated by a single membrane-spanning receptor (GHR), which is expressed in over 40 different tissues (reviewed in Ref. 1.Waters M.J. Kostyo J. Handbook of Physiology. 5. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 397-444Google Scholar). The GHR is a class 1 homomeric cytokine receptor belonging to the same group as erythropoietin receptor, prolactin receptor, thrombopoietin receptor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), all of which homodimerize upon ligand binding to form a complex consisting of one ligand and two identical receptor subunits. This contrasts with other class 1 cytokine receptors, which undergo heterodimeric or multimeric associations in response to ligand binding (reviewed in Ref.2.Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies showed that GH binds via a high affinity interaction with one GH receptor, followed by a lower affinity interaction with the second identical GHR forming a GH(GHR)2 trimeric complex (3.Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Formation of this complex is the first step in signal transduction, which is presumed to bring together and activate two JAK2 molecules, each of which associates with a highly conserved membrane proximal proline rich region in the cytoplasmic domain referred to as box 1 (4.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Activation of JAK2 results in activation of signaling molecules, such as STATs, MAP kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3′-phosphate kinase, and protein kinase C, and elevates intracellular calcium, leading to the transcriptional regulation of many genes (4.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The biological role of GHR dimerization was first studied by Fuhet al. (5.Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) using a cell line that expressed a chimeric receptor consisting of the binding domain of GHR fused to the extracellular fibronectin and cytoplasmic domains of the G-CSFR. These workers showed that wild type GH could trigger proliferation in these cells, although a GH analogue with an unfavourable substitution in the low affinity site 2 domain was unable to cause proliferation, because it was unable to induce GHR dimerization. These workers also reported that monoclonal antibodies to the GHR were able to elicit a full proliferative response in these cells, presumably by dimerizing the chimeric receptor in a fashion analogous to GH. More recently, we have studied the importance of interreceptor interactions by creating mutations in the dimerization domain, the only contact domain between the two receptor sub-units (6.Chen C.M. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5133-5140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found that charge reversal mutagenesis severely reduced the ability of the receptor to signal, presumably by preventing trimeric complex formation. Thus, there is strong support for the essential role of dimerization in GHR signal transduction, with alignment of the two receptors being set by bonding interactions across the dimerization domain. Given this view, dimerization of receptor subunits by means of bivalent antibodies should result in signal generation. However, although monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor are able to generate full proliferative responses in FDCP-1 lines expressing a chimera of the GH receptor (extracellular) fused to the G-CSFR (4.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7.Rowlinson S.W. Behncken S.N. Rowland J.E. Clarkson R.W. Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Baumbach W. Waters M.J. J.

Behncken S.N. Rowland J.E. Clarkson R.W. Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Baumbach W. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5307-5314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, of 15 anti-GHR mAbs examined, none could induce proliferation in FDC-P1 cells expressing the full-length GHR, whereas 8 could induce proliferation in the FDC-P1 cells expressing the G-CSFR chimera used by Fuh et al. (5.Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Two mAbs could cause the more sensitive hGHR-BaF-B03 cells to proliferate, but they did so very weakly (maximum 23% of GH level). These results raise the possibility that dimerization of the GHR alone is not sufficient for its activation and raise questions about its mode of action, including the possible requirement for a specific hormone-induced conformational change for signaling (see discussion in Ref. 7.Rowlinson S.W. Behncken S.N. Rowland J.E. Clarkson R.W. Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Baumbach W. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5307-5314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a view supported by another recent study using monoclonal antibodies to the GH receptor (8.Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Kremer L. von Kobbe C. de Ana A.M. Merida I. Martinez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9189-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Very recently a crystallographic study of the closely homologous erythropoietin receptor has shown that it can exist as a preformed dimer by virtue of inter receptor interactions located in the same loops of the receptor that otherwise bind the hormone (9.Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Joliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this preformed dimer places the membrane entry points of the extracellular domain around 73 Å apart, whereas the hormone bound receptor dimer has entry points around 39 Å apart (9.Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Joliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Using an elegant fragment complementation assay, Remy et al. (10.Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) presented evidence that a conformational change results from hormone binding, which brings the membrane entry points close together, paralleling the subunit relationships seen with the crystal structures of the unbound and ligand occupied receptor dimers. This new paradigm for cytokine receptor signaling could explain the difficulty in obtaining agonist responses with monoclonal antibodies to the GH receptor, because only a small subset would be able to trigger the conformational changes necessary to bring the membrane proximal sequences into proximity. Indeed, a similar study performed with the EPO receptor found that only 4 of 96 monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain were able to activate the receptor (11.Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Yanagihara D. Chang D. Elliott G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24691-24697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether the original sequential dimerization model or the preformed dimer/conformational change model applies to the GH receptor, it should be possible to create constitutively active GH receptors if the receptor subunits are correctly aligned in appropriate proximity. This study seeks to establish whether constitutive activation can be achieved simply by dimerizing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains through the use of leucine zippers (22.Syed S.S. Reid S.W. Cuiwei L. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). A leucine zipper is an α-helix with leucine resides (generally five) presented at every seventh position along its length. In solution, two complimentary zippers will form high affinity dimers aided by strong hydrophobic forces from juxtaposed leucines. Leucine zippers are found as part of certain transcription factors, such as c-fos and c-jun that form the AP-1 transcription complex. Zippers from c-fos and c-jun can homo- or heterodimerize in solution, although thermodynamic analyses have shown thatfos-jun heterodimers are more stable than junhomodimers, which are considerably more stable than foshomodimers (T m of 71 °C for heterodimer peptide, 69 °C for Jun homodimer peptide, and 59 °C for Fos homodimer peptide (12.O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar)), as a result of electrostatic interactions between helices that involve residues adjacent to the leucines. Fusing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GHR to these zippers provides a means of achieving GH-independent dimerization. By expressing these chimeras in cell systems that are known to respond to GH, we have tested their signaling capabilities, to determine whether it is possible to create a constitutively active GH receptor. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the cDNA encoding the 27 amino acid signal peptide from porcine GHR (pGHR) such that the product included a 5′ HindIII restriction site and a 3′ BamHI restriction site (Fig. 1). This fragment was then cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYAS) (12.O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) were annealed and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1+ vector (contains the neomycin resistance gene) downstream of the pGHR signal peptide sequence at BamHI and EcoRI sites. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding either the mouse c-Fos leucine zipper (amino acids 162–200) or the mouse c-Jun leucine zipper (amino acids 277–315) that contained a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′NotI site were annealed and cloned into the vector downstream of the HA tag. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the GHR transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (amino acids 251–638) such that the product included a 5′ NotI and a 3′XbaI overhang that was then cloned downstream of the leucine zipper. The entire insert was sequenced and found to contain no errors. Eleven residues of receptor sequence were left at the membrane proximal end of the domain between the zipper sequence and the transmembrane sequence to allow a degree of flexibility similar to that of wild type GHR. The leader sequence was identical to that for full-length GHR, ensuring identical posttranslational trafficking and surface expression. These constructs are hereafter termed Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR, respectively. Finally, as a control for Fos/Jun mediated dimerization, a construct was created that lacked the zipper coding sequences, so that the first of the remaining 11 extracellular residues was linked directly to the HA tag coding sequence. This was undertaken by excising the zipper/pGHR (251–638) coding sequence with EcoRI/XbaI, and replacing it with the pGHR (251–638) coding sequence derived by polymerase chain reaction to contain an EcoRI site at the 5′end, so as to be compatible with the 3′EcoRI site of the HA tag coding sequence. Human kidney 293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells at 50% confluency in a 10-cm dish (1 day after passage) were transiently transfected by a calcium phosphate procedure: DNA-precipitate was made by mixing 500 μl of 0.25m CaCl2 with 20 μg of eukaryotic expression vector followed by dropwise addition to 500 μl of 2× HBS (50 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.96). The precipitate was left for 15 min and subsequently added dropwise to cells after removal of medium, followed by 15 ml of medium then incubation in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. The next day, the medium was changed, and cells were removed to a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide for a further 24 h. This was performed as described in Hansen et al.(13.Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12669-12673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene, 1.5 μg of Spi 2.1-CAT reporter construct, and varying amounts of chimeric receptor plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h, cells were lysed, and extracts were normalized for β-galactosidase activity before the CAT assay was performed. As a control, 1.5 μg of pGH receptor expression construct was transfected in place of the chimera constructs, and cells were stimulated with 20 nm hGH. BaF-B03 cells (gift from Dr Tom Gonda, Hanson Institute, Adelaide, Australia) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% serum supreme (a fetal bovine substitute supplied by BioWhittaker Corp.) and 40 ng/ml murine IL-3 (gift from Dr Andrew Hapel, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra, Australia). 5 × 106 mid-log phase cells were electroporated in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the presence of 20 μg of expression plasmid at 270 V, 960 μF in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). Cells were cultured for 2 days in the above mentioned media before being washed twice with PBS and placed in selection media. Cells transfected with chimeric plasmid were selected in 10% serum supreme alone, whereas those transfected with the pGHR plasmid were selected with 4.5 nm hGH. After several days, cells were plated at a limiting dilution, and single cells were isolated and maintained in their respective selection media. In the case of the Fos-GHR expression plasmid, cells were co-transfected with a geneticin resistance plasmid, followed by selection with 1.5 mg/ml G418 for at least 4 days. pGHR-expressing cells were characterized for receptor expression by125I-hGH binding assay and Scatchard analysis as described in Ref. 14.Rowlinson S.W.

This involved growing the cells in IL-3 (40 ng/ml) and 10% serum supreme, harvesting, and then incubating them overnight at 4 °C in isotonic glucose binding buffer with labeled hGH in the presence of increasing concentrations of hGH (14.Rowlinson S.W.

Cells were suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% serum supreme and plated in rows at a variety of cell densities in a 96 well plate. Quadruplicate wells containing pGHR-expressing clones were incubated with either 4.5 nm GH (maximal), 4.5 nm IL-3 (maximal), or no cytokine. Clones expressing the chimera were incubated as above except that no GH incubation was included. After 18–24 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified box with no plate lids, either 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) or [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added, and the incubation was continued for a further 3 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were completed as described in Ref. 14.Rowlinson S.W.

[3H]Thymidine assays were completed by harvesting cells onto glass fiber filters and counting in a 96-well plate scintillation counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). 1 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with PBS before storage at −70 °C. Lysis was performed on ice in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing “Complete” inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge for 10 min. To the supernatant from the chimera-expressing clones, 80 μg of a polyclonal antiserum raised against the cytoplasmic domain of the rabbit GH receptor (15.Lobie P.E. Wood T.E. Chen C.-M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31735-31746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added; the mixture was then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry (1:1 mixture; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a further 1 h incubation at 4 °C. In experiments comparing the levels of expression of wild type pGHR and Jun GHR clones (see Fig.6), 30 μg of a rabbit antiserum raised against a GST fusion of the rat GHR cytoplasmic domain was used for immunoprecipitation of both. However, for most studies on pGHR-expressing clones, 10 μg of mAb 263 (directed to the extracellular domain of GHR, from Agen Biomedicals, Acacia Ridge, Australia) was added, and cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm, and then protein A/G-Sepharose was added as described above. These beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of 3× concentrated Laemelli sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and boiled for 4 min before centrifugation again at 5000 rpm and loading of the supernatant. Samples were electrophoresed under standard SDS-PAGE running conditions on 7.5 or 9% acrylamide gels (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (208094) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose using a semi-dry electroblotter using prestained markers to judge transfer efficiency (Kalaidescope, Bio-Rad) and blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk. Blots containing the chimeric protein were probed with a mAb raised against the HA tag (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and detected with an anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots containing pGHR and Jun GHR (in which levels of expression were compared) were probed with the anti-rabbit GHR cytoplasmic domain antibody mentioned above at 10 μg/ml and detected with an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All blots were visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and various exposures taken on x-ray film, which in some cases were subjected to densitometry on a Bio-Rad GS-700 densitometer. The procedure for immunoblotting was essentially the same as for BaF-B03 cells except that 2% Nonidet P-40 was used instead of Triton X-100 and the lysis buffer contained 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 10 μg/ml leupeptin instead of complete inhibitor. Also, the anti-rat GHR cytoplasmic domain antiserum (see above) was incubated overnight in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. Finally, the anti-HA antibody used for probing was clone 12CA5, not 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1 × 106 cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and placed on ice to prevent receptor internalization. Wild type GHR-expressing cells were either sorted directly or subject to down-regulation by treating the cells with 4.5 nm GH for 16 h prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For wild type GHR-expressing cells, mAb 263 was added to a final concentration of 17 μg/ml in a volume of 500 μl and left on ice for 1 h. For chimera-expressing cells, anti-HA mAb (clone 12CA5) was added to a final concentration of 4 or 17 μg/ml. After two washes with cold PBS, a secondary anti-mouse Fc portion antibody with a fluorescein isothiocyanate label was added to a concentration of 30 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed twice and then sorted on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). 1 × 107 BaF-B03 cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% serum supreme, and then incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described in Ref.17.Clarkson R.W.E. Chen C.M. Harrison S. Wells C. Muscat G.E.O. Waters M.J. Mol. Endo. 1995; 9: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, except for pGHR-expressing cells, which were treated with 4.5 nm hGH for 20 min or 16 h prior to harvesting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described in Ref.7.Rowlinson S.W. Behncken S.N. Rowland J.E. Clarkson R.W. Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Baumbach W. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5307-5314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar except that aprotinin, leupeptin, and Pefabloc were replaced with Complete inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the oligonucleotide probe contained the consensus binding site for STAT 5 (AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2565). Supershift experiments were performed by adding 1 μg of either STAT 5a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1081) or STAT 5b antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-835) to the reaction after the addition of probe and incubating the mixture for 1 h on ice. Two chimeric cDNA molecules were made such that when co-expressed, two identical cytoplasmic domains of the GHR are brought into close proximity (see Fig. 1). Each chimera contains the leucine zipper sequence from either c-Fos or c-Jun in place of almost the entire porcine GHR extracellular domain sequence as well as the HA tag at the amino terminus of the mature protein. A control construct lacking the zipper sequence was also made. To test the ability of Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR to dimerize, HEK 293 cells (known for high level expression) were transiently transfected with each expression construct and the chimeric protein was analyzed by Western blot. Fig.2 shows that both Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR can homodimerize and that this dimer is stable enough to withstand denaturing conditions in the presence of reductant. As an initial test for activity of the chimeras, the constructs were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells along with a reporter construct consisting of the Spi 2.1 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene (13.Hansen L.H.

Fig. 3 shows that increasing amounts of transfected chimeric plasmids, together or separately, result in increasing levels of reporter gene activity, to a point that is equivalent to the maximum amount achieved by full-length GHR triggered with GH (20 nm hGH). It should be noted that the Fos-GHR chimera was just as capable of activating the reporter gene as the Jun-GHR chimera, indicating that productive Fos-GHR homodimers are forming (see below). Specificity in signaling is apparent, because no signaling was seen by the chimera when all of its cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, which accords with the requirement for STAT 5 docking through its SH2 domain for activation (4.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13.Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol.

In order to demonstrate the functional role of the Fos/Jun zippers, a construct without the zipper coding sequence, but otherwise identical, was included in the analysis. This construct was able to produce some constitutive activation of the Spi 2.1 promoter, although equivalent activation to that produced by Fos or Jun-GHR required around 75-fold higher concentration of this expression construct (Fig.3). The IL-3-dependent pro B cell line BaF-B03 has been previously shown to respond to very low levels of GH when stably transfected with human and rabbit GHR (7.Rowlinson S.W. Behncken S.N. Rowland J.E.

The sensitivity of BaF-B03 cells to GH makes them an ideal system to test the signaling ability of the Fos-GHR and Jun-GHR chimeras in a physiologically relevant way. Transfection of full-length porcine GHR and selection with GH yielded colonies that were cloned by limiting dilution and characterized. A clone (named pGHR-BaF) was chosen that expressed 3457 ± 646 surface receptors per cell with an affinity of 3.6 ± 0.3 × 109m−1, as determined in serum starved cells (14.Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When BaF-B03 cells were transfected with Jun-GHR plasmid alone or co-transfected with Fos-GHR plasmid, cytokine-independent cell proliferation was observed, and these cells were cloned by limiting dilution (named Jun-BaF and Fos/Jun-BaF, respectively). However, despite several attempts, no colonies were evident in populations transfected with Fos-GHR alone. Transfection efficacy was confirmed in these populations by performing a parallel selection with G418 that yielded numerous colonies with IL-3 support. Immunoprecipitation and blotting demonstrated correct expression of the chimeric and full-length receptors (Fig.4). In the case of Fos-GHR, G418-resistant populations we"

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. To gain insight into molecular mechanisms by which ROS influence the pathogenesis of these diseases, I have studied the effect of H2O2, a ROS, on eIF4E phosphorylation. H2O2 induced eIF4E phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in growth-arrested smooth muscle cells (SMC). H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation occurred on serine residues. PD098059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibited ERK activities but had no significant effect on eIF4E phosphorylation induced by H2O2. Similarly, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, although inhibiting H2O2-induced p38 MAPK activity, had no effect on H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation. Calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, also had no effect on H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation. In contrast, trifluoperazine, an antagonist of calcium/calmodulin kinases, completely blocked H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation. In addition, intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ chelators significantly inhibited H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation. Despite its ability to induce eIF4E phosphorylation, H2O2had no significant effect on protein levels and new protein synthesis as compared with control. In contrast, it induced the expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and HSP70 in a time-dependent manner in SMC. Together, these results suggest that H2O2, a ROS and a cellular oxidant, induces eIF4E phosphorylation in a manner that is dependent on Ca2+and Ca2+/calmodulin kinases and independent of ERKs, p38 MAPK, and protein kinase C. These results also suggest that enhanced eIF4E phosphorylation by H2O2 appears to be an important event in SMC in response to oxidant stress and that eIF4E phosphorylation may be associated with the translation of a small subset of mRNAs such as c-fos, c-jun, and HSP70 gene mRNAs, whose products may have a critical role in cell survival.

The important step in this process is the binding of mRNA to ribosomes, which is facilitated by an initiation complex, eIF4F (22.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 23.Huang J. Schneider R.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24.Morley S.J.

Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). eIF4F consists of three polypeptides: eIF4E, the cap-binding protein; eIF4A, an RNA helicase; and eIF4G, a bridging protein for eIF4E and eIF4A (26.Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Via its subunit eIF4E, eIF4F binds to mRNA by interacting with the cap structure present in the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs (22.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 25.Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). eIF4F in combination with another initiation factor, eIF4B, is thought to unwind mRNA secondary structure, thereby rendering it capable of binding to ribosomes (22.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Because eIF4E is crucial for mRNA binding to ribosomes, a rate-limiting step in polypeptide synthesis, eIF4E is considered to be a regulator of protein synthesis (22.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 25.Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 27.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Indeed, a large body of data supports this notion. Overexpression of eIF4E causes malignant transformation in NIH 3T3 cells (28.Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) and aberrant growth in HeLa cells (29.DeBenedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Expression of antisense eIF4E inhibits protein synthesis and reverses the transformation induced by Ras (30.Rinker-Schaeffer C.W.

Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eIF4E is a phosphoprotein that is present in small amounts compared with other initiation factors, a characteristic feature of acute regulation by agonists (32.Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hiremath L.S. Webb N.R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, eIF4E activity is regulated by its binding proteins, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (34.Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N.

These proteins negatively modulate eIF4E activity. Analogous to retinoblastoma protein, 4E-BP1/2 with underphosphorylation binds with eIF4E and prevents the phosphorylation of eIF4E by agonists. Conversely, upon phosphorylation these proteins dissociate from eIF4E and facilitate the phosphorylation and activation of eIF4E by agonists (35.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 36.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N.

Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings clearly support the concept that translation plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth (27.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

To elucidate the role of oxidants in proliferative diseases, I have studied the effect of H2O2 on the phosphorylation state of eIF4E. I found that 1) H2O2 induces the phosphorylation of eIF4E in a dose- and time-dependent manner in growth-arrested SMC; 2) induced eIF4E phosphorylation by H2O2 is Ca2+- and Ca2+/CaM kinase-dependent and ERK-, p38 MAPK-, and protein kinase C-independent; and 3) although H2O2 had no significant effect on global protein synthesis, a correlation was found between enhanced eIF4E phosphorylation and translation of a small subset of mRNAs such as c-fos, c-jun, and HSP70 mRNAs in H2O2-treated SMC. Hydrogen peroxide, β-glycerophosphate, myelin basic protein, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium deoxycholate, sodium fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate were obtained from Sigma. Anti-ERK1 (SC-93), anti-ERK2 (SC-154), anti-c-Fos (SC-052), and anti-p38 MAPK (SC-728 and SC-535) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and anti-HSP70 (SC-24) mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibodies (PC 06) were obtained from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). PD098059 and GST·ATF-2 fusion protein were procured from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was bought from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 8000 Ci/mmol), [14C]leucine (specific activity, 315 mCi/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity, 8500 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. SMC were isolated from the thoracic aortae of 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion as described previously (13.Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. SMC were plated onto 60-mm dishes (cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes for phosphoamino acid analysis) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. At 70–80% confluence, cells were growth-arrested by incubating for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% calf serum. Growth-arrested SMC were labeled with 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h and treated with and without various concentrations of H2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C. In the case of time course experiments, labeled SMC were treated with and without 200 μm H2O2 for the indicated times at 37 °C. After treatments, medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EGTA, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were collected onto 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were incubated with 5 μl of eIF4E polyclonal antibodies for 2 h on ice with gentle rocking (41.Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W.E. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42.Rao G.N. Griendling K.K. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7180-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forty microliters of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and washed five times with cold lysis buffer and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were heated in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen for 1 day at −80 °C. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed according to the method of Hildebrandt and Fried (43.Hildebrandt E. Fried V.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, eIF4E was transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting in 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol for 4 h at 100 mA and autoradiographed. The region of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane corresponding to the eIF4E band was excised and exposed to vapors of 5.7 m HCl at 110 °C for 4 h in a Reactivial (Pierce). Following acid hydrolysis, one drop of methanol was placed on the membrane patches, and amino acids and peptide fragments were extracted with 1 ml of H2O. A mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (100 nmol each) was added to the aqueous extract before freeze drying over NaOH. Samples were dissolved in 20 μl of H2O and spotted on a 20 × 20-cm thin layer cellulose plate (J. T. Baker Inc.). The phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis in 7.8% acetic acid, 2.2% formic acid (pH 1.9) at 500 V for 4 h. Authentic phosphoamino acids were identified by ninhydrin reaction, and the TLC plate was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen for 5–7 days at −80 °C. ERK activity was measured using an in-gel kinase assay as described previously (44.Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (150 μg) from control and each treatment were incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibodies for 2 h with gentle rocking on ice. Forty microliters of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h on ice. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel that was copolymerized with 300 μg/ml myelin basic protein. The gel was washed twice for 30 min with 150 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% isopropyl alcohol and twice for 30 min with 150 ml of 50 mmTris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A). After incubation for 1 h in 150 ml of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride in Buffer A at room temperature, the gel was washed repeatedly in Buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The kinase reaction was performed by incubating the gel in 30 ml of 40 mm Hepes buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was washed several times with 200 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate until the counts/min were at background levels; then the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. p38 MAPK activity was measured using an immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (44.Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (500 μg) from control and each treatment were incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-p38 MAPK antibodies for 2 h with gentle rocking on ice. Forty microliters of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h on ice. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). The beads were suspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 2 μg of GST·ATF-2 fusion protein, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 5 min. The mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gels. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. Growth-arrested SMC were treated with and without H2O2 (200 μm) or AII (100 nm) for the indicated times. Cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]leucine for the last 2 h of each treatment period. After labeling, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were precipitated with cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min. The mixture was passed through a glass fiber filter (GF/F, Whatman). The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. The filter was dried and placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the scintillant fluid, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Tracor Analytic Delta 300). To determine cellular [14C]leucine specific activity, growth-arrested SMC were treated with and without H2O2 (200 μm) or AII (100 nm) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [14C]leucine for 12 h. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse cells. After standing on ice for 60 min, the mixture was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was extracted five times with ethyl ether to remove the trichloroacetic acid. The residue was dissolved in 50 μl of water, spotted onto a 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer plate, and resolved by one-dimensional chromatography using n-butyl alcohol:acetic acid:water (13:3:5) as a solvent system (45.Giguere G. Auray-Blais C. Draper P. Lemieux B. Clin. Biochem. 1980; 13: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Amino acids were identified by spraying the TLC plate with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone. The spot on the TLC plate corresponding to leucine was scraped and extracted with ethanol containing 0.3% ninhydrin for 30 min. The optical density reading of the extract was measured in a spectrocolorimeter at 540 nm, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter as described above. A standard graph generated using cold leucine was used as a reference for quantitation of the cellular leucine levels. To determine the phosphorylation state of eIF4E in response to oxidant stress, growth-arrested and [32P]orthophosphate-labeled SMC were treated with and without various concentrations of H2O2 for 30 min, and eIF4E phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitation using its specific antibodies followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (41.Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W.E. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42.Rao G.N. Griendling K.K. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7180-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 induced eIF4E phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with a near maximum effect of a 4.5-fold increase at 200 μm (Fig.1, upper panel). Although H2O2 at 400 μm was found to be more effective in the stimulation of eIF4E phosphorylation (5.3-fold), I chose 200 μm in the subsequent experiments because H2O2 at this concentration is not toxic to SMC (13.Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether H2O2-induced eIF4E phosphorylation is a time-dependent phenomenon, growth-arrested and [32P]orthophosphate-labeled SMC were treated with and without 200 μmH2O2 for various times, and eIF4E phosphorylation was measured. H2O2 induced eIF4E phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner as well (Fig. 1, middle panel). After 15 and 30 min of H2O2 (200 μm) treatment, eIF4E phosphorylation was increased 1.8- and 3.7-fold, respectively, as compared with control. The increases in eIF4E phosphorylation by H2O2 were sustained for at least 2 h although at a level (2-fold) that is lower than at 30 min of treatment. AII (100 nm), which was used as a positive control, induced eIF4E phosphorylation 4-fold by 15 min as compared with control, and this result is consistent with our previous observations (42.Rao G.N. Griendling K.K. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7180-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To find out whether the observed increases in eIF4E phosphorylation by H2O2 were due to corresponding increases in eIF4E levels, equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were analyzed by Western blotting for eIF4E levels using its specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panel), no significant changes were observed in eIF4E levels between control and H2O2 or AII treatments. In response to growth factors and phorbol esters, eIF4E was phosphorylated on serine residues (41.Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W.E. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig.2, serine is the only amino acid residue phosphorylated in eIF4E by H2O2. Consistent with our previous results, AII caused phosphorylation of eIF4E on serine residues (42.Rao G.N.

The recent demonstration of cases of PML in association with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection prompted us to examine whether the HTLV-I-encoded regulatory protein Tax activates JCV transcription. By employing a dual luciferase assay, we initially found that the expression of Tax activated the transcriptional potential of both early and late promoters of JCV in human neuronal but not in non-neuronal cells. We subsequently analyzed the mechanism of Tax-induced activation of the JCV promoter in neuronal cells with the following results: 1) the JCV promoter that lacks the NF-κB-binding motif could not be activated by Tax; 2) the overexpression of IκBα abolished Tax-induced transcriptional activation of the JCV promoter; 3) a Tax mutant (M22) lacking the potential for activation via the NF-κB pathway did not activate the JCV promoter. Furthermore, Tax enhances the gene expression of JCV T antigen and VP1. We examined mechanisms of the cell-specific activation of the JCV promoter by Tax. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the presence of Tax-bound protein(s) that were specifically present in non-neuronal cells. This study is the first demonstration of the activation of JCV promoter by HTLV-I Tax in an NF-κB-dependent manner.

Major E.O. Intervirology. 1997; 40: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). JCV belongs to the polyomaviridae of double-stranded DNA viruses that also include simian virus 40 (SV40) and BK virus. Although the complete genome of JCV shares extensive homology with SV40 and BK virus, the nucleotide sequences of the transcriptional regulatory region of JCV are quite different. In addition, the JCV promoter sequence can be classified into two types, non-virulent type (archetype) and pathogenic type (PML type). The regulatory region of JCV isolated from PML brain (PML type JCV) is generally composed of 98-base pair (bp) tandem repeats including TATA sequences, whereas archetype JCV that is excreted in the urine in asymptomatic individuals has only one copy of the 98-bp sequence flanked with additional 23- and 66-bp residues. Therefore, it has been postulated that the rearrangement of the regulatory region of JCV from archetypal sequence to that of 98-bp tandem repeats permits cytolytic proliferation of JCV in glial cells that results in PML (2.White III, F.A. Ishaq M. Stoner G.L. Frisque R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of transcriptional factors, such as NF-1, NF-κB, YB-1, Purα, Tst-1, GF-1, and T antigen have been shown to bind JCV regulatory regions in in vitro analysis (3.Raj G.V. Khalili K. Virology. 1995; 213: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and are thought to be involved in the species and tissue specificity of JCV propagation. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-encoded Tat protein has also been reported to transactivate the JCV promoter (4.Krachmarov C.P. Chepenik L.G. Barr-Vagell S. Khalili K. Johnson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive efforts to clarify the transcriptional factors involved in the JCV activation, the precise mechanisms of its regulation in central nervous tissue and of pathogenesis of PML are still under the investigation.

These have raised the question of whether HTLV-I proteins could have been involved in the transcriptional activation of the JCV promoter. HTLV-I regulatory protein Tax is a 40-kDa protein that is known to activate several cellular and viral genes including HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and SV40. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of Tax activates the transcriptional potential of JCV promoter in human neuronal/glial cells, whereas transactivation of the virus promoter by Tax was not detected in non-neuronal cells. We could also demonstrate the following: 1) JCV that lacks NF-κB motif in its regulatory region cannot be activated even in the presence of Tax; 2) overexpression of the inhibitory protein, IκBα, abolishes Tax-induced transcriptional activation of JCV promoter; 3) a Tax mutant (M22) lacking the potential for NF-κB activation fails to transactivate the JCV promoter. Thus three independent experimental approaches demonstrate that Tax transactivation of the virus promoter occurs via the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, the detection of a protein complex bound by JCV NF-κB oligonucleotides using EMSA has suggested there is an inhibitory protein function in non-neuronal cells that suppresses JCV promoter activity. These results provide new insights into the understanding of the activation of JCV and a possible role for HTLV-I infection in the pathogenesis of certain cases of PML. Human neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 (JCRB 9050), human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (JCRB 9068), human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (JCRB 9004), human malignant melanoma cell line MeWo (JCRB 0066), and human mixed glioma cell line KG-1-C (JCRB 0236) were provided from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Japan). Human glioblastoma cell lines U-373 MG (ATCC HTB 17), U-87 MG (ATCC HTB14), and U-138 MG (ATCC HTB16) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) from Sigma. None of the cell lines used these experiments expressed T antigen which is known to activate JCV promoter (data not shown). Tst-1/Oct6 cDNA was kindly provided from Dr. Wegner (7.He X. Gerrero R.

The pJC1–4->pJCV plasmid (HSRRB VG015), the source for the PML type JCV regulatory region was provided from Health Science Research Resources Bank. The luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic, and internal control vector, pRL-TK, were purchased from Promega. The IκBα expression vector (pIκBα) was kindly provided from Dr. Peyron through Dr. Ouchi (8.Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B.

As the JCV regulatory regions are known to be quite polymorphic, we chose the regulatory regions of both CY (9.Yogo Y. Kitamura T. Sugimoto C. Ueki T. Aso Y. Hara K. Taguchi F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3139-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Mad1 (10.Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Cannella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as archetype and PML types, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pJC1–4->pJCV plasmid revealed a 4-bp insertion between the 98-bp repeat sequence in the regulatory region compared with that of Mad1. The sequence flanking the inserted region is as follows:325CAAGG-ggtc-330CTGTA (the lowercase letters represent inserted nucleotides and the uppercase letters represent original Mad1 sequences, with numbers corresponding positions on the viral genome (10.Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Cannella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). To eliminate the insertion, two DNA segments flanking the insertion were separately amplified by PCR, subcloned into a cloning vector to ligate each other, and named pBRMad1. The fragment containing the complete regulatory region of Mad1 was used for generating both the wild-type and the NF-κB and NF-1 motif deletion mutants. The CY regulatory region from pJC-CY (11.Takahashi H. Yogo Y. Furuta Y. Takada A. Irie T. Kasai M. Sano K. Fujioka Y. Nagashima K. Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 83: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was also used to create the wild-type, the NF-κB, and NF-1 motif deletion mutants. A schematic illustration of JCV regulatory regions containing the NF-κB and NF-1 motifs and TATA sequences is shown in Fig.1. The JCV is bidirectionally transcribed from the regulatory region and both regulatory regions in the anti-clockwise direction for early transcripts and clockwise direction for late transcripts, respectively. These NF-κB-binding sites indicated as (Fig. 1, solid boxes) -AAG GGA ATT TCC CTG G- (16 nucleotides) and the NF-1-binding sites (Fig. 1, shaded boxes) -TGG CTG CCA GCC AA- (14 nucleotides) were separately deleted from both Mad1 and CY regulatory regions by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis using the Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, the regulatory regions of wild type and NF-κB-deleted were separately subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the reporter vector pGL3-Basic in both directions, and NF-1-deleted regulatory regions of Mad1 and CY were subcloned in the late direction. Finally, these 10 kinds of luciferase reporter vectors (named pJCV-MadE or L-luc, pJCV-CYE or L-luc, pJCV-MadΔκBE or L-luc, pJCV-CYΔκBE or L-luc, pJCV-MadΔ1L-luc, pJCV-CYΔ1L-luc) were used for the transfection experiments described below. For construction of Tax mutant (M22), two amino acids, Thr130 and Leu131 of the wild-type Tax were substituted by Ala130 and Ser131 using oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. Both the wild-type Tax and M22 fragments were separately subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCXN2-FLAG, generating N terminus FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK)-tagged fusion protein (12.Tokui M. Takei I. Tashiro F. Shimada A. Kasuga A. Ishii M. Ishii T. Takatsu K. Saruta T. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and were named pFLAG-TaxWT and pFLAG-TaxM22, respectively. Transient transfections were carried out by the Effectene method (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instruction. In some experiments 1.0 × 105 cells were plated onto 12-well plates, and for other experiments 3–10 × 105 cells were seeded onto 60-mm plates and grown overnight. Vectors, including the reporter vectors, the internal Renilla luciferase control vector (pRL-TK), and other protein expression vectors were co-transfected as indicated in the figure legends. The total amount of transfected DNAs for the 60-mm plate was up to 1 μg. All assays for firefly and Renillaluciferase activity were performed using one reaction tube sequentially (Promega). Briefly, at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer. After a freeze/thaw cycle, samples were mixed with Luciferase Assay Reagent II, and the firefly luminescence was measured with a Luminometer (Turner Designs, CA). Next, samples were mixed with the Stop & Glo reagent, and the Renilla luciferase activity was measured as an internal control. Finally, luciferase activity was calculated as follows: (firefly luciferase activity of the sample/Renilla luciferase activity of the sample) − (firefly luciferase activity of the background (control vector)/Renilla luciferase activity of the background (control vector)). The results of each experiment were confirmed by three independent transfections. The data are presented as mean values ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were made with thet test for paired observations. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma, and anti-IκBα (C-21), anti-p50, and anti-p65 (sc-1190X and sc-109X, respectively) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell lysates from each experiment were resolved by 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with the antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected with an anti-Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase followed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed with the LAS-1000 plus (Fuji Film, Japan). The closed circular CY DNA was generated from the plasmids, pJC-CY, after EcoRI digestion and self-ligation. This closed circular viral DNA was co-transfected with Tax expression vector, pFLAG-TaxWT, into the KG-1-C cells plated onto 6-well plates the day before transfection. At two days post-transfection, the serum concentration of conditioned media was decreased from 10 to 2%. Five days after transfection, cells were harvested and used for RT-PCR of mRNAs of the viral early and late proteins, T antigen and VP1, respectively, and the Tax protein. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of manufacturer. PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Primers were as follows: T(t)Ag-F (5′-ATG GAC AAA GTG CTG AAT AGG G-3′) and T(t)Ag-R (5′-TTA AAG CTT TAG ATC CCT GTA GG-3′) were used to amplify the JCV early protein, T antigen (nucleotides 5013 to 4495); VP1-F (5′-ATG GCC CCA ACA AAA AGA AAA GG-3′) and VP1-R (5′-CAC TGT GGC ATT CTT TGG A-3′) were used to amplify the JCV late protein, VP1 (nucleotides 1469 to 1999); Tax-566F (5′-AGC GAA TAG AAG AAC TCC TC-3′) and Tax-R (5′-TCA GAC TTC TGT TTC TCG GA-3′) were used to amplify HTLV-I Tax (nucleotides 566 to 1062). The PCR conditions were as follows: for JCV proteins, 95 °C for 10 min: 3 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min: 27, 37, or 47 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension of 72 °C for 10 min, for Tax protein, 95 °C for 10 min: 3 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min: 42 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified DNAs were run on 1.2% agarose gel and quantified by Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). Tax- and/or Tst-1-transfected HEK293 cells and IMR-32 cells at 48 h post-transfection were lysed with hypertonic buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. 200 ng of lysates were incubated with anti-Tax monoclonal antisera (13.Tanaka Y. Yoshida A. Tozawa H. Shida H. Nyunoya H. Shimotohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) on ice for 1 h, bound to 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer from the beads after washing with ice-cold lysis buffer. Western blot analysis were carried out with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293 cells, Tax-transfected HEK293 cells, IMR-32 cells, and Tax-transfected IMR-32 cells employing Dignam's methods (14.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Binding reactions were carried out as follows: 105 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, 5049GGG AAA AAC AAGGGAATTTCC CTG GCC TCC5078 (the underline represents the NF-κB-binding site, and numbers correspond to positions on the viral genome), was incubated with 20 μg of nuclear extracts in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 25 μl. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the resulting complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× Tris borate EDTA (TBE) buffer at 4 °C. For supershift band assays, samples were incubated with anti-p50, anti-p65 antisera (sc-1190X and sc-109X, respectively), and anti-VSVG-Tag antisera (MBL, Japan) as negative control on ice for 1 h before addition of the probe. To evaluate the transcriptional activity of the JCV promoter in the presence of Tax, each of the luciferase reporter vectors with the JCV promoter derived from archetypal type CY or PML-type Mad1 strain were co-transfected with the Tax expression vector, pFLAG-TaxWT, into five different human cell lines. As the regulatory domains of JCV are comprised of two independent promoters, which drive the viral early and late proteins of both archetype and PML type, we examined the transcriptional activity of all four promoters: CY early, CY late, Mad1 early, and Mad1 late. As shown in Fig. 2 A, we found that Tax could activate the JCV promoter in the neuronal cells, including neuroblastoma cells, IMR-32 cells, and neuroglial cells, KG-1-C, U-87 MG, and U-138 MG. In particular, in IMR-32 and KG-1-C cells, the activity of the JCV promoters was significantly increased with 2.46–95.60-fold activation by Tax. In contrast, luciferase activity was not enhanced by Tax in the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. In addition, we have examined other non-glial cell lines, HeLa and MeWo, and have found that the basal transcriptional activities of JCV in these cell lines was from 1/1,000 to 1/100 less than those of HEK293 cells, and the activities were not significantly changed even in the presence of Tax (data not shown). To confirm that Tax did not activate the JCV promoters in HEK293 cells, we carefully compared the correlation of Tax protein expression level and transcriptional activity in both HEK293 and IMR-32 cells, and we found that significant expression of Tax failed to activate the CY promoter in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that in the neuronal cell lines, Tax significantly activates all four JCV promoters used in this experiment CY early, CY late, Mad1 early, and Mad1 late. It is well established that Tax activates NF-κB enhancer signals and can promote viral gene expression of HIV, CMV, and SV40 through the NF-κB pathway. Since both the Mad1 and CY type of JCV also have the NF-κB motif in the 5′ region upstream of the 98-bp box in their regulatory regions (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that Tax activated the JCV promoter via the NF-κB-binding motif. We constructed JCV promoter-driven reporter plasmids that lack NF-κB-binding motif, pJCV-MadΔκBE or L-luc, or pJCV-CYΔκBE or L-luc, and these were co-transfected into U-87 MG cells with the Tax expression vector, pFLAG-TaxWT. As shown in Fig.3 A, in the absence of Tax the activities of JCV promoters, CY early, CY late, Mad1 early, and Mad1 late, were greatly reduced by deletion of the NF-κB-binding motif, and in particular, the activity of the CY late promoter was completely abrogated. Moreover, overexpression of Tax did not rescue the reduced transcriptional activities of these mutated JCV promoters lacking the NF-κB motif. In these experiments, the expression levels of Tax were confirmed by Western blotting. Representative data are shown in Fig.3 B. These results indicate that the NF-κB motif is necessary for Tax-induced transactivation of the JCV promoter and also for the basal level of transcription of the JCV promoters with the exception of the CY early promoter. To confirm the specificity of the NF-κB motif in Tax activation, we also prepared a deletion mutant of the NF-1 sequence that has been shown to be important in the JCV regulatory region. When the NF-1 deletion mutant reporter vector pJCV-MadΔ1L-luc was co-transfected with Tax expression vector pFLAG-TaxWT into U-87 MG cells, the transactivation of the NF-1 deletion mutant promoter was similarly enhanced to that of the wild type (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that the NF-1 motif is not necessary for Tax-induced transactivation and also not necessary for basal level transcription of the JCV promoter in neuroglial cells. Recent reports have demonstrated that the overexpression of IκBα provides a dominant negative effect on the NF-κB pathway diminishing the signals from IKK that results in the retention of NF-κB in the cytoplasm (15.Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). We investigated whether overexpression of IκBα could inhibit the transactivation of the JCV promoters by Tax. The IκBα expression vector (pIκBα) was co-transfected with Tax expression vector, pFLAG-TaxWT, and each of the luciferase reporter vectors derived from either CY or Mad1-strain into U-87 MG cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, overexpression of IκBα completely inhibited the enhancement of transcriptional activity of the JCV promoters by Tax. In these experiments, the protein expression levels of both the Tax with FLAG tag and IκBα were confirmed by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody and anti-IκBα antibody, respectively. Representative data are shown in Fig.5 B. The M22 Tax mutant (T130A and L131S) has been shown to lack the ability to activate the NF-κB-dependent promoters (16.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For further confirmation that Tax activates the JCV promoter through the NF-κB pathway, the M22 Tax mutant was also examined for its ability to transactivate the JCV promoter. The wild-type reporter vector, pJCV-CYE-luc was co-transfected into U-87 MG cells with either pFLAG-TaxWT or pFLAG-TaxM22 which express the wild-type Tax and the M22 Tax mutant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the M22 Tax mutant failed to activate, whereas the wild-type could activate the JCV promoter. These results clearly demonstrate that HTLV-I Tax activates the JCV promoter via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. We investigated if Tax enhances the transactivation of the JCV promoters in a native form of JCV genome, and we measured the levels of mRNA encoding the JCV early and late proteins. Closed circular CY DNA was co-transfected with the Tax expression vector pFLAG-TaxWT into KG-1-C cells, and 5 days after the transfection, the expression levels of mRNA for the JCV early and late proteins were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.7, Tax enhanced the expression levels in both early and late transcripts with 4.3- and 9.3-fold increases, respectively. Expression of Tax was demonstrated by RT-PCR assay because its protein expression could not be detected by Western blotting over 3 days post-transfection (data not shown). To analyze the mechanisms of cell type specificity of Tax-induced transactivation of JCV, we hypothesized that one transcriptional factor, Tst-1/Oct6 which is specifically expressed in neurons and glial cells and which is well known to stimulate the JCV promoter (7.He X. Gerrero R. Simmons D.M. Park R.E. Lin C.J. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17.Sock E. Renner K. Feist D. Leger H. Wegner M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may play a critical role. Specifically we examined whether the overexpression of Tst-1/Oct6 could convert HEK293 cells to permit Tax-dependent transactivation of the JCV promoter. As shown in Fig.8 A, overexpressed Tst-1/Oct6 was co-immunoprecipitated with Tax in HEK293 cells. However, the overexpression of Tst-1/Oct6 did not allow Tax to activate the CY early promoter in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8 B). HTLV-I Tax transactivates variety of genes by the Rel/NF-κB family of transcriptional factors such as p50 and p65 which are differentially regulated in a cell type-dependent manner on the JCV promoter. Specifically, p50 has been reported to suppress the JCV transcriptional activity, whereas p65 has the potential for enhancement (18.Raj G.V. Safak M. MacDonald G.H. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5944-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of cell type specificity of JCV transactivation, we initially examined the expression levels of the NF-κB subunits, p50 and p65, in HEK293 and IMR-32 cells. As shown in Fig.9 A, Tax significantly enhanced the p50 expression in HEK293 cells compared with that in IMR-32 cells, whereas there was a similar expression levels of p65 by Tax in both cell lines. Thus, the significant increase in p50 expression levels induced by Tax in HEK293 cells might be involved in the suppression of Tax transactivation of the JCV promoter. Next, we employed an EMSA to analyze JCV NF-κB motif-binding proteins in HEK293 and IMR-32 cells. The EMSA demonstrated that in nuclear extracts from both IMR-32 and HEK293 cells Tax enhanced a major band (A, Fig. 9 B). Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that an additional Tax enhanced band B exhibiting a lower mobility than band A could be detected only in HEK293 cells (Fig.9 B). The elimination of these bands by a cold probe containing the JCV NF-κB motif in a dose-dependent manner demonstrates the specific interaction of the proteins with the probe. To examine the components of these protein complexes, the supershift assay was performed using anti-Tax, -p50, and -p65 antibodies. For both cell lines, the anti-Tax antibody supershifted the band A, and for HEK293 cells, the anti-p50, -p65, and -Tax eliminated band B. No effect was observed on band A in the supershift assay with anti-p50 or p65 antibodies, and this is presumably due to the fact that their potential binding sites are blocked by Tax (19.Suzuki T. Hirai H. Fujisawa J. Fujita T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2391-2397PubMed Google Scholar). It has been clearly demonstrated that JCV infection is increasingly important in HIV-1-infected individuals, and the incidence of PML has risen dramatically with the epidemic of AIDS. Evidence for a direct role for HIV in JCV activation has been provided by studies showing transactivation of the JCV late promoter by the HIV-1 Tat protein (4.Krachmarov C.P. Chepenik L.G. Barr-Vagell S. Khalili K. Johnson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, we documented two autopsy-proven cases of PML without immunosuppression in the setting of co-infection of another retrovirus HTLV-I, and this raised the question of whether HTLV-I could activate JCV in a similar manner as HIV-1. We investigated if HTLV-I Tax could play a pivotal role in JCV activation, as Tax has been shown to alter the expression levels of a large number of cellular genes (20.Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that Tax can transactivate the promoters of several viral genes, including those of HIV, SV40, and CMV (21.Siekevitz M. Josephs S.F. Dukovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22.Nakamura M. Niki M. Nagata K. Ohtani K. Saito S. Hinuma Y. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20189-20192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Moch H. Lang D. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies we could demonstrate that in neuronal/glial cells, the transcriptional activities of the JCV promoters were significantly enhanced by Tax. Furthermore, it could be shown that Tax could not transactivate mutants of the JCV promoter lacking the NF-κB motif. In contrast, Tax could enhance the promoter activity of another mutant of JCV promoter with a deletion of the NF-1 motif sequence. In addition, we have shown that overexpression of IκBα dramatically inhibited the enhancement of JCV promoter induced by Tax and that the M22 Tax mutant that abrogates the ability of the protein to activate via NF-κB could not transactivate the JCV promoters. Taken together, we have demonstrated that HTLV-I Tax activates the JCV promoters, CY early, CY late, Mad1 early, and Mad1 late, via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. We also investigated whether Tax could enhance the expression of JCV proteins. In this experiment, both CY and Mad1 DNAs were co-transfected with the Tax expression vector into KG-1-C cells. In contrast to the CY-transfected cells, in which the gene expression was markedly enhanced by Tax, over 70% of the Mad1-transfected cells showed cytoplasmic vacuolating change leading to cell death from the 2nd day after transfection in the presence of Tax (data not shown). As such it was impossible to detect the mRNAs of the JCV proteins in Mad1-transfected cells. It is well known that JCV has a highly restricted cell type specificity and that transactivation of JCV by HTLV-I Tax occurs only in neuronal/glial cells. To analyze the mechanism of the neuronal specificity, we examined whether Tax could transactivate the JCV promoter in the setting of overexpression of the brain-specific transcriptional factor, Tst-1/Oct6. We could demonstrate using immunoprecipitation assays that Tax bound Tst-1/Oct6 in vivo. Because Tst-1/Oct6 is known to combine with a DNA motif in the vicinity of the TATA box (24.Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4743-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that Tax might form a complex with NF-κB, Tst-1/Oct6, and the TATA-binding protein and activate the JCV promoter. However, despite overexpression of Tst-1/Oct6 in HEK293 cells Tax failed to transactivate the JCV promoter. We have also examined the expression levels of the NF-κB family, p50 and p65 in the presence of Tax, because p50 inhibits whereas p65 activates the JCV promoter via the NF-κB motif (18.Raj G.V. Safak M. MacDonald G.H. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5944-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Tax, there was a significant increase of p50 expression levels in nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells compared with IMR-32 cells, whereas p65 was equally expressed in both cell lines. This result suggests the possibility that a surplus of p50 induced by Tax might be involved in suppression of the transactivation of JCV in HEK293 cells. Next, we have carried out preliminary studies to identify cellular factors that might be involved in the neuronal cell-specific transactivation of JCV using EMSAs. In nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells, but not IMR-32 cells, a distinct band (B) was detected with the JCV NF-κB probe. A second band (A) was recognized in both cell types. The latter band (A) probably represents a complex of Tax and NF-κB, because this band was shifted by anti-Tax antibody and Tax could interact with both p65 and p50 in immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). These findings raise the possibility that HEK293 cell-specific protein(s) function suppressively in Tax-induced activation of the JCV promoter. The narrow tissue-tropism of JCV is thought to be dependent on its regulatory region which a number of transcriptional factors bind, and most of these proteins function as up-regulators of the JCV promoter. In this study, we have shown the neuronal/glial cell-specific transactivation of the JCV promoter by HTLV-I Tax, and we demonstrate the existence of a non-neuronal cell-specific protein complex, which interacts with NF-κB and which may be associated with the inhibition of the transactivation activity of Tax.

https://openalex.org/W2319692042,"Prostatic glandular epithelial cells undergo apoptosis in response to androgen-deprivation. The molecular determinants of androgen-responsiveness in these cells are incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that bcl-2 gene family members may be important in this context. We used the probasin promoter to target a human bcl-2 transgene specifically to the prostate in order to assess its impact on conferring resistance to androgen withdrawal in, otherwise sensitive, prostatic glandular epithelial cells in vivo. We examined the contribution of bax to mediating androgen-responsiveness in prostatic glandular epithelial cells using bax knockout mice. The histologic appearance of the prostates from probasin-bcl-2 transgenic mice or bax-/- mice did not differ from those of control littermates. There was no evidence of hyperplastic or neoplastic growth. There was no difference between probasin bcl-2 transgenic mice, bax-/- mice, and control littermates in steady-state levels of apoptosis. Following castration our findings suggest that both bax and bcl-2 may each contribute to the androgen-responsiveness of prostatic glandular epithelial cells. It is apparent from these results, however, that bax is not required to mediate cell death in prostatic glandular epithelial cells following castration. A comparison between the apoptotic indices in the ventral prostate from the probasin-bcl-2 and bax-/- mice following castration suggests that the presence of bcl-2 may be a more important indicator of androgen-sensitivity than a deficiency of bax."
https://openalex.org/W1602822799,"Previously, we reported insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) promotes motility and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation in neuronal cells. In the current study, we examined the role of IGF-I in Schwann cell (SC) motility. IGF-I increases SC process extension and motility. In parallel, IGF-I activates IGF-I receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3)-kinase, and FAK. LY294002, a PI-3 kinase inhibitor, blocks IGF-I-induced motility and FAK phosphorylation. The Rho family of GTPases is important in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of constitutively active Leu-61 Cdc42 and Val-12 Rac1 enhances SC motility which is unaffected by LY294002. In parallel, stable transfection of SC with dominant negative Asn-17 Rac1 blocks IGF-I-mediated SC motility and FAK phosphorylation, implying Rac is an upstream regulator of FAK. Collectively our results suggest that IGF-I regulates SC motility by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via the downstream activation of a PI-3 kinase, small GTPase, and FAK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2330253183,"Mammary derived growth inhibitor (MDGI) is a member of the family of cytoplasmic fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), which bind hydrophobic ligands such as fatty acids, retinoids, eicosanoids and prostaglandines. MDGI and an 11 amino acid MDGI-derived conserved C-terminal peptide (P108) inhibits growth of normal mammary epithelial cells in tissue and organ culture, but fails to inhibit proliferation of many breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Here, the effects of peptide P108 on tumor growth of MCF-7, MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines in nude mice were tested. To deliver P108 into tumors, a novel peptide production system was applied for expression and secretion of small bioactive peptides in mammalian cells. Functional differentiation was observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB468 cells upon P108 expression. In addition, EGF-dependent colony formation in soft agar by MDA-MB468 cells was inhibited by secreted P108. Tumor growth in athymic nude mice was suppressed in all three cell lines tested. Furthermore, P108 expressed by MCF-7/P108 cells caused paracrine tumor growth inhibition of MDA-MB231 cells. These results indicate that breast cancer inhibition by P108 is independent of binding to hydrophobic ligands and is perhaps mediated by interference with EGF-dependent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2330438370,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein functions to monitor the integrity of the genome. If a damage is detected, p53 binds tightly to specific sequence elements in the DNA and induces the transactivation of genes involved in various growth regulatory processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair and apoptosis. A p53-binding site was recently identified in the promoter region of the metastatic suppressor KAI1 gene, suggesting that this gene was a direct transcriptional target of p53. To test the relevance of this hypothesis, we studied the endogenous KAI1 expression in a series of human cell lines with varying p53 status in response to genotoxic treatment as well as in different cellular models exhibiting an inducible p53 activity. Overall, our data indicate that KAI1 expression is not significantly modulated by p53. This observation provides a direct evidence that the presence of a p53-binding site in regulatory domains is not a sufficient criteria to define a p53-transcriptional target gene."
https://openalex.org/W2058315274,"Creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible transphosphorylation of creatine by MgATP. From the sequence homology and the molecular structure of creatine kinase isoenzymes, we have identified several highly conserved residues with a potential function in the active site: a negatively charged cluster (Glu226, Glu227, Asp228) and a serine (Ser280). Mutant proteins E226Q, E226L, E227Q, E227L, D228N, and S280A/S280D of human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. Their overall structural integrity was confirmed by CD spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography. The enzymatic activity of all proteins mutated in the negatively charged cluster was extremely low (0.002–0.4% of wild type) and showed apparent Michaelis constants (K m) similar to wild type, suggesting that most of the residual activity may be attributed to wild-type revertants. Mutations of Ser280 led to higher residual activities and altered K m values; S280A showed an increase ofK m for phosphocreatine (65-fold), creatine (6-fold), and ATP (6-fold); S280D showed a decrease ofK m for creatine (6-fold). These results, together with the transition state structure of the homologous arginine kinase (Zhou, G., Somasundaram, T., Blanc, E., Parthasarathy G., Ellington, W. R., and Chapman, M. S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 8449–8454), strongly suggest a critical role of Glu226, Glu227, and Asp228in substrate binding and catalysis and point to Glu227 as a catalytic base."
https://openalex.org/W2041152090,"Protein p6 of Bacillus subtilis phage Ø29 is involved in the initiation of viral DNA replication and transcription by forming a multimeric nucleoprotein complex with the phage DNA. Based on this, together with its abundance and its capacity to bind to the whole viral genome, it has been proposed to be a viral histone-like protein. Protein p6 is in a monomer-dimer-oligomer equilibrium association. We have identified protein p6 mutants deficient in self-association by testing random mutants obtained by degenerated polymerase chain reaction in an in vivo assay for dimer formation. The mutations were mainly clustered in two regions located at the N terminus, and the central part of the protein. Site-directed single mutants, corresponding to those found in vivo, have been constructed and purified. Mutant p6A44V, located at the central part of the protein, showed an impaired dimer formation ability, and a reduced capacity to bind DNA and to activate the initiation of Ø29 DNA replication. Mutant p6I8T has at least 10-fold reduced self-association capacity, does not bind DNA nor activate Ø29 DNA initiation of replication. C-terminal deletion mutants showed an enhanced dimer formation capacity. The highly acidic tail, removed in these mutants, is proposed to modulate the protein p6 self-association.

This is the case of the nucleoid-associated proteins, of which the ones most extensively studied are HU, H-NS, IHF, and FIS. They all bind and bend DNA, sharing some common characteristics such as being very abundant, having a small size, and playing a pleiotropic role. The function of these proteins requires formation of dimers or oligomers. Thus, HU is a homodimer in most bacteria, although it is a heterodimer inEscherichia coli (1Rouvière-Yaniv J. Kjeldgaard N.O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Claret L. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1985; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and FIS is a homodimer (5Johnson R.C. Ball C.A. Pfeffer D. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, H-NS monomers undergo self-association to form tetramers (7Ceschini S. Lupidi G. Coletta M. Pon C.L. Fioretti E. Angeletti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 729-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of H-NS is involved in oligomerization (8Ueguchi C. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Williams R.M. Rimsky S. Buc H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4335-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the oligomeric structure of H-NS is necessary for recognition of intrinsically curved DNA and bending (10Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Protein p6 of Bacillus subtilis phage Ø29 is requiredin vivo for viral genome replication (11Talavera A. Salas M. Viñuela E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Carrascosa J.L. Camacho A. Moreno F. Jiménez F. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J.

Virology. 1986; 155: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have shown that protein p6 is involved both in replication and transcription; it stimulates the initiation and the transition to elongation steps of Ø29 DNA replication (14Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Garcı́a J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Blanco L. Gutiérrez J. Lázaro J.M. Bernad A. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4923-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), represses the early C2 promoter (16Barthelemy I. Mellado R.P. Salas M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 460-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and regulates the switch between early and late transcription (17Elı́as-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These functions are accomplished by the formation of a nucleoprotein complex in which the DNA adopts a right-handed toroidal conformation, and thus wrapping around a multimeric protein p6 core (18Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The number of copies of protein p6 in B. subtilis cells at late times of Ø29 infection has been calculated to be 6.6 × 105, enough to bind the entire viral progeny DNA (19Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This, together with the ability to bind in vitro to the whole Ø29 genome, led us to propose a structural role in compacting and organizing the viral genome (20Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The amounts of other histone-like proteins are cell cycle-dependent; thus, for E. coli cells in logarithmic growth, the most abundant ones are FIS and HU, with 1.2 × 104 and 1.5 × 105 copies per cell, respectively, whereas at stationary phase the most abundant is IHF with 1.2 × 104 copies per cell (21Azam T.A. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With these amounts, only a minor part of the bacterial genome would be bound by these proteins. Sedimentation equilibrium studies have shown that protein p6 is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium that shifts to higher association states at the millimolar concentrations found in vivo (19Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These oligomeric structures have been observed by transmission electron microscopy (22Abril A.M. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and their structure, as deduced by image processing, is compatible with that described for the path followed by the DNA in the protein p6·DNA complex (18Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that protein p6 could act as a scaffold organizing the DNA into the appropriate configuration. Protein p6 binding to DNA is highly cooperative 1A. M. Abril, unpublished results. and extends throughout the whole Ø29 DNA forming multiple complexes of very heterogeneous sizes; the minimal size ranges from ∼130 base pairs (bp)2 observed by electron microscopy after psoralen cross-linking, to ∼80–90 bp, shown by protection of micrococcal nuclease digestion (20Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are required to stabilize the complex, suggesting that association equilibria among protein p6 oligomers would modulate their interaction with DNA. In this work we have searched regions involved in protein p6 self-interaction. The characterization of deletion mutants has suggested that the N-terminal region is involved in protein p6 self-association, and the C-terminal acidic region interferes with it. We have obtained a collection of protein p6 random mutants unable to form dimers by using an in vivo self-association assay. The mutations were mainly clustered in two regions, located at the N-terminal and central parts of the protein. This allowed us to design site-directed mutants, which have been tested in vitro. The results obtained indicate that protein p6 dimer formation is drastically reduced by mutation I8T, whereas mutation A44V impairs dimerization and decreases the activation of Ø29 DNA initiation of replication. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and ampicillin were acquired from Sigma. Restriction enzymes (HindIII, EcoRV, BamHI, andDraI), Vent polymerase, and T4-polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England BioLabs, Taq polymerase from Perkin-Elmer, oligonucleotides from Genset Oligos, dNTP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham International plc. Glutaraldehyde was purchased from Serva. The plasmid pBF21, containing the λ cI gene under the control of a tandem lacUV5 promoter-operator region (10Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was digested with HindIII and EcoRV to remove thecI gene fragment encoding the oligomerization domain (OD) (Fig. 1). Plasmids pΔcIp6 and pΔcIp6m were made by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step cloning procedure. Wild-type (wt) gene 6, cloned in plasmid pPR55w6 (23Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and mutant gene 6R6A, from plasmid pPR55R6A (23Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were obtained by PCR by using primers designed to introduce HindIII andEcoRV restriction sites 5′-GAAAGTGGGAAAGCTTTATGGCAA-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTCTTGTGATATCATCATTCAGC-3′, respectively. PCRs were carried out with 1 μm oligonucleotides, 0.2 μg of pPR55w6 or pPR55R6A as templates, 100 μm dNTP, and 2 units of Vent polymerase on its reaction buffer. PCR fragments were cloned into digested pBF21, to generate plasmids pΔcIp6 and pΔcIp6m, containing chimeric genes encoding for the DNA binding domain of the cI repressor, cI(DBD), fused to those encoding for p6wt protein or to mutant protein p6R6A, respectively (Fig. 1). The wt and mutant gene 6 were sequenced from the plasmids. Random mutagenesis of R6A single mutant gene 6 was performed on plasmid pΔcIp6m. The oligonucleotides used generated HindIII and EcoRV restriction sites (5′-GGCTCCAAGCCAAGCTTTATG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATGGACGATATCATCA-3′). To obtain random mutations, PCR was carried out under two different conditions: one had limited dATP (20 μm) and the other had additionally 0.5 mm MnCl2 (24Arcangioli B. Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). Thus, the reactions contained 1 μm oligonucleotides; 0.2 μg of plasmid; 1.25 mm MgCl2; 5 units of Taqpolymerase; 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; and 20 μm dATP, in the absence or in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 in Taq polymerase buffer. The mutated fragments were digested with HindIII andEcoRV and cloned into plasmid pBF21 digested with the same enzymes. E. coli 71-18 lacIq cells (26Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11471) Google Scholar) were transformed with these constructions and tested for λ phage development as described below. The mutated gene 6 was sequenced in those clones showing a lytic phenotype. E. coli 71-18lacIq cells transformed with plasmid pBF21 or the derivatives described above, were grown at 37 °C up to an optical density of 0.6 at 620 nm in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The production of chimeric proteins was induced by addition of 250 μl of 100 mm IPTG to 0.4 ml of culture. After induction, cells were infected with λ146 hypervirulent phage (27Bailone A. Devoret R. Virology. 1978; 84: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), essentially as described (10Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After 5-min incubation, 5 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to the infected cultures, which were further incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 0.4-ml aliquots were centrifuged and 150 μl of supernatant was mixed with 30 μl of chloroform. The number of plaques forming units per milliliter in each supernatant was determined using E. coli 71-18 lacIq as the recipient strain. Site-directed mutants of wt gene 6 were constructed by PCR using plasmid pPR55w6 (23Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as template. As primers, we have used four oligonucleotides with degenerated positions, to obtain mutations in amino acids 7, 8, 43, and 44 of protein p6 (5′-CGGTTGTCTTTGTGRTTWCTCTCTGC-3′; 5′-GCAGAGAGWAAYCACAAAGACAACCG-3′; 5′-CTCCATTGARCTYGTTCCATTGTC-3′; 5′-GACAATGGAACRAGYTCAATGGAG-3′). Two oligonucleotides 5′-CGACCTGCAGGGATCCGGCC-3′ and 5′-CTAATACTAGAAGCTTCTCTTGTG-3′ were used to generateBamHI and HindIII restriction sites to clone the fragments containing mutated gene 6 into plasmid pPLc28 (28Remaut E. Stanssens P. Fiers W. Gene. 1981; 15: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) under the control of λ PL promoter. The λ lysogen E. coli K-12ΔH1Δtrp encoding the thermosensitive cI857 repressor (28Remaut E. Stanssens P. Fiers W. Gene. 1981; 15: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) was electroporated with the recombinant plasmids to obtain a library of random mutants. The mutations were determined by sequencing the corresponding gene 6 in selected clones from the library. Cultures ofE. coli K-12ΔH1Δtrp cells transformed with the recombinant plasmids pMJnΔ5 and pMJnΔ13 (29Otero M.J. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Gene. 1990; 95: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and pMJcΔ14 and pMJcΔ16 (30Otero M.J. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4567-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were induced for 1 h at 42 °C. After centrifugation, 20 g of cells was ground with alumina and extracted with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) with 0.5 m NaCl. Alumina and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added to the supernatant up to 0.25%, after adjusting absorbance at 260 nm to 120 units/ml, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove DNA. The supernatant was made 0.35 m NaCl with buffer A; deletion mutant proteins were recovered in the pellet after centrifugation as above. To eliminate PEI, pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl, and the proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate up to 70% saturation. Pellets containing N-terminal deletion mutants, p6NΔ5 and p6NΔ13, were resuspended in buffer A and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, whereas those containing C-terminal deletion mutants, p6CΔ14 and p6CΔ16, were applied to a phosphocellulose column. They were eluted with salt concentrations ranging from 75 to 200 mm NaCl. The mutant proteins were further subjected to heparin-agarose chromatography and eluted at salt concentrations from 50 to 350 mm NaCl. Minor contaminants were eliminated using Centricon-50 from Amicon; after this step the purity of the mutant proteins was estimated to be 95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Cultures of E. coli K-12ΔH1Δtrp cells, transformed with plasmids encoding protein p6 site-directed mutants, were induced for 2 h at 42 °C. After centrifugation, 6–8 g of cells was ground with alumina, and the DNA was removed as described above. The mutant proteins were extracted from the PEI pellet by washing with 1m NaCl buffer A and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to up to 70% saturation. Pellets containing mutant proteins were resuspended in buffer A and applied to a phosphocellulose column, except p6I8T, which was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column. The different protein p6 mutants were eluted with buffer A containing NaCl concentrations from 75 to 200 mm. Minor contaminants were eliminated by 15–30% glycerol gradient centrifugation. After this step all protein p6 single mutants were more than 90% homogeneous as estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The reaction mixture contained (in 25 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; 20 mm ammonium sulfate; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol; 0.25 μm[α-32P]dATP; 0.3 μg of phage Ø29 terminal protein-DNA complex, purified as described (31Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); 20 ng of terminal protein; 20 ng of Ø29 DNA polymerase; and the indicated amounts of either protein p6wt or protein p6 mutants. After incubation for 15 min at 15 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding up to 10 mmEDTA and 0.1% SDS. The samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The initiation complex formed was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (31Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed by using a Fuji BAS-1500 image analyzer. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was carried out essentially as described (32Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Either wt or mutant p6 proteins, 5 μm each, were incubated at room temperature in 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 μm glutaraldehyde. After 45-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, up to 150 mm. Samples were analyzed by SDS-Tricine-PAGE (33Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10494) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics, using an An60Ti rotor. Protein p6 was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. Protein p6 (100 μl of 100 μm) was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm, and absorbance scans at 280 nm were taken at sedimentation equilibrium. The equilibrium temperature was 4 °C. High speed sedimentation (42,000 rpm) was conducted afterward for baseline correction. Whole cell apparent weight average molecular weights (Mw,a ) were determined by fitting a sedimentation equilibrium model for a single sedimenting solute to individual datasets with the program EQASSOC (supplied by Beckman, Ref.34Minton A.P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of protein p6 was 0.728 ml/g, calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein deduced from the gene 6 sequence (35Murray C.L. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was carried out essentially as described (36Prieto I. Serrano M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of either wt or mutant p6 proteins were incubated with 2 ng of Ø29 DNA left terminal fragment, 259 bp long. The DNA fragment was obtained by PCR in a reaction containing 0.2 μg of Ø29 DNA as template, 1 μm oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCTTTAAAGTAAGCCCCCACCCTC-3′ and 5′-GCCCACATACTTTGTTGATTGG-3′, 100 μm dNTP, and 2 units of Vent polymerase in its reaction buffer. The last oligonucleotide was previously 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase to obtain the Ø29 DNA terminal fragment internally labeled. The PCR product was digested with DraI to restore the Ø29 DNA terminal end. DNase I digestion was carried out for 5 min at 15 °C in 25 μl of a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA, pH 8.0, up to 20 mm final concentration. DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of RNA carrier (0.25 mg/ml) and then subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in 6% (w/v) acrylamide gel. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.2-cm path length cuvette. Proteins were used at room temperature at a concentration of 0.13 g/l in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The final spectrum in each case is the mean of 10 measurements with a step size of 0.2 nm recorded from 260 to 200 nm. Data were base line-corrected by substraction of that of the Tris buffer. It has been reported that N-terminal deletion mutants of protein p6 lacking 5 or 13 amino acids (p6NΔ5 and p6NΔ13, respectively) were not able to interact with a Ø29 DNA terminal fragment as detected by DNase I footprinting (29Otero M.J. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Gene. 1990; 95: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because DNA binding is highly cooperative1 and requires the formation of large oligomers, the lack of DNA binding could be due to a deficiency in protein p6 self-association; therefore, we tested by glutaraldehyde cross-linking the capability of both deletion mutants to self-associate. Fig.2 shows that dimer formation was highly impaired in the p6NΔ5 mutant, being about 10% that of the p6wt protein. In addition, dimers were not detected with the p6NΔ13 mutant (not shown). On the other hand, a 14-amino acid C-terminal deletion mutant of protein p6 (p6CΔ14) bound DNA 2-fold better than the p6wt protein (30Otero M.J. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4567-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two C-terminal deletion mutants of 14 and 16 amino acids (p6CΔ14 and p6CΔ16, respectively) were tested for dimer formation by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. As Fig. 2 shows, the ability of dimer formation in the p6CΔ16 mutant protein was about 2-fold that of the p6wt protein; a similar result was obtained with the mutant protein p6CΔ14 (not shown). Therefore, the observed DNA binding properties of p6NΔ5, p6NΔ13, p6CΔ14, and p6CΔ16 mutants could be explained by their self-association capacities. These results indicate that the N-terminal region of protein p6 is required for glutaraldehyde cross-linking, suggesting that this region is involved in dimer formation; however, glutaraldehyde cross-linking is favored when the C-terminal region is removed, suggesting that this region impairs dimer formation. To further investigate the protein p6 regions involved in self-association, we carried out anin vivo assay in which we used the region encoding the N-terminal domain of λ cI repressor as a reporter gene for dimerization (10Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Phage λ cI repressor is a two-domain protein that binds DNA as a dimer; the N-terminal part is the DNA binding domain, cI(DBD), whereas the C-terminal one is the oligomerization domain, cI(OD), which is required for an efficient binding to the operator. Thus, E. coli cells expressing only cI(DBD) (ΔcI) were sensitive to hypervirulent phage λ146 infection, whereas those with intact cI were immune. Replacement of the cI(OD) by another protein provides a self-interaction assay for that protein. We have used the plasmid pBF21 (10Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), expressing the λ phage cI repressor under the control of the lac promoter, to construct pΔcIp6 plasmid encoding a fusion protein containing the ΔcI and the protein p6wt (Fig. 1). The dimerization capacity of protein p6 was assayed by determining the development of infecting λ146 phage in E. coli cells harboring the pΔcIp6 plasmid upon induction with IPTG. Cells expressing the ΔcIp6 fusion protein were not immune to λ146 infection (Fig.3), behaving as the control cells expressing ΔcI. This result was unexpected, because protein p6 self-interacts in vitro. The expression of ΔcIp6 fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with protein p6 antiserum (not shown). An explanation for the lytic phenotype could be that the non sequence-specific DNA binding ability of protein p6 (37Serrano M. Gutiérrez J. Prieto I. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) prevented the binding of the ΔcI to the operators. To avoid this, plasmid pΔcIp6m (see Fig. 1) was constructed, expressing a fusion containing the ΔcI and the protein p6 mutant defective in DNA binding p6R6A (38Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells harboring the plasmid pΔcIp6m showed, upon induction, a time course development of λ146 phage similar to that of the control cells expressing intact λ cI repressor. In these cases, the number of pfu/ml was about 104-fold lower than that obtained in cells expressing ΔcI (Fig. 3). Therefore, we can conclude that the mutant protein p6R6A functionally replaces the cI(OD) allowing dimerization of the ΔcI. This strongly suggests that protein p6 self-associates in vivo. The in vivoassay described above sets up the basis to select mutants in self-association. Because ΔcIp6m fusion protein confers immunity to λ146 infection, random mutagenesis was performed on mutant gene 6R6A contained in plasmid pΔcIp6m. The PCR products were cloned as above, under the control of the lac promoter, in-frame to the cI(DBD). Therefore, chimeric proteins consisting of ΔcI and random mutants of protein p6R6A were expressed. Individual colonies were tested for λ phage development as above, and clones showing a lytic phenotype were selected as candidates defective in protein p6 self-interaction. From 200 individual clones, 35 showed a lytic phenotype. Fig. 4 shows the development of λ146 phage in selected lytic clones, which was about 104-fold higher than that of cells expressing ΔcIp6m. The expression of the fusion proteins was assessed by Western immunoblotting analysis using antiserum against protein p6 (not shown). The entire nucleotide sequence of the mutated gene 6 was determined from the 35 lytic clones. Four of them had a premature stop codon. Most of the mutants had more than three amino acid changes, and only five carried double or triple mutations as shown in Fig.5. Amino acid sequence comparison with the p6R6A protein (p6m) showed that the mutations were mainly clustered in two regions: N-terminal, around position 8 (region I, Fig. 5), like those in p6m8 and p6m22 mutant proteins, and a central region around position 44 (region II, Fig. 5), like p6m23 and p6m41 mutant proteins. Mutant protein p6m94 carried a single mutation in each region. The non-random distribution of in vivo selected mutants strongly suggested the involvement of regions I and II in protein p6 self-interaction. To assess directly the involvement of individual residues in protein-protein interaction, we designed site-directed mutations on positions 7, 8, 43, and 44, where wt residues were replaced by those found in mutants selected in vivo (Fig. 5), namely E7V, I8T, Q43R, and A44V. The site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR on plasmid pPR55w6, encoding wt gene 6 (23Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were cloned into an expression vector under the control of the bacteriophage λ PL promoter. Mutants were overproduced and purified up to at least 90% homogeneity. Protein p6 mutants were tested for activation of initiation of phage Ø29 DNA replication in an in vitro assay with purified proteins (14Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Garcı́a J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the results obtained with the mutant proteins p6E7V, p6I8T, p6Q43R, and p6A44V. Although the mutants p6E7V and p6Q43R showed an activation similar to that of the p6wt protein, the p6A44V mutant protein exhibited about a 6-fold reduced capacity to activate the initiation reaction. No activation was detected by the p6I8T mutant. The deficiency observed in the activation of the initiation reaction in p6A44V and p6I8T mutant proteins could be due to an impaired self-association and/or DNA binding. Because we have selected these mutants in an in vivo self-association assay, we first studied the dimerization properties of the protein p6 mutants. The effect of the p6A44V and p6I8T mutations in self-interaction was tested, as a first approach, by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The amount of dimers formed by the p6A44V and p6I8T mutant proteins was 50% and 7%, respectively, of that found in the p6wt protein (Fig.7).Figure 7Dimer formation of protein p6wt and site-directed mutants.

Proteins were cross-linked as described under “Experimental Procedures” and run in SDS-Tricine-PAGE, along with untreated samples. The mobilities of molecular mass standards are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results prompted us to further study the self-interaction capability of the protein p6 mutants by analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation equilibrium studies had shown that protein p6, in the 1–100 μm range, is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dimerization constant (K 2) of 2 × 105m−1 that shifts to higher association states at higher protein concentration (19Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig.8 shows that, at 100 μm and 4 °C, the Mw,a ) of protein p6wt was 25,400, whereas those of p6A44V and p6I8T mutant proteins were 20,600 and 15,500, respectively, the latter being close to the theoretical value for the wt protein p6 monomer (11,900). Assuming that mutant proteins have the same self-association behavior as p6wt (19Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the dimerization constant of p6A44V is slightly lower than that of the p6wt 3G. Rivas, personal communication. ; however, theK 2 of p6I8T is, at least, 10-fold lower than that of the p6wt protein.3 Therefore, we can conclude that A44V mutation slightly affects protein dimerization, which is almost abolished by the mutation I8T. Protein p6 forms a nucleoprotein complex with phage Ø29 DNA terminal fragments, in which the DNA wraps around a multimeric protein core (39Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The formation of the complex can be detected by a characteristic DNase I footprint pattern, in which strong hypersensitivities, with a periodicity of 24 bp, are located in between protected regions (36Prieto I. Serrano M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, protein p6A44V required a 2.5-fold higher protein amount (0.5 μg) than protein p6wt (0.2 μg) to form the complex; this may reflect the reduced capacity to form dimers of p6A44V mutant. In addition, we can observe that the digestion pattern formed with p6A44V is slightly different than that observed with p6wt. As it could be expected from the previous results, p6I8T mutant protein failed to bind DNA even at a 20-fold higher protein concentration than that of the p6wt (Fig. 9). Protein p6 of B. subtilis phage Ø29 binds DNA forming a multimeric nucleoprotein complex (39Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that is required for activation of Ø29 DNA initiation of replication (37Serrano M. Gutiérrez J. Prieto I. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), repression of transcription from early C2 promoter (13Whiteley H.R. Ramey W.D. Spiegelman G.B. Holder R.D. Virology. 1986; 155: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Barthelemy I. Mellado R.P. Salas M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 460-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and regulation of viral switch between early and late transcription (17Elı́as-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein p6 in solution forms elongated oligomers from preformed dimers, at thein vivo estimated protein concentration (19Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oligomeric structures have been proposed to provide the scaffold on which the DNA folds into the appropriate configuration. Protein p6 binding to DNA requires multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Thus, failure to bind DNA of N-terminal deletion mutants of 5 or 13 amino acids in protein p6 (29Otero M.J. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Gene. 1990; 95: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), can be explained by their impaired or lost capacity, respectively, in dimer formation. We have looked for other regions involved in protein p6 self-association by using an in vivo system based on the immunity of cells expressing λ cI repressor to λ phage infection. If the λ cI(OD) is removed, immunity is lost and the infecting phage can develop lytic cycle. Thus, replacement of the cI(OD) by other protein provides a self-interaction test for this protein. When ΔcI was fused to the gene encoding p6R6A mutant protein, immunity was achieved, suggesting that the protein self-interacts in vivo. Thus, random mutants of protein p6R6A, obtained by degenerated PCR, were tested for self-association. Although the proteins contained multiple mutations, they were not randomly arranged, but mainly clustered in two regions located at the N-terminal and the central region of protein p6 (regions I and II in Fig. 5). Therefore, single site-directed mutants of protein p6wt corresponding to some of those found in vivo were constructed and assayed in vitro. Taking into account that the in vivo selected mutant proteins p6m23 and p6m41 (Fig.5) share the Q43R mutation, we would expect an involvement of Gln43 in protein p6 self-interaction. However, this was not confirmed by in vitro experiments with the corresponding site-directed mutant. The mutant protein p6Q43R did not show any significant difference with the wt protein in the activation of Ø29 DNA initiation of replication or glutaraldehyde cross-linking. A possible explanation for this result could be that the in vivo assay is more restrictive. In addition, the single mutation may not be enough to show an impaired dimerization, and additional changes might be required, like those found in the in vivoselected mutants. The involvement of region II in dimer formation is shown by p6A44V mutant protein, which has a slightly reduced capacity to form dimers. In agreement with this, DNase I footprinting (Fig. 9) shows that p6A44V has a DNA binding affinity lower than that of the p6wt protein and an impaired activation of Ø29 DNA initiation of replication. The involvement in dimer formation of region I (see Fig. 5) was expected from the results obtained with protein p6 N-terminal deletion mutants. The p6I8T mutant protein failed to activate the Ø29 DNA initiation of replication, DNA binding was not detected, and dimer formation was reduced at least 10-fold. Mutant p6 proteins are folded, as shown in Fig. 10, where the circular dichroism spectra of the wt and mutant p6 proteins do not show significant differences in their secondary structure. Altogether, these results suggest that Ile8 is involved in the self-interaction of protein p6. It has been reported that a C-terminal, 14-amino acid truncated p6 protein has a DNA binding activity 2-fold higher than that of the p6wt protein (30Otero M.J. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4567-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have now shown that this truncated protein has increased its capacity to form dimers. Protein p6 has a very acidic C terminus, where 10 out of 19 residues are either Asp or Glu (see Fig.5). Therefore, it seems likely that the C-terminal acidic region modulates protein p6 self-association, interacting with a basic region. There is a cluster of basic residues overlapping region II (see Fig.5), although interaction with region I, which also contains basic residues, cannot be ruled out. This interaction could contribute to the dynamic nature of the protein p6 binding to DNA (20Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In summary, we have found two regions involved in vivo in self-association of phage Ø29 protein p6, the N-terminal and a central region. Site-directed mutation A44V, located at the central region, impairs the protein p6 self-association. The N-terminal mutation I8T has a more drastic effect and completely abolished dimer formation.
