https://openalex.org/W1970916644,"The incorporation of histone H3 variants has been implicated in the epigenetic memory of cellular state. Using genome editing with zinc-finger nucleases to tag endogenous H3.3, we report genome-wide profiles of H3 variants in mammalian embryonic stem cells and neuronal precursor cells. Genome-wide patterns of H3.3 are dependent on amino acid sequence and change with cellular differentiation at developmentally regulated loci. The H3.3 chaperone Hira is required for H3.3 enrichment at active and repressed genes. Strikingly, Hira is not essential for localization of H3.3 at telomeres and many transcription factor binding sites. Immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry reveal that the proteins Atrx and Daxx associate with H3.3 in a Hira-independent manner. Atrx is required for Hira-independent localization of H3.3 at telomeres and for the repression of telomeric RNA. Our data demonstrate that multiple and distinct factors are responsible for H3.3 localization at specific genomic locations in mammalian cells.

H3.3 localization at specific genes and regulatory regions is cell-type specific Hira controls H3.3 localization to genes and some regulatory regions H3.3 localization to many regulatory elements and telomeres is Hira independent Atrx is required for H3.3 telomeric localization, and for telomeric RNA repression Genetic and biochemical evidence have recently converged to connect epigenetic mechanisms at the level of chromatin (Bernstein et al., 2007Bernstein B.E.

In addition to nucleosome remodeling and covalent modifications, eukaryotic cells generate variation in chromatin by the introduction of variant histone proteins (Henikoff, 2008Henikoff S. Nucleosome destabilization in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express three major types of noncentromeric histone H3 variants, H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 (Hake and Allis, 2006Hake S.B. Allis C.D.

Although histone H3.3 differs from H3.2 and H3.1 at only four or five amino acids (Figure S1A available online), H3.3 is specifically enriched at transcriptionally active genes and regulatory elements in nonpluripotent cells (Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002Ahmad K.

Histone replacement marks the boundaries of cis-regulatory domains.Science. 2007; 315: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Histone H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin in both a replication-coupled (RC) and replication-independent (RI) manner, while the incorporation of H3.2 is coupled to replication (Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002Ahmad K.

The histone chaperone CAF-1 is found in a complex with H3.1 and mediates RC nucleosome assembly (Smith and Stillman, 1989Smith S. Stillman B.

In contrast, the histone chaperone Hira has been found in a complex with H3.3 and mediates RI nucleosome assembly (Ray-Gallet et al., 2002Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M.

Hira has been implicated in H3.3-specific deposition and chromatin assembly (Loyola and Almouzni, 2007Loyola A. Almouzni G. Marking histone H3 variants: how, when and why?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although Hira is required for chromatin assembly and H3.3 deposition in the male pronucleus of Drosophila, Hira is not required for global H3.3 deposition in Drosophila embryos or adult cells, suggesting that alternate pathways may mediate H3.3 nucleosome assembly (Bonnefoy et al., 2007Bonnefoy E.

The histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA is essential for chromatin assembly in the male pronucleus.Nature. 2005; 437: 1386-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, the chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 was shown to physically associate with Hira and has been suggested to work with Hira to mediate H3.3 incorporation into chromatin in Drosophila (Konev et al., 2007Konev A.Y. Tribus M. Park S.Y. Podhraski V. Lim C.Y. Emelyanov A.V. Vershilova E. Pirrotta V. Kadonaga J.T. Lusser A. Fyodorov D.V. CHD1 motor protein is required for deposition of histone variant H3.3 into chromatin in vivo.Science. 2007; 317: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, both Hira and H3.3 are required for fertility and for transcriptional regulation of specific genes, but not for developmental viability (Bonnefoy et al., 2007Bonnefoy E. Orsi G.A.

However, in mice, targeted mutagenesis of Hira results in a more severe phenotype, with gastrulation defects leading to early embryonic lethality (Roberts et al., 2002Roberts C. Sutherland H.F.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2318-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Given the conserved association between H3.3 and active chromatin, H3.3 has been speculated to play an important role in mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Creyghton et al., 2008Creyghton M.P. Markoulaki S. Levine S.S. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Sha K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Boyer L.A.

Chd1 regulates open chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, no genome-wide studies in pluripotent cells distinguish between H3 variants, nor do they examine the genome-wide role of Hira or other histone chaperones in specifying H3.3 localization at specific genomic regions. Here, we report genome-wide profiles of histone H3 variant localization in mammalian ESCs and neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), and we establish the dependence and independence of these patterns on Hira. We find that Hira is required for genome-wide H3.3 enrichment at active and repressed genes in ESCs. Surprisingly, H3.3 enrichment at many transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and telomeres is Hira independent. To identify factors that might mediate specific Hira-independent localization of H3.3, we use immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. We identify Atrx and Daxx as proteins that specifically associate with H3.3 in both pluripotent and nonpluripotent cells, both in the presence and in the absence of Hira. Unlike Hira, Atrx is not required for H3.3 localization at genes or TFBS. However, Atrx is specifically required for enrichment of H3.3 at telomeres in ESCs, and for the repression of telomeric RNA. To distinguish H3 variants in our study without altering endogenous levels of H3 variant expression, we used designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Carroll, 2008Carroll D. Progress and prospects: zinc-finger nucleases as gene therapy agents.Gene Ther. 2008; 15: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) in both gene addition (Moehle et al., 2007Moehle E.A.

Porteus M.H. Gregory P.D. Holmes M.C. Highly efficient endogenous human gene correction using designed zinc-finger nucleases.Nature. 2005; 435: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) modes to engineer a panel of heterozygous ESC lines carrying one allele of wild-type H3.3B and another allele of H3.3B with a C-terminal EYFP tag (H3.3-EYFP), HA tag (H3.3-HA), or H3.3B with an epitope tag and simultaneous mutation toward H3.2 or H3.1 (H3.2-EYFP, H3.1-EYFP, H3.2-HA, and H3.1S31-HA) (Figure S1). All heterozygously tagged ESCs retain three “wild-type” copies of H3.3 genes, including one copy of unmodified H3.3B (Figure S1G), and two copies of H3.3A. Western blots demonstrate equal protein expression in the epitope-tagged H3 variant ESC lines (Figure S1H). To assess the genome-wide localization of histone H3 variants at high resolution, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K.

Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). We found 10,099 total genic and intergenic regions highly enriched for H3.3 in crosslinking ChIP-seq of ESCs, in contrast to 1442 regions enriched for H3.2, and we observe that gene-rich regions of the genome show greater enrichment of H3.3 than H3.2 (Figures 1A and 1B ). On a chromosomal scale map, H3.3 enrichment correlates with markers of transcription, including Ser-5 phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K4me1 (Figure 1A). Unbiased clustering analyses confirm the genome-wide correlation of H3.3 with active histone modifications, particularly H3K4me1 (Table S1). Despite different epitope tags, we found extremely similar profiles of H3.3-HA and H3.3-EYFP (Figure 1A, Table S1, Figures S2A and S2B). Genome-wide analysis also reveals specific enrichment of H3.3 at previously identified genic and intergenic ESC TFBS (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E.

To analyze H3 variant enrichment in different classes of repeats, we determined the relative enrichment of specific repeat sequences from our ChIP-seq experiments and compared it to that from control input DNA. H3.3 was reproducibly depleted in satellite repeat sequences and in Y-chromosomal repeat DNA (Figure 1C). We found the most significant enrichment of H3.3 in the (TTAGGG)n repeat that is the conserved telomeric DNA sequence among vertebrates (Meyne et al., 1989Meyne J. Ratliff R.L. Moyzis R.K. Conservation of the human telomere sequence (TTAGGG)n among vertebrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). This telomeric enrichment of H3.3 is consistent with telomeric foci of incorporation visible on the largely heterochromatic Y chromosome (Figures S1J–S1O), and with a recent report of telomeric localization of transfected epitope-tagged H3.3 in ESCs (Wong et al., 2009Wong L.H. Ren H. Williams E. McGhie J. Ahn S. Sim M. Tam A. Earle E. Anderson M.A. Mann J. Choo K.H. Histone H3.3 incorporation provides a unique and functionally essential telomeric chromatin in embryonic stem cells.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutation of H3.3B to H3.2 or H3.1S31 alters genome-wide patterns of H3.3 enrichment, demonstrating that the amino acid sequence of an endogenous H3.3 gene determines its genomic localization in mammalian cells.

When we divide HCP genes into low, medium, and high expression in ESCs (see the Experimental Procedures), we find that H3.3, like H3K4me3 and RNAPII, is enriched around the TSS of both active and repressed genes (Figure 2A ). In both native and crosslinking ChIP-seq, we find H3.3 less enriched at the TSS itself (Figures 2A and 2D, Figures S2A–S2D).

We report here that experience-driven neuronal activity induces Ube3A transcription and that Ube3A then regulates excitatory synapse development by controlling the degradation of Arc, a synaptic protein that promotes the internalization of the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors.

Med. Genet. A. 2006; 140: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Genetic studies revealed that AS is associated with maternal deletions of chromosome 15q11-q13, paternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting defects that affect the transcription of genes within 15q11-q13 (Clayton-Smith and Laan, 2003Clayton-Smith J.

Recent studies indicate that failure to inherit a normal maternal copy of the UBE3A gene (which resides within 15q11-q13) accounts for 85%–90% of AS cases, and specific loss-of-function mutations in human UBE3A have been identified in a subset of affected individuals (Kishino et al., 1997Kishino T.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex disorders characterized by impairment in social interactions and the occurrence of repetitive behaviors. Despite the high prevalence of ASDs, little is known about the etiology of these disorders. Nonetheless, there is a significant genetic component to ASDs, and thus considerable effort has gone into identifying genetic mutations that cause ASDs. These studies suggest that Ube3A is a candidate ASD gene. Abnormalities within chromosomal region 15q11-q13 are among the most prevalent mutations identified in ASDs, accounting for 1%–2% of all ASD cases (Sutcliffe et al., 2003Sutcliffe J.S. Nurmi E.L.

Recent reports indicate that copy number variance within the Ube3A locus is associated with autism (Glessner et al., 2009Glessner J.T. Wang K. Cai G. Korvatska O. Kim C.E. Wood S. Zhang H. Estes A.

Despite the critical role that Ube3A plays in human cognitive function, little is known about Ube3A's contribution to nervous system development or how the mutation of Ube3A leads to cognitive impairment. Electrophysiological experiments have demonstrated impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in Ube3A knockout mice (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L.

Additionally, a recent study implicates Ube3A in experience-dependent plasticity (Yashiro et al., 2009Yashiro K. Riday T.T. Condon K.H. Roberts A.C. Bernardo D.R. Prakash R. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Philpot B.D. Ube3a is required for experience-dependent maturation of the neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). While these experiments demonstrate a crucial role for Ube3A in synaptic transmission, the mechanisms by which Ube3A regulates synaptic function are poorly understood. Possible insight into how Ube3A functions may come from the finding that Ube3A is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family of enzymes, a class of proteins that catalyzes the addition of ubiquitin moieties to target substrates, often leading to the degradation of the ubiquitinated protein. Genetic studies indicate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Ube3A is necessary for normal human cognitive function inasmuch as disruption of this activity leads to AS (Cooper et al., 2004Cooper E.M. Hudson A.W. Amos J. Wagstaff J. Howley P.M. Biochemical analysis of Angelman syndrome-associated mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41208-41217Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the neuronal substrates of Ube3A that mediate its effects on synaptic function remain unknown. In this study, we sought to understand how disruption of Ube3A results in synaptic dysfunction. We find that Ube3A is a neuronal activity-regulated protein that controls synaptic function by ubiquitinating and degrading the synaptic protein Arc. In the absence of Ube3A, elevated levels of Arc accumulate in neurons, resulting in the excessive internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at synapses and impaired synaptic function. This impaired AMPAR trafficking may be a cause of the cognitive dysfunction that occurs in AS. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for treating AS, a disorder for which there is currently no effective therapy. One clue as to how Ube3A might function in nervous system development comes from the observation that the symptoms of AS and ASDs first become apparent within the first years of a child's life (Williams et al., 2006Williams C.A. Beaudet A.L. Clayton-Smith J. Knoll J.H. Kyllerman M. Laan L.A. Magenis R.E. Moncla A. Schinzel A.A. Summers J.A. Wagstaff J. Angelman syndrome 2005: updated consensus for diagnostic criteria.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2006; 140: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), during which sensory experiences play a key role in shaping neuronal connectivity. The effect of environmental cues on cognitive development is mediated in part by the release of glutamate at excitatory synapses. This triggers a program of gene expression that plays a critical role in synapse development (Greer and Greenberg, 2008Greer P.L. Greenberg M.E. From synapse to nucleus: calcium-dependent gene transcription in the control of synapse development and function.Neuron. 2008; 59: 846-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that AS may arise from a deficit in activity-dependent regulation of Ube3A. We find that the expression of Ube3A messenger RNA (mRNA) in cultured neurons is significantly increased by either membrane depolarization or glutamate receptor activation (Figure 1A ). Conversely, blocking neuronal activity with inhibitors of NMDARs, AMPARs and sodium channels results in a decrease in Ube3A mRNA expression (Figure S1A available online). Ube3A protein levels mirror the change in mRNA level under these conditions (Figure 1B and Figures S1B and S1C).Figure S1Regulation of Ube3A mRNA and Protein by Neuronal Activity, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Real-time PCR analysis of Ube3A mRNA extracted from hippocampal neurons at E18 + 10 DIV treated for six hours with the indicated agent.

We next asked whether Ube3A expression is induced by neuronal activity in the intact mouse brain. During kainate-induced seizures, Ube3A mRNA and protein levels are increased compared to control (Figures S1D and S1E). Ube3A is also induced in response to environmental stimuli that trigger experience-dependent synaptic development (Figure 1C and Figure S1F). Mice in a cage containing novel objects to induce exploratory behavior exhibited increased Ube3A mRNA and protein expression compared to mice in a standard laboratory cage (Figure 1C and Figure S1F). These results demonstrate that Ube3A mRNA and protein levels are regulated by synaptic activity both in culture and in the intact brain. These findings raise the possibility that synaptic glutamate release during early life experiences activates Ube3A expression and that the absence of experience-dependent Ube3A induction may contribute to the neurological impairment in AS. We investigated the mechanism by which neuronal activity triggers Ube3A induction. Analysis of Ube3A transcripts present in expressed sequence tag databases revealed three distinct mRNA transcripts that are likely transcribed from unique promoters. Of the Ube3A transcripts, those initiating from promoters 1 and 3 are induced by neuronal activity (Figure S1G), and their promoters contain binding sites for the activity-regulated transcription factor MEF2. These sites are conserved across phylogeny and lie within 2 kB of the putative transcriptional start sites of the two activity-regulated Ube3A transcripts (see below). The presence of potential MEF2-binding sites within Ube3A promoters was of interest because MEF2 is an activity-regulated transcription factor that controls synapse development and regulates genes implicated in ASDs (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E.

Hashmi A. et al.Identifying autism loci and genes by tracing recent shared ancestry.Science. 2008; 321: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that DNA fragments corresponding to Ube3A promoters 1 and 3 are enriched in anti-MEF2 immunoprecipitates (Figure 1D and data not shown). By contrast, there was no enrichment for DNA sequences surrounding Ube3A promoter 2 (Figure 1D). These data suggest that MEF2 may directly control the activity-dependent transcription of Ube3A from promoters 1 and 3. The neuronal activity-dependent induction of Ube3A promoter 1- and 3-driven mRNA transcripts and Ube3A protein are significantly reduced in neurons infected with lentiviruses encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the MEF2 family members MEF2A and MEF2D (Figures 1E and 1F). By contrast, the expression of Ube3A promoter 2-dependent mRNA transcripts, as well as GAPDH and beta3-tubulin, is unaffected by the presence of MEF2 shRNA (Figure 1E). These experiments indicate that in response to neuronal activity, Ube3A promoter 1- and 3-driven mRNA transcripts and Ube3A protein expression are induced by a MEF2-dependent mechanism. Regulation of Ube3A mRNA expression by neuronal activity along with the association of Ube3A with AS led us to investigate the role of Ube3A in nervous system development. Point mutations within the Ube3A coding region have been associated with AS, nearly all of which abrogate its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Cooper et al., 2004Cooper E.M. Hudson A.W. Amos J. Wagstaff J. Howley P.M. Biochemical analysis of Angelman syndrome-associated mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41208-41217Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that the catalytic activity of Ube3A is important for nervous system development. Although several Ube3A substrates have been identified in nonneuronal cells, the identification of substrates of E3 ubiquitin ligases has been challenging. To identify Ube3A substrates, we employed a transgenic mouse in which a hemagglutinin epitope tagged-version of ubiquitin (HA-ubiquitin) is knocked into the HPRT locus (Ryu et al., 2007Ryu K.Y. Maehr R. Gilchrist C.A. Long M.A. Bouley D.M. Mueller B. Ploegh H.L. Kopito R.R. The mouse polyubiquitin gene UbC is essential for fetal liver development, cell-cycle progression and stress tolerance.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2693-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These mice express similar levels of free ubiquitin in their brains to those detected in the brains of wild-type mice (Figure 2A ). In addition, in the HA-ubiquitin mice HA-ubiquitin appears to be efficiently incorporated into substrates (Figures 2A and 2B). We crossed HA-ubiquitin transgenic mice with wild-type or Ube3A knockout mice and immunoprecipitated HA-ubiquitinated proteins from brain lysates of these mice. We then compared ubiquitinated proteins in wild-type and Ube3A knockout mice using quantitative mass spectrometry. We reasoned that if a given protein were a substrate of Ube3A, then in the absence of Ube3A it would be less ubiquitinated and thus less efficiently precipitated with anti-HA antibodies. We therefore sought to identify HA-ubiquitinated proteins whose abundance was decreased in Ube3A knockout mice. We identified the protein Sacsin as a candidate Ube3A substrate. We found peptides corresponding to ubiquitinated Sacsin in brain lysates of wild-type but not Ube3A knockout mice, suggesting that Sacsin might not be efficiently ubiquitinated in the absence of Ube3A (Figure 2C). Sacsin is of interest as it is mutated in Charelvoix-Saguenay spastic ataxia, a neurological disorder with similarities to AS (Engert et al., 2000Engert J.C. Bérubé P. Mercier J. Doré C. Lepage P. Ge B. Bouchard J.P. Mathieu J. Melançon S.B. Schalling M. et al.ARSACS, a spastic ataxia common in northeastern Québec, is caused by mutations in a new gene encoding an 11.5-kb ORF.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, little is known about Sacsin's role in nervous system development and the large size of the Sacsin protein suggested it would be difficult to study. Nevertheless, we found that Sacsin has a 75 amino acid stretch that has similarity to a previously identified Ube3A substrate HHR23A (Figure 2D). This region of homology corresponds to a well-characterized region of HHR23A consisting of five amphipathic helices, suggesting that the corresponding region in Sacsin may have a similar structure (Kamionka and Feigon, 2004Kamionka M. Feigon J. Structure of the XPC binding domain of hHR23A reveals hydrophobic patches for protein interaction.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2370-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As the specificity of ubiquitin ligases is most strongly determined by substrate binding, we hypothesized that this region of similarity between Sacsin and HHR23A might serve as a Ube3A binding domain (UBD) that might be present in other Ube3A targets. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant form of HHR23A (ΔHHR23A) that lacks the UBD and assessed its ability to interact with, and be ubiquitinated by Ube3A. While wild-type HHR23A efficiently interacts with Ube3A, mutation of the UBD in HHR23A blocks this interaction (Figure 2E). Likewise, this domain is required for Ube3A to ubiquitinate HHR23A (data not shown). These results suggest the existence of a motif on Ube3A substrates that mediates binding to Ube3A. A search of mammalian genomes for proteins that contain the UBD identified proteins including the synaptic protein Arc and the RhoGEF ephexin 5 as potential Ube3A substrates (Figure 3A ) (S.S. Margolis and M.E.G., unpublished data). We focused our attention on Arc as Arc regulates the trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) type of glutamate receptors at synapses (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S.

If Arc is a substrate of Ube3A, such a finding could potentially begin to explain Ube3A's role in synaptic function. Furthermore, like Ube3A, Arc transcription is regulated by neuronal activity through the action of MEF2 family transcription factors (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two proteins might function together in response to synaptic activation. To assess whether Arc is a Ube3A substrate, we asked whether Arc and Ube3A interact. Purified Arc binds Ube3A in a manner that is dependent upon the UBD within Arc (Figures 3B and 3C). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using mouse brain extracts confirmed that Arc and Ube3A also interact in the intact brain (Figure S2A). We then performed in vitro ubiquitination assays using purified recombinant proteins. Ube3A ubiquitinated Arc in vitro but did not ubiquitinate the control proteins p53 or MeCP2 (Scheffner et al., 1993Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. The HPV-16 E6 and E6-AP complex functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase in the ubiquitination of p53.Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar) (Figure 3D and data not shown). A catalytically inactive form of Ube3A (Ube3A C833A) was incapable of catalyzing the ubiquitination of Arc (Kumar et al., 1999Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. Identification of HHR23A as a substrate for E6-associated protein-mediated ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (data not shown and see below). To test whether Ube3A promotes the ubiquitination of Arc within cells, we transfected HEK293T cells with Arc and either Ube3A C833A or wild-type Ube3A. Coexpression of wild-type Ube3A, but not Ube3A C833A, led to a decrease in the level of Arc (Figure 3E). Incubation of transfected HEK293T cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked Ube3A-mediated degradation of Arc, suggesting that Ube3A degrades Arc via the ubiquitin proteasome (Figure S2B). The ubiquitination of Arc by Ube3A was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Figures S2C and S2D). We next compared Arc expression in the brains of wild-type and Ube3A knockout mice. As the expression of both Ube3A and Arc is enhanced by neuronal activity, we exposed the mice to kainic acid or an enriched environment to boost the levels of Ube3A and Arc protein. Under these conditions, we detect higher levels of Arc protein in Ube3A knockout mice than in wild-type controls (Figures 3F–3H). These findings suggest that Ube3A ubiquitination of Arc in the wild-type brain contributes to Arc degradation. In contrast to Arc, the activity-dependent phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator MeCP2 and the induction of the activity-regulated transcription factor NPAS4 are similar in wild-type and Ube3A knockout brains, suggesting that the increase in Arc in Ube3A knockout mouse brain is not the result of an overall increase in the activity-dependent gene response (Figure 3F and data not shown) (Zhou et al., 2006Zhou Z.

In CML-BC, but not chronic phase (CML-CP) CD34+ bone marrow (BM) progenitors, hnRNP E2 is highly expressed and, upon interaction with the C-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of CEBPA mRNA, suppresses translation (Chang et al., 2007Chang J.S.

Disruption of differentiation in human cancer: AML shows the way.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). hnRNP E2 RNA-binding activity does not require posttranslational modifications, and its expression is transiently induced by cytokines (e.g., IL-3) in myeloid precursors (Chang et al., 2007Chang J.S. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Neviani P. Eiring A.M. Briercheck E. Ronchetti M. Roy D.C. Calabretta B. Caligiuri M.A. Perrotti D.

Nonetheless, the early stages of myelopoiesis are characterized by cytokine-dependent proliferation and C/EBPα-mediated differentiation, suggesting that the hnRNP E2:CEBPA interaction might be prevented by a hnRNP E2-interacting protein or RNA, or by another RBP interacting with the CEBPA 5′UTR. Because small noncoding RNAs are regulators of critical cell functions including normal and leukemic hematopoiesis (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar, Garzon et al., 2006Garzon R. Fabbri M. Cimmino A. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. MicroRNA expression and function in cancer.Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that differentiation arrest of myeloid CML-BC blasts results from impaired expression of a microRNA (miRNA) that, in addition to exerting its gene silencing activity through canonical binding to mRNA regulatory regions (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: Target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14320) Google Scholar, Friedman et al., 2009Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar), also strongly competes with CEBPA mRNA for binding to hnRNP E2. Here, we report the existence of miRNA-dependent posttranslational control of biological processes through both base pairing with complementary mRNAs and sequence-dependent interference with the mRNA-regulatory function of RNA-binding proteins (decoy activity). Comparative miRNA arrays revealed that a discrete number of miRNAs were more than 3-fold modulated in a BCR/ABL dose- and kinase-dependent manner in cell line models and patient-derived myeloid CML-BCCD34+ versus CML-CPCD34+ BM progenitors (not shown). Among the miRNAs downregulated in CML-BCCD34+, we focused on miR-328 because its mature form harbors a C-rich element that resembles the negative regulatory hnRNP E2-binding site contained in the CEBPA intercistronic mRNA region (Figure 1A). Northern blot and qRT-PCR analyses confirmed that miR-328 downregulation is markedly induced by BCR/ABL expression in 32Dcl3 myeloid precursors (32D-BCR/ABL) and primary lineage-negative (Lin−) mouse BM cells (Figure 1B). Reduction of miR-328 expression depends on BCR/ABL kinase activity as imatinib treatment (2 μM; 24 hr) significantly increased miR-328 expression in 32D-BCR/ABL and K562 cells (Figure 1B), as well as in Lin− BM cells from leukemic SCLtTA-BCR/ABL mice (n = 3/group) (Figure 1C). As expected, imatinib did not rescue miR-328 levels in imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL(T315I) cells (not shown). Finally, miR-328 expression was also significantly reduced in myeloid CML-BCCD34+ (n = 6) compared to CML-CPCD34+ (n = 6) BM patient cells (Figure 1C), suggesting its possible involvement in blastic transformation. To determine whether the C-rich element present in mature miR-328 is a bona fide hnRNP E2-binding site, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA), UV crosslinking, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were performed using maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged hnRNP E2 (MBP-hnRNP E2), 32D-BCR/ABL cytoplasmic cell lysates expressing high levels of hnRNP E2 (Perrotti et al., 2002Perrotti D. Cesi V. Trotta R. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Campbell K. Iervolino A. Condorelli F. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Caligiuri M.A. Calabretta B. BCR-ABL suppresses C/EBPalpha expression through inhibitory action of hnRNP E2.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and/or lysates of 32Dcl3 and 32D-BCR/ABL cells expressing a Flag-tagged hnRNP E2. REMSA (Figure 2A and Figure S1A available online) and UV crosslinking (Figure 2B) revealed that a 32P-labeled miR-328 oligoribonucleotide efficiently formed a complex with recombinant, endogenous, and ectopic hnRNP E2 proteins but not with MBP alone or lysates of 32Dcl3 cells. Accordingly, the mobility of hnRNP E2:miR-328 complexes was identical to that formed using the uORF/spacer region of CEBPA mRNA (CEBPA uORF) oligoribonucleotide (Figures 2A and 2B), and miR-328 binding to hnRNP E2 was four times stronger than that of CEBPA uORF (Figure 2A). By contrast, the BCR/ABL-regulated miR-330, which is not C-rich, neither interacted with hnRNP E2 nor disturbed hnRNP E2:miR-328 complex formation (Figures 2A and 2B). miR-328 and CEBPA uORF binding to endogenous hnRNP E2 was also impaired by imatinib (Figure 2A) that, reportedly, inhibits hnRNP E2 expression in BCR/ABL+ cells (Chang et al., 2007Chang J.S.

To determine whether hnRNP E2:miR-328 interaction requires integrity of the miRNA seed sequence (Figure 2B, underlined nucleotides) that, as known, is essential for canonical miRNA:mRNA target interaction, UV crosslinking assays were performed using 32D-BCR/ABL and 32D-Flag-E2 lysates, as well as a miR-328 oligoribonucleotide harboring a mutated seed sequence that retains the wild-type C-rich character (miR-328-Mut) (Figure 2B). As shown (Figure 2B), miR-328-Mut binds both endogenous and ectopic hnRNP E2 at higher affinity than wild-type miR-328, suggesting that the C-rich character rather than the seed sequence is important for hnRNP E2 interaction. Furthermore, the hnRNP E2:miR-328 interaction was also demonstrated in living cells by RIP assay. In fact, endogenous miR-328 was found associated with endogenous hnRNP E2 in anti-hnRNP E2 but not anti-IgG immunoprecipitates (IP) from imatinib-treated 32D-BCR/ABL cells (Figure 2C). As expected, no binding was detected in untreated IL-3-cultured 32D-BCR/ABL cells (Figure 2C). Ectopic expression of miR-328 at physiological levels (Figure 2D and Figure S1B) also resulted in complex formation with both ectopic (Figure S1C) and endogenous (Figures 2C and 2D and Figure S1D) hnRNP E2. Note that Flag-hnRNP E2 did not significantly alter total hnRNP E2 levels (Figure S1A) and that miR-328 binding to hnRNP E2 impaired (∼80% inhibition) hnRNP E2:CEBPA association (Figures 2D and 2E and Figure S1D). Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses performed on anti-hnRNP E2 RIPs revealed that 4.26% ± 0.56% (n = 3) of the total miR-328 was associated to hnRNP E2 (not shown). As expected, hnRNP E2 did not interact with either a BCR/ABL-induced mRNA (i.e., SET) or the endogenous C-rich miR-223 (Figure S1D). Accordingly, ectopic miR-181b did neither interact with hnRNP E2 nor significantly alter levels of the hnRNP E2:CEBPA complex (Figure 2E). Thus, miR-328 specifically competes with CEBPA mRNA for binding to hnRNP E2. To assess whether the hnRNP E2:miR-328 interaction occurs in the presence of major components of the RISC loading complex (Chendrimada et al., 2005Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. TRBP recruits the Dicer complex to Ago2 for microRNA processing and gene silencing.Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether hnRNP E2 is in complex with Dicer, Ago2, or TRBP2. Anti-hnRNP E2 and anti-Dicer (Figures 3A and 3B) coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments clearly show that hnRNP E2 did not interact with Dicer, TRBP2, or Ago2. Likewise, hnRNP E2 or Dicer immunodepletion did not alter levels of RISC components (Ago2 and TRBP2) or hnRNP E2, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). As expected, TRBP2 was readily detectable in anti-Dicer IPs (Figure 3B). Thus, hnRNP E2:miR-328 interaction does not appear to require association with RISC loading components. However, RIP assays revealed miR-328 in complex with both Dicer and Ago2 (Figure 3C), suggesting that miR-328 also functions as a silencer of mRNA targets in a canonical RISC-dependent manner and that, most likely, its binding to hnRNP E2 is not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the presence of readily detectable hnRNP E2:miR-328 complex in RIP assays on Dicer-immunodepleted lysates (Figure 3C, lane 5) suggests that miR-328 might interact with hnRNP E2 in a RISC-independent manner. As loss of miR-328 may influence the phenotype of CML-BC myeloid blasts, we evaluated proliferation, clonogenic potential, and G-CSF-driven differentiation in miR-328-transduced GFP+ BCR/ABL+ cell lines, BCR/ABL+ Lin− mouse BM, and/or CML-BCCD34+ cells. As controls, we assessed the effects of ectopic miR-328-Mut, miR-181b, and the myeloid differentiation-related (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) miR-223 in BCR/ABL+ cells. Of note, ectopic miR-328 or miR-223 levels in BCR/ABL+ cells were similar to those in nontransformed cells (Figure 2D and Figure S2A), thus excluding off-target effects due to overexpression. Although endogenous miR-328 (Figure 1) and, to a lower extent, miR-223 (Figure S2B) were downregulated in 32D-BCR/ABL and K562 cells, their ectopic expression did not have a significant effect on IL-3-dependent and/or -independent growth (Figure S2B). Likewise, ectopic miR-328 did not accelerate the kinetics of 32Dcl3 neutrophil maturation (Figure 4B), consistent with the barely detectable levels of hnRNP E2 in 32Dcl3 cells (Perrotti et al., 2002Perrotti D. Cesi V. Trotta R. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Campbell K. Iervolino A. Condorelli F. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Caligiuri M.A. Calabretta B. BCR-ABL suppresses C/EBPalpha expression through inhibitory action of hnRNP E2.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the increased expression of endogenous miR-328 in 32Dcl3, human CD34+ (n = 2) and mouse Lin−/Sca+/Kit+ (n = 3) BM (NBM) progenitors undergoing granulocytic differentiation (Figure 4A). Conversely, miR-328 levels were not significantly different in normal CD34+ BM cells before and after differentiation toward other hematopoietic lineages (Figure 4A). As expected (Fazi et al., 2005Fazi F. Rosa A. Fatica A. Gelmetti V. De Marchis M.L. Nervi C. Bozzoni I. A minicircuitry comprised of microRNA-223 and transcription factors NFI-A and C/EBPalpha regulates human granulopoiesis.Cell. 2005; 123: 819-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), miR-223 enhanced 32Dcl3 differentiation (not shown). In agreement with the potential role of miR-328 as an antagonist of hnRNP E2 differentiation inhibitory activity, forced expression of miR-328 at physiological levels (Figure 2D and Figure S2A) efficiently rescued granulocytic differentiation of newly established (15 days after BCR/ABL infection) 32D-BCR/ABL cells (Figure 4B). In fact, the majority (82.1% ± 3.9%) of miR-328-expressing 32D-BCR/ABL cells were postmitotic metamyelocytes, bands, and segmented neutrophils after 7 days of G-CSF-supplemented culture (Figure 4B). As expected, G-CSF-treated vector- and miR-181b-transduced BCR/ABL+ cells remained blasts (5.1% ± 0.5% and 11.0% ± 3.2% postmitotic cells) (Figure 4B). By contrast, miR-328-Mut expression efficiently induced 32D-BCR/ABL differentiation (88.6% ± 3.1% postmitotic cells) (Figure 4B). Although terminal differentiation was also a characteristic of miR-223-overexpressing 32D-BCR/ABL cells, only ectopic miR-328 but not miR-223 expression (Figure S2C) restored G-CSF-driven maturation of GFP+ CD34+ BM progenitors from myeloid CML-BC patients (n = 6) (Figure 4C). In fact, both miR-328- and miR-328-Mut-expressing CML-BCCD34+ BM cultures became bands and segmented neutrophils (88.8% ± 2.4% and 85.2% ± 4.2% postmitotic cells) after 10 days in rhG-CSF (25 ng/ml). By contrast, morphology of miR-223-expressing CML-BCCD34+ (n = 6) progenitors remained similar to untransduced cells (n = 6), appearing arrested at the myeloblast stage after 7–10 days in G-CSF-containing medium (16.9% ± 1.7% postmitotic cells) (Figure 4C) with unchanged levels of the granulocyte/macrophage markers CD11b or CD14 (not shown). Consistent with the essential role of C/EBPα in neutrophil maturation of BCR/ABL+ blasts (Ferrari-Amorotti et al., 2006Ferrari-Amorotti G. Keeshan K. Zattoni M. Guerzoni C. Iotti G. Cattelani S.

USA. 2006; 103: 6338-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), C/EBPα expression was readily detectable in miR-223- and miR-328-transduced 32D-BCR/ABL myeloid precursors, and in miR-328- but not miR-223-expressing CML-BCCD34+ BM progenitors and miR-181b-expressing 32D-BCR/ABL cells (Figure 4E). This was dependent neither on hnRNP E2 downregulation (Figure 4E) nor on increased CEBPA mRNA levels (Figure 4F and Figure S2C). In agreement with its ability to bind hnRNP E2, miR-328-Mut also restored C/EBPα expression (Figure 4E), indicating that the differentiation-promoting effects of miR-328 do not result from the seed sequence-dependent silencing of miR-328 mRNA targets. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker of granulocyte/macrophage commitment and a direct transcriptional target of C/EBPα (Rosmarin et al., 1989Rosmarin A.G. Weil S.C. Rosner G.L. Griffin J.D.

Finally, the dissimilar response of miR-223-transduced 32D-BCR/ABL versus CML-BCCD34+ progenitors to G-CSF might depend on differences in the mechanism(s) controlling expression of NFI-A (Figure S2D), a miR-223-negative regulator (Fazi et al., 2005Fazi F. Rosa A. Fatica A. Gelmetti V. De Marchis M.L. Nervi C. Bozzoni I.

As hnRNP E2:miR-328 binding in vitro is more efficient than that of CEBPA uORF (Figure 2), and miR-328 expression antagonizes hnRNP E2:CEBPA interaction (Figures 2D and 2E) most likely by competing for binding to hnRNP E2, it is plausible that miR-328 releases CEBPA from the translation inhibitory effects of hnRNP E2. Thus, we assessed the effect of miR-328 on CEBPA translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in an in vivo mouse model of myeloid CML-BC. In the latter, BCR/ABL+ cell differentiation is driven solely by ectopic C/EBPα expression, which is under the control of its uORF/spacer mRNA element (Chang et al., 2007Chang J.S. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Neviani P. Eiring A.M. Briercheck E. Ronchetti M. Roy D.C. Calabretta B. Caligiuri M.A. Perrotti D. High levels of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein are required for the MAPK-hnRNP E2 dependent suppression of C/EBPalpha-driven myeloid differentiation.Blood. 2007; 110: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As reported (Perrotti et al., 2002Perrotti D. Cesi V. Trotta R. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Campbell K. Iervolino A. Condorelli F. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Caligiuri M.A. Calabretta B. BCR-ABL suppresses C/EBPalpha expression through inhibitory action of hnRNP E2.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), translation of CEBPA mRNA was markedly impaired (∼80% inhibition) in in vitro translation reactions programmed with a CEBPA construct containing the uORF/spacer intercistronic region (pcDNA3-WT-uORF-C/EBPα) and the recombinant fusion protein MBP-hnRNP E2 (Figure 5A) but not when performed in the absence of exogenous hnRNP E2 (Figure 5A). Addition of 1000-fold excess of mature miR-328 but not miR-330 resulted in an almost 100% increase of newly synthesized 35S-C/EBPα protein (CEBPA+hnRNP E2 versus CEBPA+hnRNP E2+miR-328; p < 0.005) (Figure 5A). Note that addition of miR-328 in the absence of MBP-hnRNP E2 did not significantly affect CEBPA mRNA translation (Figure 5A). Moreover, the large amount of MBP-hnRNP E2 (Figure 5A) might justify the incomplete rescue of CEBPA translation. To assess whether forced miR-328 expression rescues neutrophilic maturation of differentiation-arrested BCR/ABL+ blasts through restoration of CEBPA mRNA translation, we used the aberrant 32D-BCR/ABL long-term cultured 6.15 cell clone that exhibits extremely high levels of BCR/ABL and hnRNP E2 but is unable to undergo G-CSF-driven differentiation due to transcriptional suppression of CEBPα expression (Figure 5C). Indeed, 6.15 cells completely rely on translation of ectopic CEBPA mRNA for differentiation. Thus, parental and 6.15 cells expressing a GFP-WT-uORF/spacer-C/EBPα (6.15-WT-uORF), which contains the hnRNP E2 translation inhibitory element, were retrovirally transduced with the pSUPERIOR-retro-puro-miR-328 (6.15-WT-uORF-miR-328) or with the empty vector (6.15-WT-uORF-pSUP). Differentiation assays confirmed that the ability of miR-328 to induce neutrophil maturation is dependent on and mediated by the presence of CEBPA mRNA, as expression of miR-328 in parental 6.15 cells failed to rescue differentiation, whereas 91.7% ± 6.4% of 6.15-WT-uORF-miR-328 cells were postmitotic after 7 days of culture in G-CSF (Figure 5B). Furthermore, forced miR-328 expression neither decreased hnRNP E2 protein nor increased CEBPA mRNA levels (Figure 5C), suggesting that the restoration of C/EBPα protein expression in 6.15-WT-uORF-miR-328 cells (Figure 5C) results from the ability of miR-328 to interfere with hnRNP E2 translation inhibitory activity. Accordingly, anti-hnRNP E2 RIP assays performed with 6.15-WT-uORF-pSUP and 6.15-WT-uORF-miR-328 lysates revealed that miR-328 expression and, therefore, formation of the hnRNP E2:miR-328 complex (Figure 5D) markedly decreased levels of the hnRNP E2-bound CEBPA mRNA (Figure 5D). To determine whether miR-328 influences the CML-BC-like disease process induced by transplantation of BCR/ABL-expressing cells, SCID mice (n = 13 per group) were intravenously injected with 6.15-WT-uORF-miR-328 or 6.15-WT-uORF-pSUP cells (5 × 105 GFP+-puromycin-selected cells/mouse), and engraftment was assessed 1 week later by nested RT-PCR-mediated BCR/ABL detection in peripheral blood (not shown). After 3 weeks, three mice/group were sacrificed for visual and histopathologic examination of hematopoietic organs and for flow cytometric quantification of GFP+/GR1+ differentiated BM cells. Consistent with the almost complete hnRNP E2-dependent translational inhibition of C/EBPα expression in 6.15-WT-uORF cells (Chang et al., 2007Chang J.S. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Neviani P. Eiring A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1986514504,"Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces varied early outcomes, ranging from resistance to infection to progressive disease. Here we report results from a forward genetic screen in zebrafish larvae that identify multiple mutant classes with distinct patterns of innate susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum. A hypersusceptible mutant maps to the lta4h locus encoding leukotriene A(4) hydrolase, which catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), a potent chemoattractant and proinflammatory eicosanoid. lta4h mutations confer hypersusceptibility independent of LTB(4) reduction, by redirecting eicosanoid substrates to anti-inflammatory lipoxins. The resultant anti-inflammatory state permits increased mycobacterial proliferation by limiting production of tumor necrosis factor. In humans, we find that protection from both tuberculosis and multibacillary leprosy is associated with heterozygosity for LTA4H polymorphisms that have previously been correlated with differential LTB(4) production. Our results suggest conserved roles for balanced eicosanoid production in vertebrate resistance to mycobacterial infection."

Naegleria's genome sequence suggests a versatile and complex ancestral eukaryote The genome encodes both aerobic and anaerobic hydrogen-producing metabolism We predict novel evolutionarily conserved genes associated with amoeboid motility Genomic comparisons identify 4133 protein families likely ancestral to all eukaryotes Eukaryotes emerged and diversified at least a billion years ago (Brinkmann and Philippe, 2007Brinkmann H. Philippe H. The diversity of eukaryotes and the root of the eukaryotic tree.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 607: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), radiating into new niches by taking advantage of their metabolic, cytoskeletal, and compartmental complexity. Descendants of half a dozen deeply divergent, major eukaryotic clades survive, including diverse protists along with the more familiar plants, animals, and fungi. These contemporary species retain some ancestral eukaryotic features along with novelties specific to their particular lineages. Here we report the genome sequence of Naegleria gruberi, the first from a free-living member of a major eukaryotic group that includes the pathogenic trypanosomatids. With the addition of Naegleria, five out of the six major eukaryotic clades now have genome sequence from free-living organisms. This is crucial as the genomes of obligate parasites are thought to be derived by gene loss and high sequence divergence (Carlton et al., 2007Carlton J.M. Hirt R.P. Silva J.C. Delcher A.L. Schatz M. Zhao Q. Wortman J.R. Bidwell S.L. Alsmark U.C.

Comparing the gene sets of diverse eukaryotes reveals thousands of genes present early in eukaryotic evolution and also provides a new understanding of Naegleria's remarkable versatility. Naegleria gruberi is a free-living heterotrophic protist commonly found in both aerobic and microaerobic environments in freshwater and in moist soils around the world (De Jonckheere, 2002De Jonckheere J.F. A century of research on the amoeboflagellate genus Naegleria.Acta Protozool. 2002; 41: 309-342Google Scholar, Fulton, 1970Fulton C.

Naegleria: A research partner for cell and developmental biology.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 520-532Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Its predominant form is a 15 μm amoeba that can reproduce every 1.6 hr when eating bacteria. Yet Naegleria is best known for its remarkably quick (<1.5 hr) differentiation from amoebae to transitory streamlined flagellates with two anterior 9+2 flagella (Figure 1) (Fulton, 1993Fulton C. Naegleria: A research partner for cell and developmental biology.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 520-532Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This change includes de novo assembly of an entire cytoplasmic microtubule cytoskeleton, including canonical basal bodies (Figure 1) (Fulton, 1993Fulton C. Naegleria: A research partner for cell and developmental biology.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 520-532Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Naegleria also forms resting cysts, which excyst to produce amoebae (Fulton, 1970Fulton C. Amebo-flagellates as research partners: The laboratory biology of Naegleria and Tetramitus.Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 341-346Google Scholar). Amoebae divide with neither nuclear envelope breakdown nor centrioles (Fulton, 1993Fulton C. Naegleria: A research partner for cell and developmental biology.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 520-532Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Naegleria belongs to Heterolobosea, a major eukaryotic lineage that, together with the distantly related Euglenozoa (which include parasitic trypanosomes) and Jakobid flagellates, comprise the ancient and ecologically diverse clade termed “JEH” for Jakobids, Euglenozoa, Heterolobosea (Figure 2) (Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al., 2007Rodriguez-Ezpeleta N. Brinkmann H. Burger G. Roger A.J. Gray M.W. Philippe H. Lang B.F. Toward resolving the eukaryotic tree: The phylogenetic positions of jakobids and cercozoans.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1420-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Within Heterolobosea, the genus Naegleria encompasses as much evolutionary diversity as the tetrapods (based on rDNA divergence; Fulton, 1993Fulton C. Naegleria: A research partner for cell and developmental biology.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 520-532Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and includes the “brain-eating amoeba” N. fowleri, which, although usually free-living in warm freshwater, is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause fatal meningoencephalitis in humans (Visvesvara et al., 2007Visvesvara G.S. Moura H. Schuster F.L. Pathogenic and opportunistic free-living amoebae: Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris, Naegleria fowleri, and Sappinia diploidea.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 50: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Although the position of the root of the eukaryotic tree remains controversial, three major hypotheses have emerged (Figure 2 and Text S1) (Ciccarelli et al., 2006Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. von Mering C. Creevey C.J. Snel B. Bork P.

Rooting the eukaryote tree by using a derived gene fusion.Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In each hypothesis, Naegleria represents a critical taxon for comparative studies, alternately by being the first sequenced amoeboid bikont (Figure 2, Root A), by allowing analysis of free-living descendants of an early common ancestor (Figure 2, Root B), or by allowing analysis of free-living descendants of every major eukaryotic group via uniting JEH and POD (a monophyletic group encompassing Parabasalids, Oxymonads, and Diplomonads) into the Excavates (Figure 2, Root C). By parsimony, features shared between Naegleria and another major eukaryotic group likely existed in their common ancestor. These features would have been present early in eukaryotic evolution (i.e., before the divergence of the major eukaryotic groups that share those features; Figure 2) and perhaps in the ancestor of all eukaryotes. For example, Naegleria and humans (members of opisthokonts) diverged early (Figure 2 inset, green highlighting), so their common features were likely present by this time. (Lateral gene transfer [LGT] between eukaryotes may be the source of some shared genes, yet it is infrequent; Keeling and Palmer, 2008Keeling P.J. Palmer J.D. Horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotic evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar.) What was the core eukaryotic gene repertoire and how did it arise and diversify? To date, eukaryotic genome sequencing has focused on opisthokonts and multicellular plants, as well as obligate parasitic protists (which tend to be genomically streamlined), although a number of free-living protists have been sequenced (e.g., Dictyostelium [Eichinger et al., 2005Eichinger L.

Several of these free-living protists are descendants of additional symbiosis events, so gene transfer from organellar to nuclear genomes may obscure gene ancestry. Previous phylogenomic comparisons of eukaryotes have been limited to species from two or three major groups (centered on opisthokonts and plants) (Hartman and Fedorov, 2002Hartman H. Fedorov A. The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1420-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Tatusov et al., 2003Tatusov R.L. Fedorova N.D.

Nikolskaya A.N. et al.The COG database: an updated version includes eukaryotes.BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar). Our genomic analysis includes all six major eukaryotic groups with genome sequences (circled “G”s in Figure 2): opisthokonts, amoebozoa, plants, chromalveolates, JEH (now including free-living Naegleria), and POD (in which all sequenced species are obligate parasites). Analyses of individual genome sequences have tended to focus on known genes and protein domains in single taxa. Our analysis identifies both known and unknown eukaryotic gene families, begins to map out previously unexplored areas of eukaryotic biology, and highlights gene loss in every major lineage. Furthermore, we substantially extend the idea that early eukaryotes possessed extensive trafficking, cytoskeletal, sexual, metabolic, signaling, and regulatory modules (Dacks and Field, 2007Dacks J.B.

We also generate a catalog of genes specifically associated with amoeboid motility and identify an unusual capacity for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Most importantly, the degree to which diverse gene families are shared among diverse major groups reveals an unexpectedly complex and versatile ancestral eukaryote. We assembled the 41 million base pair N. gruberi genome from ∼8-fold redundant coverage of random paired-end shotgun sequence using genomic DNA prepared from an axenic, asexual culture of the NEG-M strain (ATCC 30224) (Fulton, 1974Fulton C. Axenic cultivation of Naegleria gruberi. Requirement for methionine.Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 88: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Naegleria has at least 12 chromosomes (Figure S1A) and only 5.1% repetitive sequence (Extended Experimental Procedures and Table S1). The genome is a mosaic of heterozygous and homozygous regions (Figure S1A). Heterozygous regions showing two distinct haplotypes are found across 71% of the assembly, with a mean single-nucleotide polymorphism frequency of 0.58%. The geometric distribution of variation in these polymorphic regions (Figure S1D) is consistent with the two haplotypes being randomly sampled from an interbreeding population (Nordborg, 2003Nordborg M. Coalescent theory.in: Balding D.J. Bishop M. Cannings C. Handbook of statistical genetics. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2003Google Scholar). This implies a history of sexual recombination, despite recent clonal propagation in the laboratory. The remaining 29% of the genome comprises segments of up to hundreds of kilobases with little or no polymorphism. Assuming these homozygous regions are identical by descent, they could plausibly have arisen by gene conversion and/or inbreeding. Superimposed on the probable sexual history suggested by the geometric distribution of polymorphic variation, a genome duplication occurred in culture (Fulton, 1970Fulton C.

In addition to its nuclear genome, NEG-M has ∼4000 copies of a sequenced extrachromosomal plasmid that encodes rDNA (Clark and Cross, 1987Clark C.G.

We predicted 15,727 protein-coding genes spanning 57.8% of the genome by combining ab initio and homology-based methods with 32,811 EST sequences (Tables S2 and S3). The assembly accounts for over 99% of the ESTs, affirming its near completeness. Nearly two-thirds (10,095) of the predicted genes are supported by EST, homology, and/or Pfam evidence. The remaining 5632 genes may be novel, diverged, poorly predicted, or have low expression. At least 191 Naegleria genes (1%) have homology to bacterial and/or archaeal but not eukaryotic genes, making them candidates for LGT (or loss in other eukaryotic lineages). The number of potential LGT events is not unusual for free-living or parasitic protists (Armbrust et al., 2004Armbrust E.V. Berges J.A. Bowler C. Green B.R. Martinez D. Putnam N.H. Zhou S. Allen A.E.

Phylogenetic analysis placed 45 of the Naegleria sequences in a prokaryotic clade with good bootstrap support, consistent with LGT from prokaryotes (yet coming from multiple phyla; Table S4). Although most LGT candidate genes have unknown function, several have predicted metabolic function (including a molybdopterin/thiamine biosynthesis family protein) (Table S4). Naegleria has many of the key features that distinguish eukaryotic cells from Bacteria and Archaea (Text S2). These features include complete actin and microtubule cytoskeletons (Tables S5 and S6 and Figure S4), extensive meiotic, DNA replication, and transcriptional machinery (Tables S7, S8, S9, and S10 and see below), calcium/calmodulin-mediated regulation (Table S11), transcription factors (Iyer et al., 2008Iyer L.M.

Parasitol. 2008; 38: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), endosymbiotic organelles (mitochondria), and organelles of the membrane-trafficking system (although it lacks visible Golgi, Naegleria contains the required genes; Dacks et al., 2003Dacks J.B.

Sci. 2003; 270: S168-S171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Table S12). Additionally, Naegleria contains thousands more spliceosomal introns than parasitic JEH species such as Trypanosoma brucei (Table 1), which is consistent with other reports of parasitic JEH and POD taxa losing introns (Archibald et al., 2002Archibald J.M. O'Kelly C.J. Doolittle W.F. The chaperonin genes of jakobid and jakobid-like flagellates: implications for eukaryotic evolution.Mol. Biol.

A high density of ancient spliceosomal introns in oxymonad excavates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2006; 6: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Naegleria's introns include those in precisely orthologous positions in species from other eukaryotic groups (Text S2). The coding potential of the Naegleria genome clearly supports the early origin of all these eukaryotic hallmarks. The sexuality of some protists, including N. gruberi, remains enigmatic. Although many protists appear asexual, recent studies have indicated that most meiosis-specific genes were already present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes (Ramesh et al., 2005Ramesh M.A. Malik S.B. Logsdon Jr., J.M. A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 185-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These genes are present in Naegleria as well (Table S7). Strain NEG-M, and its parent NEG, have been maintained in the laboratory since 1967 without observing any sign of sex. However, NEG-M's heterozygosity suggests that N. gruberi NEG is the product of a mating. NEG is one of a cluster of independent globally distributed isolates with consistent heterozygosity for electrophoretic variants of several enzymes (Robinson et al., 1992Robinson B.S. Christy P. Hayes S.J. Dobson P.J. Discontinuous genetic variation among mesophilic Naegleria isolates: further evidence that N. gruberi is not a single species.J. Protozool. 1992; 39: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a pattern that suggests asexual propagation of a widespread “natural clone” rather than frequent sexual recombination (Tibayrenc et al., 1990Tibayrenc M. Kjellberg F. Ayala F.J. A clonal theory of parasitic protozoa: the population structures of Entamoeba, Giardia, Leishmania, Naegleria, Plasmodium, Trichomonas, and Trypanosoma and their medical and taxonomical consequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2414-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The heterozygosity found in Naegleria is typical of a sexual organism, with perhaps infrequent matings. Additionally, identification of the core RNAi machinery indicates that Naegleria may use this mechanism (Table S13). Perhaps these results will encourage the discovery of conditions that induce sexuality or RNAi in N. gruberi and thus bring genetic analysis to this organism. Like many microbial eukaryotes, Naegleria oxidizes glucose, various amino acids, and fatty acids via the Krebs cycle and a branched mitochondrial respiratory chain using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor (Figure S2; Table S14; Text S3). However, Naegleria's genome also encodes features of an elaborate and sophisticated anaerobic metabolism (Figure 3; Figure S2; Text S3) including (1) substrate-level phosphorylation reactions of the type commonly found in microaerophilic eukaryotes such as Entamoeba, Giardia, and Trichomonas (Hug et al., 2009Hug L.A.

This network then yielded to a molecular description of the host cell functional modules that were both engaged and perturbed by the pathogen. Importantly, a subscreen against a panel of field isolates revealed that the molecular composition of the host interface varied with both genotype and the phenotypic properties of the pathogen.

A genome-wide siRNA screen identified host factors regulating M. tuberculosis infection These factors define various functional modules of the host human macrophage A core set of regulatory factors were identified with a panel of Mtb field isolates These core host cell factors predominantly function in the regulation of autophagy Tuberculosis continues to prevail as the major cause of mortality around the world, despite implementation of control programs and the availability of effective drugs. The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an obligate human pathogen that primarily targets macrophages. After infection, intracellular mycobacteria are predominantly distributed between the early and late phagosomal compartments, with some also escaping into the cytoplasm (van der Wel et al., 2007van der Wel N. Hava D. Houben D. Fluitsma D. van Zon M. Pierson J. Brenner M. Peters P.J. M. tuberculosis and M. leprae translocate from the phagolysosome to the cytosol in myeloid cells.Cell. 2007; 129: 1287-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Their survival in the hostile intracellular milieu is facilitated through the dynamic modulation of a range of cellular processes. These include inhibition of pathways involved in the fusion of the phagosome with lysozomes, antigen presentation, apoptosis, and the activation of bactericidal responses (Koul et al., 2004Koul A. Herget T. Klebl B. Ullrich A. Interplay between mycobacteria and host signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In addition, manipulation of the host cellular machinery also provides for access to essential nutrients (Pandey and Sassetti, 2008Pandey A.K. Sassetti C.M. Mycobacterial persistence requires the utilization of host cholesterol.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A nutritive view on the host-pathogen interplay.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). While this pervasive influence clearly supports that the pathogen engages the molecular components of the cell in a broad network of interactions (Young et al., 2008Young D. Stark J. Kirschner D. Systems biology of persistent infection: tuberculosis as a case study.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the details of this network are yet incomplete. In this connection, mycobacterial interference with the host signaling machinery has been extensively studied and pathways that are attenuated to enable the infection have been defined. The focus of these investigations, however, has been primarily restricted to events regulating pathogen entry and subsequent endocytosis (Koul et al., 2004Koul A. Herget T. Klebl B. Ullrich A. Interplay between mycobacteria and host signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, Vergne et al., 2004Vergne I. Chua J. Singh S.B.

The larger issue of mechanisms that mediate stabilization of the infection has remained unexplored. To identify host factors regulating an established infection, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen against host proteins in human cells that were first infected with a virulent strain of Mtb. Several host factors were identified whose expression levels proved critical for maintenance of the intracellular pathogen load. An analysis of these targets with their functional associations yielded a comprehensive description of the host molecular interface, and its constituent functional modules, that involved in crosstalk with the intracellular pathogen. By employing a panel of diverse field isolates, we also probed how this interface responded to the broad diversification in mechanisms of pathogenesis that Mtb exhibits in the human population. Surprisingly, the host determinants of intracellular pathogen load varied significantly across the isolates, suggesting that the clade identity of Mtb has an important bearing on defining its host factor dependencies. Nonetheless, by integrating the results, we could extract the obligate—host-specified—survival axis that was independent of the adaptive variations that the pathogen exploits in the field. Interestingly, this axis was largely comprised of members that regulated the process of autophagy. We employed the SMARTPool human whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library to target a total of 18,174 genes as a mixture of four siRNAs per target gene. Human macrophage-like THP-1 cells were first infected with H37Rv and then transfected with individual, target-specific, siRNA (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). This protocol ensured that interaction of Mtb with the target cell and its subsequent uptake through the endocytic pathway were unhindered. Consequently, our screen selected for those host factors that were involved in the regulation of an established infection. The effect of siRNA treatment on the intracellular mycobacterial load was determined from subsequently generated cell lysates, in terms of the colony forming units (CFUs) obtained.Figure S1Data for Standardization of Experimental Conditions, Related to Figure 1Show full captionPanel A shows THP-1 cells infected with H37Rv for either 6, 24, or 48 hr.

At each of these time points cells were harvested, lysed, and the level of GAPDH protein in the cytoplasm detected by Western blot analysis. Some of the known molecules that induce apoptosis in cells upon knockdown by siRNA were tested for their effects on PMA differentiated THP-1 cells. The list of genes was selected from multiple siRNA screens and we used HeLa cells (red) as positive control to compare relative induction of apoptosis upon siRNA treatment (Panel D). On the right hand side in Panel D, indicated combinations of siRNA pools against two of these targets were employed in THP-1 cells. In all cases the effect of siRNA treament on apoptosis of the target cells was determined. In comparison with HeLa cells, THP-1 cells were significantly more resistant to the induction of apoptosis by any of the individual siRNA pools. The simultaneous knock-down of two separate targets, however, produced a synergistic effect (Panel D). Average CFU counts from multiple siRNA controls are compared in the table in Panel E.

For the top scoring ‘Hits’ nearly 80% of them were common between the two levels of screens while for the lower scoring ones this number was 77%. The primary screen identified 1138 target proteins in which silencing led to either an increase, or a decrease, in mycobacterial CFU values that was greater than 1.5 standard deviations (SD) from the mean. A secondary screen further shortlisted on the basis of reproducibility of results, and the resulting 509 targets were then subjected to a tertiary screen in which only those siRNA pools in which the change in CFU value was greater than 2 SD of the mean CFU value obtained for the control wells were selected (Figure 1B). This iterative procedure (see the Extended Experimental Procedures) short-listed 329 siRNA pools (Table S1A). To next filter out “off-target” effects of siRNA, we rescreened the four siRNAs from each of the 329 target-specific pools separately to determine the number of individual siRNAs from each pool that retained a positive score (i.e., >2 SD of mean control value). For 106 of these, all of the four individual siRNAs scored positive, whereas for 88 pools this number was three. Further, two of the four individual siRNAs in 81 pools produced a significant effect, whereas this was true for only one siRNA in an additional set of 19 pools. For the remaining 35 pools, however, none of the individual siRNAs gave a positive result, thus identifying this latter group as clear false positives (Table S1B). We only took as validated those cases in which the results with the parent pool were reproduced by at least two of its constituent siRNAs, thus yielding a short list of 275 siRNA pools (Figure 1B and Table S1B). Of these, silencing with 270 led to a significant reduction in the intracellular mycobacterial load, while that with the remaining five pools yielded an enhanced CFU count (Figure 2A ). A subsequent microarray analysis of the gene expression profile in uninfected THP-1 cells confirmed basal expression of the gene targets of all of these 275 siRNA (Table S2). These target proteins and their known functions are described in Table S3. To verify whether any of the observed effects of these siRNA pools derived from an influence on cell viability, we treated uninfected cells with the validated siRNA pools and, after propidium iodide staining, measured the population with sub-G1 levels of DNA by flow cytometry. A comparison between the frequency of dead/apoptotic cells and the magnitude of the effect on Mtb CFU, obtained for each siRNA, revealed limited effects on cell apoptosis in comparison with the more wide-ranging effects on Mtb levels (Figure 2B). Similar results were also obtained using an MTT assay (Figure S2), further confirming that the effect of these siRNAs was not due to toxic effects on the host cells. This stability of uninfected cells to siRNA treatment is consistent with our observation that PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were more resistant than cycling cells to the depletion of key survival-related molecules (Figure S2). The host factors identified to regulate Mtb infection by our screen showed a poor concordance with those implicated in previous studies (see Table S1). However, while these earlier studies had largely concentrated on events occurring either during or soon after the uptake of pathogen by the host macrophage (Koul et al., 2004Koul A. Herget T. Klebl B. Ullrich A. Interplay between mycobacteria and host signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), our screen investigated a later time window involving the establishment of a sustainable equilibrium with the host intracellular milieu. Therefore, to verify whether the stage of infection examined had any bearing on outcome, we selected a panel of nine targets that, though known to regulate the early processes after Mtb uptake, were not identified in our screen. The effects of silencing expression of these molecules either during or subsequent to the exposure of cells to H37Rv were then compared. Intracellular Mtb loads were significantly reduced in seven of these cases when the target proteins were depleted at the time of infection (Figure 2C). However, postinfection silencing again had no significant effect. Further, in these latter experiments, a significant inhibitory effect of Akt1 was only observed when its silencing was combined with that of its isoform, Akt2 (Figure 2D). Thus, temporally distinct stages of the infection are also characterized by distinctions in the regulatory host factors involved. Consequently, the targets identified by our screen were likely those whose roles either persisted or were initiated during the later stages of the infection. However, these results notwithstanding, both insufficient silencing of the target and reversibility of the silencing effect over the time course of our experiment could be expected to contribute toward false negatives in our screen. To further characterize the host molecules identified, we employed their Gene Ontology (GO) class descriptions to classify them under eight broad categories of cellular function. These categories and the distribution of the 275 host factors between them are described in Figure 3A and Table S3. Barring molecules with either unknown or inadequately characterized function, it was the functional categories of metabolism, signal transduction, transcription regulation, and trafficking that were predominantly represented, collectively accounting for nearly 65% of all of the “hits” (Figure 3A). Next, to define the host molecular interface involved in interactions with the pathogen, we extracted the cellular network that was composed of all the validated siRNA targets. For this we sourced the STRING database to determine the functionally associated partners for each of the target molecules, and these interactions were then merged together to generate the network (see Figure 3B). The resulting network, termed as the Mtb-regulatory network, was comprised of 4771 nodes and 51,677 edges (interactions) (Tables S5 and S6). A clustering coefficient (CC) of 0.526 was obtained, which is consistent with a “small-world” architecture that facilitates easy information flow between the component nodes (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004Barabási A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Network biology: understanding the cell's functional organization.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar). A randomization of this network through 100 iterations where links were arbitrarily shuffled without altering their number resulted in a 20-fold reduction in the clustering coefficient (0.03 ± 0.0007), with a concomitant reduction also in the mean path length (from 4.0 to 2.8 ± 0.003). Thus, the topological features of the Mtb-regulatory network were not randomly derived, but rather represent unique properties. Additionally, the low frequency of our “hits” among the nodes with a higher than average value for the measured centrality parameters also reiterated that this network was not biased toward the siRNA-identified targets (Figure 3C, Table S6). We further dissected the Mtb-regulatory network to examine its constituent functional modules. With the exception of ion channel-related activities, the other functional groups described in Figure 3A were identified to form discrete subnetworks that were significantly overrepresented (p < 10−3). The subnetworks obtained for each of these GO classes are depicted in Table S6, and the two most enriched ones were those for the functions of metabolism and signal transduction. This is consistent with the fact that, in addition to sourcing nutrients, intracellular survival of Mtb requires the pathogen to modulate multiple host cellular functions that are under the regulatory control of the signaling machinery (Schaible and Kaufmann, 2005Schaible U.E. Kaufmann S.H. A nutritive view on the host-pathogen interplay.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Warner and Mizrahi, 2007Warner D.F. Mizrahi V. The survival kit of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, the relatively large size of the module corresponding to the host cell transcription regulatory network is also in keeping with earlier findings that infection causes extensive alterations in the host cell transcriptome (Nau et al., 2002Nau G.J. Richmond J.F. Schlesinger A. Jennings E.G. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Human macrophage activation programs induced by bacterial pathogens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). A comparison of the intrinsic network properties of the individual subnetworks with that of the parent Mtb-regulatory network revealed that these parameters were only slightly affected (Figure 3D). Additionally, the parent network and its subnetworks all displayed a broad distribution in node degree (Table S6), confirming the modular organization of the Mtb-regulatory network. To explore how the above functional modules were perturbed by the pathogen, we analyzed the gene expression profile of THP-1 cells at various times after infection with H37Rv. These results were then integrated into the above functional-class subnetworks to determine the relative expression patterns of the nodes within each module. Interestingly, expression of nearly half of the genes coding for the nodes in each of these modules was either up- or downregulated (Figure 3E), suggesting that the functional properties of the modules were significantly altered as a result of the infection. Next, we segregated the coregulated clusters within each subnetwork (see Table S6). Taking each of these clusters, we then searched for connected modules that were composed of a minimum of three nodes. Interestingly, this exercise revealed the existence of a large, highly connected module, along with a few smaller clusters, within each of the functional subnetworks. Further, these coexpressing modules also included several of the targets identified by our siRNA screen. The largest up- and downregulated module from select subnetworks is shown in Figure 4, and the complete sets are presented in Table S7. Intriguingly, the subnetworks representing the GO classes of immunity/inflammation/stress, transcription regulation (Figure 4), signal transduction, metabolism, and cell cycle/growth all included a functional cluster of upregulated genes that was centered on the serine/threonine kinase Akt. While this reaffirms the importance of this group of kinases in regulating Mtb levels (Kuijl et al., 2007Kuijl C. Savage N.D. Marsman M. Tuin A.W. Janssen L. Egan D.A. Ketema M. van den Nieuwendijk R. van den Eeden S.J. Geluk A. et al.Intracellular bacterial growth is controlled by a kinase network around PKB/AKT1.Nature. 2007; 450: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), these results also provide a resolution of the multivariate pathways through which Akt/PKB may act, in regulating the intracellular infection. The presence of a cluster within the metabolism subnetwork that was centered on ACSL1—an identified siRNA target—was also of interest (Figure 4). Mycobacterial lipid metabolism is central to its virulent properties, and coupled lipid metabolism between host and the pathogen plays a role in mycobacterial survival and virulence in host cells (Jain et al., 2007Jain M. Petzold C.J. Schelle M.W. Leavell M.D. Mougous J.D. Bertozzi C.R. Leary J.A. Cox J.S. Lipidomics reveals control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence lipids via metabolic coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5133-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, ASCL1 has also been implicated in the etiology of diabetes (Gertow et al., 2004Gertow K. Pietiläinen K.H. Yki-Järvinen H. Kaprio J. Rissanen A. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Fisher R.M. Expression of fatty-acid-handling proteins in human adipose tissue in relation to obesity and insulin resistance.Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1118-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ASCL1-focused cluster identified here may, therefore, help to gain mechanistic insights into the close association observed between diabetes and susceptibility to tuberculosis (Kaufmann et al., 2005Kaufmann S.H. Cole S.T. Mizrahi V. Rubin E. Nathan C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the host response.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1693-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The coregulated clusters identified within the immune/inflammation/stress subnetwork also provide the blueprint for an understanding of how the pathogen modulates the innate and adaptive components of the host immune response. Thus, the upregulated cluster shown in Figure 4 (and Table S7) primarily includes nodes that are immunosuppressive (IL-10, CTLA4, BTLA), are involved in the induction of apoptosis of T cells (FASLG, PDCD1LG2, TRAF6, NOD1), or bias toward a Th2 response (IL-4, GATA3). TLR8—a hit in our screen—is another node of particular interest here. Genetic variants of this protein have recently been linked to susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (Davila et al., 2008Davila S. Hibberd M.L. Hari Dass R. Wong H.E. Sahiratmadja E. Bonnard C. Alisjahbana B. Szeszko J.S. Balabanova Y. Drobniewski F. et al.Genetic association and expression studies indicate a role of toll-like receptor 8 in pulmonary tuberculosis.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000218Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast to the upregulated cluster, the downregulated cluster of nodes from the immune/inflammation subnetwork included both extracellular (IL-1B, IL-7, 1L-27, IL-6, IFNB1, CXCL5, CCL11, CXCL14, etc.) and intracellular/cellular (EBI3, IRAK2, IRF-4, NOD2, MYD88, CSF2, NOTCH 1 and 4, etc.) mediators of an inflammatory response. This is consistent with the known immune-evasive strategies adopted by virulent mycobacteria within the host (Flynn and Chan, 2001Flynn J.L. Chan J. Immunology of tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Thus, our sequential analysis involving the incorporation of targets identified by the siRNA screen into a functional association network, then resolving this network into distinct GO-based subnetworks, and finally integrating into these the results from microarray experiments allowed us distinguish those modules that were specifically influenced by the infection. These coregulated clusters likely represent dynamic expressions of the interplay between the pathogen and the molecular components of the host cellular machinery. A more detailed analysis of these clusters, along with those involving host factors whose expression levels remain unchanged (see Table S7) would, however, be required before more definitive interpretations can be made on host factor-dependent regulation of the pathogen. Mtb exhibits a broad spectrum of genotypic and phenotypic diversification in the human population. To date, at least six main lineages and 15 sublineages of this pathogen have been described (Brudey et al., 2006Brudey K. Driscoll J.R. Rigouts L. Prodinger W.M. Gori A. Al-Hajoj S.A. Allix C. Aristimuño L. Arora J.

DeRiemer K. Van T. Kato-Maeda M. de Jong B.C. Narayanan S. Nicol M. Niemann S. Kremer K. Gutierrez M.C. et al.Variable host-pathogen compatibility in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Further, the clinical presentation of this infection can dynamically shift between states of latent, persistent, and active infection in which the pathogen can again potentially display a spectrum of phenotypic variations that extend from drug-sensitive to multiple-drug (MDR-Mtb), and even extensive drug, resistance (Ginsberg and Spigelman, 2007Ginsberg A.M. Spigelman M. Challenges in tuberculosis drug research and development.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is, however, unknown whether such variations also involve alterations in the mechanisms that support intracellular survival of the pathogen. To explore this, we extended our studies to include a panel of seven independent field isolates of Mtb that collectively represented a range of phenotypic and genotypic variations. For example, these isolates displayed distinct patterns of drug resistance against the four front-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis (Figure 5A ). While three of these isolates belonged to the class of MDR-Mtb, exhibiting resistance to any three of these four drugs, the resistance profile describing each isolate differed from that of the other two. The remaining four isolates were also similarly distinguished in that they were each resistant to just a single drug, but again in a m"

Noncoding RNAs transcribed from repeat elements generate siRNAs that are incorporated into the Argonaute-containing RITS complex and direct it to nascent homologous transcripts. This leads to recruitment of the CLRC complex, including the histone methyltransferase Clr4, promoting H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin formation. A key question is what mediates the recruitment of Clr4/CLRC to transcript-bound RITS. We have identified a LIM domain protein, Stc1, that is required for centromeric heterochromatin integrity. Our analyses show that Stc1 is specifically required to establish H3K9 methylation via RNAi, and interacts both with the RNAi effector Ago1, and with the chromatin-modifying CLRC complex. Moreover, tethering Stc1 to a euchromatic locus is sufficient to induce silencing and heterochromatin formation independently of RNAi. We conclude that Stc1 associates with RITS on centromeric transcripts and recruits CLRC, thereby coupling RNAi to chromatin modification.

Divergent RNAi pathways mediate silencing in a variety of ways but all are characterized by small RNAs that are bound by Argonaute effector proteins and act as specificity factors to target homologous sequences for repression (Ghildiyal and Zamore, 2009Ghildiyal M. Zamore P.D. Small silencing RNAs: an expanding universe.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). RNAi frequently acts at the posttranscriptional level, reducing gene expression by directing transcript cleavage or translational inhibition. However, RNAi can also trigger DNA and/or chromatin modifications that lead to transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin formation. Such RNA-directed chromatin modification is best understood in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Bernstein and Allis, 2005Bernstein E. Allis C.D. RNA meets chromatin.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1635-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, Bühler and Moazed, 2007Bühler M. Moazed D. Transcription and RNAi in heterochromatic gene silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, domains of heterochromatin are found at telomeres, the silent mating-type locus, and on pericentromeric repeats (reviewed in Bühler and Moazed, 2007Bühler M. Moazed D. Transcription and RNAi in heterochromatic gene silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Heterochromatin revisited.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). This heterochromatin is characterized by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), mediated by the sole H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4. H3K9me creates binding sites for the chromodomain proteins Swi6, Chp1, Chp2, and Clr4 (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C.

Several histone deacetylases (HDACs), Clr3, Clr6, and Sir2, are also required to facilitate H3K9 methylation (Grewal et al., 1998Grewal S.I. Bonaduce M.J. Klar A.J.

At centromeres, RNAi promotes H3K9 methylation on centromeric outer repeat sequences (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R. Verdel A. Colmenares S.U. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Moazed D.

It is possible to distinguish between establishment of H3K9me, which is fully dependent on RNAi, and its subsequent maintenance, which is only partially RNAi dependent (Sadaie et al., 2004Sadaie M. Iida T. Urano T. Nakayama J. A chromodomain protein, Chp1, is required for the establishment of heterochromatin in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3825-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). RNAi also targets mating-type locus and telomeric elements with homology to centromere outer repeats. However, here, alternative pathways act redundantly with RNAi to recruit chromatin modifiers, so that RNAi is required for establishment but not for maintenance of H3K9me at these loci (Hansen et al., 2006Hansen K.R. Ibarra P.T. Thon G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42850-42859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RNAi in fission yeast is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from noncoding centromere outer repeat transcripts produced during S phase by RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Bühler and Moazed, 2007Bühler M. Moazed D. Transcription and RNAi in heterochromatic gene silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S.

RNAi, heterochromatin and the cell cycle.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 511-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Dicer (Dcr1) cleaves these dsRNA molecules into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide the Argonaute (Ago1)-containing RITS effector complex to homologous nascent transcripts by sequence complementarity. Association of the RITS complex (Ago1, Tas3, and Chp1) with chromatin is facilitated by binding of the chromodomain protein Chp1 to H3K9me nucleosomes, which drives a self-enforcing loop coupling spreading of H3K9me with RITS binding. Nascent transcript-bound RITS also recruits the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC; Rdp1, Cid12, and Hrr1), which may promote further dsRNA and siRNA production. By a mechanism that is not understood, this cotranscriptional form of RNAi can recruit Clr4 to initiate H3K9me. H3K9me then spreads to form a heterochromatin domain (reviewed in Bühler and Moazed, 2007Bühler M. Moazed D. Transcription and RNAi in heterochromatic gene silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Heterochromatin revisited.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Clr4 is associated with a multisubunit complex containing Rik1, Dos1 (Raf1/Cmc1/Clr8), Dos2 (Raf2/Cmc2/Clr7), and Pcu4/Cul4 (Hong et al., 2005Hong E.J. Villén J. Gerace E.L. Gygi S.P. Moazed D.

This Clr4-Rik1-Cul4 complex (CLRC) is an active Cullin-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for heterochromatin assembly. Rik1 has a WD40/β-propeller domain similar to damaged DNA-binding protein DDB1 (Neuwald and Poleksic, 2000Neuwald A.F. Poleksic A.

Dos1 also contains WD40 repeats, while Dos2 has no obvious domains. Cul4 serves as a scaffold for ubiquitin ligase assembly, and must be neddylated for cullin-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity. Although the relationship between the ubiquitin ligase activity of CLRC and Clr4-mediated heterochromatin formation is unclear, these Clr4-associated factors are all required for H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin integrity (Hong et al., 2005Hong E.J.

A critical question is what connects this Clr4 methyltransferase complex CLRC to the RNAi machinery, to mediate its RNAi-dependent recruitment to chromatin. It has been shown previously that Rik1 and Clr4 associate with the RITS component Chp1, and that Rik1 recruitment to the centromeric repeats is enhanced when production of centromere transcripts and siRNAs is increased (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Roles of the Clr4 methyltransferase complex in nucleation, spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, what mediates the association of CLRC with RITS is unknown. In a genome-wide screen, we identified stc1+ as a gene required for heterochromatin integrity. Stc1 is a LIM domain protein that associates with CLRC, and additionally associates with the RNAi effector protein Ago1. The phenotypes of stc1Δ cells resemble those of RNAi mutants; however, artificially tethering Stc1 to a euchromatic locus promotes H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin formation independently of RNAi. Our analyses lead us to conclude that once RITS/Ago1 has been guided to centromeric transcripts by siRNAs, Stc1 is the key protein that recruits CLRC. Stc1 is therefore critical for the recognition of ongoing cotranscriptional RNAi and delivery of the chromatin modifiers that promote heterochromatin formation. In a screen of ∼3000 strains bearing single nonessential gene deletions (E.H.B., D.A.B., and R.C.A., unpublished data), we identified SPBP8B7.28c as a gene required for marker gene silencing in outer repeat heterochromatin of centromere 1 (cen1:ade6+; Figure 1). We named this gene stc1+ (siRNA to chromatin). Plating assays and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses confirmed that, as in cells lacking other components of the RNAi-directed chromatin modification process (clr4Δ, swi6Δ, and dcr1Δ), deletion of stc1+ (stc1Δ) results in alleviation of silencing of cen1:ade6+ and accumulation of noncoding outer repeat transcripts (Figures 1A and 1B). Conversely, siRNAs homologous to outer repeats are not detectable in stc1Δ cells (Figure 1C). siRNAs are also undetectable in cells lacking RNAi components (dcr1Δ, chp1Δ, ago1Δ, and tas3Δ); however, we find that low levels of siRNAs clearly remain in CLRC complex mutants (clr4Δ, rik1Δ, dos1Δ, and dos2Δ). The absence of detectable siRNAs in stc1Δ cells therefore implicates Stc1 in the RNAi pathway.

We found that, as with other RNAi and heterochromatin mutants, stc1Δ cells lose a minichromosome at elevated rates, are sensitive to the microtubule destabilizing compound TBZ (Figure S1 available online), and display a high incidence of lagging chromosomes in late anaphase, indicative of defects in centromere function (Figure 1D). Cells lacking CLRC subunits (clr4Δ, rik1Δ, cul4Δ, dos1Δ, or dos2Δ) exhibit delocalization of Swi6 and complete loss of H3K9me from heterochromatic regions (Ekwall et al., 1996Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R.

In contrast, cells lacking RNAi (i.e., dcr1Δ) retain some H3K9me on heterochromatic repeats, albeit at reduced levels, but lose it from embedded marker genes such as cen1:ade6+ or cen1:ura4+ (Bayne et al., 2008Bayne E.H.

Anti-H3K9me2 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on stc1Δ cells indicates that, as in dcr1Δ cells, H3K9me2 is only partially reduced on centromeric outer repeats (cen-dg) but is completely lost from the cen1:ura4+ marker gene. Consistent with this, a reduced level of Swi6 remains associated with outer repeats, but not with cen1:ura4+ (Figure 1E). Thus, like Dcr1, Stc1 is required to process centromeric transcripts into siRNAs, but is not absolutely required to maintain H3K9me2 and Swi6 on centromere repeats. This suggests that Stc1 is required for H3K9 methylation, and thus heterochromatin formation, via RNAi. It is known that RNAi is required to establish, but not to maintain, silent heterochromatin over the mat2-mat3 and subtelomeric regions. Consequently, deletion of Dcr1 has little or no impact on silencing of embedded genes (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I.

We crossed stc1Δ, dcr1Δ, clr4Δ, rik1Δ, dos1Δ, or dos2Δ cells with cells harboring a silent ura4+ gene close to mat3 (mat3-M:ura4+). The CLRC components Clr4, Rik1, Dos1, and Dos2 are required to maintain silencing of mat2-mat3; consequently, cells lacking these proteins lose mat3-M:ura4+ silencing, resulting in growth on plates lacking uracil (−URA) and loss of resistance to counterselective FOA (+FOA). qRT-PCR confirms that ura4+ transcript levels increase by around 20-fold in CLRC mutants (Figures 2A–2C ). In contrast, mat3-M:ura4+ remained silent in both dcr1Δ and stc1Δ cells, as indicated by continued growth on FOA (equivalent to the wild-type) and low transcript levels. Maintenance of silencing at telomeres was similarly unaffected by deletion of Dcr1 or Stc1 but was disrupted by deletion of CLRC components (Figure S2). So that the role of Stc1 in establishing silencing of mat3-M:ura4+ could be assessed, the clr4+ gene was removed (causing loss of silencing) and then reintroduced in wild-type, dcr1Δ or stc1Δ backgrounds by crossing (Figure 2A). Silencing of mat3:ura4+ could not be re-established in the absence of Dcr1 or Stc1 (Figures 2B and 2C). This indicates that, like Dcr1, Stc1 is required for the establishment, but not the maintenance, of silencing over mat2-mat3, strongly suggesting that Stc1 is specifically required for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin establishment.Figure S2Stc1 Is Not Required for Maintenance of Silencing at Telomeres, Related to Figure 2Show full captionAssay for silencing at a telomeric his3+ marker gene (tel1:his3+) in wild-type or mutant backgrounds.

Plates are non-selective (N/S) or lacking histidine (-HIS); growth on -HIS indicates loss of silencing. We recently showed that artificial recruitment of Clr4 to heterologous DNA-binding sites induces heterochromatin formation and silencing of nearby marker genes (Kagansky et al., 2009Kagansky A. Folco H.D. Almeida R. Pidoux A.L. Boukaba A. Simmer F. Urano T. Hamilton G.L. Allshire R.C. Synthetic heterochromatin bypasses RNAi and centromeric repeats to establish functional centromeres.Science. 2009; 324: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this system, cells express Clr4 (chromodomain deleted) fused to the Gal4-binding domain (GBD-Clr4-Δcd). Recruitment of this GBD-Clr4 fusion protein to Gal4-binding sites upstream of ade6+ (3xgbs-ade6+) silences ade6+ expression, resulting in red colonies (as opposed to white, ade6+-expressing, colonies). Both establishment and maintenance of this synthetic heterochromatin are essentially RNAi independent, indicating that tethering Clr4 methyltransferase activity to DNA bypasses the need for RNAi-mediated Clr4 recruitment. In contrast, the CLRC component Rik1 is critical for both establishment and maintenance of this heterochromatin (Kagansky et al., 2009Kagansky A. Folco H.D. Almeida R. Pidoux A.L. Boukaba A. Simmer F. Urano T. Hamilton G.L. Allshire R.C. Synthetic heterochromatin bypasses RNAi and centromeric repeats to establish functional centromeres.Science. 2009; 324: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We tested the contribution of Stc1 to this synthetic heterochromatin, comparing it to that of Dcr1, Rik1, Dos1, and Dos2 using plating assays and qRT-PCR (Figures 2D and 2E). Deletion of Stc1 had no effect on pre-established GBD-Clr4-Δcd-mediated silencing of 3xgbs-ade6+, as indicated by red colony color and low ade6+ transcript levels, similar to dcr1Δ and wild-type cells. In contrast, the CLRC mutants, rik1Δ, dos1Δ, and dos2Δ, produced white colonies and high transcript levels, indicative of loss of silencing. Thus, maintenance of GBD-Clr4-Δcd-mediated silencing requires CLRC components but not Stc1 or RNAi (Dcr1), consistent with Stc1 being required for RNAi-mediated CLRC recruitment. However, when GBD-Clr4-Δcd and the 3xgbs-ade6+ reporter were freshly combined in the absence of Stc1, ade6+ was not silenced, as shown by white colonies and high transcript levels (Figures 2D and 2E). This indicates that, surprisingly, like CLRC components but unlike Dcr1, Stc1 is required for establishment of GBD-Clr4-Δcd-mediated silencing. ChIP analyses confirmed that establishment of H3K9me on the reporter required Stc1, whereas maintenance of H3K9me was largely unaffected in stc1Δ cells (Figure 2F). This suggests that, apart from its role in RNAi, Stc1 is additionally required to initiate CLRC activity, even when Clr4 is tethered directly to DNA, although it is not required to sustain this activity once H3K9me is established. This assay reveals a unique role for Stc1 that is distinct from those of other RNAi and CLRC component mutants, suggesting that Stc1 may function at the interface between RNAi and Clr4 methyltransferase activity. To gain further insight into the functional relationship between Stc1 and known RNAi and chromatin components, we affinity selected Stc1-FLAG from cell lysates and identified coprecipitating proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Specificity was ensured by subtracting proteins identified in immunoprecipitates (IPs) from untagged control strains (Figure S3A and Tables S3 and S4). Notably, many of the identified peptides corresponded to CLRC components: Cul4, Rik1, Dos1, and Dos2. Nedd8 peptides were also detected, consistent with Cul4 being neddylated (Figure 3A ). The association of Stc1-FLAG with Rik1, Dos1, and Dos2 was confirmed by western analysis of IPs to detect Rik1-myc, GFP-Dos1, and Dos2-HA. In addition, although the CLRC component Clr4 was not detected in our LC-MS/MS analysis, association of myc-Clr4 with Stc1-FLAG was detected by IP-western (Figure 3B and Figures S3B and S3C). Interestingly, association of Stc1-FLAG with the RITS component Ago1 (myc-Ago1) was also observed, consistent with the RNAi-like (dcr1Δ) phenotype of stc1Δ cells (Figure 3C and Figure S3D). Association between Stc1-FLAG and RDRC components was not detected (Figure S3E). The finding that Stc1 associates with both CLRC and Ago1, along with the phenotype of stc1Δ cells, indicates that Stc1 may be a key bridging protein that connects the chromatin modification machinery to RNAi.Figure 3Stc1 Interacts with CLRC and Ago1Show full caption(A) List of proteins found specifically and reproducibly associated with Stc1-FLAG by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

https://openalex.org/W2051066849,"Background Influenza transmission is often associated with climatic factors. As the epidemic pattern varies geographically, the roles of climatic factors may not be unique. Previous in vivo studies revealed the direct effect of winter-like humidity on air-borne influenza transmission that dominates in regions with temperate climate, while influenza in the tropics is more effectively transmitted through direct contact. Methodology/Principal Findings Using time series model, we analyzed the role of climatic factors on the epidemiology of influenza transmission in two regions characterized by warm climate: Hong Kong (China) and Maricopa County (Arizona, USA). These two regions have comparable temperature but distinctly different rainfall. Specifically we employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model along with climatic parameters as measured from ground stations and NASA satellites. Our studies showed that including the climatic variables as input series result in models with better performance than the univariate model where the influenza cases depend only on its past values and error signal. The best model for Hong Kong influenza was obtained when Land Surface Temperature (LST), rainfall and relative humidity were included as input series. Meanwhile for Maricopa County we found that including either maximum atmospheric pressure or mean air temperature gave the most improvement in the model performances. Conclusions/Significance Our results showed that including the environmental variables generally increases the prediction capability. Therefore, for countries without advanced influenza surveillance systems, environmental variables can be used for estimating influenza transmission at present and in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2082060456,"Background Cone photoreceptors are responsible for color and central vision. In the late stage of retinitis pigmentosa and in geographic atrophy associated with age-related macular degeneration, cone degeneration eventually causes loss of central vision. In the present work, we investigated cone degeneration secondary to rod loss in the S334ter-3 transgenic rats carrying the rhodopsin mutation S334ter. Methodology/Principal Findings Recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was delivered by intravitreal injection to the left eye of an animal, and vehicle to the right eye. Eyes were harvested 10 days after injection. Cone outer segments (COS), and cell bodies were identified by staining with peanut agglutinin and cone arrestin antibodies in whole-mount retinas. For long-term treatment with CNTF, CNTF secreting microdevices were implanted into the left eyes at postnatal day (PD) 20 and control devices into the right eyes. Cone ERG was recorded at PD 160 from implanted animals. Our results demonstrate that an early sign of cone degeneration is the loss of COS, which concentrated in many small areas throughout the retina and is progressive with age. Treatment with CNTF induces regeneration of COS and thus reverses the degeneration process in early stages of cone degeneration. Sustained delivery of CNTF prevents cones from degeneration and helps them to maintain COS and light-sensing function. Conclusions/Significance Loss of COS is an early sign of secondary cone degeneration whereas cell death occurs much later. At early stages, degenerating cones are capable of regenerating outer segments, indicating the reversal of the degenerative process. Sustained delivery of CNTF preserves cone cells and their function. Long-term treatment with CNTF starting at early stages of degeneration could be a viable strategy for preservation of central vision for patients with retinal degenerations."
https://openalex.org/W1999967473,"Thyroid adenomas are common benign human tumors with a high prevalence of about 5% of the adult population even in iodine sufficient areas. Rearrangements of chromosomal band 19q13.4 represent a frequent clonal cytogenetic deviation in these tumors making them the most frequent non-random chromosomal translocations in human epithelial tumors at all. Two microRNA (miRNA) gene clusters i.e. C19MC and miR-371-3 are located in close proximity to the breakpoint region of these chromosomal rearrangements and have been checked for a possible up-regulation due to the genomic alteration. In 4/5 cell lines established from thyroid adenomas with 19q13.4 rearrangements and 5/5 primary adenomas with that type of rearrangement both the C19MC and miR-371-3 cluster were found to be significantly overexpressed compared to controls lacking that particular chromosome abnormality. In the remaining cell line qRT-PCR revealed overexpression of members of the miR-371-3 cluster only which might be due to a deletion accompanying the chromosomal rearrangement in that case. In depth molecular characterization of the breakpoint in a cell line from one adenoma of this type reveals the existence of large Pol-II mRNA fragments as the most likely source of up-regulation of the C19MC cluster. The up-regulation of the clusters is likely to be causally associated with the pathogenesis of the corresponding tumors. Of note, the expression of miRNAs miR-520c and miR-373 is known to characterize stem cells and in terms of molecular oncology has been implicated in invasive growth of epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo thus allowing to delineate a distinct molecular subtype of thyroid adenomas. Besides thyroid adenomas rearrangements of 19q13.4 are frequently found in other human neoplasias as well, suggesting that activation of both clusters might be a more general phenomenon in human neoplasias."
https://openalex.org/W2053170600,"Background The two major indications for tonsillectomy are recurrent tonsillitis (RT) and peritonsillar abscess (PTA). Unlike PTAs, which are primarily treated surgically, RT is often cured by tonsillectomy only after a series of failed drug therapy attempts. Although the bacteriological background of RT has been studied, the reason for the lack of success of conservative therapeutic approaches is not well understood. Methods In a prospective study, tonsil specimens from 130 RT patients and 124 PTA patients were examined for the presence of extra- and intracellular bacteria using antibiotic protection assays. Staphylococcus aureus isolates from RT patients were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa-typing and MSCRAMM-gene-PCR. Their ability for biofilm formation was tested and their cell invasiveness was confirmed by a flow cytometric invasion assay (FACS), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. Findings S. aureus was the predominant species (57.7%) in RT patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes was most prevalent (20.2%) in PTA patients. Three different assays (FACS, FISH, antibiotic protection assay) showed that nearly all RT-associated S. aureus strains were located inside tonsillar cells. Correspondingly, the results of the MSCRAMM-gene-PCRs confirmed that 87% of these S. aureus isolates were invasive strains and not mere colonizers. Based upon PFGE analyses of genomic DNA and on spa-gene typing the vast majority of the S. aureus isolates belonged to different clonal lineages. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that intracellular residing S. aureus is the most common cause of RT and indicate that S. aureus uses this location to survive the effects of antibiotics and the host immune response.

https://openalex.org/W2088972943,"Amongst the most severe clinical outcomes of life-long infections with Helicobacter pylori is the development of peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma - diseases often associated with an increase of regulatory T cells. Understanding H. pylori-driven regulation of T cells is therefore of crucial clinical importance. Several studies have defined mammalian microRNAs as key regulators of the immune system and of carcinogenic processes. Hence, we aimed here to identify H. pylori-regulated miRNAs, mainly in human T cells. MicroRNA profiling of non-infected and infected human T cells revealed H. pylori infection triggers miR-155 expression in vitro and in vivo. By using single and double H. pylori mutants and the corresponding purified enzymes, the bacterial vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tested positive for their ability to regulate miR-155 and Foxp3 expression in human lymphocytes; the latter being considered as the master regulator and marker of regulatory T cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of the Foxp3 transcription factor in T cells abolished miR-155 expression. Using adenylate cyclase inhibitors, the miR-155 induction cascade was shown to be dependent on the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, we found that miR-155 directly targets the protein kinase A inhibitor α (PKIα) mRNA in its 3′UTR, indicative of a positive feedback mechanism on the cAMP pathway. Taken together, our study describes, in the context of an H. pylori infection, a direct link between Foxp3 and miR-155 in human T cells and highlights the significance of cAMP in this miR-155 induction cascade."

Biol. 2007; 3: 80Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The experimental study of multidrug combinations poses a well-known combinatorial problem, since the number of experiments grows exponentially with the number of drugs and doses measured. Whereas drug effects on outcome are much studied, the effect of drug combinations on protein dynamics in the cell is much less investigated. Understanding the impact of drugs on each protein is important in the context of a vision of a future medicine that controls protein dynamics precisely, using specific combinations of a large number of drugs. Imagine that the cell state can be described in a high dimensional space in which each axis is the level (or localization or activity) of one of the cells proteins (Figure 1). The goal is to guide the cell from a “sick state” to a “healthy state” in a rational manner (or, in the case of cancer, from a living cancer cell to a dead or quiescent cancer cell). This entails understanding the dynamical response of each protein to each drug at each dose, in the context of all possible combinations of the other drugs. To approach such rational control requires study of the degree to which protein dynamics in drug combinations can be understood. To address this, we use a dynamic proteomics approach (Sigal et al., 2006Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Klein Y. Alaluf I. Swerdlin N. Perzov N. Danon T.

We find that the dynamics of each protein in the presence of a drug combination is described accurately by a linear superposition (weighted sum) of the dynamics in the presence of each drug alone. The weights in this superposition are constant over time and depend on the drug dose. They describe the relative impact of each drug on each protein. We find that one can predict the dynamics in a multidrug combination on the basis of the dynamics in pairs of drugs. Extending this approach may allow understanding the vast space of multidrug and multidose combinations based on a relatively small number of two-drug measurements. To follow proteins in space and time in individual living cells, we used a dynamic proteomics approach (Sigal et al., 2006Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Klein Y. Alaluf I. Swerdlin N.

We employed a library of cell line clones, based on the H1299 human lung cancer cell line. In each clone, a different protein is tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), inserted as an exon in the chromosomal locus of the gene. The clone expresses a full-length fusion protein from its native chromosomal location under its endogenous regulation. Immunoblots on a subset of these clones indicated that 80% of the tagged proteins serve as accurate markers for the dynamics of the endogenous protein (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Eden E. Frenkel-Morgenstern M. Issaeva I. Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen-Saidon C. Liron Y. Kam Z. et al.Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug.Science. 2008; 322: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The present library includes about 1400 different tagged proteins. The clones are all tagged with a second red fluorescent marker that enables automated image analysis (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Eden E. Frenkel-Morgenstern M. Issaeva I. Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen-Saidon C. Liron Y. Kam Z. et al.Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug.Science. 2008; 322: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). For this study, we selected 15 proteins that represent different aspects of cell biology (see Table S3, part a, available online). These include representatives from systems such as the ribosome, oxidative stress, DNA repair, metabolism, cytoskeleton, and apoptosis. The proteins localize to different cell compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and nucleoli. The dynamics of each protein in the presence of drugs was monitored by time-lapse microscopy under incubated conditions in multi-well plates as described in Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Eden E. Frenkel-Morgenstern M. Issaeva I. Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen-Saidon C. Liron Y. Kam Z. et al.Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug.Science. 2008; 322: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar (see the Experimental Procedures). Dynamics of the fluorescence of tagged protein for each cell was obtained by automated image analysis. The dynamics presented are the average of 200–400 individual cell dynamical profiles, taken from two to four repeated movies with four fields of view in the same well for each movie. Day-day reproducibility of the dynamics was better than 10% (RMS error). We chose 13 drugs including chemotherapy agents, pathway inhibitors, and growth factors (Table S3, part b). These drugs have diverse antagonistic or synergistic interactions when assayed for cell death using neutral red (Table 1). For example, etoposide (ETOPO) combined with camptothecin (CPT) shows synergism, in the sense of enhanced cell killing relative to Bliss independence (in which each drug kills a fraction of the cells independently of the other). In contrast, ETOPO combined with Nocodazole (NCZ) shows reduced killing (antagonism).Table 1Summary of Survival after Chemotherapy Drug Combination TreatmentCombinationDose (μM)SurvivalaSurviving cells in response to the indicated drugs and their combinations as was measured by neutral red assay (see the Experimental Procedures).

Open table in a new tab See also Figure S6. We tested the dynamics of the 15 proteins with these drugs at equi-lethal concentrations (for some drugs, only a subset of the proteins was tested). We find that each protein shows different dynamics for each drug. For example, ribosomal protein RPS3 levels rise under NCZ, but decrease under CPT (Figure 2A , part 1). Thus, drugs that all result in cell death still have different effects on each of the proteins (Figure 2A). We next tested the dynamics of the 15-protein panel in combinations of drug pairs. Here, we mixed together the same doses as used for the single-drug dynamics. We tested a total of 19 combinations of the 13 drugs. We find that in 12 of the 13 drugs (the exception is PI3K inhibitor, discussed below) the dynamics in drug pairs can be described to within experimental error by a weighted sum of the dynamics in the presence of each drug alone (Figures 2B and 2C). Thus,Pi+j(t)=wiPi(t)+wjPj(t). Here, Pi+j is the protein level in the combination of drugs i and j, Pi and Pj are the levels in each drug alone. Protein levels are normalized to the initial protein level before the drugs are added, P(t) = (P(t)-P(0))/P(0). Note that the weights wi and wj are constant over time. In other words, measurement of each drug alone, and the combination at a single time point to estimate the two weights wi and wj, is enough to predict the dynamics of the combination at all time points in the experiment. The weights are specific for each protein (Figure 3A , parts 1 and 2), and in most cases they add up to approximately one: wi + wj ∼ 1 (Figure 3A, part 3). Thus, the dynamics in the present two-drug combinations tend to lie between the dynamical curves of each drug alone, similar to a weighted average of the two curves. Such superposition is somewhat surprising. In principle, one may have expected other effects; for example, a protein response that exceeds both single drug responses, such as would result if the two dynamics were purely additive (with wi = wj = 1). As a statistical test of the superposition phenomenon, we performed a data shuffling test. In this test, we attempted to describe the dynamics of a protein in two-drug combinations by means of a weighted sum of the single drug dynamics of other proteins (Figure S1). We find that the error of the best-fit superposition in this shuffling approach is always higher than the error that results when describing each protein as a superposition of its own single-drug dynamic profiles (p < 0.001). As a further test, we used principle component analysis (PCA) (Pearson, 1901Pearson K. On lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space.Philos. Mag. 1901; 2: 559-572Crossref Google Scholar, Jolliffe, 2002Jolliffe I.T. Principle Component Analysis. Springer Series in Statistics, Aberdeen, UK2002Google Scholar) to ask to what extent the two-drug dynamics are a linear combination of the single-drug dynamics. If the measured combination Pi+j is a pure linear combination of the individual-drug dynamics Pi, Pj, then PCA over the three vectors Pi, Pj, and Pi+j would result in only two components that are larger than zero and a third component that is equal to zero. Application of PCA to all 15 proteins results in 99.5% of the variability in the two first principle components, leaving only a 0.5% effect not explained by linear superposition (Figures S1A–S1F). Some trends in the weights can be seen, where certain drugs seem to have larger weights than others. We find that the weights for CPT for most proteins are larger than those for NCZ and similarly larger than the weights for CisPt (Figure 3A, parts 1 and 2). This means that the combination of either NCZ or CisPt with CPT at the present doses leads to dynamics that are dominated by CPT. In particular, the CPT drug target, TOP1, shows dynamics completely dominated by CPT, with weight close to one for CPT and nearly zero for the other drug in the pair. The dominance of CPT does not apply however to all proteins: an exception is the protein DDX18, in which NCZ dominates CPT. This may point to the pathway-specific impact of each drug. Overall, about 20% of the cases we tested showed strong dominance by one drug in a drug pair (three out of 15 cases showed dynamics more than 90% dominated by one of the two drugs). We also tested the effects of varying the drug dose. We find that the linear superposition principle applies across drug concentrations. The resulting weights for a given drug are an increasing function of its dose (Figure 3B, parts 1 and 2). For example, when CPT levels are reduced from 330 nM to 3.3 nM, it is no longer dominant over NCZ for most proteins. The weights as a function of dose x are reasonably described by Hill-like functions, wi(x) = wmax xn/(Kn+xn). The halfway point K depends on the dose of the other drug in the pair. We extensively tested the superposition hypothesis in the case of the protein LMNA, in 96 different dose combinations of CPT and CisPt, using a 96-well assay in the microscope. We find that linear superposition accurately describes the dynamics in all dose combinations. The weights in each dose combination can be represented in a two-dimensional map (Figure 3B, part 3), and are well fit by the product of two Hill-like functions (Figure 3B, part 4). Thus, the weight for CisPt in the presence of CPT is w1(x,y) = h1(x)·h2(y), where x is the CisPt dose and y is the CPT dose. Here, h1 is a Hill functions of x, h1(x)=xn1xn1+K1n1, and h2 is a decreasing Hill function of y, h2(y)=K2n2yn2+K2n2. Similar findings were obtained with 96 combinations of CPT and NCZ. One drug does not seem to show linear superposition with other drugs, the PI3K inhibitor, Wortmanin. Addition of this compound to other drugs seems to result in dynamics that can not be well described as a weighted sum of the two single-drug dynamics (Figures 4A and 4B ). We could not find a compelling reason why this drug behaves differently from the others in the present study. An additional test case is when a drug is combined with itself. This can be considered as a limiting case in which the two drugs in a cocktail are one and the same. One can imagine situations where, for example, the dynamical profile of a drug at dose x is not a weighted sum of its two dynamical curves at dose x/2. We tested this for three of the drugs, CPT, ETOPO, and CisPt. We find that for most concentrations, linear superposition holds to excellent approximation even when adding a drug to itself (Table S1 and Figure S2).Figure S3Histogram of all RMS Values in Two-Drug Combinations, Related to Figure 2, Figure 3Show full captionShown are RMS values (summarized from Table S2) in two-drug combinations dynamics for all tested proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S4Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Significance of the sub-dominant drug in the linear superposition is shown by shuffling the protein dynamics for the sub-dominant drug alone.

Error bars are standard errors of 3 or more independent experimental repeats. Linear superposition can be mathematically shown to hold true when adding a drug to itself, if the drug has a dose response that can be separated into a product of a dose-dependent function and a time-dependent one, in the following way: P(D,t) = h1(t)+ h2(t)· g(D), where D is the dose and t the time (see the Extended Results, “Adding a Drug to Itself”). The drugs presently tested seem to have a dose-response that shows such a separability feature. It is conceivable, however, that other drugs have a nonseparable interplay between dose and temporal response profiles, so that linear superposition of the drug with itself will not hold. We next tested combinations of three drugs, CPT (0.33 μM) + CisPt (80 μM) + NCZ (1 μM) (Table S1) and CPT (0.3 μM) + CisPt (80 μM) + ETOPO (100 μM) (Figure 5A and Table S1), and a combination of all four drugs CPT (0.33 μM) + CisPt (80 μM) + ETOPO (100 μM) + NCZ (1 μM) (Figure 5B and Table S1). We find that, as in the two-drug case, the dynamics are a linear superposition of the single-drug dynamics. Superposition captures multidrug dynamics extremely well (the fit lies within the bounds of the experimental error) and is highly significant in data shuffling tests (p < 10−4). The weights are again specific to each protein and sum up to approximately one. We hypothesized that the three-drug weights can be predicted based on the two-drug weights. To see this, note that if the linear superposition principle holds for three drugsPi+j+k=wi(ijk)Pi+wj(ijk)Pj+wk(ijk)Pkand for each of the three different pair combinationsPi+j=wi(ij)Pi+wj(ij)Pj,then one has enough equations to solve for the three-drug weights on the basis of the two-drug weights (see the Extended Results, “Derivation of the Prediction Equations for Three and More Drugs,” and Table S1). Here, wiij denotes the weight of drug i in the presence of drugs i+j, and for the purpose of the present calculation weights are normalized to sum up to one. The resulting formula for three-drug weights based on the two-drug weights iswi(ijk)=wi(ik)−wi(ik)wj(jk)1−wi(ik)wj(jk). The same reasoning can be extended to four drugs and more. The corresponding formula for N-drug weights based on (N−1)-drug weights iswi(1..N)=wi(≠j)−wi(≠j)wj(≠i)1−wi(≠j)wj(≠i),where (≠j) means all drugs but j. This results in one equation for each choice of j≠i, a total of N−1 equations. These equations can be solved starting from two-drug weights until one reaches N-drug weights. We estimated the weights in the four-drug combinations by averaging over the predictions given by these equations. We find that the predicted weights agree very well with the best-fit weights for most proteins (Figure 5 and Figure S5): correlation between best-fit and predicted weights is R = 0.92, p < 10−15. Thus, knowledge of two-drug weights seems to provide a good estimate for dynamics in three- and four-drug combinations. Extended Results Shuffling Tests Indicate that the Linear Superposition Is Statistically SignificantTo test the significance of the linear superposition we performed two statistical tests. In the first test we calculated the Root Mean Square (RMS) error between the measured protein response to drugs combination and the best fit calculated superposition. In the second test we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Pearson, 1901Pearson K. On lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space.Philos. Mag. 1901; 2: 559-572Crossref Google Scholar, Jolliffe, 2002Jolliffe I.T. Principle Component Analysis. Springer Series in Statistics, Aberdeen, UK2002Google Scholar) on the measured protein response to the single drugs and to the drugs combination. PCA provides three eigenvalues (since there are three curves, 2 for single drugs and one for the combination). We calculated the smallest eigenvalue, which is an indication for the quality of the superposition (eigenvalues are normalized to sum up to one). If the smallest eigenvalue is zero it means that one of the measured responses (single or combined drugs) is a pure linear superposition of the other responses. High eigenvalue means that the measured responses (single or combined drugs) show some linear independence from each other.For both RMS and PCA measures, we performed a data shuffling test. We compared the original dataset, in which the single drug response and the drugs combination response are for the same protein, to a randomly shuffled datasets in which the single drug responses are randomly chosen from other proteins (the drugs are not shuffled).We performed 10,000 data shuffles (Figure S1). The original dataset is marked by a red circle in Figures S1A–S1F, and the shuffled tests are shown by the blue histogram. In all tested cases the original dataset is the absolute minimum of the RMS measure, and is distanced at least four standard deviations from the mean of the distribution (estimated P-value is p < 10−4). In the PCA test the original dataset is the absolute minimum in the NCZ-CPT combination, but in the CPT-CisPt combination there are a few other combinations that show similar quality (estimated P-value is p < 3·10−2). This is probably because the measurements in these experiments are noisier.Both tests show that the goodness of fit of linear superposition is statistically significant, and that dynamics of a given protein can not be explained by the dynamics of other proteins using linear superposition. Control for Superposition: The Linear Superposition Is Not Explained by a Single Dominant Drug; the Sub-dominant Drug Is Also ImportantWe sought to control for the possibility that when one of the two drugs in a combination dominates the dynamics, linear superposition is less significant. In this case, the other, sub-dominant drug has a lo"
https://openalex.org/W1968244390,"Piscidins constitute a family of cationic antimicrobial peptides that are thought to play an important role in the innate immune response of teleosts. On the one hand they show a remarkable diversity, which indicates that they are shaped by positive selection, but on the other hand they are ancient and have specific targets, suggesting that they are constrained by purifying selection. Until now piscidins had only been found in fish species from the superorder Acanthopterygii but we have recently identified a piscidin gene in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), thus showing that these antimicrobial peptides are not restricted to evolutionarily modern teleosts. Nucleotide diversity was much higher in the regions of the piscidin gene that code for the mature peptide and its pro domain than in the signal peptide. Maximum likelihood analyses with different evolution models revealed that the piscidin gene is under positive selection. Charge or hydrophobicity-changing amino acid substitutions observed in positively selected sites within the mature peptide influence its amphipathic structure and can have a marked effect on its function. This diversification might be associated with adaptation to new habitats or rapidly evolving pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2125764601,"Emerging evidence suggests that RNA interference (RNAi)-related processes act both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. However, the process by which the RNAi machinery is transported into the nucleus remains poorly understood. The Tetrahymena Argonaute protein Twi1p localizes to the nucleus and is crucial for small RNA-directed programmed DNA elimination. In this study, we identify Giw1p, which binds to Twi1p and is required for its nuclear localization. Furthermore, the endoribonuclease (Slicer) activity of Twi1p plays a vital role in the removal of one of the two strands of Twi1p-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), leading to a functionally mature Twi1p-siRNA complex. Slicer activity is also shown to be required for nuclear localization of Twi1p and for its association with Giw1p. These results suggest that Giw1p senses the state of Twi1p-associated siRNAs and selectively transports the mature Twi1p-siRNA complex into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2072645819,"Tyrosine kinases are attractive targets for pancreatic cancer therapy because several are over-expressed, including PDGFRalpha/beta, FAK, Src and Lyn. A critical role of mast cells in the development of pancreatic cancer has also been reported. Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets c-Kit, PDGFRalpha/beta, Lyn, and to a lesser extent the FAK pathway, without inhibiting kinases of known toxicities. Masitinib is particularly efficient in controlling the proliferation, differentiation and degranulation of mast cells. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of masitinib in pancreatic cancer, as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine.Proof-of-concept studies were performed in vitro on human pancreatic tumour cell lines and then in vivo using a mouse model of human pancreatic cancer. Molecular mechanisms were investigated via gene expression profiling. Masitinib as a single agent had no significant antiproliferative activity while the masitinib/gemcitabine combination showed synergy in vitro on proliferation of gemcitabine-refractory cell lines Mia Paca2 and Panc1, and to a lesser extent in vivo on Mia Paca2 cell tumour growth. Specifically, masitinib at 10 microM strongly sensitised Mia Paca2 cells to gemcitabine (>400-fold reduction in IC(50)); and moderately sensitised Panc1 cells (10-fold reduction). Transcriptional analysis identified the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway as down-regulated in the cell lines resensitised by the masitinib/gemcitabine combination.These data establish proof-of-concept that masitinib can sensitise gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer cell lines and warrant further in vivo investigation. Indeed, such an effect has been recently observed in a phase 2 clinical study of patients with pancreatic cancer who received a masitinib/gemcitabine combination."

CREB is a key transcription factor in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. To elucidate the behavioral effects of CaMKIV deficiency, we subjected CaMKIV knockout (CaMKIV KO) mice to a battery of behavioral tests. CaMKIV KO had no significant effects on locomotor activity, motor coordination, social interaction, pain sensitivity, prepulse inhibition, attention, or depression-like behavior. Consistent with previous reports, CaMKIV KO mice exhibited impaired retention in a fear conditioning test 28 days after training. In contrast, however, CaMKIV KO mice did not show any testing performance deficits in passive avoidance, one of the most commonly used fear memory paradigms, 28 days after training, suggesting that remote fear memory is intact. CaMKIV KO mice exhibited intact spatial reference memory learning in the Barnes circular maze, and normal spatial working memory in an eight-arm radial maze. CaMKIV KO mice also showed mildly decreased anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that CaMKIV is involved in regulating emotional behavior. These findings indicate that CaMKIV might not be essential for fear memory or spatial memory, although it is possible that the activities of other neural mechanisms or signaling pathways compensate for the CaMKIV deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2009669131,"Recent epidemiological and experimental data suggest a negative influence of shortened or disturbed night sleep on glucose tolerance. Due to the high prevalence of sleep disorders this might be a major health issue. However, no comparative studies of carbohydrate metabolism have been conducted in clinical sleep disorders.We performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and assessed additional parameters of carbohydrate metabolism in patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS, N = 25), restless legs syndrome (RLS, N = 18) or primary insomnia (N = 21), and in healthy controls (N = 33). Compared to controls, increased rates of impaired glucose tolerance were found in OSAS (OR: 4.9) and RLS (OR: 4.7) patients, but not in primary insomnia patients (OR: 1.6). In addition, HbA1c values were significantly increased in the same two patient groups. Significant positive correlations were found between 2-h plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT and the apnea-arousal-index in OSAS (r = 0.56; p<0.05) and the periodic leg movement-arousal-index in RLS (r = 0.56, p<0.05), respectively. Sleep duration and other quantitative aspects of sleep were similar between patient groups.Our findings suggest that some, but not all sleep disorders considerably compromise glucose metabolism. Repeated arousals during sleep might be a pivotal causative factor deserving further experimental investigations to reveal potential novel targets for the prevention of metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2070993775,"Background Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), present in human serum, is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and contributes to vascular disease. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is an ADMA degrading enzyme that has two isoforms: DDAHI and DDAHII. We sought to determine whether serum ADMA levels in type 2 diabetes are influenced by common polymorphisms in the DDAH1 and DDAH2 genes. Methodology/Principal Findings Relevant clinical parameters were measured and peripheral whole blood obtained for serum and genetic analysis on 343 participants with type 2 diabetes. Serum ADMA concentrations were determined by mass spectroscopy. Twenty six tag SNPs in the DDAH1 and 10 in the DDAH2 gene were genotyped in all subjects and tested for association with serum ADMA levels. Several SNPs and haplotypes in the DDAH genes were strongly associated with ADMA levels. Most significantly in the DDAH1 gene, rs669173 (p = 2.96×10−7), rs7521189 (p = 6.40×10−7), rs2474123 (p = 0.00082) and rs13373844 (p = 0.00027), and in the DDAH2 gene, rs3131383 (p = 0.0029) and the TGCCCAGGAG haplotype (p = 0.0012) were significantly associated with ADMA levels. Sub-analysis by diabetic retinopathy (DR) status revealed these variants were associated with ADMA levels predominantly in participants without DR. Combined analysis of the most strongly associated SNPs in DDAH1 (rs669173) and DDAH2 (rs3131383) revealed an additive effect (p = 1.37×10−8) on ADMA levels. Conclusions/Significance Genetic variation in the DDAH1 and 2 genes is significantly associated with serum ADMA levels. Further studies are required to determine the pathophysiological significance of elevated serum ADMA in type 2 diabetes and to better understand how DDAH gene variation influences ADMA levels."

Cells suspended in a universal buffer system received an initial high voltage pulse that was continuously combined with a subsequent low voltage pulse with independently defined electric parameters of the effective field and the duration of each pulse. At comparable viable cell recoveries and transfection efficiencies of up to 95% of all cells, a wide variety of cells especially profited from this combined pulse strategy by high protein expression levels of individual cells after transfection. Long-term silencing of gene expression by transfected small interfering RNA was most likely due to the uptake of large nucleic acid amounts as shown by direct detection of fluorochromated small interfering RNA. The highly efficient combined pulse electroporation strategy enables for external regulation of the number of naked nucleic acid molecules taken up and can be easily adapted for cells considered difficult to transfect."
https://openalex.org/W2089184001,"Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are the single largest class of bacterial virulence factors. The DAF-2 insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway, which regulates lifespan and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans, is known to mutate to resistance to pathogenic bacteria. However, its role in responses against bacterial toxins and PFTs is as yet unexplored. Here we reveal that reduction of the DAF-2 insulin-like pathway confers the resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans to cytolitic crystal (Cry) PFTs produced by Bacillus thuringiensis. In contrast to the canonical DAF-2 insulin-like signaling pathway previously defined for aging and pathogenesis, the PFT response pathway diverges at 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1) and appears to feed into a novel insulin-like pathway signal arm defined by the WW domain Protein 1 (WWP-1). In addition, we also find that WWP-1 not only plays an important role in the intrinsic cellular defense (INCED) against PFTs but also is involved in innate immunity against pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in lifespan regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that WWP-1 and DAF-16 function in parallel within the fundamental DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 signaling network to regulate fundamental cellular responses in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2035225170,"Background India has a high burden of drug resistant TB, although there are few data on XDR-TB. Although XDR-TB has existed previously in India, the definition has not been widely applied, and surveillance using second line drug susceptibility testing has not been performed. Our objective was to analyze clinical and demographic risk factors associated with isolation of MDR and XDR TB as compared to susceptible controls, at a tertiary center. Methodology/Findings Retrospective chart review based on positive cultures isolated in a high volume mycobacteriology laboratory between 2002 and 2007. 47 XDR, 30 MDR and 117 susceptible controls were examined. Drug resistant cases were less likely to be extrapulmonary, and had received more previous treatment regimens. Significant risk factors for XDR-TB included residence outside the local state (OR 7.43, 3.07-18.0) and care costs subsidized (OR 0.23, 0.097-0.54) in bivariate analysis and previous use of a fluoroquinolone and injectable agent (other than streptomycin) (OR 7.00, 95% C.I. 1.14-43.03) and an initial treatment regimen which did not follow national guidelines (OR 5.68, 1.24-25.96) in multivariate analysis. Cavitation and HIV did not influence drug resistance. Conclusions/Significance There is significant selection bias in the sample available. Selection pressure from previous treatment and an inadequate initial regimen increases risk of drug resistance. Local patients and those requiring financial subsidies may be at lower risk of XDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W2117597190,"Background In a variety of organisms, including mammals, caloric restriction improves metabolic status and lowers the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, ultimately leading to increased lifespan. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that knockout mice for Eps8, a regulator of actin dynamics, display reduced body weight, partial resistance to age- or diet-induced obesity, and overall improved metabolic status. Alteration in the liver gene expression profile, in behavior and metabolism point to a calorie restriction-like phenotype in Eps8 knockout mice. Additionally, and consistent with a calorie restricted metabolism, Eps8 knockout mice show increased lifespan. The metabolic alterations in Eps8 knockout mice correlated with a significant reduction in intestinal fat absorption presumably caused by a 25% reduction in intestinal microvilli length. Conclusions/Significance Our findings implicate actin dynamics as a novel variable in the determination of longevity. Additionally, our observations suggest that subtle differences in energy balance can, over time, significantly affect bodyweight and metabolic status in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2088664176,"Podocytes are injured in several glomerular diseases. To alter gene expression specifically in podocytes in vivo, we took advantage of their active endocytotic machinery and developed a method for the targeted delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA). We generated an anti-mouse podocyte antibody that binds to rat and mouse podocytes in vivo. The polyclonal IgG antibody was cleaved into monovalent fragments, while preserving the antigen recognition sites. One Neutravidin molecule was linked to each monovalent IgG via the available sulfohydryl group. Protamine, a polycationic nuclear protein and universal adaptor for anionic siRNA, was linked to the neutravidin via biotin. The delivery system was named shamporter (sheep anti mouse podocyte transporter). Injection of shamporter coupled with either nephrin siRNA or TRPC6 siRNA via tail vein into normal rats substantially reduced the protein levels of nephrin or TRPC6 respectively, measured by western blot analysis and immunostaining. The effect was target specific because other podocyte-specific genes remained unchanged. Shamporter + nephrin siRNA induced transient proteinuria in rats. Control rats injected with shamporter coupled to control-siRNA showed no changes. These results show for the first time that siRNA can be delivered efficiently and specifically to podocytes in vivo using an antibody-delivery system."
https://openalex.org/W2058665312,"We previously found that dopamine signaling modulates the sensitivity of wild-type C. elegans to the aversive odorant 1-octanol. C. elegans lacking the CAT-2 tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, which is required for dopamine biosynthesis, are hypersensitive in their behavioral avoidance of dilute concentrations of octanol. Dopamine can also modulate the context-dependent response of C. elegans lacking RGS-3 function, a negative regulator of G alpha signaling. rgs-3 mutant animals are defective in their avoidance of 100% octanol when they are assayed in the absence of food (E. coli bacterial lawn), but their response is restored when they are assayed in the presence of food or exogenous dopamine. However, it is not known which receptor might be mediating dopamine's effects on octanol avoidance. Herein we describe a role for the C. elegans D2-like receptor DOP-3 in the regulation of olfactory sensitivity. We show that DOP-3 is required for the ability of food and exogenous dopamine to rescue the octanol avoidance defect of rgs-3 mutant animals. In addition, otherwise wild-type animals lacking DOP-3 function are hypersensitive to dilute octanol, reminiscent of cat-2 mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DOP-3 function in the ASH sensory neurons is sufficient to rescue the hypersensitivity of dop-3 mutant animals, while dop-3 RNAi knockdown in ASH results in octanol hypersensitivity. Taken together, our data suggest that dopaminergic signaling through DOP-3 normally acts to dampen ASH signaling and behavioral sensitivity to octanol."
https://openalex.org/W2063932638,"Recent studies have demonstrated that several mineral products sold for medicinal purposes demonstrate antimicrobial activity, but little is known about the physicochemical properties involved in antibacterial activity.Using in vitro mineral suspension testing, we have identified two natural mineral mixtures, arbitrarily designated BY07 and CB07, with antibacterial activity against a broad-spectrum of bacterial pathogens. Mineral-derived aqueous leachates also exhibited antibacterial activity, revealing that chemical, not physical, mineral characteristics were responsible for the observed activity. The chemical properties essential for bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli were probed by testing antibacterial activity in the presence of metal chelators, the hydroxyl radical scavenger, thiourea, and varying pH levels. Chelation of the BY07 minerals with EDTA or desferrioxamine eliminated or reduced BY07 toxicity, respectively, suggesting a role of an acid-soluble metal species, particularly Fe(3+) or other sequestered metal cations, in mineral toxicity. This conclusion was supported by NMR relaxation data, which indicated that BY07 and CB07 leachates contained higher concentrations of chemically accessible metal ions than leachates from non-bactericidal mineral samples.We conclude that the acidic environment of the hydrated minerals significantly contributes to antibacterial activity by increasing the availability and toxicity of metal ions. These findings provide impetus for further investigation of the physiological effects of mineral products and their applications in complementary antibacterial therapies."

BRCA1 mutation carriers are more likely to achieve a pathological complete response with DNA-damage-based chemotherapy compared to non-mutation carriers. Furthermore, sporadic ovarian cancer patients with low levels of BRCA1 mRNA have longer survival following platinum-based chemotherapy than patients with high levels of BRCA1 mRNA.Tumor biopsies were obtained from 86 breast cancer patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treated with four cycles of neoadjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 and vimentin were examined by tissue microarray. HER2 were also assessed by chromogenic in situ hybridization, and BRCA1 mRNA was analyzed in a subset of 41 patients for whom sufficient tumor tissue was available by real-time quantitative PCR. Median time to progression was 42 months and overall survival was 55 months. In the multivariate analysis for time to progression and overall survival for 41 patients in whom BRCA1 could be assessed, low levels of BRCA1 mRNA, positive PR and negative lymph node involvement predicted a significantly lower risk of relapse, low levels of BRCA1 mRNA and positive PR were the only variables associated with significantly longer survival.We provide evidence for a major role for BRCA1 mRNA expression as a marker of time to progression and overall survival in sporadic breast cancers treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. These findings can be useful for customizing chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2019996557,"Continued development of in-vitro procedures for expansion and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells (EPC) is essential not only in hematology and stem cell research but also virology, in light of the strict erythrotropism of the clinically important human parvovirus B19.We cultured EPC directly from ordinary blood samples, without ex vivo stem cell mobilization or CD34+ cell in vitro preselection. Profound increase in the absolute cell number and clustering activity were observed during culture. The cells obtained expressed the EPC marker combination CD36, CD71 and glycophorin, but none of the lymphocyte, monocyte or NK markers. The functionality of the generated EPC was examined by an in vitro infection assay with human parvovirus B19, tropic for BFU-E and CFU-E cells. Following infection (i) viral DNA replication and mRNA production were confirmed by quantitative PCR, and (ii) structural and nonstructural proteins were expressed in >50% of the cells. As the overall cell number increased 100-200 fold, and the proportion of competent EPC (CD34+ to CD36+) rose from <0.5% to >50%, the in vitro culture procedure generated the EPC at an efficiency of >10,000-fold. Comparative culturing of unselected PBMC and ex vivo-preselected CD34+ cells produced qualitatively and quantitatively similar yields of EPC.This approach yielding EPC directly from unmanipulated peripheral blood is gratifyingly robust and will facilitate the study of myeloid infectious agents such as the B19 virus, as well as the examination of erythropoiesis and its cellular and molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1991888027,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria thermogenesis is regulated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1), GDP and fatty acids. In this report, we observed fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with the mitochondrial outer membrane of rats BAT. Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA 1) was identified by immunoelectron microscopy in both ER and mitochondria. This finding led us to test the Ca(2+) effect in BAT mitochondria thermogenesis. We found that Ca(2+) increased the rate of respiration and heat production measured with a microcalorimeter both in coupled and uncoupled mitochondria, but had no effect on the rate of ATP synthesis. The Ca(2+) concentration needed for half-maximal activation varied between 0.08 and 0.11 microM. The activation of respiration was less pronounced than that of heat production. Heat production and ATP synthesis were inhibited by rotenone and KCN. Liver mitochondria have no UCP1 and during respiration synthesize a large amount of ATP, produce little heat, GDP had no effect on mitochondria coupling, Ca(2+) strongly inhibited ATP synthesis and had little or no effect on the small amount of heat released. These finding indicate that Ca(2+) activation of thermogenesis may be a specific feature of BAT mitochondria not found in other mitochondria such as liver."
https://openalex.org/W2071647195,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) is a new malaria control tool. However, it is uncertain whether IPTi works mainly through chemoprophylaxis or treatment of existing infections. Understanding the mechanism is essential for development of replacements for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) where it is no longer effective. This study investigated how protection against malaria given by SP, chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD) and mefloquine (MQ), varied with time since administration of IPTi. Methods and Findings A secondary analysis of data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in an area of high antifolate resistance in Tanzania was conducted. IPTi using SP, CD, MQ or placebo was given to 1280 infants at 2, 3 and 9 months of age. Poisson regression with random effects to adjust for potential clustering of malaria episodes within children was used to calculate incidence rate ratios for clinical malaria in defined time strata following IPTi. The short-acting antimalarial CD gave no protection against clinical malaria, whereas long-acting MQ gave two months of substantial protection (protective efficacy (PE) 73.1% (95% CI: 23.9, 90.5) and 73.3% (95% CI: 0, 92.9) in the first and second month respectively). SP gave some protection in the first month after treatment (PE 64.5% (95% CI: 10.6, 85.9)) although it did not reduce the incidence of malaria up to 12 months of age. There was no evidence of either long-term protection or increased risk of malaria for any of the regimens. Conclusion Post-treatment chemoprophylaxis appears to be the main mechanism by which IPTi protects children against malaria. Long-acting antimalarials are therefore likely to be the most effective drugs for IPTi, but as monotherapies could be vulnerable to development of drug resistance. Due to concerns about tolerability, the mefloquine formulation used in this study is not suitable for IPTi. Further investigation of combinations of long-acting antimalarials for IPTi is needed.

https://openalex.org/W2037933291,"TRK oncoproteins are chimeric versions of the NTRK1/NGF receptor and display constitutive tyrosine kinase activity leading to transformation of NIH3T3 cells and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3 is activated in response to cytokines and growth factors and it has been recently identified as a novel signal transducer for TrkA, mediating the functions of NGF in nervous system. In this paper we have investigated STAT3 involvement in signalling induced by TRK oncogenes. We showed that TRK oncogenes trigger STAT3 phosphorylation both on Y705 and S727 residues and STAT3 transcriptional activity. MAPK pathway was involved in the induction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, we have shown reduced STAT3 protein level in NIH3T3 transformed foci expressing TRK oncogenes. Overall, we have unveiled a dual role for STAT3 in TRK oncogenes-induced NIH3T3 transformation: i) decreased STAT3 protein levels, driven by TRK oncoproteins activity, are associated to morphological transformation; ii) residual STAT3 transcriptional activity is required for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2023484989,"Patients suffering from dementia of Alzheimer's type express less serotonin 4 receptors (5-HTR(4)), but whether an absence of these receptors modifies learning and memory is unexplored. In the spatial version of the Morris water maze, we show that 5-HTR(4) knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice performed similarly for spatial learning, short- and long-term retention. Since 5-HTR(4) control mnesic abilities, we tested whether cholinergic system had circumvented the absence of 5-HTR(4). Inactivating muscarinic receptor with scopolamine, at an ineffective dose (0.8 mg/kg) to alter memory in WT mice, decreased long-term but not short-term memory of 5-HTR(4) KO mice. Other changes included decreases in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the required enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis, in the septum and the dorsal hippocampus in 5-HTR(4) KO under baseline conditions. Training- and scopolamine-induced increase and decrease, respectively in ChAT activity in the septum in WT mice were not detected in the 5-HTR(4) KO animals. Findings suggest that adaptive changes in cholinergic systems may circumvent the absence of 5-HTR(4) to maintain long-term memory under baseline conditions. In contrast, despite adaptive mechanisms, the absence of 5-HTR(4) aggravates scopolamine-induced memory impairments. The mechanisms whereby 5-HTR(4) mediate a tonic influence on ChAT activity and muscarinic receptors remain to be determined."

Inactivation of Foxl2 in mice demonstrated its indispensability for female gonadal sex determination and ovary development and revealed its antagonism of Sox9, the effector of male testis development. To help to define the regulatory activities of FOXL2, we looked for interacting proteins. Based on yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that FOXL2 interacts with PIAS1 and UBC9, both parts of the sumoylation machinery. We showed that human FOXL2 is sumoylated in transfected cell lines, and that endogenous mouse Foxl2 is comparably sumoylated. This modification changes its cellular localization, stability and transcriptional activity. It is intriguing that similar sumoylation and regulatory consequences have also been reported for SOX9, the male counterpart of FOXL2 in somatic gonadal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2005213100,"C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and modulator of small G-protein activity, which primarily acts on members of the Rap GTPase subfamily. Via promotion of the active GTP bound conformation of target GTPases, C3G has been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular and developmental events including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Drosophila C3G orthologue exhibits a domain organization similar to that of vertebrate C3G. Through deletion of the C3G locus, we have observed that loss of C3G causes semi-lethality, and that escaping adult flies are characterized by a reduction in lifespan and general fitness. In situ hybridization reveals C3G expression in the developing embryonic somatic and visceral muscles, and indeed analysis of C3G mutants suggests essential functions of C3G for normal body wall muscle development during larval stages. C3G mutants display abnormal muscle morphology and attachment, as well as failure to properly localize betaPS integrins to muscle attachment sites. Moreover, we show that C3G stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Drosophila Rap GTPases in vitro. Taken together, we conclude that Drosophila C3G is a Rap1-specific GEF with important functions in maintaining muscle integrity during larval stages."
https://openalex.org/W2104165451,"Over many years, it has been assumed that enzymes work either in an isolated way, or organized in small catalytic groups. Several studies performed using ""metabolic networks models"" are helping to understand the degree of functional complexity that characterizes enzymatic dynamic systems. In a previous work, we used ""dissipative metabolic networks"" (DMNs) to show that enzymes can present a self-organized global functional structure, in which several sets of enzymes are always in an active state, whereas the rest of molecular catalytic sets exhibit dynamics of on-off changing states. We suggested that this kind of global metabolic dynamics might be a genuine and universal functional configuration of the cellular metabolic structure, common to all living cells. Later, a different group has shown experimentally that this kind of functional structure does, indeed, exist in several microorganisms.Here we have analyzed around 2.500.000 different DMNs in order to investigate the underlying mechanism of this dynamic global configuration. The numerical analyses that we have performed show that this global configuration is an emergent property inherent to the cellular metabolic dynamics. Concretely, we have found that the existence of a high number of enzymatic subsystems belonging to the DMNs is the fundamental element for the spontaneous emergence of a functional reactive structure characterized by a metabolic core formed by several sets of enzymes always in an active state.This self-organized dynamic structure seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of metabolism, common to all living cellular organisms. To better understand cellular functionality, it will be crucial to structurally characterize these enzymatic self-organized global structures."
https://openalex.org/W2002938255,"Dystonin is a giant cytoskeletal protein belonging to the plakin protein family and is believed to crosslink the major filament systems in contractile cells. Previous work has demonstrated skeletal muscle defects in dystonin-deficient dystonia musculorum (dt) mice. In this study, we show that the dystonin muscle isoform is localized at the Z-disc, the H zone, the sarcolemma and intercalated discs in cardiac tissue. Based on this localization pattern, we tested whether dystonin-deficiency leads to structural defects in cardiac muscle. Desmin intermediate filament, microfilament, and microtubule subcellular organization appeared normal in dt hearts. Nevertheless, increased transcript levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, 66%) β-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC, 95%) and decreased levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump isoform 2A (SERCA2a, 26%), all signs of cardiac muscle stress, were noted in dt hearts. Hearts from two-week old dt mice were assessed for the presence of morphological and histological alterations. Heart to body weight ratios as well as left ventricular wall thickness and left chamber volume measurements were similar between dt and wild-type control mice. Hearts from dt mice also displayed no signs of fibrosis or calcification. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the intricate structure of the sarcomere by situating dystonin in cardiac muscle fibers and suggest that dystonin does not significantly influence the structural organization of cardiac muscle fibers during early postnatal development."

Disturbed expression of some neurotransmitters and their receptors has been shown in the central nervous system of SIDS victims but no biological abnormality of the peripheral vago-cardiac system has been demonstrated to date. The present study aimed to seek vago-cardiac abnormalities in SIDS victims. The cardiac level of expression of muscarinic receptors, as well as acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity were investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Left ventricular samples and blood samples were obtained from autopsies of SIDS and children deceased from non cardiac causes. Binding experiments performed with [3H]NMS, a selective muscarinic ligand, in cardiac membrane preparations showed that the density of cardiac muscarinic receptors was increased as shown by a more than doubled Bmax value in SIDS (n = 9 SIDS versus 8 controls). On average, the erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity was also significantly increased (n = 9 SIDS versus 11 controls). Conclusions In the present study, it has been shown for the first time that cardiac muscarinic receptor overexpression is associated with SIDS. The increase of acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity appears as a possible regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2033777994,"Background We conducted an Internet-based randomized trial comparing three valence framing presentations of the benefits of antihypertensive medication in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) for people with newly diagnosed hypertension to determine which framing presentation resulted in choices most consistent with participants' values. Methods and Findings In this second in a series of televised trials in cooperation with the Norwegian Broadcasting Company, adult volunteers rated the relative importance of the consequences of taking antihypertensive medication using visual analogue scales (VAS). Participants viewed information (or no information) to which they were randomized and decided whether or not to take medication. We compared positive framing over 10 years (the number escaping CVD per 1000); negative framing over 10 years (the number that will have CVD) and negative framing per year over 10 years of the effects of antihypertensive medication on the 10-year risk for CVD for a 40 year-old man with newly diagnosed hypertension without other risk factors. Finally, all participants were shown all presentations and detailed patient information about hypertension and were asked to decide again. We calculated a relative importance score (RIS) by subtracting the VAS-scores for the undesirable consequences of antihypertensive medication from the VAS-score for the benefit of CVD risk reduction. We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' RIS and their choice. 1,528 participants completed the study. The statistically significant differences between the groups in the likelihood of choosing to take antihypertensive medication in relation to different values (RIS) increased as the RIS increased. Positively framed information lead to decisions most consistent with those made by everyone for the second, more fully informed decision. There was a statistically significant decrease in deciding to take antihypertensives on the second decision, both within groups and overall. Conclusions For decisions about taking antihypertensive medication for people with a relatively low baseline risk of CVD (70 per 1000 over 10 years), both positive and negative framing resulted in significantly more people deciding to take medication compared to what participants decided after being shown all three of the presentations.

https://openalex.org/W2025183725,"Background Seasonal variations in mood and behaviour, termed seasonality, are commonly reported in the general population. As a part of a large cross-sectional health survey in Hordaland, Norway, we investigated the relationship between seasonality, objective health measurements and health behaviours. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 11,545 subjects between 40–44 years old participated, completing the Global Seasonality Score, measuring seasonality. Waist/hip circumference, BMI and blood pressure were measured, and blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. Subjects also completed a questionnaire on miscellaneous health behaviours (exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption). Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations between seasonality and objective health measurements, while binary logistic regression was used for analysing associations between seasonality and health behaviours. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, month of questionnaire completion and sleep duration. Seasonality was positively associated with high waist-hip-ratio, BMI, triglyceride levels, and in men high total cholesterol. Seasonality was negatively associated with HDL cholesterol. In women seasonality was negatively associated with prevalence of exercise and positively associated with daily cigarette smoking. Conclusions/Significance High seasonality was associated with objective health risk factors and in women also with health behaviours associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003345078,"Mutations in spastin are the most common cause of hereditary spastin paraplegia, a neurodegenerative disease. In this study, the role of spastin was examined in Drosophila photoreceptor development.The spastin mutation in developing pupal eyes causes a mild mislocalization of the apical membrane domain at the distal section, but the apical domain was dramatically reduced at the proximal section of the developing pupal eye. Since the rhabdomeres in developing pupal eyes grow from distal to proximal, this phenotype strongly suggests that spastin is required for apical domain maintenance during rhabdomere elongation. This role of spastin in apical domain modulation was further supported by spastin's gain-of-function phenotype. Spastin overexpression in photoreceptors caused the expansion of the apical membrane domain from apical to basolateral in the developing photoreceptor. Although the localizations of the apical domain and adherens junctions (AJs) were severely expanded, there were no defects in cell polarity.These results strongly suggest that spastin is essential for apical domain biogenesis during rhabdomere elongation in Drosophila photoreceptor morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108255837,"Ethanolamine phosphoglycerol (EPG) represents a protein modification that so far has only been found in eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). In mammals and plants, EPG is covalently attached to two conserved glutamate residues located in domains II and III of eEF1A. In contrast, Trypanosoma brucei eEF1A contains a single EPG attached to Glu362 in domain III. The sequence and/or structural requirements for covalent linkage of EPG to eEF1A have not been determined for any organism. Using a combination of biosynthetic labelling of parasites with tritiated ethanolamine and mass spectrometry analyses, we demonstrate that replacement of Glu362 in T. brucei eEF1A by site-directed mutagenesis prevents EPG attachment, whereas single or multiple amino acid substitutions around the attachment site are not critical. In addition, by expressing a series of eEF1A deletion mutants in T. brucei procyclic forms, we demonstrate that a peptide consisting of 80 amino acids of domain III of eEF1A is sufficient for EPG attachment to occur. Furthermore, EPG addition also occurs if domain III of eEF1A is fused to a soluble reporter protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report addressing amino acid sequence, or structure, requirements for EPG modification of eEF1A in any organism. Using T. brucei as a model organism, we show that amino acid substitutions around the modification site are not critical for EPG attachment and that a truncated version of domain III of eEF1A is sufficient to mediate EPG addition."
https://openalex.org/W2159456842,"Background The field of neural prosthetics aims to develop prosthetic limbs with a brain-computer interface (BCI) through which neural activity is decoded into movements. A natural extension of current research is the incorporation of neural activity from multiple modalities to more accurately estimate the user's intent. The challenge remains how to appropriately combine this information in real-time for a neural prosthetic device. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we propose a framework based on decision fusion, i.e., fusing predictions from several single-modality decoders to produce a more accurate device state estimate. We examine two algorithms for continuous variable decision fusion: the Kalman filter and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Using simulated cortical neural spike signals, we implemented several successful individual neural decoding algorithms, and tested the capabilities of each fusion method in the context of decoding 2-dimensional endpoint trajectories of a neural prosthetic arm. Extensively testing these methods on random trajectories, we find that on average both the Kalman filter and ANNs successfully fuse the individual decoder estimates to produce more accurate predictions. Conclusions Our results reveal that a fusion-based approach has the potential to improve prediction accuracy over individual decoders of varying quality, and we hope that this work will encourage multimodal neural prosthetics experiments in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2025134925,"Background Endophilin is a cytoplasmic protein with an important function in clathrin-dependent endocytosis at synapses and elsewhere. Endophilin has a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology) domain, which is implicated in the sensing and induction of membrane curvature. Previous structure-function studies of the endophilin-A BAR domain have almost exclusively been made in reduced systems, either in vitro or ex vivo in cultured cells. To extend and complement this work, we have analyzed the role played by the structural features of the endophilin-A BAR domain in Drosophila in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings The study is based on genetic rescue of endophilin-A (endoA) null mutants with wild type or mutated endoA transgenes. We evaluated the viability of the rescuants, the locomotor behavior in adult flies and the neurotransmission at the larval neuromuscular junction. Whereas mutating the endophilin BAR domain clearly affected adult flies, larval endophilin function was surprisingly resistant to mutagenesis. Previous reports have stressed the importance of a central appendage on the convex BAR surface, which forms a hydrophobic ridge able to directly insert into the lipid bilayer. We found that the charge-negative substitution A66D, which targets the hydrophobic ridge and was reported to completely disrupt the ability of endophilin-BAR to tubulate liposomes in vitro, rescued viability and neurotransmission with the same efficiency as wild type endoA transgenes, even in adults. A similar discrepancy was found for the hydrophilic substitutions A63S/A66S and A63S/A66S/M70Q. The A66W mutation, which introduces a bulky hydrophobic side chain and induces massive vesiculation of liposomes in vitro, strongly impeded eye development, even in presence of the endogenous endoA gene. Substantial residual function was observed in larvae rescued with the EndoA(Arf) transgene, which encodes a form of endophilin-A that completely lacks the central appendage. Whereas a mutation (D151P) designed to increase the BAR curvature was functional, another mutation (P143A, ΔLEN) designed to decrease the curvature was not. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide novel insight into the structure/function relationship of the endophilin-A BAR domain in vivo, especially with relation to synaptic function."

Perturbation of Thr402 (34.6%) suggests a communication pathway between Thr402 in the activation loop, and Phe387 (ΔΔE387F,402T = 2.80) in the magnesium positioning loop, Trp427 (ΔΔE427W,402T = 3.12) in the F-helix, and Val404 (ΔΔE404V,402T = 4.43) and Gly405 (ΔΔE405G,402T = 2.95) in the peptide positioning loop. When compared to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Src, the perturbation pattern of threonine phosphorylation in the activation loop of Pak2 is similar to that of PKA, and different from the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of Src. Reciprocal coupling analysis by SCA showed the residues perturbed by Thr402 and the reciprocal coupling pairs formed a network centered at Trp427 in the F-helix. Nine pairs of reciprocal coupling residues crucial for enzymatic activity and structural stabilization were identified. Pak2, PKA and Src share four pairs. Reciprocal coupling residues exposed to the solvent line up as an activation groove. This is the inhibitor (PKI) binding region in PKA and the activation groove for Pak2. This indicates these evolutionary conserved residues are crucial for the catalytic activity of PKA and Pak2."
https://openalex.org/W2006875820,"Background B lymphocytes are subject to elimination following strong BCR ligation in the absence of appropriate second signals, and this mechanism mediates substantial cell losses during late differentiation steps in the bone marrow and periphery. Mature B cells may also be eliminated through this mechanism as well as through normal turnover, but the population containing mature cells destined for elimination has not been identified. Herein, we asked whether the transitional 3 (T3) subset, which contains most newly formed cells undergoing anergic death, could also include mature B cells destined for elimination. Methodology/Principal Findings To interrogate this hypothesis and its implications, we applied mathematical models to previously generated in vivo labeling data. Our analyses reveal that the death rate of T3 B cells is far higher than the death rates of all other splenic B cell subpopulations. Further, the model, in which the T3 pool includes both newly formed and mature primary B cells destined for apoptotic death, shows that this cell loss may account for nearly all mature B cell turnover. Conclusions/Significance This finding has implications for the mechanism of normal mature B cell turnover."

(2010) use single mRNA molecule quantification to show that variation in gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans increases in mutants displaying incomplete penetrance. They find that a bimodal response is triggered when noisy expression of an upstream regulator crosses a critical threshold."

APC dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals could accelerate or exacerbate CD4+ T cell dysfunction and may contribute to increased levels of immunodeficiency seen in some patients regardless of their CD4+ T cell numbers. Here we test the hypothesis that APC from HIV-infected individuals have diminished antigen processing and presentation capacity.Monocytes (MN) were purified by immuno-magnetic bead isolation techniques from HLA-DR1.01+ or DR15.01+ HIV-infected and uninfected individuals. MN were analyzed for surface MHC-II expression and for antigen processing and presentation capacity after overnight incubation with soluble antigen or peptide and HLA-DR matched T cell hybridomas. Surface expression of HLA-DR was 20% reduced (p<0.03) on MN from HIV-infected individuals. In spite of this, there was no significant difference in antigen processing and presentation by MN from 14 HIV-infected donors (8 HLA-DR1.01+ and 6 HLA-DR15.01+) compared to 24 HIV-uninfected HLA-matched subjects.We demonstrated that MHC class II antigen processing and presentation is preserved in MN from HIV-infected individuals. This further supports the concept that this aspect of APC function does not further contribute to CD4+ T cell dysfunction in HIV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008885191,"Perceived spatial intervals between successive flashes can be distorted by varying the temporal intervals between them (the ""tau effect""). A previous study showed that a tau effect for visual flashes could be induced when they were accompanied by auditory beeps with varied temporal intervals (an audiovisual tau effect).We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the audiovisual tau effect occurs in infancy. Forty-eight infants aged 5-8 months took part in this study. In Experiment 1, infants were familiarized with audiovisual stimuli consisting of three pairs of two flashes and three beeps. The onsets of the first and third pairs of flashes were respectively matched to those of the first and third beeps. The onset of the second pair of flashes was separated from that of the second beep by 150 ms. Following the familiarization phase, infants were exposed to a test stimulus composed of two vertical arrays of three static flashes with different spatial intervals. We hypothesized that if the audiovisual tau effect occurred in infancy then infants would preferentially look at the flash array with spatial intervals that would be expected to be different from the perceived spatial intervals between flashes they were exposed to in the familiarization phase. The results of Experiment 1 supported this hypothesis. In Experiment 2, the first and third beeps were removed from the familiarization stimuli, resulting in the disappearance of the audiovisual tau effect. This indicates that the modulation of temporal intervals among flashes by beeps was essential for the audiovisual tau effect to occur (Experiment 2).These results suggest that the cross-modal processing that underlies the audiovisual tau effect occurs even in early infancy. In particular, the results indicate that audiovisual modulation of temporal intervals emerges by 5-8 months of age."
