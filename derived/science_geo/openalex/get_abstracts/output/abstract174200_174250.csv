https://openalex.org/W1990858807,"Abstract Ceramide-1-phosphate is a sphingolipid metabolite that has been implicated in membrane fusion of brain synaptic vesicles and neutrophil phagolysosome formation. Ceramide-1-phosphate can be produced by ATP-dependent ceramide kinase activity, although little is known of this enzyme because it has not yet been highly purified or cloned. Based on sequence homology to sphingosine kinase type 1, we have now cloned a related lipid kinase, human ceramide kinase (hCERK). hCERK encodes a protein of 537 amino acids that has a catalytic region with a high degree of similarity to the diacylglycerol kinase catalytic domain. hCERK also has a putative N-myristoylation site on its NH2 terminus followed by a pleckstrin homology domain. Membrane but not cytosolic fractions from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a hCERK expression vector readily phosphorylated ceramide but not sphingosine or other sphingoid bases, diacylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol. This activity was clearly distinguished from those of bacterial or human diacylglycerol kinases. With natural ceramide as a substrate, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.0–7.5 and showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with K m values of 187 and 32 μm for ceramide and ATP, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that hCERK mRNA expression was high in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. A BLAST search analysis using the hCERK sequence revealed that putative ceramide kinases (CERKs) exist widely in diverse multicellular organisms including plants, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CERKs are a new class of lipid kinases that are clearly distinct from sphingosine and diacylglycerol kinases. Cloning of CERK should provide new molecular tools to investigate the physiological functions of ceramide-1-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1965033589,"Dietary triacylglycerols are a major source of energy for animals. The absorption of dietary triacylglycerols involves their hydrolysis to free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols in the intestinal lumen, the uptake of these products into enterocytes, the resynthesis of triacylgylcerols, and the incorporation of newly synthesized triacylglycerols into nascent chylomicrons for secretion. In enterocytes, the final step in triacylglycerol synthesis is believed to be catalyzed primarily through the actions of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. In this study, we analyzed intestinal triacylglycerol absorption and chylomicron synthesis and secretion in DGAT1-deficient (Dgat1 −/−) mice. Surprisingly, DGAT1 was not essential for quantitative dietary triacylglycerol absorption, even in mice fed a high fat diet, or for the synthesis of chylomicrons. However, Dgat1 −/− mice had reduced postabsorptive chylomicronemia (1 h after a high fat challenge) and accumulated neutral-lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of enterocytes when chronically fed a high fat diet. These results suggest a reduced rate of triacylglycerol absorption in Dgat1 −/−mice. Analysis of intestine from Dgat1 −/−mice revealed activity for two other enzymes, DGAT2 and diacylglycerol transacylase, that catalyze triacylglycerol synthesis and apparently help to compensate for the absence of DGAT1. Our findings indicate that multiple mechanisms for triacylglycerol synthesis in the intestine facilitate triacylglycerol absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2085058707,"The HDM2 protein is a key regulator of the tumour suppressor, p53. Control of HDM2 function is critical for normal cell proliferation and stress responses, and it is becoming evident that multiple modifications of HDM2 can regulate its function within cells. In this study we show that HDM2 associated with the serine-threonine kinase, Akt, in response to growth factor stimulation of human primary cells. This association was concurrent with phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser 473), and resulted in elevated expression of HDM2 and enhanced nuclear localization. However, analysis of HDM2 proteins mutated at the consensus Akt recognition sites at serines 166 and 186 indicated that modification at these residues was not sufficient for the increased expression of the protein, which was blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. Tryptic peptide and mutational analyses revealed evidence for an Akt phosphorylation site in HDM2 additional to the two consensus sites."
https://openalex.org/W2014333801,"Akt activation reduces cardiomyocyte death and induces cardiac hypertrophy. To help identify effector mechanisms, gene expression profiles in hearts from transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of activated Akt (myr-Akt) were compared with littermate controls. 40 genes were identified as differentially expressed. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed qualitative results of transcript profiling for 9 of 10 genes examined, however, there were notable quantitative discrepancies between the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and microarray data sets. Interestingly Akt induced significant up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5), which could contribute to its anti-apoptotic effects in the heart. In addition, Akt-mediated down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) and PPAR-α may shift myocytes toward glycolytic metabolism shown to preserve cardiomyocyte function and survival during transient ischemia. IGFBP-5 transcripts also increased after adenoviral gene transfer of myr-Akt to cultured cardiomyocytes, suggesting that this represents a direct effect of Akt activation. In contrast, substantial induction of growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), a highly conserved inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth, was observed in transgenic hearts but not after acute Akt activationin vitro, suggesting that GDF-8 induction may represent a secondary effect perhaps related to the cardiac hypertrophy seen in these mice. Thus, microarray analysis reveals previously unappreciated Akt regulation of genes that could contribute to the effects of Akt on cardiomyocyte survival, metabolism, and growth.

We have shown that expression of a constitutively active mutant of Akt (myr-Akt) is sufficient to block apoptosis in hypoxic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in vitro (4Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F.

The downstream targets of Akt that mediate cell survival in the heart remain poorly characterized. Indeed some Akt substrates (e.g. Bad, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and Bcl-2) identified in other cell types appear to be either expressed at very low levels or not phosphorylated by Akt in cardiomyocytes (5Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar,6Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These data suggest that additional Akt-dependent phosphorylation, translation, and/or transcription events may be required for Akt-mediated cytoprotection in the heart. Translational effects of Akt involve the phosphorylation and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)1 that in turn phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase (7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The net effect of these phosphorylation events is enhanced translation of specific mRNA subset(s), which is bound by the initiation factor eIF-4F and/or the ribosomal S6 subunit. In contrast, the transcriptional effects of Akt are less well defined, although the importance of these events may be greater than initially realized (8Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin.

To examine the transcriptional effects of Akt in the heart we analyzed the changes in global gene expression in transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of myr-Akt using DNA microarrays. This approach enabled the quantitation of the effects of Akt activation on ∼11,000 genes. Results of interest were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR). Here we identify genes differentially regulated by chronic Akt activation in the heart and demonstrate that modulated transcripts represent a combination of primary and secondary effects. The importance of confirming microarray results of interest using additional, complimentary techniques is discussed. Generation and phenotypic characterization of myr-Akt mice is described elsewhere in detail (20Matsui, T., Li, L., Wu, J. C., Cook, S. A., Nagoshi, T., Picard, M. H., Liao, R., and Rosenzweig, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, the cDNA encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Akt with a src myristoylation (myr) signal (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas F. Franke, Columbia University) was subcloned downstream of the 5.5-kb murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter (generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, Division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation) and used to generate transgenic mice through oocyte injection. Positive founders were identified by Southern blotting and bred to wild-type C57BL6 mice for six generations. Two transgenic (TG) lines were maintained; the 20 line exhibited X-linked inheritance, whereas the 564 line exhibited autosomal inheritance. TG-positive F3 mice were used for studies and compared with TG-negative littermates. Both lines express myr-Akt specifically in the heart at levels 5–7-fold higher than the endogenous molecule and exhibit a substantial increase in Akt activation as measured by both in vitro kinase assays and in vivo phosphorylation of known substrates (20Matsui, T., Li, L., Wu, J. C., Cook, S. A., Nagoshi, T., Picard, M. H., Liao, R., and Rosenzweig, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from F3, 6-week-old, 20 line male mouse hearts using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O and further purified using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) RNeasy total RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified, and samples (n = 2–5 hearts) were pooled such that pooled RNA represented equal amounts (10 μg) of RNA from TG-positive or TG-negative mice within the litter. This was repeated in three independent experiments. Pooled samples (10 μg) were used to generate cDNA using the Superscript Choice system (Invitrogen) according to the Affymetrix protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Resulting cDNA was used to generate biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO Bioarray High Yield transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix). cRNA (20 μg) was fragmented in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mmmagnesium acetate) for 35 min at 94 °C. The quality of the cRNA was checked by hybridization to Test2 arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently samples were hybridized to Affymetrix mU74A microarrays, and bound sequences were identified by staining and scanning according to Affymetrix protocols. To enable comparison between experiments expression data were globally scaled to an average intensity of 1500 using the Affymetrix Microarray SuiteTMsoftware. A minimum value of 150 was assigned to all average differences (AvDiffs) with an intensity measurement below 150. Two parameters, the AvDiff and the absolute call (present or absent), extracted from the Affymetrix data files, were used in the data analysis, which was performed using GenespringTM (Silicon Genetics, CA). Results were sorted using a combination of high and low stringency filtering criteria. High stringency filtering required that a gene should have an absolute call of present in six of six samples with a mean -fold change of ≥±1.6. Low stringency filtering required that the gene be called present in two of the three replicates in the more highly expressing group with a mean AvDiff of ≥750 and mean -fold change of ≥2. Mean -fold changes between groups were calculated from the mean AvDiffs. Data passing these criteria were combined and subjected to statistical analysis. Total RNA was isolated and purified from the hearts of F3, 6-week-old male mice from the 20 and 564 transgenic lines as described above. Following purification RNA was quantified in triplicate using Ribogreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (5 μg) was treated (10 min at 20 °C) with amplification grade DNase 1 (Invitrogen) following which the DNase 1 was heat-inactivated (5 min at 75 °C). QRT-PCR was performed in duplicate using the Brilliant One-Step QRT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing SYBR Green I (1:30,000, Sigma), forward and reverse primers (50 nm each), and sample RNA (90 ng). Primers were designed to be compatible with a single QRT-PCR thermal profile (48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min) such that multiple transcripts could be analyzed simultaneously. Accumulation of PCR product was monitored in real time (Mx4000, Stratagene), and the crossing threshold (Ct) was determined using the Mx4000 software. For each set of primers, a no template control and a no reverse amplification control were included. Postamplification dissociation curves were performed to verify the presence of a single amplification product in the absence of DNA contamination. -Fold changes in gene expression were determined using the ΔCt method with normalization to total RNA (21Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 22Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Ad·EGFP·β-gal contains cytomegalovirus-driven expression cassettes for β-galactosidase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (5Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H., Li, L. Picard M.

Ad·Akt(AA) utilizes a similar viral backbone but encodes a dominant-negative Akt mutant and was kindly provided by Dr. Wataru Ogawa, Kobe University, Japan (23Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y.

Ad·myr-Akt and Ad·EGFP mediate expression of hemagglutinin-tagged constitutively active Akt or EGFP, respectively, and have been described previously (5Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Ads were amplified in 293 cells, the particle count was estimated fromA 260, and the titer was determined by plaque assay. Wild-type adenovirus contamination was excluded by the absence of PCR-detectable early region 1 (E1) sequences. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) were prepared from the cardiac ventricles of Sprague-Dawley neonates as described previously (5Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To study the effects of transient transgene expression, myocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subsequently serum-starved for 24 h prior to RNA extraction. RNA was extracted, purified, and quantified as described above. Hearts from littermate control and myr-Akt-expressing mice were removed from deeply anesthetized animals, snap frozen, and crushed under liquid nitrogen before tissue was homogenized in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Proteins from NRVMs were extracted by scraping cells directly into cold lysis buffer as described previously (4Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% separation gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry transfer. Blots were incubated with anti-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, Dako). Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling). Data are represented as mean ± S.E. Data were compared by two-tailed Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05. To identify genes differentially regulated by Akt in the heart we examined the gene expression profiles of mice with cardiac-specific expression of myr-Akt (20 line) compared with TG-negative littermate controls. The experiment was repeated three times to reduce erroneous data that can arise when pooled RNA alone is used as a substitute for experimental replication (25Lee M.-L.T. Kuo F.C. Whitmore G.A. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9834-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Genes of interest were identified using the described filtering protocols and examined for statistically significant differences in expression. These analyses revealed that expression of myr-Akt in the heart resulted in the differential regulation of 40 (21 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated) of the ∼11,000 genes examined (Tables I and II).Table IGenes significantly up-regulated in myr-Akt-expressing miceGene name-Fold change pGenBank™MLC1F/MLC3F11.8<0.01X12973Ovary testis transcribed11.1<0.01X96603Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-55.4<0.05L12447Growth differentiation factor-85.1<0.01U84005FXYD ion transport regulator 53.6<0.05U72680Procollagen, type VIII, α12.8<0.05X66976Lysozyme P2.8<0.01X51547Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 22.7<0.05AI847904Pigment epithelium-derived factor2.6<0.05AF036164Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein2.5<0.01AF041847Receptor activity modifying protein 12.1<0.05AJ250489Complement component 1qc2.1<0.01X66295Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11a2.0<0.05AF093669Odorant-binding protein Ib2.0<0.05AW046850Ia-associated invariant chain1.9<0.05X00496Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L1.6<0.01AB009392Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein1.6<0.05X573374 ESTs(3.0–1.8)<0.05Genes identified as up-regulated by microarrays were filtered and analyzed as described.

Myosin alkali light chain 1 fast/3 fast (MLC1F/3F, up-regulated 11.8-fold) is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle (26Neville C. Gonzales D. Houghton L. McGrew M.J. Rosenthal N. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the ovary testis transcribed (OTT, up-regulated 11.1-fold) gene is usually only expressed in the ovary or the testis (27Kerr S.M. Taggart M.H. Lee M. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Induction of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mTOR has been observed previously (28Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although a direct connection to Akt has not been reported. Some genes of related function were coordinately regulated by chronic Akt expression. For instance, the potent inhibitor of angiogenesis pigment epithelium-derived factor was up-regulated 2.6-fold, while the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor was down-regulated 1.8-fold. In addition, transcripts for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1), both involved in fatty acid metabolism, were down-regulated. The differential expression of six up-regulated and four down-regulated genes, identified by microarray analysis, were validated by QRT-PCR. Relative transcript levels were determined in F3, 20 line TG-positive males compared with TG-negative male littermate controls (Fig. 1). QRT-PCR analysis confirmed 7 of the 10 genes were statistically differentially regulated (p < 0.05) in the 20 line. Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and IGF-II, although differentially regulated in accordance with microarray data, did not achieve statistical significance. Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein and pigment epithelium-derived factor were subsequently confirmed as differentially regulated (p < 0.05) in the 564 line. Although the -fold change of some genes (IGFBP-5, pigment epithelium-derived factor, PGC-1, PPAR, and vascular endothelial growth factor), as determined by QRT-PCR analysis, correlated with the -fold change reported by microarray analysis there were three major discrepancies. The greatest discrepancy was observed in the expression levels of OTT, which was reported as 11.1-fold up-regulated by microarray analysis compared with 675-fold by QRT-PCR (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). The second major discrepancy was seen in the expression levels of growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), which was reported as 5.1-fold up-regulated in TG20-positive hearts by microarray analysis compared with 18.4-fold up-regulated by QRT-PCR. These discrepancies may be explained, in part, by the greater dynamic range afforded by QRT-PCR analysis. However, this explanation cannot account for the difference between microarray and QRT-PCR data for MLC1F/3F expression. An 11.8-fold (p < 0.01) up-regulation of MLC1F/3F was recorded by microarray analysis compared with a 1.7-fold (p < 0.05) up-regulation as determined by QRT-PCR. The relative expression of MLC1F/3F was further examined by Northern blot analysis, which revealed a modest increase in MLC1F/3F mRNA levels in TG-positive hearts in accordance with the QRT-PCR data and in deference to the microarray data (data not shown).Figure 2Amplification curves and postamplification dissociation curves for OTT in 20 line mice. Total RNA was prepared from 20 line TG and littermate (LM) controls and subjected to QRT-PCR analysis of OTT mRNA levels using gene-specific primers and postamplification melt curve analysis. A no template control (NTC) and a no amplification control (NAC) were included to confirm accumulation of a single PCR product of the predicted melting temperature in the absence of DNA contamination. A, amplification: amplified product was detected after an average of 18.7 cycles of PCR in TG hearts compared with an average of 28.1 cycles in littermate control hearts (n = 3 in both groups). Accumulation of nonspecific product was observed in the no template control after 33 cycles. No amplification was observed in the no amplification control confirming the absence of DNA contamination. B, melting point analysis: the first derivative of the postamplification dissociation curve demonstrates that the accumulated product has a single melting point in accordance with that predicted for the specific OTT amplicon. Minimal nonspecific primer-dimer was observed in the no template control, and no DNA-derived product was observed in the no amplification control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To control for differences in transgene insertion, expression, and activity, we determined the relative expression of the 10 genes examined by QRT-PCR in the 20 line in a second myr-Akt-expressing line, the 564 line (Fig. 1). For all genes except OTT, the pattern of differential expression observed in TG20 mice was confirmed in TG564 mice, although the -fold change in expression was significantly greater in the 564 line for GDF-8 and IGFBP-5 (64.9versus 18.4, p < 0.01 and 6.0versus 3.8, p < 0.05, respectively; Fig.1 A). Although OTT mRNA was detected in the TG564 hearts, there was no difference in the low level of expression between TG-positive and -negative littermates. We next examined whether IGFBP-5 and/or GDF-8 were directly regulated by acute Akt activation in cardiomyocytes using an in vitro system (4Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). NRVMs were infected with Ad·EGFP, Ad·myr-Akt, or dominant-negative Ad·Akt(AA). Ad·Akt(AA) served as a full-length control for the Akt molecule, including the pleckstrin homology domain but lacking catalytic activity. The effects of these constructs on IGFBP-5 and GDF-8 gene expression were determined by QRT-PCR (Fig.3 A). Expression of Ad·myr-Akt, at levels comparable to those observed in the TG mice (Fig. 3 B), significantly up-regulated IGFBP-5 (7.2-fold,p < 0.05) compared with Ad·Akt(AA). This finding corroborates a previous study in vascular smooth muscle cells that demonstrated IGFBP-5 mRNA up-regulation by IGF-I in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR-dependent manner (28Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ad·myr-Akt did not alter the expression level of GDF-8 at 24 h and had no effect on GDF-8 expression at either 48 or 72 h (data not shown). Akt protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury (5Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A.

Thus, the mechanisms of Akt cardioprotection remain incompletely defined and may include transcriptional effects. The recent identification of Akt-dependent transcripts (e.g. Glut-1, Bcl-2, and Fas ligand) (10Barthel A. Okino S.T. Liao J. Nakatani K., Li, J. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

We characterized the transcriptional effects of myr-Akt expression in the heart using DNA microarrays. It has been suggested that DNA microarray experiments should be repeated with at least three replicates (25Lee M.-L.T. Kuo F.C. Whitmore G.A. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9834-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and that the resulting data sets should be filtered and validated to minimize erroneous data. Indeed, as much as one-third of the variation seen during an experimental comparison may be attributable to variations intrinsic to the arrays themselves (30Friddle C.J. Koga T. Rubin E.M. Bristow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6745-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, data filters should be used with caution as they can increase the number of false negative results. Thus changes in important, low copy transcripts, which are excluded from analysis by virtue of their low AvDiffs and/or their increased propensity to be called “absent,” may be missed. We observed significant changes in the expression of 40 (∼0.4%) of the genes examined in myr-Akt-expressing hearts (Tables I and II). Of note, the two transcripts with the greatest -fold changes, OTT and GDF-8, were in the group of genes identified using the “low stringency” filter. This finding illustrates how potentially important data may be missed if too stringent a filter is applied to microarray data sets. We have demonstrated that Akt activation increases the transcription of IGFBP-5 in the heart. IGFBP-5 may have direct and/or indirect anti-apoptotic activity (31Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 32Perks C.M. McCaig C. Holly J.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Roschier M.

Biochem. 2002; 84: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, IGFBP-5 up-regulation, in an Akt-dependent manner, may be of particular importance to the cardioprotective effects of Akt. In the light of previous studies, Akt-dependent IGFBP-5 up-regulation in the heart is likely to be mediated through mTOR (28Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting to note that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, can dramatically attenuate the protective effects of insulin, which activates Akt, in the heart (29Jonassen A.K. Sack M.N. Mjos O.D. Yellon D.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In this study, we have also shown that Akt down-regulates PGC-1 and PPAR-α in the heart. This may shift cardiomyocyte metabolism away from fatty acid metabolism in favor of glycolysis, which has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes during transient ischemia (35Apstein C.S. Gravino F.N. Haudenschild C.C. Circ. Res. 1983; 52: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Confirmation of microarray data by a previously validated and established technique should be performed for a selection of differentially regulated genes and in particular for genes of specific interest. Of the 10 genes analyzed by QRT-PCR, nine were confirmed in one or both of the transgenic lines as significantly differentially expressed in keeping with the microarray data. However, the degree of differential regulation of OTT, GDF-8, and MLC1F/3F determined by QRT-PCR differed markedly from microarray results (Tables I and II and Fig. 1). OTT mRNA has been described only in the testis and ovary (27Kerr S.M. Taggart M.H. Lee M. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and it was initially unclear why this gene should be up-regulated by Akt activation in the heart. As the inheritance in the 20 line is X-linked and OTT is encoded on the X chromosome (27Kerr S.M. Taggart M.H. Lee M. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the up-regulation of OTT may be an insertional effect of the transgene construct. Consistent with this hypothesis, OTT was not differentially regulated in the 564 line in which the low level of expression was similar to that seen in transgene-negative littermates from both lines and wild-type controls (data not shown). The possibility that the discrepancy between the two lines represents an insertional effect on an autosome in the TG564 mice (for example in atrans-acting element regulating OTT expression) appears less likely but has not been formally excluded. As microarray characterization of transgenic mice becomes more common and the murine physical map better characterized, the hitherto latent frequency of insertional events may become more apparent. The disparity between microarray and QRT-PCR data for the expression levels of GDF-8 and MLC1F/3F highlights two other important limitations of microarray data: dynamic range and sequence specificity. The -fold change in expression of GDF-8 in TG20 hearts, compared with littermate controls, was reported as 5.1-fold up-regulated by microarray analysis. In contrast, analysis of GDF-8 expression in the 20 line by QRT-PCR, likely a more accurate means of quantifying mRNA levels, revealed that GDF-8 was up-regulated by 18.4-fold. This underestimation of -fold change was even greater for OTT, which was found to be 11.1-fold up-regulated by microarray analysis compared with 675-fold by QRT-PCR (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). The problem of false positive results reported by microarray analysis was illustrated by the MLC1F/3F data, reported as 11.8-fold up-regulated by microarray analysis compared with 1.7-fold (20 line) and 1.4-fold (564 line) by QRT-PCR (Table I and Fig.1). This false positive result could reflect an error in the sequences on the microarray, the occurrence of which was dramatically demonstrated when up to one-third of the sequences on one set of mouse arrays were found to be wrong (37Knight J. Nature. 2001; 410: 860-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Other possibilities for this type of error include cross-hybridization by splice variants, related genes, and/or pseudogenes. The Akt/mTOR pathway has been identified as the crucial regulator of skeletal muscle and pancreatic islet cell hypertrophy in vivo (38Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wen W. Stahlhut S. Welling C.M. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 39Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). In both our myr-Akt-expressing mouse lines cardiac hypertrophy, with no evidence of decompensation, was observed at 6 weeks (20Matsui, T., Li, L., Wu, J. C., Cook, S. A., Nagoshi, T., Picard, M. H., Liao, R., and Rosenzweig, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Akt therefore promotes both skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. As Akt promotes cardiac hypertrophy, we hypothesize that the observed up-regulation of GDF-8, a negative regulator of muscle growth, acts as part of a negative feedback loop limiting heart size. The phenomenon of negative feedback and activation of adaptive mechanisms is recognized but infrequently described in transgenic and knockout mice (40Godecke A. Schrader J. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Fishman G.I. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GDF-8, also termed myostatin, is highly conserved across species, and although first characterized in skeletal muscle (42McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12457-12461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 43McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar) it has also been identified in the heart (44Sharma M. Kambadur R. Matthews K.G. Somers W.G. Devlin G.P. Conaglen J.V. Fowke P.J. Bass J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that GDF-8 up-regulation is a secondary event is supported by our in vitro experiments where expression of myr-Akt, at levels similar to those seen in TG mice (Fig. 3 B), resulted in the up-regulation of IGFBP-5 but not GDF-8 (Fig. 3 A). It remains unclear whether GDF-8 expression is related to myocyte size or organ mass (24Conlon I. Raff M. Cell. 1999; 96: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In summary, these data demonstrate that chronic Akt activation results in the differential regulation of ≥40 genes in the heart. Several of the observed changes generate intriguing hypotheses regarding the effects of Akt in the heart and possible mechanisms underlying Akt-mediated cardioprotection. Akt-dependent up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule IGFBP-5 may be of particular importance and could contribute to the observed cytoprotective effects of Akt in the heart. Similarly Akt down-regulation of PGC-1 and PPAR-α could shift myocytes toward glycolytic metabolism previously shown to help preserve cardiomyocyte function and survival during transient ischemia (35Apstein C.S. Gravino F.N. Haudenschild C.C. Circ. Res. 1983; 52: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Chronic Akt activation in the heart was associated with the differential regulation of a subset of genes that are dissimilar to those observed with acute Akt activation in other cell types, emphasizing the tissue and temporal specificity of changes in transcription profiles (9Kuhn I. Bartholdi M.F. Salamon H. Feldman R.I. Roth R.A. Johnson P.H. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the myr-Akt mice, some changes (e.g. IGFBP-5) appear to be direct consequences of Akt activation and were recapitulated in cardiomyocytes in vitro, while other transcripts (e.g. GDF-8) were not induced by acute Akt activation in vitro and therefore likely represent an indirect effect of the transgene. Given the role of GDF-8 in limiting skeletal muscle growth, we hypothesize that the dramatic up-regulation of GDF-8 observed in hypertrophied hearts may represent a negative feedback mechanism. However, additional studies will be necessary to demonstrate the functional relevance of the observed alterations in transcript levels. Finally, while our transcript profiling and QRT-PCR data were generally concordant, there were some striking discrepancies in the quantitative assessment of mRNA changes, underscoring the importance of validation of DNA microarray results through additional independent techniques."

Myoferlin is highly homologous to dysferlin and like dysferlin is a plasma membrane protein with six C2 domains highly expressed in muscle. C2 domains are found in a variety of membrane-associated proteins where they have been implicated in calcium, phospholipid, and protein-binding. We investigated the pattern of dysferlin and myoferlin expression in a cell culture model of muscle development and found that dysferlin is expressed in mature myotubes. In contrast, myoferlin is highly expressed in elongated “prefusion” myoblasts and is decreased in mature myotubes where dysferlin expression is greatest. We tested ferlin C2 domains for their ability to bind phospholipid in a calcium-sensitive manner. We found that C2A, the first C2 domain of dysferlin and myoferlin, bound 50% phosphatidylserine and that phospholipid binding was regulated by calcium concentration. A dysferlin point mutation responsible for muscular dystrophy was engineered into the dysferlin C2A domain and demonstrated reduced calcium-sensitive phospholipid binding. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism for muscular dystrophy in which calcium-regulated phospholipid binding is abnormal, leading to defective maintenance and repair of muscle membranes.

Miyoshi myopathy Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy 2B glutathioneS-transferase phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine The ferlin family is an emerging group of mammalian proteins implicated in genetic disease. The ferlin family is named for its homology to the Caenorhabditis elegans proteinfer-1 (1Achanzar W.E. Ward S. J.

The function of dysferlin and the mechanism by which dysferlin mutations lead to muscle dysfunction are unknown. It was recently reported (5Piccolo F. Moore S.A. Ford G.C. Campbell K.P. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Selcen D. Stilling G. Engel A.G. Neurology. 2001; 56: 1472-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that an abnormal accumulation of submembraneous vesicles is a feature of dysferlin mutant muscle. Myoferlin is highly related to dysferlin and like dysferlin is also found at the plasma membrane in heart and skeletal muscle (7Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J., Ly, C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To date, myoferlin has not been linked with any human disease, but its location on human chromosome 10q24 and its expression pattern make it a candidate gene for an autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia, SPG9, a disorder associated with muscle wasting and weakness (8Seri M. Cusano R. Forabosco P. Cinti R. Caroli F. Picco P. Bini R. Morra V.B., De Michele G. Lerone M. Silengo M. Pela I. Borrone C. Romeo G. Devoto M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 586-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on homology to fer-1 and their predicted protein domain structure, the mammalian ferlins may have evolved specialized roles for cell type-specific membrane fusion. Myoferlin and dysferlin each have a single carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain and six C2 domains that are predicted to reside in a large cytoplasmic domain (9Britton S. Freeman T. Vafiadaki E. Keers S. Harrison R. Bushby K. Bashir R. Genomics. 2000; 68: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have shown that the C2 domain is an independently folding domain composed of eight β strands forming a β sandwich structure (10Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Calcium binding loops reside at one end of the β sandwich structure, and calcium binding is mediated through a conserved group of aspartic acid residues. C2 domains are present in many membrane-associated proteins (12Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Proteins directly implicated in membrane fusion such as the synaptotagmins contain two C2 domains. The first C2 domain of synaptotagmin binds calcium and anionic phospholipids (14Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second synaptotagmin C2 domain aids in protein-protein interactions and homo-oligomerization (16Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I., An, S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and more recently was shown to bind phospholipids (17Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O.

A. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Most recently, data have emerged supporting the role of synaptotagmins as calcium sensors regulating the process of fast exocytosis (19Sugita S. Han W. Butz S. Liu X. Fernandez-Chacon R. Lao Y. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2001; 30: 459-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In synaptotagmins, up to three calcium ions are known to bind at three loops at the end of the β sandwich structure. Because of the predicted protein structure, domain function, and expression of dysferlin and myoferlin at the sarcolemma, we hypothesized that dysferlin and myoferlin are important for membrane fusion, because they occur during muscle development and during muscle repair. To assess this hypothesis, we studied the expression of ferlin proteins in an in vitro model of muscle development (21Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Mature skeletal muscle is a syncytium that forms from the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts to multinucleate myotubes. We found that myoferlin was highly expressed in myoblasts that have elongated prior to fusion to myotubes. After fusion, myoferlin expression was decreased. Dysferlin expression increased concomitant with fusion and maturation of myotubes. Given that ferlins are expressed in the correct spatiotemporal pattern to play a role in membrane fusion events in muscle, we studied the biochemical properties of myoferlin and dysferlin C2 domains. We found that the first C2 domain, C2A, bound a negatively charged phospholipid mixture similar to the phospholipid composition of the inner surface of the plasma membrane (22Sessions A. Horwitz A.F.

Furthermore, C2A binding to phospholipids was calcium-sensitive. A point mutation in the C2A domain of dysferlin that causes muscular dystrophy showed abnormal calcium sensitivity and reduced phospholipid binding. Together, these data suggest a role for the ferlin proteins in membrane fusion and a novel mechanism for muscular dystrophy. C2C12 cells were cultured and harvested at different timepoints in differentiation. Reducing serum content in the medium to 2% induced differentiation. Cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cellular debris was removed by brief centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was assayed with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blotted with Myof2 or Dysf1 (7Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J., Ly, C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) at 1:1000 in 5% milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunochemicals) was used at 1:5000. ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) substrate was used for detection and visualized on Kodak Biomax MS film. Immunofluorescence was performed on C2C12 cells grown on sterile glass coverslips in tissue culture dishes. The coverslips were fixed in methanol for 2 min, rehydrated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline + 5% fetal bovine serum. They were incubated with Myof2 at 1:100. After secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3, the cells were mounted in Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs), and images were captured with an Axiophot microscope and Axiovision (Carl Zeiss) software. Sequence alignments to identify C2 domains were performed with MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). The myoferlin C2A construct encoded for amino acids 1–124 (nucleotides 97–471 of GenBankTM accession numberAF182316), myoferlin C2B construct represents amino acids 197–327 (nucleotides 685–1079), myoferlin C2C construct represents amino acids 357–505 (nucleotides 1165–1611), C2D construct represents amino acids 1116–1254 (nucleotides 3442–3860), C2E construct represents amino acids 1518–1685 (nucleotides 4648–5153), and C2F construct represents amino acids 1771–1930 (nucleotides 5407–5888). Primers corresponding to each of these nucleotide regions were designed and used to amplify inserts from a human myoferlin cDNA template. The inserts were ligated into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Human dysferlin C2A was amplified using the following two primers: 350F Dys C2A-EcoR, 5′-GGAATTCATGCTGAGGGTCTTCATCCTCTATGCC-3′, and 745R Dys C2A-NotI, 5′-ATCAGCGGCCGCTGTGTAGGACACCTGCAGGACCAGCGAGG-3′, using plasmid A15 generously provided by Drs. R. H. Brown and M. Ho. The dysferlin C2A domain was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The dysferlin V67D mutation was generated by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-CAGGGCTCTGAGCTCCATGATGTGGTCAAAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTTTGACCACATCATGGAGCTCAGAGCCCTG-3′, with Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The normal and mutant inserts were digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into pGEX4T-1. All sequences were verified by cycle sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli. Log phase E. coli were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.35 m NaCl, 0.75% Nonidet P-40) and sonicated for 3 × 10 s with 15-s rest intervals. Inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing soluble fusion protein was recovered. Fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, washed four times in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EGTA), and used for lipid binding assays essentially as described previously (15Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes were made from a total of 1 mg of lipid (Avanti Lipids, Alabaster, AL) plus 10 μCi of [3H]phosphatidylcholine (Amersham Biosciences), lipids were mixed, dried under nitrogen, dried under vacuum overnight, and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A. The lipid suspension was extruded through a 0.1-μm filter in an extruder (Avanti Lipids) to give uniform-sized vesicles. 7.5 × 105 cpm of lipids were used per assay with 15 μg of protein. Protein was quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay. Free calcium concentrations were calculated with WEBMAXC version 2.10 (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/webmaxc2.htm) (24Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in MilliQ water (Millipore) at room temperature, and a 0.1 m calcium standard (Orion) was used for making all of the solutions. Proteins were washed three times in the specified calcium buffer, and lipid mixtures were brought to the appropriate free calcium concentration before mixing for the assay. Protein and lipid were incubated for 15 min at 24 °C with continuous vortexing. Sepharose fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min and washed three times in the appropriate calcium buffer. 3H-Lipid was quantified by scintillation counting. Assays were performed in triplicate with at least two separate lipid and protein preparations. Assays performed in the presence of 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, or 1m NaCl were treated in the same manner. Curve-fitting and binding constant calculations were performed using Origin 6.1 software (Origin Lab Corp., Northampton, MA). For dysferlin C2A lipid binding assays, 4 × 105 cpm of lipids were used, and results were normalized to 15 μg of protein. To investigate the potential role of dysferlin and myoferlin in skeletal muscle membrane fusion, we examined the expression of dysferlin and myoferlin during myoblast differentiation in C2C12 cells, a cell line that undergoes differentiation from mononucleate myoblasts to multinucleate syncytial myotubes (21Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Cultures representing different phases of fusion and differentiation in C2C12 cells were harvested and tested for dysferlin and myoferlin expression (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblotting with an antibody specific to dysferlin (7Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J., Ly, C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that dysferlin was expressed at the greatest levels in mature myotubes (Fig.1 A, bottom, and B, lane 3). An antibody specific to myoferlin (7Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J., Ly, C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) demonstrated that myoferlin is expressed at the greatest levels in cultures with high numbers of prefusion myoblasts (Fig. 1 A, top, andB, lane 1). The level of myoferlin protein decreased after fusion of myoblasts to myotubes had occurred (Fig.1 B, lane 3). To elucidate further the timing of myoferlin expression, we tested C2C12 cultures at different stages of myoblast differentiation for expression of myoferlin using indirect immunofluorescence and an antibody specific to myoferlin. We noted high levels of myoferlin protein expression in those myoblasts that had become elongated prior to myoblast fusion into myotubes (Fig. 2,A–D, arrows). These single-celled myoblasts retained high level myoferlin expression, whereas those myoblasts that had undergone cell-cell contact, fusion, and differentiation had greatly reduced myoferlin protein expression (asterisk). High magnification views of myoferlin expression in C2C12 cells during myocyte differentiation demonstrated that myoferlin is expressed in vesicles within the myoblasts (Fig. 2, E and F,arrow). We analyzed the sequence of dysferlin and myoferlin using the SMART protein domain analysis program (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) (25Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 26Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) in which at least six C2 domains were predicted (Fig.3 A). In myoferlin, there is a potential seventh C2 domain (amino acids 1302–1409, GenBankTM accession number AF182316) with a highE value indicating a low confidence level and lacking the majority of the conserved residues found in other C2 domains. Therefore, the sequence analysis is most consistent with six C2 domains in dysferlin and myoferlin. The position of each of these C2 domains in the linear dysferlin and myoferlin protein sequence is indicated in the schematic in Fig. 3 A. Of note, there is high conservation between homologous C2 domains of dysferlin and myoferlin (an average of 74% homology). That is, C2A of dysferlin is more related to C2A of myoferlin than it is to other C2 domains in dysferlin (an average of 15% homology). Fig. 3 B shows the alignment of consensus C2 domain with the C2A domains of dysferlin and myoferlin. This alignment demonstrates the conserved residues found in many C2 domains as well as the predicted calcium binding residues. Based on sequence alignments, we predicted that these domains have type II topology similar to those seen in cytosolic phospholipase A2, the non-classical protein kinase C isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ, and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isoforms. This topology prediction is based on the presence of the predicted calcium binding residues between the first and second β strands and between the fifth and sixth β strands as seen in all topology II C2 domains (13Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The C2 domains at the amino terminus of proteins typically use topology II (13Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The calcium binding sites of topology II C2 domains, similar to dysferlin and myoferlin C2A, have been noted to often lack one or more of the five conserved aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues and to contain alternative residues capable of coordination (13Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). All six myoferlin C2 domains were generated as GST fusion proteins (Fig.4 A). Each purified fusion protein was tested for its ability to bind to phospholipid vesicles containing lipids found in the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane in muscle (22Sessions A. Horwitz A.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Sessions A. Horwitz A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles containing 50% phosphatidylserine (PS) in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bound myoferlin C2A in the presence of 1 mm calcium (Fig. 4 B). The lipids composed of 50% PS did not show binding to any of the other five myoferlin C2 domains, C2B, C2C, C2D, C2E, and C2F (Fig. 4 B). None of the six myoferlin C2 domains demonstrated binding to 100% PC vesicles in the presence or absence of calcium (Fig. 4 C). These findings are consistent with the phospholipid binding properties of a number of homologous C2 domains that similarly do not bind neutral phospholipid (15Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but instead demonstrate binding to the negatively charged PS (14Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Johnson J.E. Zimmerman M.L. Daleke D.L. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The lipids containing 25% PS in PC showed no binding to myoferlin C2A, C2C, or C2F regardless of calcium concentration (data not shown), suggesting that a significant presence of negatively charged phospholipid is required for the interaction with myoferlin C2A. Also, 50% phosphatidylinositol and 50% phosphatidylethanolamine vesicles were similarly tested and did not bind to any of the six myoferlin C2 domains (data not shown). A range of calcium concentrations was tested to determine the binding constant of myoferlin C2A for 50% PS. C2A was unable to bind PS-containing vesicles in the presence of normal intracellular calcium levels (0.1 μm); however the ability to bind rapidly increased with half-maximal lipid binding observed at 1 μm (Fig. 5 A). The interaction of myoferlin C2A with PS is abolished in the presence of high salt, consistent with the predicted electrostatic interaction (Fig. 5 B). The requirement for calcium is also specific, because in the presence of Mg2+ or K+, phospholipid binding did not occur (Fig. 5 B). Mutations in dysferlin lead to two forms of muscular dystrophy, MM and LGMD2B (3Bashir R. Britton S. Strachan T. Keers S. Vafiadaki E. Lako M. Richard I. Marchand S. Bourg N. Argov Z. Sadeh M.

Arahata K. Osame M. J. Neurol. Sci. 2001; 184: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and there is a phenotypic range of symptoms that varies from mild to severe associated with these mutations. We tested the ability of dysferlin C2A to bind lipid vesicles containing 50% PS and found that dysferlin C2A demonstrated similar binding properties to myoferlin C2A (Fig. 6 A). Dysferlin C2A bound 50% PS with a half-maximal lipid binding at 4.5 μmcalcium. A mutation in dysferlin was recently described (V67D, GenBankTM accession number AF075575) that is associated with LGMD (31Illarioshkin S.N. Ivanova-Smolenskaya I.A. Greenberg C.R. Nylen E. Sukhorukov V.S. Poleshchuk V.V. Markova E.D. Wrogemann K. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1931-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Individuals with the V67D mutation exhibited a range of phenotypic severity consistent with both MM and LGMD2B. This mutation alters a residue within the C2A domain of dysferlin and introduces an acidic residue for a conserved non-polar residue within a β strand (Fig. 3, asterisk). We introduced the V67D mutation into dysferlin C2A and found abnormal phospholipid binding through a range of calcium concentrations (Fig. 6 A, dashed line). A similar mutation was engineered into myoferlin C2A (I67D) and similarly demonstrated abnormal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding (data not shown). We determined that the expression of dysferlin C2A and C2A-V67D was similar and that an identical amount of protein was assayed for calcium sensitive phospholipid binding (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the abnormal binding properties of dysferlin C2A-V67D arise from the mutation responsible for the LGMD2B and MM phenotypes. Similar to most C2 domain-containing proteins, myoferlin and dysferlin are found associated with membranes. The predicted topology of dysferlin and myoferlin places the six C2 domains within the cytoplasm anchored by their carboxyl-terminal transmembrane regions. In a cell culture model of myoblast differentiation, dysferlin was expressed at low levels in myoblasts and increased its expression upon differentiation as myoblasts fused to myotubes. In contrast, myoferlin was expressed highly in the prefusion myoblast. These prefusion myoblasts were distinguished from quiescent myoblasts by their elongated appearance and an accumulation of myoferlin-containing vesicles. The fusion of myoblasts to myotubes is known to involve vesicular structures (35Kalderon N. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, the repair of torn surface membranes uses a number of mechanisms that may also include vesicular structures (36McNeil P.L. Terasaki M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E124-E129Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because of their intracellular location, the spatiotemporal pattern of expression, and domain structure, we hypothesize a coordinated role of myoferlin and dysferlin where myoferlin may be specialized for myoblast fusion and dysferlin may be important for membrane fusion and repair in the mature myotube. To examine the potential role of ferlin proteins in membrane fusion events, we studied the biochemical properties of ferlin C2A domains and found that myoferlin and dysferlin C2A domains bind phospholipid in a calcium-sensitive fashion. The ferlin proteins are the only known C2 domain-containing proteins that have more than three C2 domains, and the ferlin proteins are unique with six C2 domains. In other C2 domain-containing proteins, a single C2 domain is often responsible for calcium-dependent phospholipid binding. We tested all six C2 domains of myoferlin and found that only C2A demonstrated the binding to phospholipids under our experimental conditions. The role of the remaining ferlin C2 domains is unknown, but similar to other C2 domain-containing proteins, these domains may be involved in protein-protein interactions. The requirement for the negatively charged phospholipid may be influenced by the number of positively charged residues in the calcium binding loops of the dysferlin/myoferlin C2A domain. A negatively charged lipid membrane domain is necessary for membrane fusion to occur (37Papahadjopoulos D. Poste G. Nicholson G.L. Membrane Fusion. 5. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1978: 766-790Google Scholar, 38Papahadjopoulos D. Poste G. Vail W.J. Korn E.D. Methods in Membrane Biology. 10. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1979: 1-121Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, the myoblast membrane is associated with an unusual composition of phospholipids that is distinct from fibroblasts and consistent with the phospholipid binding profile of C2A (22Sessions A. Horwitz A.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Sessions A. Horwitz A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The requirement for 50% PS for C2A binding suggests that C2A may respond to lipid clustering in the membrane or to specific regions of the membrane with higher concentrations of PS. Myoblast fusion is critical during muscle development and in the repair of existing muscle fibers damaged through regular use and exercise and in degenerative disorders like muscular dystrophy. Myoblast fusion has been shown to require an influx of calcium from the extracellular space (39David J.D. See W.M. Higginbotham C.A. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that the fusion of myoblast membranes requires calcium concentrations in the range of 1.4 μm(40Knudsen K.A. Horwitz A.F. Dev. Biol. 1977; 58: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and localized pools of increased calcium are present near the regions of membrane fusion (41Lobo M.V. Santander R.G. Cuadrado G.M. Alonso F.J. Histochem. J. 1999; 31: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Dysferlin and myoferlin C2A phospholipid binding occurred at calcium concentrations above 1 μm, consistent with calcium requirements for myoblast fusion. The repair of membrane tears also requires calcium (36McNeil P.L. Terasaki M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E124-E129Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is known that in animal models for muscular dystrophy, these membrane tears occur more frequently (42Menke A. Jockusch H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). An elevation of myoferlin has been observed in microsomal fractions from this same animal model (7Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J., Ly, C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), potentially reflecting an increased need for membrane repair machinery in this damage-susceptible muscle. The first C2 domain of dysferlin demonstrated similar calcium and phospholipid binding properties to myoferlin C2A. The cooperativity of binding of these two C2 domains is consistent with binding multiple calcium ions. The C2A domains are found at the extreme amino termini of dysferlin and myoferlin, most remote from the transmembrane domain at the carboxyl terminus. We speculate that this placement may indicate a role for the C2A domain in localizing the amino terminus to the plasma membrane or possibly in the attraction of ferlin-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. In support of this finding, it has been noted that dysferlin mutant muscle displays an increase in vesicle accumulation under the membrane (5Piccolo F. Moore S.A. Ford G.C. Campbell K.P. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Selcen D. Stilling G. Engel A.G. Neurology. 2001; 56: 1472-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additionally, dysferlin interacts with caveolin, another membrane-associated protein important for intracellular vesicular trafficking (44Matsuda C. Hayashi Y.K. Ogawa M. Aoki M. Murayama K. Nishino I. Nonaka I. Arahata K. Brown R.H., Jr. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Dysferlin missense mutations may alter dysferlin function. Illarioshkinet al. (31Illarioshkin S.N. Ivanova-Smolenskaya I.A. Greenberg C.R. Nylen E. Sukhorukov V.S. Poleshchuk V.V. Markova E.D. Wrogemann K. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1931-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) described a mutation associated with both mild and severe phenotypes that changed a single amino acid (V67D) within the C2A domain of dysferlin. This amino acid substitution occurs within one of the eight β strands and inserts a novel charge residue. Molecular modeling suggests that this residue is important to the core structure of the C2 domain (data not shown). Dysferlin C2A-V67D showed partial phospholipid binding at lower calcium concentrations but minimal phospholipid binding at higher calcium concentrations. The peak intracellular calcium concentration within a myofiber can be as high as 14 μm (45Wang Z.M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1338-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thus it is highly probable that this mutation alters phospholipid binding of dysferlin in vivo. There are two important membrane fusion events in skeletal muscle. Myoblasts fuse into myotubes during muscle development in the embryonic state, and in the adult, this process occurs to repair and regenerate muscle fibers that have been damaged. The increased expression of myoferlin specifically in the prefusion myoblast suggests that this protein plays a critical role in this event. By demonstrating the ability of myoferlin and dysferlin to bind calcium and phospholipids, two of the key players in muscle membrane fusion, we have now placed ferlin family members in the correct temporal and spatial position for a role in membrane fusion in the development and repair of muscle.

The molecular masses of AJL-1 and AJL-2 were 16,091 and 31,743 Da, respectively. Intact AJL-1 was comprised of two identical 16-kDa subunits having blocked N termini and no disulfide bonds. AJL-2 was a homodimer with disulfide bonds. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the AJL-2 monomer, the nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding this lectin was determined by 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced amino acid sequence showed ∼30% homology with C-type lectins, which bind to carbohydrates in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition, AJL-2 exhibited highly conserved consensus amino acid residues of the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, although this lectin showed Ca2+-independent activity. Gene expression of AJL-2 was detected only in the skin by Northern blot analysis, and this lectin localization was demonstrated in the club cells by immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that AJL-2 is secreted on the body surface and function as a component of skin mucus. AJL-2 agglutinated Escherichia coli and suppressed its growth, suggesting that this lectin is involved in host defense.

Gene expression of AJL-2 was detected only in the skin by Northern blot analysis, and this lectin localization was demonstrated in the club cells by immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that AJL-2 is secreted on the body surface and function as a component of skin mucus. AJL-2 agglutinated Escherichia coli and suppressed its growth, suggesting that this lectin is involved in host defense. carbohydrate recognition domain phosphate-buffered saline matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight rapid amplification of cDNA ends mannose-binding protein Lectins, which are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are not antibodies and enzymes (1Sharon N.

The functioning of animal lectins vary widely because they are involved in cell-cell interactions, protein trafficking, and primitive defense reactions (6Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

Most known animal lectins are found to exist internally, but some are also found in the skin mucus of several animal species, especially in fish. However, knowledge concerning the structure and functioning of such molecules remains limited. Purification of skin mucus lectins has been performed for many species of fish including the windowpane flounder Lophopsetta maculata (17Kamiya H. Shimizu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 622: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Arabian Gulf catfishArius thalassinus (18Al-Hassan J.M. Thomson M. Summers B. Criddle R.S. Comp. Biochem.

Among these lectins, the primary structures were determined in the conger eel only for galectins referred to as congerins I and II (24Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Muramoto K. Kagawa D. Sato T. Ogawa T. Nishida Y. Kamiya H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 123B: 33-45Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The structural sequences for skin mucus lectins in animal groups other than fish are also limited and have been reported in only two species, the land slug Incilaria fruhstorferi (26Yuasa H.J. Furuta E. Nakamura A. Takagi T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119B: 479-484Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis (27Marschal P. Herrmann J. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12942-12949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise biological roles of skin mucus lectin have not yet been finally elucidated, although they are possibly involved in self-defense mechanisms; agglutination by lectin likely inhibits pathogenic penetration into the body or colonization at the skin surface. Hemagglutinating activity possibly caused by lectin was reported in the thick, sticky skin mucus of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica (28Suzuki Y. Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi. 1985; 51: 2083Crossref Google Scholar). Lectin is contained in club cells (29Suzuki Y. Kaneko T. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1986; 10: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which compose the eel epidermis in combination with epithelial cells and mucus cells. This was the first report of the localization of a skin mucus lectin in fish, but knowledge of the structure and functioning of this lectin was lacking up until present. In the present study, we first purified eel skin mucus lectins (AJL-1 and AJL-2) and determined the primary structure of AJL-2, which was structurally a C-type lectin but showed Ca2+ independent activity. As a first step to elucidate the purposed defense roles of AJL-2, hemagglutinating activity and growth inhibition activity of this lectin against Escherichia coli were examined. A. japonicaJapanese eels were purchased from a commercial dealer. Skin mucus was collected by scraping with a spatula and was then homogenized with 5 volumes of 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 × g. This obtained supernatant was used as skin mucus extract. Hemagglutinating activity was assayed by the 2-fold serial dilution method. Twenty-five μl of diluted samples were allowed to react with the same volume of a 5% suspension of rabbit red blood cells in microtiter plates having 96 wells. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the activity was determined as the lowest concentration of sample solution giving visible agglutination. Heat stability of the activity was examined by incubation of the skin mucus extract at 20, 40, 60, or 80 °C for 20 min. Before being assayed, all of the samples were cooled on ice. The effects of pH on activity were examined by maintaining the extract at pH 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 13 for 12 h at 4 °C. The effects of NaCl concentration on activity were examined by adding 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1m NaCl to sample. To examine divalent cation requirements, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5, 10, 20, or 50 mm EDTA was used as the assay buffer. To determine specific saccharides, inhibition of hemagglutinating activity via the addition of saccharides was tested by adding 2-fold serial dilutions of test saccharide mixture to wells containing the skin mucus extract using PBS as the assay buffer. The results were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the saccharide completely inhibiting activity. The following saccharides (200 mm each) were examined: d-glucose, d-galactose,d-mannose, d-fucose, d-xylose,l-arabinose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine,N-acetylneuraminic acid, maltose, lactose, saccharose, and melibiose. Lactose was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Skin mucus extract was applied to a column packed with lactose-Sepharose 6B that was equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). Subsequently, the column was washed completely with the same buffer to remove unabsorbed substances. The fractions eluting with 50 mm lactose in the same buffer were collected and tested for hemagglutinating activity. The active fractions were desalted by using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and were then freeze-dried. The freeze-dried fraction was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. The lectins were subsequently separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) on a Superose 6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer used to dissolve freeze-dried lectins; flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The fractions showing positive absorbance at 280 nm were collected and examined for hemagglutinating activity. PAGE was performed using 5–20% gradient gel (PAGELTM NPG-520L, ATTO Corporation). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 15% gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. Dalton Mark VII-L (Sigma) molecular markers were used in molecular mass determination. After conducting electrophoresis at 20 mA/gel, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified lectins were analyzed by using a 476A protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The molecular masses were determined by Voyager-DE STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Perspective Biosystems) using 5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. AJL-2 was diluted to a titer of 1:25. PBS containing 5, 10, 20, or 50 mm EDTA or EGTA, 50 mm or 100 mm CaCl2, 50 mm MgCl2, or 50 mmZnCl2 was used as the assay buffer. The activity was measured after incubation at 4 °C for 12 h. Fish were anesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol and sacrificed by decapitation. The skin was stripped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until RNA preparation. Total RNA was extracted with Isogen RNA extraction solution (Nippon Gene). The following oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: primer 1, 5′-GTN(C/T)TNGGI(C/T)TITA(C/T)GA(A/G)GG-3′; primer 2, 5′-TCNA(A/G)CCAIGT(C/T)TT(C/T)TT(C/T)TC-3′; primer 3, 5′-TGCCTGCCCTGAAGGTTGGG-3′; primer 4, 5′-TCTGAACCCTTATGGAGACC-3′; primer 5, 5′-TGCTCATCTTCACTGTGCTC-3′; primer 6, 5′-TTCAACGTGTCATCACACGC-3′; and primer 7, 5′-CCACGGGCTTAAATGGGTTA-3′. For 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), the following primers were also used: adaptor primer 1, 5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCG-3′; anchor primer, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′; and adaptor primer 2, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′. Each PCR amplification was performed by using the GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 20 μl withTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) and a pair of primers (500 nm each). The first PCR was performed using degenerate primers (primers 1 and 2). First strand cDNA was synthesized from the skin total RNA with the Ready-To-GoTM T-primed first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to 35 cycles of PCR amplification. Each reaction cycle consisted of incubations at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final elongation step was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. For 3′-RACE, first strand cDNA synthesized above was used as the template for 30 cycles of PCR amplification using primer 3 and adaptor primer 1. Each reaction cycle consisted of incubations at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The final elongation step was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. For 5′-RACE, first strand cDNA was synthesized from skin total RNA using a 5′-RACE PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer 4 was used to prime cDNA synthesis. PCR amplification for 40 cycles was performed using primer 4 and the anchor primer. Each reaction cycle consisted of incubations at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Subsequently, nested PCR amplification for 35 cycles was performed with primer 5 and adaptor primer 2 using 10-fold diluted first PCR product obtained above as the template. Each reaction cycle consisted of incubations at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final elongation step was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. The obtained nucleotide sequence by 3′- and 5′-RACE over the coding region was reconfirmed by PCR amplification using primers 6 and 7. Each cDNA fragment amplified by the PCR amplifications described above was subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) vectors (Strategene). Plasmid DNA strands were sequenced using an SQ-5500 DNA sequencer (Hitachi) using a Thermo SequenaseTM premixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The nucleotide sequence was determined for four or five clones obtained by independent amplifications to confirm that the sequence did not harbor any PCR errors. The deduced amino acid sequence obtained was compared with other proteins on the Swissprot data base using the BLAST computer program. Total RNA prepared from skin, gill, intestine, muscle, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and ovary were separated on a 1.5% formamide-agarose gel (10 μg in each lane) and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; AmershamBiosciences). The membrane was UV cross-linked using a SpectrolinkerTM XL-1500 (Spectronics Corporation). The membrane was prehybridized in 6× SSC (90 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and 900 mm NaCl) containing 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and calf thymus DNA (100 ng/ml) at 42 °C for 4 h. A partial AJL-2 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR amplification with primers 1 and 2 was used as a probe. The membrane was hybridized with the probe in the same buffer used for prehybridization at 42 °C for 12 h. The membrane was washed in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 10 min, in 0.5× SSC at 50 °C for 10 min, and finally in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C for 10 min. After washing, it was exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Film) at −80 °C for 7 h. Band size was estimated by comparison with a standard 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Invitrogen). Eel skin was dissected and fixed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The sections at 3-μm thickness were incubated with methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature to inactivate endogenous peroxidase and washed twice in PBS. The sections were incubated with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature for blocking. Antiserum against AJL-2 was raised by immunizing rabbits with the purified protein. The sections were incubated with AJL-2 antiserum at 1:50,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and treated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Antiserum absorbed with excess antigen was used as negative control. The bound antibodies were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.0045% H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). E. coli K12 (XL1-Blue, Toyobo) was cultured in LB at 25 °C for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in 0.5% (v/v) formalin solution to prepare formalin-killed cells. After incubation at 25 °C for 24 h, the formalin-killed cells were collected. The formalin-killed cells were incubated with AJL-2 or PBS at room temperature for 1 h, and agglutination activity was examined under a light microscope. A suppressive test of AJL-2 against growth of E. coli K12 was also carried out. Precultured E. coli was diluted with LB to the level at ∼1.0 × 105 colony forming units/ml. An equivalent volume of this solution was added to 1 ml of PBS or AJL-2 at concentrations of 2 or 200 μg/ml in PBS and incubated at 25 °C with shaking at 180 rpm. After 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 h, 60 μl of cultured solution was removed to measure absorbance at 600 nm. The hemagglutinating activity of the eel skin mucus extract was stable when heated at 20, 30, or 40 °C for 20 min, but decreased when heated at 60 °C for 10 min, and was completely abolished upon heating at 80 °C for 5 min. The activity was nearly completely stable in the pH range of 3–12 but was abolished at pH 2 and 13. Addition of NaCl up to 1 m did not affect activity. Addition of EDTA also showed no effect on activity. Inhibition of activity by saccharides occurred with lactose at a concentration of 3.1 mm (Table I). Other saccharides showed no inhibition at concentrations of 50 mm.Table ISaccharide inhibition of A. japonica skin mucus extract hemagglutinating activity against rabbit erythrocyteSaccharidesMinimum inhibitory concentrationmmd-Glucose>50d-Galactose>50d-Mannose>50d-Fucose>50d-Xylose>50l-Arabinose>50N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine>50N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine>50N-Acetylneuraminic acid>50Maltose>50Lactose3.1Saccharose>50Melibiose>50Inhibition of hemagglutinating activity against rabbit erythrocytes ofA. japonica, skin mucus extract was tested with various saccharides.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of hemagglutinating activity against rabbit erythrocytes ofA. japonica, skin mucus extract was tested with various saccharides. The extract was diluted to a titer of 1:25 with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The concentration of each saccharide leading to complete inhibition was determined. As the first step of purification, lactose-binding lectins in the skin mucus extract were purified on lactose-binding Sepharose 6B. Unabsorbed fractions showed no hemagglutinating activity. As shown in Fig.1A, one protein peak was detected when the buffer was changed to 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm lactose (pH 7.0). This peak fraction showed hemagglutinating activity. Subsequent separation by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column gave two peaks (Fig. 1B). Each peak fraction showed activity. On PAGE, the affinity-purified fraction yielded two protein bands (Fig.2A, lane 1). These could be isolated in an apparently pure form by subsequent gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and3). On native PAGE, the peak 1 protein, named AJL-1, did not yield a sharp band (Fig. 2A, lane 2), whereas the peak 2 protein, named AJL-2, provided a sharp band (Fig. 2A,lane 3). On unreduced SDS-PAGE, the affinity-purified fraction yielded protein bands of ∼16 and 32 kDa, which were the major components of soluble proteins in skin mucus (Fig. 2B,lanes 1 and 2). AJL-1 did not yield a sharp band on PAGE as described above (Fig. 2A, lane 1) but provided a sharp band of ∼16 kDa on both unreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, B, lane 3, and C,lane 2), and the molecular mass estimated by gel filtration was ∼30 kDa (data not shown), indicating that this lectin is composed of two identical 16-kDa subunits. AJL-2 yielded bands of ∼32 kDa on unreduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lane 4), whereas reduced SDS-PAGE yielded a band of ∼16 kDa (Fig. 2C,lane 3), showing that this lectin forms a homodimer with disulfide bonds. The molecular masses of AJL-1 and AJL-2 proteins as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were 16,091 and 31,743 Da (Fig.3), respectively. The N-terminal region of AJL-1 was blocked and thus could not be determined. On the other hand, that of AJL-2 could be determined from Ala1 to His40 as underlined by a dotted linein Fig. 4.Figure 4cDNA nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of AJL-2. The dotted line shows residues determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (40 residues). Based on this sequence, primers 1 and 2 were synthesized, and cDNA clones were then obtained by PCR, 3′-RACE using primer 3 and adaptor primer 1, and 5′-RACE using primers 4 and 5, anchor primer, and adaptor primer 2. The overlapping sequence was reconfirmed by PCR amplification using primers 6 and 7. The deduced amino acid sequence contained a 24-residue signal peptide and a total of 166 residues. The calculated molecular mass of this sequence excluding the signal peptide was 15,870 Da.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hemagglutinating activity of AJL-2 was not altered by the addition of up to 50 mm EDTA or EGTA. The addition of 50 or 100 mm CaCl2, 50 mm MgCl2, or 50 mm ZnCl2 also did not alter activity (Table II). These results show that the activity of AJL-2 is Ca2+-independent.Table IIEffects of divalent cations on the activity of AJL-2BufferHemagglutination activityPBS1:25+ 5 mm EDTA1:25+ 10 mmEDTA1:25+ 20 mm EDTA1:25+ 50 mm EDTA1:25+ 5 mmEGTA1:25+ 10 mm EGTA1:25+ 20 mm EGTA1:25+ 50 mmEGTA1:25+ 50 mmCaCl21:25+ 100 mmCaCl21:25+ 50 mmMgCl21:25+ 50 mmZnCl21:25AJL-2 was diluted to a titer of 1:25 and then incubated with each solution for 12 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 5% rabbit erythrocyte suspension in each solution, hemagglutination activity was measured. Open table in a new tab AJL-2 was diluted to a titer of 1:25 and then incubated with each solution for 12 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 5% rabbit erythrocyte suspension in each solution, hemagglutination activity was measured. A cDNA fragment (55 bp) of AJL-2 was first obtained by PCR using degenerate primers (primers 1 and 2) designed based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 4). Subsequently, clones including the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions were isolated by 3′- and 5′-RACE methods using specific primers (primers 3–5) and anchor primer and adaptor primers 1 and 2, respectively. The overlapping sequence was reconfirmed by PCR amplification using primers 6 and 7. The cDNA of this lectin spanned 792 bp (Fig. 4). This contained a 498-bp open reading frame encoding 166 amino acids including a signal peptide consisting of 24 amino acids having a calculated molecular mass of 15.87 kDa, not including the molecular mass of the signal peptide region. This molecular mass was half of that measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This result also shows that this lectin forms a homodimeric structure and lacks attached carbohydrates. The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were 55 and 208 bp, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of the AJL-2 monomer was compared with that of other proteins on the Swissprot data base using the BLAST computer program. The highest homology was found withPleurodeles lectin, a C-type lectin found in the inner layer of egg jelly of the Iberian ribbed newt Pleurodels waltl (35% identity) (31Tiffoche C. Chesnel A. Jego P. Le Pennec J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, the amino acid sequence of AJL-2 showed ∼30% homology with CRDs of various C-type lectins (Fig. 5) such as rat hepatic lectin (32Leung J.O. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

A single transcript (∼800 bp) was detected only in the skin, but not in other tissues (Fig.6), indicating that this lectin is produced exclusively in the skin. The eel epidermis consisted of three types of cells: epithelial cells, mucus cells, and club cells (29Suzuki Y. Kaneko T. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1986; 10: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the club cells showed positive reactions for the antiserum against AJL-2. Strong positive reactions were concentrated in the secretory vacuoles especially in the cells of the outer layer, whereas weak positive reactions were seen in the cytoplasm of cells of the middle and deeper layers. The number of the cells showing positive reactions was larger in the ventral skin than in the dorsal skin (Fig. 7, B andD). AJL-2 could agglutinate formalin-killed E. coli K12 (Fig.8A). This activity was inhibited by the addition of lactose (data not shown). Absorbance at 600 nm of broth with 1 or 100 μg/ml AJL-2 were lower than that of negative control (Fig. 9), showing that this lectin suppresses the growth of E. coliK12. In the present study, we revealed the existence of two lactose-specific lectins, named AJL-1 and AJL-2 (16,091 and 31,743 Da, respectively), in the skin mucus of the Japanese eel. Of these, we demonstrated the unique nature of AJL-2 through elucidation of its primary structure as determined by 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. AJL-2 possessed a highly conserved CRD corresponding to C-type lectin, which is characterized by its Ca2+-dependent activity; however, this lectin showed divalent cation-independent activity. AJL-2 is synthesized in the skin, exists only in the club cells, and is secreted into the skin mucus. AJL-2 could agglutinate E. coli K12 as well as rabbit erythrocytes, indicating its functioning as a defensive factor. AJL-2 yielded a band on reduced SDS-PAGE approximately half the molecular mass of that on unreduced SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence was also half of that determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, showing that AJL-2 is a dimer composed of identical subunits. The amino acid sequence of this lectin monomer showed ∼30% homology with various C-type lectins (Fig. 5). In particular, this lectin conserved consensus amino acid residues characteristic of C-type lectin CRDs (3Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Four consensus cysteine residues (Cys62, Cys136, Cys152, and Cys160) that are expected to form disulfide bonds (cysteine 1–cysteine 4 and cysteine 2–cysteine 3) were also all conserved. In addition, consensus hydrophobic residues were also highly conserved, indicating that AJL-2 also possesses protein structure similar to that of other C-type lectins. The AJL-2 monomer exhibits three additional cysteines (Cys30, Cys34, and Cys45), suggesting that some of these form disulfide bonds between the two subunits. It has been reported that rat mannose binding protein (MBP)-A CRD binds to two Ca2+ (40Weis W.I. Crichlow G.V. Murthy H.M.K. Hendrickson W.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20678-20686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Similarly, AJL-2 showed conserved Glu101, Asp129, and Asp135 residues that are expected to be involved in binding one of two Ca2+ ions. However, in contrast to rat MBP-A, AJL-2 lacked one basic amino acid residue at this site. The absence of this residue may make AJL-2 show Ca2+-independent activity. AJL-2 includes five conserved residues similar to those in rat MBP-A CRD, Glu126, Asn128, Glu134, Asn148, and Asp149, that would be expected to form a binding site for an additional Ca2+ ion and also for carbohydrates. It is not clear whether the AJL-2 molecule possesses Ca2+ or possesses the same carbohydrate-binding site as rat MBP-A, and further analysis is thus necessary. AJL-2 is therefore a unique C-type lectin that shows Ca2+ independent activity as delineated further below. Northern blot analysis indicates that AJL-2 is synthesized only in the skin. This lectin is expected to be secreted externally from the club cells, becoming a component of skin mucus. This suggests that AJL-2 functions in skin mucus, which harbors the same ionic conditions as water in the surrounding environment. Moreover, AJL-2 shows activity up to 1 m NaCl and in a wide range of pH from 3 to 12. The hemagglutinating activity of AJL-2 was not changed by chelating or by the addition of divalent cation, showing that this activity is Ca2+-independent. These facts are consistent with the mode of life and habitat of the eel. In particular, eels of Anguillidae can survive in wide range of osmotic conditions, even in freshwater containing very low levels of Ca2+, whereas all other Anguilliformes are marine species. A search for similar molecules in marine species of Anguilliformes may thus provide interesting information useful for understanding the molecular evolution of this lectin. In the conger eel, the amino acid sequences of congerins I and II found in the skin mucus were determined as β-galactoside-specific lectins (24Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Muramoto K. Kagawa D. Sato T. Ogawa T. Nishida Y. Kamiya H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 123B: 33-45Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Congerins I and II belong to the galectin family based on primary structure and thus show no homology with AJL-2. It is possible that eels also possess galectin type lectin in the skin mucus, and further experiments are required. Most known animal lectins function internally, i.e. in the tissues or blood plasma, but skin mucus lectins function externally. The biological roles of internal lectins have been clarified to some extent, such as in the activation of the classical complement pathway by MBP (42Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 43Ji Y.H. Fujita T. Hatsuse H. Takahashi A. Matsushita M. Kawakami M. J.

On the other hand, the functions of external lectins remain unfully clarified. Congerin has been shown to agglutinate a marine pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio anguillarum (21Shiomi K. Uematsu H. Ito H. Yamanaka H. Kikuchi T. Nippon Suisan Gakkaisi. 1990; 56: 119-123Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, AJL-2 demonstrated agglutination activity and growth suppressive activity against E. coli K12. AJL-2 also showed agglutination of bacteria at concentrations of 100 μg/ml and suppression of growth at concentrations of 1 μg/ml. These activities against E. coli indicate that skin mucus lectin participates in host defense. The agglutination of pathogenic organisms may inhibit their penetration into the body or allow them to be trapped in the skin mucus to be washed away with the further secretion of mucus. In addition, lectin may inhibit the growth of such organisms in the mucus, some of which may serve as bacterial nutrients. Finally, in a manner similar to MBP, skin mucus lectin may act together with other humoral factors that confer innate immunity such as immunoglobulin and complement."

They were identified by sequence similarity to the amino acid/auxin permease family member of lower eukaryotes. We functionally characterized both transporters by flux studies and electrophysiology after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both mPAT1 and mPAT2 induced a pH-dependent electrogenic transport activity for small amino acids (glycine, alanine, and proline) that is altered by membrane potential. Direct evidence for amino acid/H+-symport was shown by intracellular acidification, and a flux coupling stoichiometry for proline/H+-symport of 1:1 was determined for both transporters. Besides small apolar l-amino acids, the transporters also recognize their d-enantiomers and selected amino acid derivatives such as γ-aminobutyric acid. The mPAT1 transporter, the murine orthologue of the recently cloned rat LYAAT-1 transporter, can be considered as a low affinity system when compared with mPAT2. The mRNA of mPAT1 is highly expressed in small intestine, colon, kidney, and brain; the mPAT2-mRNA is mainly found in heart and lung.

Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier M.H., Jr. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This protein family is widespread in nature, with members found in yeast, plants, invertebrates, and mammals. Although their amino acid sequences appear very divergent, a common signature has been identified, and secondary structure predictions show conserved similarities (2Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier M.H., Jr. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Accordingly, most members of the AAAP family possess 11 membrane-spanning domains with very similar hydropathy profiles. Functionally characterized members as AAP1 and AVT1 found inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thalianaoperate as proton symporters for amino acids and selected derivatives such as auxins (2Young G.B.

Three subfamilies within the AAAP family that show low although significant similarities (20–30%) have been identified so far in mammalian organisms. They are represented by the VGAT transporter group, the system A/N transporter group, and the LYAAT branch (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter VGAT was the first identified mammalian member of the AAAP family with an assigned function (6McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). It mediates the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles (6McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 7Sagne C., El Mestikawy S. Isambert M.F. Hamon M. Henry J.P. Giros B. Gasnier B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The driving force of VGAT is the electrochemical proton gradient generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase (8Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic GABA and glycine can therefore be accumulated within the vesicles via a proton antiport mechanism (6McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The system A/N transporter group also belong to the AAAP family. System N plays an important role especially in the homeostasis of glutamine in brain, where it serves as a delivery system for the precursor of the excitatory amino acid glutamate (9Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The system N-mediated glutamine influx is coupled to the cotransport of one Na+ ion in antiport with one H+ ion (9Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although system A transporters are highly homologous to system N, they show a very different substrate specificity as well as a different ion-substrate flux coupling ratio (10Reimer R.J. Chaudhry F.A. Gray A.T. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7715-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). System A transporters prefer alanine and most of the other neutral amino acids and are considered to provide bulk quantities of these amino acids in most cell types. System A carriers act as Na+/amino acid symporters. Although transport by system A is sensitive to low pH, no proton exchanger activity has been shown in contrast to system N (11Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recently, Sagne et al. (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) report the cloning of the first mammalian proton/amino acid symporter from rat brain, which is also a member of the AAAP family (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This lysosomal amino acid transporter, designated as LYAAT-1, when transfected in CV-1 cells mediated the uptake of small amino acids such as alanine and proline and the neurotransmitter GABA. The observation of an enhanced transport activity by low extracellular pH suggested a proton-symport mechanism for amino acid influx. The LYAAT-1 transcripts were identified in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in rat brain. The LYAAT-1 protein was localized in the lysosomal membrane in these neurons, although when expressed heterologously, it mediated plasma membrane amino acid uptake (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The first members of the system A/N subfamily, the SN1 protein, and LYAAT-1 have been identified by data base search for mammalian homologues of the VGAT transporter (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J.

Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We searched for mammalian AAAP family members based on the S. cerevisiae protein sequence YKL146wp, which had been identified by genome-scanning analysis as a putative amino acid transport protein. Recently it was shown that YKL146wp indeed codes for a protein that represents a vesicular amino acid transporter, designated as AVT3 (4Russnak R. Konczal D. McIntire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23849-23857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of two new members, the murine orthologue of rLYAAT-1, designated as mPAT1, and an additional member of this subfamily, designated as mPAT2. Both transporters, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, show the functional characteristics of electrogenic H+/amino acid symporters. The mPAT2 transporter displays the characteristics of a high affinity system with a more restricted substrate specificity than mPAT1. The yeast protein sequence YKL146wp belonging to the AAAP family was blasted (tblastn method) against murine and human EST sequences. Two closely related cDNA sequences were identified that were so far not linked to any functionally known cDNA. The EST clone 1920302 (designated as mPAT2) from a murine 14 days-post-coital embryonic cDNA library was purchased from the Resource Center/Primary Data base of the German Human Genome Project (IMAGp998B154710Q2, RZPD, Berlin, Germany). The original cDNA in the pME18S-FL3 vector was cut with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated in pCRII (BD PharMingen) to allow cRNA transcription using the T7 polymerase promoter. The major part of the open reading frame (ORF) of the mPAT1-cDNA was available by the assembly of EST sequences. The 5′-untranslated cDNA end including the start codon was identified using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (BD PharMingen). The complete ORF of mPAT1 was amplified with a high fidelity Taq polymerase (ELongase, Invitrogen) using the primers mPAT1-F-140 (GTCAGACTCACTCCATAGTAC) and mPAT1-B1571 (AGACACACAGGGTGAGGCTG) with small intestinal RNA (5 μg). The numbering of the primers is according to their position in relation to the first base of the start codon. Two independently amplified PCR products were cloned in the pCRII vector, and both strands were sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase Cy5 dye terminator kit with an automated DNA sequencer (ALF Express, AP Biotech). The PCR products were subcloned directionally in the pCRII vector in which an ∼700-bp 3′ end fragment of the rabbit PEPT2 (GenBankTM accession number U32507), including the poly(A) tail, was introduced. This usually stabilizes the synthesized cRNA for efficient expression inX. laevis oocytes. The expression of mPAT1-cRNA with the additional 3′ end was more than 50-fold higher than that of the mPAT1-cRNA without the additional 3′ end (data not shown). For homology searches on DNA and protein levels, the BLAST programs were used (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Transmembrane regions of PAT proteins were predicted with DNASIS (Hitachi) using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm with a window size of 18 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignments (neighbor joining method) were performed with the CLUSTALW program (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Oocytes were treated with collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics) for 1.5–2 h at room temperature in Ca2+-free ORII solution (82.5 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) to remove follicular cells. After sorting, healthy oocytes of stage V and VI were kept at 18 °C in modified Barth solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mmCa(NO3)2, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The next day oocytes were injected with 27 nl of sterile water (control) or 27 nl of mPAT1- or mPAT2-cRNA solution at concentrations between 0.2 and 1.5 μg/μl for initial functional tests. For detailed functional characterization 10 ng of mPAT1 or 25 ng of mPAT2-cRNA were injected into oocytes. The oocytes were kept in modified Barth solution at 18 °C until further use (3–5 days after injection). 10 oocytes (water or cRNA injected) per uptake experiment were preincubated at room temperature for 2 min in Na+-free standard uptake buffer (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES (pH 6.5)). The buffer was then replaced by the respective uptake buffer supplemented with 100 μm amino acid and the corresponding3H-labeled l-amino acid as a tracer (5 μCi/ml). Uptake experiments were performed for 10 min because pilot experiments showed linearity in amino acid uptake during this time period (data not shown). The oocytes were washed 3 times with 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (uptake buffer containing 20 mmglycine) and distributed to individual vials. After oocyte lysis in 10% SDS, radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Uptake solutions for the determination of pH-dependent uptake ofl-proline were buffered with 10 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.5–6.5), HEPES/KOH (pH 7.0–8.0), or TRIS/HCl (pH 8.5). Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed as described previously (12Kottra G. Daniel H. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocyte was placed in an open chamber and continuously superfused with incubation buffer (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES, or HEPES at pH 5.5–8.5) in the absence or presence of amino acids. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV, and current-voltage (I-V) relations were measured using short (100 ms) pulses separated by 200-ms pauses in the potential range −160 to +80 mV. I-V measurements were made immediately before and 20–30 s after substrate application when current flow reached steady state. The current evoked by mPAT1 or mPAT2 at a given membrane potential was calculated as the difference between the currents measured in the presence and the absence of substrate. In studies investigating the cation or anion dependence of mPAT transport activity, 100 mm NaCl was equimolar replaced by either choline chloride, sodium isethionate, or potassium chloride. H+/l-proline coupling stoichiometry was determined by direct comparison of net inward charge with [3H]proline accumulation in individual oocytes under voltage clamp as described (11Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Oocytes were clamped at V m = −60 mV and superfused with standard Na+-free medium (pH 6.5) plus 500 μm l-[3H]proline (ICN, 10 μCi/ml) for 5 min before washing out with Na+-free medium. Oocytes were solubilized, and the3H content was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The proline-evoked current was integrated with time to obtain the proline-dependent charge (QPro) and converted to a molar equivalent using the Faraday conversion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were constructed from experiments employing 5 different amino acid concentrations in Na+-free buffer at pH 6.5 with 6 individual mPAT1- or mPAT2-expressing oocytes from at least two different oocyte batches for each substrate. Substrate-evoked currents were transformed according to Eadie-Hofstee, and after linear regression, the substrate concentrations that cause half-maximal transport activity (apparent K m ) were derived. Intracellular pH of oocytes injected with mPAT1 or mPAT2-cRNA was measured using ion-selective microelectrodes filled with the proton ionophore I mixture B (Fluka). The electrodes were calibrated using solutions with different pH values, and only electrodes with a slope of >55 mV/pH unit and stable calibration were used. On basis of the calibration curves for the pH-sensitive electrode, the chemical potential for H+ of oocytes was calculated as the difference between the membrane potential, measured simultaneously with a 3 m KCl microelectrode, and the electrochemical potential of the pH-sensitive electrode. Total RNA from different murine tissues were isolated with RNAwiz (Ambion) following the supplier's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA samples were purified with Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech). 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA and RNA standard (Promega) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel under denatured conditions and subsequently transferred to a positively charged membrane (Hybond N, AP Biotech). The blot was hybridized with subtype-specific mPAT-cDNA, [α-32P]dATP (ICN)-radiolabeled by random priming (AP Biotech), for 1 h in Express Hyb solution (BD PharMingen CLONTECH) at 68 °C after high stringency washing. For detection of bound radioactivity, the blot was exposed on a PhosphoScreen and detected with Cyclone phosphorimaging (Packard BioScience). For a demonstration of RNA loading, the blot was hybridized with a β-actin cDNA probe. The ORF of mPAT2 was amplified with the ELongaseTaq polymerase (Invitrogen) and the mPAT2-cDNA as template using the primers mPAT2-F-EcoRI (TGAATTCATGTCTGTGACCAAGAGTGC) and mPAT2-B-EcoRI (AGAATTCCTGAATAAACATGGTGGAGTTGG). In both primer sequences anEcoRI restriction site was introduced to allow the ligation of the PCR product into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N2 vector (Invitrogen), which had the mPAT2 and the EGFP-coding region in the same frame. Insertion of the mPAT2 ORF in the right direction was checked by PCR. The mPAT2 cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands. For transfection, HeLa cells were grown on six-well plates to a confluency of about 70%. 2 μg of the mPAT2-pEGFP construct was transfected using the SuperFect transfection reagent following the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). Two days after transfection the cells were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS) for the appearance of green fluorescence. Staining of acidic organelles with LysoTrackerRed was performed according to the supplier's protocol (Molecular Probes). The functionality of the mPAT2-EGFP fusion protein was tested after injection of its cRNA into X. laevis oocytes. Therefore, the mPAT2-EGFP-cDNA insert was cut with XhoI andMunI and subcloned into the pCRII vector including the rabbit PEPT2 3′ end, as also used for enhanced expression of mPAT1. Uptake of radiolabeled glycine, alanine, and proline (100 μm) into oocytes expressing mPAT2-EGFP was significantly increased (p < 0.01, Student's paired ttest) when compared with the uptake in water-injected control oocytes. Similar to wild type mPAT2, proline uptake in mPAT2-EGFP-expressing oocytes showed the highest stimulation with an increase from 6.5 ± 0.7 pmol·oocyte−1·10 min−1 in controls to 25.9 ± 1.8 pmol·oocyte−1 · 10 min−1 (n = 8 oocytes each). In contrast, tyrosine influx was not affected. Moreover, under voltage clamp conditions (at −60 mV) glycine, alanine, and proline but not tyrosine also induced positive inward currents in oocytes expressing mPAT2-EGFP (data not shown). Using an in silico cloning strategy, we identified two closely related cDNA sequences from mice based on the yeast protein sequence YKL146wp, designated as mPAT1- and mPAT2-cDNA. The mPAT2-cDNA is represented by an EST clone from a murine 14 days post-coital embryonic cDNA library (IMAGE Clone I.D. 1920302). The complete ORF of mPAT1 has been amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using cDNA-specific primers flanking the mPAT1-ORF with RNA purified from murine small intestine. The deduced proteins possess 475 (mPAT1) and 478 (mPAT2) residues (Fig.1). The mPAT1 and mPAT2 proteins show an identity of 69% and a similarity of 80%. Hydropathy analyses predict both mPAT proteins to have 11 membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1). Within the putative transmembrane domains the amino acid sequences show highest homology, whereas the N terminus, most likely the cytosolic part, is divergent. Three conserved putative N-glycosylation sites were found at the proposed luminal/extracellular site of the mPAT proteins when assuming that the N terminus is directed to the cytosol. The only known mammalian protein that is closely related to the mPAT proteins is the recently identified rat LYAAT-1 (5Sagne C. Agulhon C. Ravassard P. Darmon M. Hamon M., El Mestikawy S. Gasnier B. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). LYAAT-1 is the rat orthologue of the mPAT1 protein with a similarity of 97%. The mPAT proteins and rLYAAT-1 belong to the large eukaryotic AAAP family (2Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier M.H., Jr. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In mammals, functionally identified AAAP family members are the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT and the system A/N transporters. The mPAT proteins build a new subfamily beside the VGAT and system A/N subfamily. Analysis of the first version of the human genome sequences and human EST sequences shows that the 2 human orthologue genes are located on chromosome 5q31–33 within a region less than 150 kb on the contig NT_006951.7. The predicted human orthologue proteins share a similarity of 91% (hPAT1) and 88% (hPAT2) to the corresponding murine transporter proteins. To determine whether the mPAT proteins indeed function as rheogenic amino acid transporters, we applied the two-electrode voltage clamp technique and employed flux studies with radiolabeled amino acids in X. laevis oocytes expressing mPAT1 or mPAT2. Fig.2 A shows the uptake of selected amino acids provided in the medium in concentrations of 100 μm. The uptake rates of glycine, alanine and proline were highly elevated in mPAT1- and mPAT2-expressing oocytes, whereas tyrosine uptake was not significantly enhanced when compared with uptake in water-injected control oocytes. Under voltage clamp conditions (membrane potential −60 mV) glycine, alanine, and proline induced positive inward currents (Fig. 2, B andC). The substrate-evoked currents of the three amino acids were almost equal in mPAT1-cRNA-injected oocytes, whereas mPAT2 produced the highest inward currents with glycine followed by alanine and proline (about 70 and 40% of glycine currents, respectively). As given by the current voltage relationship in Fig. 2 D, glycine (20 mm) evoked currents increased with hyperpolarization of the membrane, suggesting that the membrane voltage is a driving force. This voltage dependence of substrate currents was more pronounced in mPAT1- than in mPAT2-expressing oocytes. Currents generated by mPAT1-expressing oocytes increased 4-fold by shifting the membrane potential from 0 to −120 mV, whereas in mPAT2-expressing oocytes currents increased only about 60%. To analyze in detail the underlying mechanisms that caused the transport currents of mPAT1 and mPAT2, we first studied the effect of different cations and anions on the glycine-evoked currents. Replacement of Na+ by choline or K+ and Cl− by isethionate had no significant effect on normalized mPAT1 and mPAT2 transport activity (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, lowering the extracellular pH led to a pronounced increase in mPAT1 and mPAT2 mediated l-proline influx (Fig. 3 B). The mPAT1 transport activity was much more strongly influenced by changes of the extracellular pH than that of mPAT2. The uptake rate of 100 μm l-Pro at pH 5.5 was 6-fold higher than that at pH 7.5 in mPAT1-expressing oocytes, whereas its stimulation in mPAT2-expressing oocytes was only increased by 45%. Direct evidence for a proton/amino acid symport mechanism was obtained by measuring intracellular pH changes by a hydrogen ion-selective electrode simultaneously with changes in membrane potential when perfusing oocytes in the absence or presence of 20 mm glycine or proline. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the addition of glycine and proline to the perfusate led to an intracellular acidification as well as to a depolarization of oocytes expressing mPAT1. These effects were completely reversed by washing out the amino acids. The same effect was observed for glycine in mPAT2-expressing oocytes, whereas leucine, which is no substrate of the transporters, failed to induce an acidification and membrane depolarization. Water-injected control oocytes did not respond to the addition of any applied amino acid (data not shown). The H+/l-proline-coupling stoichiometry was directly determined by comparing thel-proline-dependent charge (QPro) with the concomitant accumulation rate ofl-[3H]proline in individual oocytes voltage-clamped at −60 mV (Fig.4 A). QProcorrelated with the 3H accumulation in a linear fashion with a slope of 0.97 (mPAT1) and 1.28 (mPAT2). The H+/l-proline-coupling coefficients (n) were 1.22 ± 0.04 (mPAT1) and 1.28 ± 0.08, and the mean QPro values were not significantly different from the 3H accumulation rates in a paired ttest (Fig. 4 B). This convincingly shows that the H+-coupled l-proline transport via mPAT1 and mPAT2 occurs with 1:1 stoichiometry. Both transporters are very restrictive regarding substrate recognition. We tested all 20 proteinogenic l-amino acids for their ability to induce positive inward currents in mPAT1- and mPAT2-expressing oocytes at concentrations of 20 mm. Only amino acids with short side chains such as glycine, alanine, proline, and to a much smaller extent serine were able to interact with the transporters substrate binding sites (Fig.5, A and B). No other proteinogenic amino acid was able to induce inward current significantly above background oocyte activity. On the other hand, the transporters are not very enantioselective, as shown by the inward currents induced by d-alanine, d-proline, andd-serine in Fig. 5, C and D. In oocytes expressing mPAT1 d-alanine- andd-proline-evoked currents were almost as high as those of glycine, whereas in the case of mPAT2, all d-enantiomers induced less than 30% of the glycine currents. In addition, β-alanine and the neurotransmitter GABA induced positive inward currents more potently in mPAT1- than in mPAT2-expressing oocytes (Fig.5, C and D). Dose-response experiments for currents in voltage-clamped oocytes injected with mPAT1- or mPAT2-cRNA were performed for selected amino acids and derivatives. Net substrate-evoked currents at five different concentrations were calculated, and after Eadie-Hofstee transformation and linear regression analysis, the apparent affinities (K m values) were determined. TableI summarizes the obtained apparentK m values. The proteinogenic amino acid with the highest affinity was l-Pro, with apparentK m values of 2.8 mm (mPAT1) and 0.12 mm (mPAT2). In general, mPAT2 was found to have a more than 10-fold higher affinity for all three l-α-amino acids when compared with the affinities of mPAT1. The very low affinity ofl-serine of >40 mm for both transporters shows the very strict specificity, as the introduction of the polar hydroxy group almost abolishes affinity. d-Alanine has almost the same affinity for both transporters (K m values of 6.3 and 6.5 mm for mPAT1 and mPAT2, respectively), again demonstrating that mPAT2 is more enantioselective than mPAT1. In addition, GABA is a very good substrate of mPAT1 (K m = 3.1 mm) but a poor substrate of mPAT2 (K m = 30.9 mm). In summary, mPAT2 therefore represents a high affinity-type PAT transporter and is more restrictive in substrate recognition when compared with the low affinity type mPAT1.Table IApparent affinities of selected amino acids and derivatives of proton/amino acid cotransportersSubstrate K m value In vitro Km valuemPAT1mPAT2Caco-2Renal BBMV mm mmGlycine7.0 ± 0.70.59 ± 0.045.3 ± 0.4 (13)3.9 (17)l-Alanine7.5 ± 0.60.26 ± 0.055.7 ± 0.7 (14)4.4 (18)l-Proline2.8 ± 0.10.12 ± 0.029.2 ± 0.9 (15)4.5 (19)l-Serine69 ± 543 ± 4NDNDd-Alanine6.3 ± 0.76.5 ± 1.1ND7.86 ± 0.38 (20)GABA3.1 ± 0.230.9 ± 0.11.95 ± 0.78 (16)NDSubstrate-dependent transport kinetics of mPAT1 and mPAT2 were determined by two-electrode voltage clamp for the substrates indicated (5 concentrations) in Na+-free uptake solution (pH 6.5).

In humans, this enzyme is composed of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomerase RNA (hTR) subunits. hTR has been found in the nucleolus, a site of assembly of ribosomes as well as other ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We therefore tested whether the hTERT component is also found in the nucleolus, where it could complex with the hTR RNA to form a functional enzyme. We report here that hTERT does indeed localize to the nucleolus, and we mapped the domain responsible for this localization to the hTR-binding region of the protein by deletion analysis. Substitution mutations in two of the three conserved hTR-binding domains in this nucleolarlocalization domain (NoLD) abolished nucleolar localization. However, another mutation that impeded hTR binding did not alter this subcellular localization. Additionally, wild type hTERT was detected in the nucleolus of cells that failed to express hTR. Taken together, we propose that the nucleolar localization of hTERT involves more than just the association with the hTR subunit. Furthermore, the coincidental targeting of both the hTR and hTERT subunits to the nucleolus supports the premise that the assembly of telomerase occurs in the nucleolus.

Deletion analysis has also defined the region extending from amino acids 326 to 613, which harbors all three of the aforementioned domains, as the minimum region required for hTR binding (22Lai C.K. Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although mutations in domain I can also have some effect on hTR binding (24Moriarty T.J. Huard S. Dupuis S. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The site of assembly of the telomerase RNP has not been determined; however, there is growing evidence supporting a connection to the nucleolus in vertebrate systems. The nucleolus is well known as the site of ribosome assembly and has been speculated to be a site for the assembly of other RNPs (25Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3871-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Olson M.O. Dundr M. Szebeni A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The hTR RNA component of human telomerase contains a sequence/structure motif characteristic of Box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs, which guide rRNA processing and modification within the nucleolus (28Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Narayanan A. Lukowiak A. Jady B.E. Dragon F. Kiss T. Terns R.M. Terns M.P.

Moreover, hTR co-immunoprecipitates the small nucleolar RNA-binding proteins dyskerin (31Mitchell J.R. Wood E. Collins K. Nature. 1999; 402: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), GAR1 (32Dragon F. Pogacic V. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that hTR can exist in a complex with these nucleolar proteins. Lastly, hTR has been found to localize to the nucleolus by virtue of its Box H/ACA motif (28Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Narayanan A. Lukowiak A. Jady B.E. Dragon F. Kiss T. Terns R.M. Terns M.P.

However, the same may not be true in lower eukaryotes. For example, yeast telomerase RNA lacks a Box H/ACA motif (28Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) but instead shares features of spliceosomal small nucleolar RNAs (35Chapon C. Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. RNA (N.

Therefore, unlike other functions of telomerase, understanding the biogenesis of this enzyme in humans may be achieved only by studying this process in higher eukaryotes. This is of particular importance because improper telomerase RNP accumulation has been linked to the human disease dyskeratosis congenita (31Mitchell J.R. Wood E. Collins K. Nature. 1999; 402: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 37Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Goldman F. Dearlove A. Bessler M. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Nature. 2001; 413: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Given that hTR is found in the nucleolus, a site for the assembly of ribosomes and possibly other RNPs (25Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3871-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Olson M.O. Dundr M. Szebeni A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we tested whether the hTERT catalytic subunit is also found in this subnuclear compartment by monitoring the subcellular localization of hTERT when fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in human cells. We found that hTERT localized to the nucleolus, and we mapped the corresponding nucleolar localization domain to the region encompassing the N-terminal domains II and III and the T motif. Although point or substitution mutations in any of these three domains decreased hTR binding in vitro, not all of these mutations disrupted hTERT nucleolar localization, suggesting that localization can occur independent of hTR binding. Indeed, hTERT was found in the nucleoli of human cells that do not express hTR. These results demonstrate that hTERT contains a discretenucleolar localizationdomain (NoLD) that targets the molecule to the nucleolus and that this subcellular distribution can be mediated through interactions with factors other than hTR. The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, the human cervical adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HeLa, and the SV40 transformed human fibroblast cell lines WI38 VA13/2RA (American Tissue Type Collection) and LM217 (38Murnane J.P.

The same six amino acids described above beginning at positions 386 and/or 512 were substituted with the sequence NAAIRS, and/or amino acid Phe561 in the T motif was mutated to Ala in the NoLD fragment by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (20Armbruster B.N.

FLAG-tagged NoLD, either wild type or with the described mutations, was expressed from the T7 promoter of pCI-neo and 35S-labeled in the presence of 1 μl of hTR using the T7 quick coupled TnT system (Promega). As a negative control, FLAG-HDAC1 was expressed from the T7 promoter of pCMV-HDAC1. 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was used for immunoprecipitation after preblocking with 100 ng/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 ng/ml casein, 100 ng/ml tRNA, 250 ng/ml yeast total RNA, and 100 ng/ml glycogen in PBS supplemented with 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. TnT reactions were diluted in supplemented PBS with nonspecific blockers and 200 units of RNasin (Promega) and immunoprecipitated at room temperature for 1 h with M2-agarose. The agarose beads were then washed three times with prechilled supplemented PBS, heated in SDS buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Water or 100 ng of total RNA isolated with the RNazol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test) from WI38 VA13/2RA or telomerase-positive PC3 (39Gou C. Geverd D. Liao R.

Localization of YFP fusion proteins was visualized in U2OS, LM217, HeLa, or WI38 VA13/2RA cells grown on coverslips coated with 100 mg/ml poly-d-lysine, M r > 300,000 (Sigma). Cells were transiently transfected with the above described plasmids encoding the appropriate YFP fusion protein using either the FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturers' protocols. After 48 h, live U2OS or LM217 cells were observed under PBS at ×400 magnification on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. VA13 and HeLa cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, mounted, and observed at ×630 magnification on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted fluorescence microscope. To visualize fibrillarin, U2OS cells transfected with hTERT expression constructs were similarly fixed and then permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 1× PBS and incubated with the human polyclonal anti-fibrillarin antibody (40Garcia-Blanco M.A. Miller D.D. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) at 1:500 dilution. The primary antibody was detected with the rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and visualized as above. To address whether hTERT is found in the nucleolar compartment of the cell, YFP was fused in-frame with the N terminus of full-length hTERT. We chose to monitor hTERT localization by detecting YFP because the fusion of large polypeptides at the N terminus has no measurable effect on telomerase activity (Ref.41Bachand F. Autexier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38027-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and data not shown), YFP-tagged proteins can be visualized in live cells (42Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4930) Google Scholar), and there is an absence of antibodies readily capable of detecting endogenous hTERT at the subcellular level. The YFP-hTERT construct was transiently expressed in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS because these cells lack telomerase activity (43Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Poazz L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), which eliminates possible interference by multimerization with the endogenous hTERT protein (20Armbruster B.N. Banik S.S. Guo C.

We found that YFP-hTERT is located predominantly in the nucleolus or both the nucleolus and nucleoplasm as assessed by co-localization with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin detected by indirect immunofluorescence (40Garcia-Blanco M.A. Miller D.D. Sheetz M.P. J.

To rule out the possibility that this observation was unique to these cells, we introduced YFP-hTERT into another telomerase negative human cell line, LM217 (38Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Consistent with our observations using U2OS cells, YFP-hTERT was found predominantly in the nucleolus. YFP-hTERT was even detected in the nucleolus of the telomerase-positive line HeLa (Fig. 1 B and Table I). We therefore conclude that hTERT is found in the nucleolus and that this event is independent of cell type. To map the region of hTERT required for nucleolar localization, we fused YFP to a series of fragments that represent key regions of hTERT and collectively span the entire length of the protein (Fig. 2 A). Each of these constructs was introduced into U2OS cells, and >100 transfected cells were scored for subcellular localization. Fragment 1–183, which encompasses domain I and the DAT domain, did not localize to the nucleolus. Similarly, fragment 523–924, encoding the T motif and all the reverse transcriptase domains, or fragment 867–1132, encompassing the entire C terminus, also failed to localize to the nucleolus (Fig. 2 B). Since all of these fragments were detected in the nucleus, we discount the possibility that the peptides were excluded from the nucleolus due to a failure to enter the nucleus. We therefore surmise that neither the DAT domain, the catalytic core, nor the C terminus of hTERT contains a nucleolar localization domain. However, fragment 326–620, which encodes the hTR-binding domains of hTERT (domains II and III and the T motif), was always found in the nucleolus (Fig. 2 B and TableII), indicating that this fragment contains sequences sufficient for nucleolar targeting. We found that the overlapping fragment 170–546, which contains domains II and III, or the fragment encompassing the catalytic region (523–924), which also contains part of domain III and the T motif, was not localized to the nucleolus. We therefore reasoned that at least two elements are required for nucleolar targeting of the 326–620 region encompassed by domain II to the T motif. We term this portion of hTERT the nucleolar localization domain (NoLD). We next confirmed that the NoLD was localized to the nucleolus in other cell types. Specifically, we expressed the YFP-NoLD polypeptide in LM217 and HeLa cells and again found the YFP-tagged protein in the nucleolus of 99–100% of the cells (Table II). Thus, the NoLD encodes a potent nucleolar localization sequence that functions regardless of cell type.Table IISubnuclear localization of YFP-tagged NoLD proteinsYFP fusion2-aSee Fig. 3 A for a description of the fusion constructs.Cell typeNucleolus2-bWild type NoLD was found primarily in the nucleolus; hence, only cells with predominant nucleolar staining were scored as positive for being in the nucleolus. %NoLDU2OS100LM21799HeLa95VA1397NoLD-II+386U2OS29LM21735NoLD-III+512U2OS70LM21774NoLD-T+561U2OS25LM21734HeLa5VA136NoLD-II+386 + III+512U2OS26NoLD-II+386 + III+512+ T+561U2OS20The described YFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in the human U2OS, LM217, HeLa, or VA13 cells, after which a minimum of 100 cells with nuclear YFP protein were scored for nucleolus staining and expressed as a percent based on the total number of cells observed.2-a See Fig. 3 A for a description of the fusion constructs.2-b Wild type NoLD was found primarily in the nucleolus; hence, only cells with predominant nucleolar staining were scored as positive for being in the nucleolus.

The NoLD encompasses conserved sequences denoted as domains II, III, and the T motif. These domains also map to regions determined by mutational analysis to be essential for telomerase activity in humans, yeast, or ciliates (18Friedman K.L. Cech T.R.

We have previously shown that a six-amino acid substitution (with the sequence NAAIRS) beginning at position 386 in domain II or 512 in domain III of hTERT reduces the association of this protein with hTR (20Armbruster B.N. Banik S.S. Guo C. Smith A.C. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similarly, an alanine substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine residue in the T motif is known to decrease telomerase RNA binding in ciliates (23Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data argue that these three domains are responsible for most telomerase RNA binding. Because nucleolar localization was detected with a fragment encompassing the sequences encoding the hTR RNA-binding activities of hTERT (but not with fragments outside this region) and hTR is known to localize to the nucleolus (28Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Narayanan A. Lukowiak A. Jady B.E. Dragon F. Kiss T. Terns R.M. Terns M.P.

Y.). 2001; 7: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar), we queried whether the RNA-binding activity of hTERT was essential for the observed nucleolar localization of hTERT. We introduced the aforementioned mutations in domains II, III, and the T motif one at a time or in combination into the NoLD fragment of hTERT (Fig. 3 A). We then confirmed that the NoLD fragment harboring mutations in domains II and III and the T motif abolished hTR binding in vitro. Specifically,35S-labeled FLAG-tagged NoLD fragments, either in the wild type format or with the 386, 512, or the 561 mutations, were incubated with 32P-labeled hTR and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The FLAG-tagged NoLD polypeptide, but not an irrelevant FLAG-tagged protein (HDAC1), co-immunoprecipitated hTR. However, mutations in any of the three hTR-binding domains abolished this association with no further loss observed, even when all three mutations were introduced into the same polypeptide (Fig.3 B). Thus, we confirm that mutations 386, 512, and 561 abolish detectable hTR association with the NoLD in vitro. Having confirmed that the mutations abolish detectable hTR binding, we next monitored the subcellular localization of the YFP-tagged proteins in U2OS cells by fluorescence microscopy. We have found that a substitution mutation in domain II (mutant 386), which eliminated hTR binding and is known to abolish the catalytic function of hTERT (Fig.3 B and Ref. 20Armbruster B.N. Banik S.S. Guo C. Smith A.C. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), greatly reduced the nucleolar localization of the NoLD fragment. In >400 cells scored, the mutated YPF-NoLD fragment was found in the nucleolus only one-third of the time, a 3-fold drop compared with the wild type NoLD fragment. Similarly, a mutation in the T motif (561) crippled the ability of the NoLD fragment to localize to the nucleolus by 4-fold. Interestingly, mutating domain III (512) had little effect on the nucleolar localization of the NoLD fragment (Fig. 4 and Table II). We discount the possibility that the localization of these three mutant NoLD proteins was dependent upon cell type, because all of these proteins were similarly localized when expressed in LM217 or HeLa cells (Table II). Thus, disrupting two of the three hTR-binding domains altered the nucleolar targeting by the NoLD, and these effects were independent of cell type. We next addressed whether mutations in more than one hTR-binding region further decreased nucleolar localization. YFP was fused to a series of NoLD fragments containing different combinations of domains II and III and T motif mutations (Fig. 3 A). The resultant constructs were then expressed in U2OS cells and assayed for nucleolar localization. We found that mutating either two or all three hTR-binding domains did not have an additive effect. A mutation in domain II disrupted the nucleolar localization of the NoLD fragment to approximately the same degree whether domain III or the T motif or both were also mutated (Table II). The same was true with the T motif; additional mutations did not further diminish nucleolar localization (Table II). These results are consistent with a model whereby mutations in domains II or the T motif are alone capable of disrupting the accumulation of hTERT in the nucleolus. Mutation in domain II greatly reduced the nucleolar accumulation of the NoLD fragment when expressed in human cells. To directly test whether this domain was essential to target full-length hTERT to the nucleolus, we created a fusion of the YFP with hTERT containing the aforementioned NAAIRS substitution mutation in domain II. The fusion protein was transiently expressed in U2OS cells and assayed for subcellular localization. Although the full-length hTERT molecule was found in the nucleolus, the introduction of a NAAIRS substitution mutation at position 386 in domain II reduced this localization by almost one-half (Fig. 5and Table I). Thus, we conclude that the NoLD identified by deletion analysis mediates the localization of target full-length hTERT to the nucleolus. We have shown that the nucleolar localization domain of hTERT maps to the region of the protein linked to hTR binding (Fig. 2) and that mutations in two known hTR-binding domains, domain II and the T motif, crippled the ability of the protein to accumulate in this compartment of the nucleus. Such observations are consistent with the hTR recruiting hTERT to the nucleolus via the Box H/ACA motif. However, one mutation that abolished all measurable association of hTERT with hTR (Fig.3 B) had very little effect on the accumulation of the NoLD fragment (Fig. 4) or full-length hTERT (Table I) in the nucleolus. We interpret these data in one of two ways. Interaction with hTR may not be required for targeting hTERT to the nucleolus. Alternatively, hTR binding may be essential for hTERT localization, but the mutation in domain III does not disrupt hTR binding to the same extent in vivo as observed in vitro. To differentiate between these two models, YFP-tagged full-length hTERT and the NoLD fragment were introduced into WI38 VA13/2RA human cells. These cells reportedly lack both hTERT and hTR transcripts (48Bryan T.M. Marusic L. Bacchetti S. Namba M. Reddel R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 49Guiducci C. Cerone M.A. Bacchetti S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and require the ectopic expression of these two subunits to restore telomerase activity (49Guiducci C. Cerone M.A. Bacchetti S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, we confirm by the exquisitely sensitive real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR that the hTR transcript is not present in these cells despite being readily detected in telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 6 A). If hTR binding is indispensable for the nucleolar localization of hTERT, then the hTERT or NoLD proteins should not be detected in the nucleolus when expressed in these cells. However, we find that ectopically expressed YFP-hTERT as well as the YFP-NoLD itself was found almost exclusively in the nucleolus, supporting the premise that hTERT can be targeted to this subcellular structure independent of hTR binding. Moreover, a mutation in the T motif (561) that drastically reduced nucleolar accumulation of YFP-NoLD protein in the U2OS and LM217 cells was similarly effective in the cells lacking hTR (Fig. 6 B and Table II). These observations indicate that hTR is not essential for the localization of hTERT to nucleoli. We now show that hTERT is localized to the nucleolus when transiently expressed in human cells. Because both the hTR and hTERT subunits localize to this structure, we suggest that this localization may reflect a part of telomerase biogenesis such as the assembly of the hTR and hTERT subunits into an RNP. However, it is possible that the targeting of hTERT to the nucleolus may have other functions such as the sequestration of telomerase from its telomeric target (30Lukowiak A.A. Narayanan A., Li, Z.H. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal fragment of hTERT defined by deletion analysis that mediates localization extends from amino acids 326 to 620. The most striking feature of this NoLD is that it encompasses all of the known hTR binding elements of hTERT. Furthermore, mutating two of the three RNA-binding domains of hTERT reduced the localization of either the NoLD or the full-length hTERT to the nucleolus. Thus, it initially appeared that the hTR served as a bridge, tethering hTERT protein to the Box H/ACA motif for nucleolar localization. However, we also found that a mutation in hTERT that disrupts hTR binding did not grossly affect the ability of the protein to accumulate in the nucleolus and that hTERT is found in the nucleolus of cells lacking hTR. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the NoLD can target hTERT to the nucleolus in a manner that is independent of hTR binding. Thus, the targeting or retention of hTERT within the nucleolus may involve other factors that interact specifically with domain II and the T motif within the NoLD of hTERT."

For microorganisms in particular, their immediate environmental conditions, temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability, can fluctuate considerably. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used model system for studying the molecular processes that sense and initiate responses to these stressful changes. This work is of general biological interest, because the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are highly conserved between yeasts and higher eukaryotes. It has been known for some years that the membrane-bound inositol lipids and their hydrolysis by phospholipase C (Plc1p) both play important roles in adaptations to environmental stress. For example, disruption of the genes encoding inositol lipid phosphatases results in cell wall lysis, vacuolar fragmentation, and impaired homeostatic responses to osmotic stress (4Foti A. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,5Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inositol lipid kinases have also been shown to be required for cell wall integrity and the maintenance of vacuolar morphology (6Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J.

However, it has not previously been considered that the soluble inositol phosphates might also be important in mediating any of these homeostatic responses. In yeast, exposure to the toxic effects of elevated salinity (8Murguı́a J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol.

We have therefore now investigated whether this particular vacuolar defect is associated with any impairment to the homeostatic responses to high salt and osmotic stress. Furthermore, an intact cell wall is essential for yeast to successfully adapt to environmental stress (13Smits G.J. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, we have also studied whether Kcs1p has a role in maintaining the integrity of the cell wall. These studies into environmental stress responses represent new areas of research into the function of the KCS1gene. One of the functional characteristics of Kcs1p is its diphosphoinositol polyphosphate synthase (DINS)1 activity (2Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which yields a specific class of inositol phosphates distinguished by their diphosphate groups (diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-InsP4), diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP5), and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate ((PP)2-InsP4); see Fig. 1). InsP6K1 is a mammalian homologue of Kcs1p (2Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); InsP6K1 is pleiotropic, since, in addition to its own DINS activity, it also interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab3A (14Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Nagata E., Ye, K., Yu, H. Jung T.S. Luo X. Jain S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2001; 31: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Kcs1p is at least as likely to be multifunctional, since it is much larger in size (120 kDa (15Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) than are the mammalian InsP6 kinases (50–60 kDa (2Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39179-39185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Indeed, the KCS1 gene was first identified in a screen for suppressing the temperature sensitivity of the pkc1–4allele (15Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kcs1p also has two groups of four heptad repeats of leucine residues. The latter were suggested to be leucine zippers (15Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in other contexts direct the homo- and heterodimerization of proteins (17Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide the first evidence that there is an important function for these leucine repeats in Kcs1p. Since Kcs1p may be multifunctional, its severe disruption in an earlier report (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) could have yielded abnormal phenotypes that were not all directly related to its kinase activity. Thus, in this study, we have investigated the physiological impact of specifically targeting the DINS activity of Kcs1p. Our approach was first to createkcs1Δ cells and then transform them with plasmids encoding mutants in which the inositol phosphate kinase activity was specifically modified. Diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, both in yeast and in mammalian cells, are synthesized from the InsP5 and InsP6precursor pools (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney J.W., Jr. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Thus, we considered the possibility that the phenotypic consequences of eliminating the DINS activity of Kcs1p from cells could also arise independently from genetic manipulations that deplete the InsP5 and InsP6 pools.ARG82 2The Arg82p protein has acquired several pseudonyms, including ArgRIII (1Qiu H.F. Dubois E. Bröen P. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), inositol polyphosphate multikinase (Ipmk) (2Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). In addition, Arg82p regulates the expression of enzymes in the arginine metabolism pathway (21Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Amar N. Messenguy F., El Bakkoury M. Dubois E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This transcriptional role is achieved by Arg82p binding and sequestering two MADS-box proteins, Arg80p and Mcm1p, thereby preventing their rapid degradation (23El Bakkoury M. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These two transcription factors then form a complex on DNA with Arg81p, the arginine sensor (22Amar N. Messenguy F., El Bakkoury M. Dubois E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the current study, we use specific genetic manipulations that distinguish the role of Arg82p as a regulator of arginine gene expression from its separate function as a supplier of precursor material for the synthesis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. As a consequence, we demonstrate that inositol phosphate phosphorylation by Arg82p has more extensive physiological consequences than have previously been appreciated. Escherichia coli strain XL1-B was used for plasmid amplification and for in vitromutagenesis. The BY4709 (MATα, ura3) yeast strain (24Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E., Li, J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) was used to create a series of gene deletions. The long flanking homology strategy (25Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) was used to perform deletion ofARG82 and KCS1. A long flanking homology replacement cassette was synthesized using a two-step PCR, leading to the kanMX4 cassette flanked by about 500 bp corresponding to the promoter and terminator regions of the target genes. The DNA fragments containing the different cassettes were used to transform strain BY4709 on rich medium plates containing 200 μg/ml of Geneticin. The correct targeting of the deletions in G418rtransformants was verified by PCR, using whole cells as a source of DNA, and appropriate primers. The following strains were obtained:arg82::kanMX4 (03127c) andkcs1::kanMX4 (4709kcs1Δ). Unless otherwise noted, all yeast strains were grown on minimal medium (pH 6.5), which contained 3% glucose, vitamins, and mineral traces. Unless otherwise stated, the nitrogen source was 0.02 m(NH4)2SO4 (M.am medium). The low copy pFL38 plasmid was used in this work to bear wild type and mutated arg82 (26Dubois E. Dewaste V. Erneux C. Messenguy F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) andkcs1 genes. Since these proteins are expressed under their native promoter and on a low copy number plasmid (one or two copies in the cell), the amount of each protein is comparable with the amount produced by the genomic copy of the wild type strain. The wild typeKCS1 gene was cloned on a pFL38 plasmid by insertion of a 4.95-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of KCS1, synthesized by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides as primers withEcoRI restriction sites, and genomic wild type DNA as template, yielding plasmid pFV241. Oligonucleotides were used to create substitution by in vitro mutagenesis on double-stranded DNA from plasmid pFV241 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). In this plasmid, the following amino acid changes were created: L794A/L801A/L857A/L864A (pFV198) and S887A/L888A/L889A (pFV217). To check that each mutant protein was stable when expressed, the same Kcs1p proteins were expressed fused at the C terminus to the V5 epitope tag, using the pYES2 plasmid (Invitrogen), with a GAL10 promoter. Plasmids pFV249 (GAL10-KCS1-V5), pFV251 (GAL10-kcs1L794A/L801A/L857A/L864A-V5), and pFV252 (GAL10-kcs1S887A/L888A/L889A-V5) were obtained by insertion in the EcoRI restriction site of pYES2 plasmid of EcoRI KCS1 DNA fragments synthesized by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides and as templates the plasmids pFV241, pFV217, and pFV198, respectively. We completely sequenced all of the wild type and the different mutated genes to ensure that no additional mutations had been introduced. To overexpress ARG82 and KCS1 genes from S. cerevisiae, we fused their coding sequence to the tetpromoter present in plasmid pCM262 (gift from E. Herrero, Universitat de Lleida, Spain). For ARG82, a 1070-bpBamHI-BamHI fragment was synthesized by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides as primers with BamHI restriction sites and DNA from plasmid pFV145 as template, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and inserted in the PmeI restriction site of plasmid pCM262, yielding plasmid pFV186. For KCS1, a 4.15-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment was synthesized by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides as primers with EcoRI restriction sites and DNA from plasmid pFV241 as template, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and inserted in the PmeI restriction site of plasmid pCM262, yielding plasmid pFV187. Exponentially growing cells (25 ml) were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (catalog no. 1697498; Roche Diagnostics). Next, 300 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 300 mg of glass beads were added, and cells were disrupted in a Bead-Beater. Proteins were extracted by centrifugation and resuspended in 200 μl of gel loading buffer containing 3.5% (w/v) SDS, 80 mm Tris, 8 mm EDTA, 14% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and blue bromphenol. Samples were heat-treated (100 °C, 10 min). After electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels, followed by transfer to Highbond membrane, the Kcs1p proteins were visualized using antibodies raised against the V5 epitope. Arg82p proteins were detected using polyclonal antibodies against recombinant GST-Arg82p, which were raised in the mouse, and prepared as previously described using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (26Dubois E. Dewaste V. Erneux C. Messenguy F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed according to a standard chemiluminescent protocol provided with the WesternBreeze kit from Invitrogen (Merelbeke, Belgium). To study inositol phosphate levels in intact yeast cells, cultures were grown on M.am at 29 °C through at least eight generations in the presence of [3H]inositol (100 μCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals). The HPLC analysis and identification of [3H]inositol-labeled inositol phosphates in these cells using appropriate standards were performed as described previously, with a Synchropak Q100 column (20Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); 1-ml fractions were collected. Inositol phosphate isomers were identified by their co-elution with genuine 3H-labeled standards of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, InsP6, PP-InsP5, and [PP]2-InsP4 as previously described (20Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To study inositol phosphate metabolism by Kcs1p in vitro, the plasmid pFV249 was introduced in the yeast strain 12S16cpep4D (ura3, leu2, arg3,pep4::kanMX4). An extract was prepared from 1 liter of these cells using a French press, and Kcs1p was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography and then dialyzed into 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Kcs1p was incubated with 5000 dpm of either [3H]Ins (1,4,5)P3, [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, or [3H]InsP6 (all purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C in 25–100 μl of medium containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 12 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Na2ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 360 units of phosphocreatine kinase (Calbiochem), and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Assays were quenched with perchloric acid and neutralized with KCO3 as described previously (20Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The first-order rate constant for these assays was evaluated by HPLC with a 12.5-cm Partisphere SAX column as described previously (20Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) was assayed as described previously (27Messenguy F. Penninckx M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Data for this enzyme are presented as repression factors. The repression factor for OTCase corresponds to the ratio of OTCase-specific activities of thearg82Δ strain grown on M.am versusOTCase-specific activities of the different strains grown on M.am plus 1 mg/ml arginine. Alkaline phosphatase release from cells was recorded on plates that contained M.am plus 40 μg/ml BCIP (Sigma). The hydrolysis of the dye yields a blue stain. Cells were grown at 29 °C in YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose). Cells from 5 ml of early logarithmic phase cultures (A 600 = 0.4–0.6) were collected and resuspended in 100 μl of medium containing 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 2% glucose, 10 μm carboxy-DCFDA. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, whereupon the membrane-permeable carboxy-DCFDA enters the vacuoles, the acetate groups are hydrolyzed, and the non-membrane-permeable and fluorescent carboxy-DCF highlights the vacuolar compartment. Intracellular localization of carboxy-DCF was examined with a Zeiss LSM510 microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective (NA = 1.4) under transmitted light or with epifluorescence (488-nm excitation with an argon laser, HFT 488-nm dichroic, and 505-nm long pass filter). The images that are shown in this study are representative of at least 100 cells from every strain. We initially studied the consequences of deleting the entire KCS1 gene. Since Kcs1p has diphosphoinositol phosphate kinase activity, we monitored the effect of the gene deletion upon the cellular levels of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4. Individual inositol phosphates were resolved by HPLC of yeast cell extracts that had been prelabeled with [3H]inositol (Fig. 2). To ensure that all of the inositol polyphosphate pools were radiolabeled to equilibrium, their saturation with [3H]inositol during the time course of our experiments was ensured by labeling for at least eight cell generations. As shown previously (28York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), InsP1 and InsP6 account for more than 99% of the total spectrum of inositol phosphates in yeast cells (Fig. 2). However, there is considerable interest in the functional significance of the other, more minor inositol phosphates (28York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), particularly the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, we detected one peak of (PP)2-[3H]InsP4 and two peaks of PP-[3H]InsP5 (Fig. 2). The kcs1Δcells showed 93% lower steady-state levels of PP-InsP5 and (PP)2-InsP4 compared with wild-type cells (Fig.2; Table I), confirming the importance of the DINS activity of Kcs1p.Table IThe effect of wild-type and mutant forms of kcs1p upon inositol phosphate pools in S. cerevisiaeAmount of inositol phosphateIns(1,3,4,5,6)P5InsP6PP-InsP5(PP)2-InsP4 dpm × 10 5 /cell no.Wild type58 ± 201320 ± 13528.3 ± 631.5 ± 6 kcs1Δ53 ± 141767 ± 2922 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.3 kcs1Δ + pKCS141 ± 81042 ± 8610.5 ± 1.820.7 ± 3.7 kcs1Δ + pkcs1 SLL→AAA50 ± 121119 ± 540.99 ± 0.10.61 ± 0.44 kcs1Δ + pkcs1 L1L2→AA65 ± 91968 ± 9928.5 ± 541.4 ± 5.5Inositol phosphate levels were determined by HPLC as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

The vacuolar compartment of S. cerevisiae was identified by fluorescence microscopy. Wild-type cells were found to have the normal complement of one large vacuole (Fig. 3). In contrast, the vacuolar compartment in the kcs1Δ strain was fragmented (Fig. 3). In addition to being about twice as large as the wild-type cells (Fig. 3), the kcs1Δ cells also exhibited a growth-impaired phenotype that was evident at either 30 or 37 °C (Fig.4 A).Figure 4The effect of KCS1 andARG82 gene deletions upon cell growth, osmotic tolerance, and salt stress. A, 10-fold serial dilutions of the strains indicated were plated and incubated at 30 or 37 °C for 3 days on M.am plus 25 μg/ml uracil, either with or without 1m sorbitol. B, 10-fold serial dilutions of the strains indicated were plated and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days on M.am plus 25 μg/ml uracil plus either 0.6 or 0.8 mNaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ion transport processes in the vacuolar membrane are thought to help protect the cell from toxicity caused by exposure to high salt as well as affording protection against sudden osmotic challenges (10Nass R. Rao R. Microbiology. 2001; 145: 3221-3228Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Darley C.P. van Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van der Woude K. Mager W.H. de Boer A.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the defective vacuolar compartment in the kcs1Δ strain compromised these stress responses. We discovered that these cells were unusually sensitive to NaCl (either 0.6 or 0.8 m), which strongly inhibited colony formation (Fig. 4 B). On the contrary, the kcs1Δ strain was unaffected by an osmotic challenge from 1 m sorbitol (Fig. 4 A). Thus, we conclude that these cells have normal osmotic stress responses, but resistance to salt stress is compromised. Another new finding was the fragility of these kcs1Δ cells; mutants developed blue-colored colonies on a medium that was overlaid with a pH 9.8 buffer supplemented with BCIP (Fig.5 A), which records the leakage of intracellular alkaline phosphatase into the extracellular milieu (7Audhya A. Foti A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar,30Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.-L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We also observed phosphatase leakage when the yeast cells were grown on media with a less stressful pH of 6.5 (Fig.5 B). The addition of 1 m sorbitol elicited an osmoremedial effect that reduced the leakage of phosphatase from inside the cell (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that in the kcs1Δ strain, there was a defect in the maintenance of cell wall structure rather than a defect in the plasma membrane (see Refs. 30Paravicini G.

Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We sought an independent means of examining cell wall integrity. It has been reported that perturbations to the integrity of the cell wall can decrease the degree of resistance of the cells to the toxic effects of caffeine (see Ref. 31Martı́n H. Rodrı́guez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and references therein). These experiments were performed on YPD media, since the toxicity of caffeine is enhanced, even in wild-type cells, when they are grown on minimal medium (data not shown). In the absence of caffeine, the greater nutritional support of the YPD media provided thekcs1Δ cells with some protection against their growth defect, compared with cells grown on minimal media (compare Figs. 4 A and 5 C). Nevertheless, the growth phenotype of kcs1Δ cells was still evident at 37 °C in YPD media, and they were more sensitive to 10 mmcaffeine than were wild-type cells (Fig. 5 C). Osmotic stabilization of the plasma membrane by 1 m sorbitol largely protected against this sensitivity to caffeine (Fig.5 C); this osmotic remedial response is typical of a defect in cell wall integrity (31Martı́n H.

Clearly, Kcs1p has far more wide ranging consequences for cell function than has been appreciated from earlier studies (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Since Kcs1p is probably pleiotropic (see the Introduction), an important objective in the current study was to investigate the specific role of diphosphoinositol polyphosphate synthesis. Therefore, we transformedkcs1Δ cells with a plasmid encoding wild-type K"
https://openalex.org/W2140119380,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells acquire iron under high affinity conditions through the action of a cell surface ferric reductase encoded by thefrp1+ gene and a two-component iron-transporting complex encoded by the fip1+ and fio1+ genes. When cells are grown in the presence of iron, transcription of all three genes is blocked. A conserved regulatory element, 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′, located upstream of thefrp1+ , fip1+ , andfio1+ genes, is necessary for iron repression. We have cloned a novel gene, termed fep1+ , which encodes an iron-sensing transcription factor. Binding studies reveal that the putative DNA binding domain of Fep1 expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli specifically interacts with the 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ sequence in an iron-dependent manner. In a fep1Δ mutant strain, thefio1+ gene is highly expressed and is unregulated by iron. Furthermore, the fep1Δ mutation increases activity of the cell surface iron reductase and renders cells hypersensitive to the iron-dependent free radical generator phleomycin. Mutations in the transcriptional co-repressorstup11+ and tup12+ are phenocopies to fep1+ . Indeed, strains with bothtup11Δ and tup12Δ deletions fail to sense iron. This suggests that in the presence of iron and Fep1, the Tup11 and Tup12 proteins may act as co-repressors for down-regulation of genes encoding components of the reductive iron transport machinery. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells acquire iron under high affinity conditions through the action of a cell surface ferric reductase encoded by thefrp1+ gene and a two-component iron-transporting complex encoded by the fip1+ and fio1+ genes. When cells are grown in the presence of iron, transcription of all three genes is blocked. A conserved regulatory element, 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′, located upstream of thefrp1+ , fip1+ , andfio1+ genes, is necessary for iron repression. We have cloned a novel gene, termed fep1+ , which encodes an iron-sensing transcription factor. Binding studies reveal that the putative DNA binding domain of Fep1 expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli specifically interacts with the 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ sequence in an iron-dependent manner. In a fep1Δ mutant strain, thefio1+ gene is highly expressed and is unregulated by iron. Furthermore, the fep1Δ mutation increases activity of the cell surface iron reductase and renders cells hypersensitive to the iron-dependent free radical generator phleomycin. Mutations in the transcriptional co-repressorstup11+ and tup12+ are phenocopies to fep1+ . Indeed, strains with bothtup11Δ and tup12Δ deletions fail to sense iron. This suggests that in the presence of iron and Fep1, the Tup11 and Tup12 proteins may act as co-repressors for down-regulation of genes encoding components of the reductive iron transport machinery. bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid Fe protein 1 maltose-binding protein open reading frame Iron is an essential trace element (1Andrews N.C.

Because of its ability to undergo electronic changes by adopting both the reduced (Fe2+) and oxidized (Fe3+) forms, iron serves as catalytic co-factor for a wide variety of indispensable enzymes (3Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,4Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, when present in excess, iron ions can have detrimental effects by reacting with reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen to produce free radicals that damage DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids (5Santoro N. Thiele D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 165-205Google Scholar). Therefore, cells possess specialized biochemical pathways that maintain the delicate balance between essential and toxic iron levels by controlling uptake and distribution (6Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although iron is abundant in nature, its bioavailability is limited (7Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 940-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In the presence of atmospheric oxygen, iron is oxidized to insoluble ferric hydroxides (8Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Many organisms have developed different iron-scavenging systems for solubilizing iron and transporting it into cells, including cell surface reduction to soluble ferrous species, utilization of heme, and synthesis of siderophores, which are low molecular weight iron-specific chelators (9Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Production and secretion of siderophores is a commonly used mechanism in aerobic bacteria and fungi, except budding and fission yeasts (11Ardon O. Bussey H. Philpott C. Ward D.M. Davis-Kaplan S. Verroneau S. Jiang B. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although these two yeasts lack the ability to synthesize siderophores, they can utilize siderophores produced by other microbes (12Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In some fungi including Ustilago maydis (13Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L., Xu, P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Neurospora crassa (14Zhou L.W. Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Penicillium chrysogenum (15Haas H. Angermayr K. Stoffler G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4613-4619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), when iron is in excess, siderophore synthesis is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by a repressor. The promoter element necessary for DNA binding of the repressor contains the nucleotides 5′-GATAA-3′ (17Haas H. Angermayr K. Zadra I. Stoffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22576-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was determined that this short sequence bears a strong sequence similarity to the recognition site, named GATA element, which is recognized by a family of regulatory proteins termed GATA binding transcription factors (13Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L., Xu, P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The use of bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism has led to the identification of critical components of the iron transport pathway (4Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Babcock M. de Silva D.

For high affinity iron uptake into cells, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by the Fre1 and Fre2 cell surface reductases (20Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 21Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After reduction, Fe2+ ions are specifically transported across the plasma membrane by the Ftr1-Fet3 permease-oxidase complex (24Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Within this complex, Fet3 can re-oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ in a copper-dependent oxidation reaction (25Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), allowing the passage of Fe3+ ions across the membrane in concert with Ftr1. In the absence of Fet3 activity, Fet4 can transport reduced iron across the plasma membrane with low affinity (26Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Alternative pathways for iron uptake in S. cerevisiae have been identified (28Yun C.W. Tiedeman J.S. Moore R.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16354-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For example, iron bound to siderophores can be taken up by cells through either components of the reductive iron uptake system or cell surface transporters of the ARN family (29Yun C.W. Bauler M. Moore R.E. Klebba P.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10218-10223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cell wall mannoproteins Fit1, Fit2, and Fit3 have been found to mediate transport of iron (30Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When cells are grown under iron starvation conditions, the expression of all yeast genes exceptFET4 encoding the above-mentioned components of the reductive and non-reductive iron uptake systems is up-regulated via the transcription factor Aft1 (30Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Aft1 binds to the promoters of these genes in the absence of iron by interacting with the consensuscis-acting element, 5′-(T/C)(G/A)CACCC(A/G)-3′ (31Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When cells are grown under elevated iron concentrations, the Aft1 protein localizes to the cytoplasm (33Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y., Ueta, R., Fukunaka, A., and Sasaki, R. (March 4, 2002) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M200949200Google Scholar), suggesting that Aft1 activity is modulated by its localization. Recently, studies in S. cerevisiae revealed a second iron sensor, Aft2 (36Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with extended homology (residues 38–285; 39%) to Aft1. Although Aft2 appears to control expression of genes involved in iron metabolism, a distinct regulatory function for Aft2 from that mediated by Aft1 has not been identified. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, studies have shown that Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by the Frp1 cell surface reductase (38Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Once reduced, Fe2+ is transported across the plasma membrane via a permease-oxidase complex called Fip1-Fio1, orthologs of the Ftr1-Fet3 complex in S. cerevisiae (39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although Fio1 is similar to Fet3, by itself Fio1 cannot complement the iron starvation defects of an S. cerevisiae fet3Δ mutant strain, indicating that some molecular differences exist for high affinity iron uptake between the two species of yeast (39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the frp1+ ,fip1+ , and fio1+ genes are transcriptionally repressed under iron-replete conditions (38Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no sequence identity has been observed between thefio1+ and FET3 promoter sequences or with any other 5′ regions of iron-responsive genes from S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, BLAST searches for Aft1 or Aft2 homologs in the S. pombe genome data base (41Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.A. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) have revealed noS. pombe proteins with significant identity. Based on this observation, we sought to determine a consensus DNA sequence requirement for the putative S. pombe iron-sensing protein and, subsequently, to identify the fission yeast iron metalloregulatory protein that regulates the iron transporter gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that iron-mediated repression of the reductive iron transporter gene fio1+ inS. pombe requires the promoter cis-acting element, 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′. Furthermore, we find that the S. pombe Fep1 protein can sense and translate iron concentration changes to the iron transport machinery because of its ability to interact directly in an iron-dependent manner with the 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ element found in the fio1+ promoter region, which gives a marked repression of thefio1+ gene expression. Moreover, we have also identified two proteins, Tup11 and Tup12, which act as putative co-repressors for iron repression of the fio1+ gene expression. Taken together, these results reveal the identity ofcis- and trans-acting elements for molecular control of critical genes encoding components of the reductive iron uptake machinery in fission yeast. The S. pombestrains used in this study were the wild-type FY435 (h+ his7–366 leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210) (42Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the fep1Δ disruption strain (h+ his7–366 leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 fep1Δ::ura4+ ). To ascertain that the results observed were not specific to the S. pombestrain FY435, identical experiments were carried out with the strain JSY174 (h − leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210). Thetup11Δ (h − leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 tup11Δ::ura4+ ),tup12Δ (h − leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 tup12Δ::LEU2), and tup11Δtup12Δ double mutant (h − leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 tup11Δ::ura4+tup12Δ::LEU2) disruption strains are isogenic to the strain JSY174 (43Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When plasmid maintenance was required, yeast cells were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium as described previously (44Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar), except that the media contained only 74 nm FeCl3. Iron deprivation or iron repletion was carried out by adding the indicated amount of BPS1 or FeCl3 to cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.9–1.1) in Edinburgh minimal medium. At this mid-logarithmic phase, cells were treated for 90 min at 30 °C. Under nonselective conditions, cells were grown on yeast extract plus supplements (44Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). For observing the phleomycin-sensitive growth phenotype, 10 μg/ml phleomycin (Sigma) was added to yeast extract plus supplements. To detect the enhanced reductase activity associated with the inactivation of the fep1+ allele (fep1Δ), a plate assay was used as described previously (45Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), except that the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-containing overlay was poured on fresh colonies grown on YES plates, which contained 50 μm FeCl3. The plasmid pSP1fio1+ -1155lacZ contains thefio1+ promoter region up to −1155 from the start codon of the fio1+ gene in addition to theE. coli lacZ gene. This latter plasmid was constructed via three-piece ligation by simultaneously introducing theEcoRI-StuI fragment of YEp357R (46Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene. 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and theBamHI-EcoRI fragment from thefio1+ promoter containing 1155 bp of the 5′-noncoding region and the first 13 codons of thefio1+ gene into theBamHI-SmaI cut pSP1 vector (47Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Four plasmids (pSP1fio1+ -884lacZ, pSP1fio1+ -793lacZ, pSP1fio1+ -761lacZ, and pSP1fio1+ -680lacZ) harboring sequential deletions from the 5′ end of thefio1+ promoter were created from plasmid pSP1fio1+ -1155lacZ using theExoIII/mung bean nuclease method as described previously (48Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSKfio1+ 297 containing nucleotides from position −922 to position −625 with respect to the A of the ATG codon of the fio1+ ORF was created to introduce mutations in either or both GATA elements (positions −800 to −795; positions −777 to −772) by site-directed mutagenesis. Precisely, the oligonucleotides 5′-−779CCAATCTGGACAAAAGGGCGTCGATGTAATCCAGATGCCTGGAAG−823-3′, 5′-−756CACTTTGATCGGTTGCGACAGGACCAATCTGGACAAAAGTTATCAGATG−804-3′, and 5′-−756CACTTTGATCGGTTGCGACAGGACCAATCTGGACAAAAGGGCGTCGATGTAATCCAGATG−815-3′ (letters that are underlined represent multiple point mutations in the GATA elements) were used in conjunction with pSKfio1+ 297 and the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA sequence for each construct created was verified by dideoxy sequencing, and thefio1+ promoter fragment was inserted into theXhoI and SmaI sites of pCF83 (49Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for analyzing heterologous reporter gene expression. A functional ura4+ cassette was isolated from pUR18 (50Barbet N. Muriel W.J. Carr A.M. Gene. 1992; 114: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) by PCR. The primers were designed to create ClaI and NdeI sites at the beginning and the end of theura4+ genetic marker, respectively. After digestion at these sites, the ura4+ fragment was inserted to replace two-thirds of the fep1+ ORF, leaving 477 and 200 bp each side of the fep1+ locus for homologous recombination, creating pfep1Δ::ura4+ . The gene disruption fragment (5′-fep1-ura4+-fep1-3′) was generated by restriction endonuclease digestion using unique flanking sites (BamHI and Asp718) and then transformed into the appropriate S. pombe strains by electroporation (51Prentice H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The allele status of the locus in all strains generated was verified using Southern blotting and diagnostic PCR. Conveniently, this disruption rendered the mutant strain unable to grow aerobically on medium containing 10 μg/ml phleomycin (Sigma), an antibiotic that confers iron-dependent toxicity. The phleomycin-sensitive growth phenotype, because of the inactivation offep1+ , was remediated by integration of the wild type fep1+ gene to the leu1 locus infep1Δ strain cells. The plasmid for integration was constructed by insertion of a 3.2-kb SacII-XhoI genomic fragment encompassing the fep1+ gene, which was cloned into plasmid pJK148 (52Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) before transformation into cells for homologous recombination. For RNase protection analyses (53Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), three plasmids for making antisense RNA probes were utilized. The plasmids pKSlacZ and pSKact1+ used were described previously (40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 48Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSKfio1+ was constructed by inserting a 218-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the fio1+ gene into the same sites of pBluescript II SK. The antisense RNA hybridizes to the region between +91 and +309 downstream from the initiator codon offio1+ . For Northern blot analyses, thefep1+ gene was isolated by PCR using primers that corresponded to the start and stop codons of the ORF. This PCR product was purified using the GFX gel band purification kit (AmershamBiosciences). A 32P-labeled probe was made from the DNA fragment using the Random primed labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified using the Quick spin probe purification column system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was carried out according to the Schleicher & Schuell protocol. The S. pombe act1+ probe (40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used as an internal control for normalization during quantitation. The DNA containing the amino-terminal 241 codons of Fep1 was fused in-frame to the maltose-binding protein. To generate this fusion, thefep1+ gene starting at +4 after the start codon up to +723 was amplified using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the BamHI-PstI sites of pBluescript II KS and sequenced to verify its integrity. The fragment was digested and cloned into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) using the same restriction sites. Plasmid pMAL-fep1+ was transformed into E. coli TB1. Fresh transformants of TB1 cells containing the plasmid pMAL-c2X or pMAL-Fep1 were grown toA 600 of 0.5 in rich medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 0.2% glucose) containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. At this early growth phase, the cells were induced in the presence of FeCl3 (0 and 1 mm) or BPS (1 mm) with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 25 °C. Harvested cells were washed once in ice-cold water and resuspended in C buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with an equal volume of glass beads and protease inhibitors (8 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The mixture was vortexed for 45 s at top speed at 4 °C for 4 times. After centrifugation at 4 °C, the whole cell extracts were purified by affinity chromatography using the amylose resin as described by the manufacturer. To demonstrate specific DNA binding activity for Fep1, electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding reactions were carried out using 1× binding buffer that contained 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)2, 5 μmZnSO4, and 5 μm FeCl3 unless otherwise stated. Typically, ∼240 ng of affinity-purified MBP-Fep1 was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with ∼1 ng of32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligomers harboring the two 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ sites. When indicated, competitors to concentrations specified in Fig. 7 A were added together with the probe. Once incubated, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (30:0.8 acrylamide/bis ratio) that had been preelectrophoresed for 60 min in 0.25× TB (44.5 mm Tris and 44.5 mm borate) at 4 °C. The DNA-protein complex was separated from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °C and 4 W constant power for 2 h. Subsequently, the gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics screen. Studies of iron uptake in S. pombe show that the frp1+ gene encodes a ferric reductase, which reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ at the cell surface (38Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 55Anderson G.J. Dancis A. Roman D.G. Klausner R.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Once reduced, Fe2+ is taken up by a permease-oxidase complex called Fip1/Fio1, which transports iron across the plasma membrane with high affinity (39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

A hallmark of the genes encoding components of the high affinity iron uptake system includingfrp1+ , fip1+ , andfio1+ is the fact that they are transcriptionally expressed according to iron need. They are activated during iron deprivation and repressed by iron repletion (38Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

InS. pombe, the fip1+ andfio1+ genes share the same promoter, with thefip1+ -fio1+ genes divergently transcribed (39Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistently, it is thought that both genes share the same iron regulatory elements in that intergenic promoter. A previous investigation has shown that a short promoter region of the frp1+ gene (from position −332 to position −279 relative to the first nucleotide of the initiator codon) was involved in response to iron repletion (38Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, no regulatory element was defined in detail for the iron responsiveness of thefrp1+ gene. The program GeneStream (Baylor College, Houston, TX) was used to determine a commoncis-acting element betweenfip1+ -fio1+ andfrp1+ promoters. Comparison of thefip1+ -fio1+ intergenic promoter with frp1+ revealed one short region exhibiting 68.5% identity in 54-bp overlap between the two promoters (Fig. 1). Within this shared promoter segment, we noted the presence of two copies of a repeated sequence, 5′-(T/A)GATA(A/T)-3′, similar to the binding sites for the GATA family transcription factors (56Tsai S.F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). A third sequence, highly conserved but distinct from the two GATA sequences, was also observed at the 3′ end of that promoter segment. To ascertain whether the two GATA-like elements play a role in fio1+ regulation by iron, a series of nested 5′ deletions of promoter sequences beginning at position −1155 were created in the plasmid pSP1fio1+ -1155lacZ (Fig.2). This fusion promoter was able to down-regulate (∼2-fold) and up-regulate (∼8-fold) lacZmRNA expression in the presence of iron or BPS, respectively (Fig.2 C). Removal of the fio1+ upstream region between −1155 and −884 had little effect on the iron-dependent regulation of thefio1+-lacZ fusion, except for the magnitude of the response, which was more pronounced with ∼3-fold repression in response to iron and ∼13-fold activation under iron starvation conditions (Fig. 2 C). Further deletion to position −793 gave high constitutive levels offio1+-lacZ fusion gene expression with failure to repress gene expression in response to iron concentrations below 100 μm. Under iron deprivation conditions, increased gene expression was detected. When thefio1+ promoter was further deleted to position −761, the fio1+-lacZ gene was still remarkably highly expressed. Furthermore, this pSP1fio1+-761lacZ derivative was completely defective in iron-regulated gene expression. Deletion to position −680 abolished the highly expressed steady-state level offio1+-lacZ mRNA, lowering its expression to a minimal threshold. Interestingly, this 81-bp DNA region between positions −761 and −680 contained the above-mentioned third conserved region located at the 3′ end of the two GATA-like elements.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Parkinson's disease glutathione S-transferase bovine serum albumin diaminobenzidine pellet supernatant lysed Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. At post-mortem examination, brains from PD patients show loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and surviving neurons develop a characteristic inclusion called Lewy body (1Hardy J. Gwinn-Hardy K. Science. 1998; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Dunnett S.B. Björklund A. Nature. 1999; 399: A32-A39Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). While most cases of Parkinson's disease are sporadic, a few families have PD caused by mutations in the α-synuclein gene (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C., Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L.

Lett. 1997; 239: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is highly enriched in the brain, and it progressively accumulates into nerve terminals during development (8Iwai A.

Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although the physiologic role of α-synuclein is still unclear, there is evidence that it regulates the size of the synaptic vesicular pool (10Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, targeted disruption of the α-synuclein gene causes accelerated recovery of dopamine release when the neuron is presented with multiple stimuli, suggesting that α-synuclein is a negative regulator of dopamine neurotransmission (11Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D., Ho W.-H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M.G. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Philips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Thus, although α-synuclein has a synaptic role, its protein partners in the synapse and how it contributes to the death of dopaminergic neurons in PD are not known. We have previously characterized synphilin-1 as a protein that associates with α-synuclein and leads to the formation of inclusion bodies when co-transfected with the non-Aβ component of α-synuclein in cultured cells (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The interaction of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein has recently been confirmed by biochemical and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques (13Kawamata H. McLean P.J. Sharma N. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 co-localizes with C-terminally truncated α-synuclein constructs in cytoplasmic inclusions of H4 transfected cells (15McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that α-synuclein-synphilin-1 interaction may be relevant for inclusion formation. In accordance, synphilin-1 has been found to be an intrinsic component of Lewy bodies in PD indicating that it may be involved in the pathology of PD (16Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Parkin, a protein implicated in juvenile PD, has also been shown to interact with and ubiquitinate synphilin-1. Co-transfection of synphilin-1, α-synuclein, and parkin elicits the formation of ubiquitin-positive Lewy body-like cytosolic inclusions, suggesting that synphilin-1 may link α-synuclein and parkin into a common pathogenic mechanism (17Chung K.K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.H. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Disease mutations in parkin fail to ubiquitinate synphilin-1 raising the possibility that accumulation of synphilin-1 could also be implicated in the pathogenesis of PD (17Chung K.K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.H. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Although there are compelling data supporting the association of synphilin-1 with α-synuclein and PD, the distribution and role of synphilin-1 in the brain are not known. Because α-synuclein is a regulator of the synaptic vesicle pool, we now raise the possibility that synphilin-1 is a synaptic target for α-synuclein. Here we show that synphilin-1 was predominantly expressed in neurons and gradually migrated to presynaptic terminals during development. Synphilin-1 specifically associated with synaptic vesicles, and this interaction was negatively modulated by α-synuclein. Thus, synphilin-1 seems to be a synaptic partner of α-synuclein, implying that this interaction mediates the synaptic effects of α-synuclein. Purified synaptosomes were prepared by Percoll gradient from Wistar rat brains by pooling interfaces of 10–15% and 15–23% Percoll as described previously (18Dunkley P.R. Heath J.W. Harrison S.M. Jarvie P.E. Glenfield P.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1988; 441: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations were carried out as described previously (19Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains of five adult rats were homogenized in buffer containing 0.32m sucrose, 4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The crude homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g, producing the P1 pellet. The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged for 15 min at 9,200 × g, producing the pellet P2 and supernatant S2. P2 was washed once with the original volume of homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ×g to produce the final P2 pellet. S2 supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 165,000 × g to give the supernatant S3 and pellet P3. Washed P2 was resuspended in a small volume of homogenization buffer and lysed hypotonically with 9 volumes of ice-cold water containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. The pH was quickly adjusted by the addition of concentrated Hepes, pH 7.4. The lysed P2 was centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g, giving rise to the supernatant LS1 and pellet LP1. LS1 was centrifuged for 2 h at 165,000 × g, producing the supernatant LS2 and the crude synaptic vesicle fraction LP2. Protein samples (50 μg) were denatured for 5 min at 100 °C in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. N2A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of full-length synphilin-1 in pRK5-HA plasmid (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C.

Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and synphilin-1 was detected by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody produced against synphilin-1 (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Samples were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Protein samples (50 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 200 mA for 16 h. The blots were probed with antibodies against synphilin-1 (1 μg/ml), α-synuclein (1:2,000, Transduction Laboratories), and synaptophysin (1:10,000, Sigma). Western blots were developed with ECL detection reagents, and the yielded luminescence was captured on a Hyperfilm ECL autoradiography film (AmershamBiosciences). Rats were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were dissected, fixed for an additional 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Ten-micrometer-thick sections were cut in a cryostat and immunoreacted with antibodies against synphilin-1 (2.5 μg/ml) and tyrosine hydroxylase (1:300, Chemicon). Immunostaining was developed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories). The specificity of the immunostaining was checked by incubating adjacent sections with preabsorbed anti-synphilin-1 antibody. For this, antibody against synphilin-1 was incubated with excess synphilin-1 antigen as described previously (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Adult Wistar rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.08% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were dissected and immersed into 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Fifty-micrometer-thick sections were cut using a vibratome and collected into phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Sections were cryoprotected into 30% sucrose for 6 h and kept at −70 °C. After thawing, sections were immunostained with anti-synphilin-1 antibody (2.5 μg/ml) and were detected using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories). Stained sections were postfixed for 1 h in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by a 15-min incubation in 1% OsO4 and dehydration with increasing concentrations of acetone. Sections were immersed for 6 h in Epon diluted with acetone 1:1 and infiltrated for 24 h in 100% Epon. Polymerization of Epon was done by incubating the sections between two slides for 24 h at 60 °C. Pieces from selected areas were mounted on Epon capsules, and ultrathin sections were collected over copper grids and counterstained with lead citrate. Images were obtained using a Zeiss 900 electron microscope. For immunogold labeling, vibratome sections were embedded and polymerized in Unicryl. Ultrathin sections were mounted over nickel grids, blocked with 50 mm ammonium chloride, 3% BSA, and 0.02% Tween 20, and further incubated with anti-synphilin-1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Ten-nanometer gold anti-rabbit antibody was used to develop the reaction. Immunogold-stained sections were counterstained with 2% glutaraldehyde, 1% OsO4, and lead citrate. Blanks were carried out by omitting primary antibody. Images were obtained using a Zeiss 900 electron microscope. For synaptic vesicle immunoprecipitation, Dynal beads (M-450) conjugated to secondary anti-mouse antibody were first coated with a monoclonal antibody to synaptophysin (Sigma) or mouse control IgG by overnight incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA followed by four washes in the same buffer. Then the LP2 brain subcellular fraction was incubated overnight with beads coupled to either anti-synaptophysin or mouse IgG in buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1% BSA, and the protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were washed five times with the same buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against synaptophysin, synphilin-1, and α-synuclein. The yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described previously (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A.

Holzbaur E.L.F. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 13: 2205-2212Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Different synphilin-1 truncations were fused in-frame into a yeast two-hybrid vector containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pPC97), and N-terminal α-synuclein (amino acids 1–65) was fused to the GAL4 DNA activation domain in pPC86 vector. The yeast strain Y190 (MATa, ura3–52,his3-Δ200, ade 2–101, trp 1–901, leu 2–3, 112,gal4Δgal80Δ,URA::GAL-lacZ,cyhr2,LYS::GAL-HIS3) was used for all transformations. Synphilin-1/pPC97 constructs were co-transformed with α-synuclein/pPC86 into Y190. The transformants were grown for 4 days in Trp−, Leu−, His−. The β-galactosidase filter lift assay was carried out for all grown colonies and monitored within 1 h at 37 °C. c-Jun (amino acids 246–335) in pPC86 and c-Fos (amino acids 117–197) in pPC97 were used as positive controls for the yeast two-hybrid assays. N-terminal synphilin-1-(1–349)-GST or FKBP12-GST fusion proteins were produced and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For binding experiments, the LP2 brain fraction was incubated with 20 μg/ml GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Beads were washed five times with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer, and synaptic vesicles pulled down by synphilin-1-GST were detected with anti-synaptophysin antibody. To ascertain synphilin-1 localization, we carried out immunohistochemistry and found that synphilin-1 is widely distributed in the brain and highly enriched in neurons. In postnatal day 7 rat, highest expression was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Fig. 1,A–C). Synphilin-1 densities were higher in neuronal cell bodies of layers II, III, and VI of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1 A). In the hippocampus, pyramidal neurons (CA1 to CA3 regions) were strongly labeled as well as the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (Fig. 1 B). In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (P) were strongly stained with substantial staining also observed in the granule cell layer but negligible staining in the molecular layer (Fig. 1 C). High densities of synphilin-1 were also observed in the caudate-putamen and associated structures, such as nucleus accumbens, as well as in the olfactory bulb and anterior commissure (data not shown). Staining was prominent in most nuclei of the brainstem (data not shown). Synphilin-1 immunostaining was specific since no labeling was observed when brain tissues were incubated with anti-synphilin-1 antibody preabsorbed with antigen (Fig.1 D and data not shown). Expression of synphilin-1 was developmentally regulated. At higher magnification, the immunoreactivity of synphilin-1 in postnatal day 3 brain was prominent in the soma and processes of neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Fig. 1, E, H, andK). However, when we analyzed the labeling of synphilin-1 in postnatal day 14 brain, we observed a decrease of synphilin-1 densities in the cell bodies and a concomitant increase in the neuropil (Fig. 1,F, I, and L). This was better observed in adult brain (3 months) in which synphilin-1 immunoreactivity exhibited a diffuse punctuated pattern with no labeling of cell bodies, suggestive of nerve terminal staining (Fig. 1. G,J, and M). Thus, in the adult cerebellum, staining of Purkinje and granule cells was light or absent, and immunoreactivity was prominent in the molecular layer, which contains abundant synapses of the parallel fibers originating from granule cell layer. Neither cell bodies nor neuropil were stained when brain sections were incubated with anti-synphilin-1 antibody preabsorbed with synphilin-1 antigen (Fig. 1, N–P, and data not shown). Different from other regions in the brain, immunostaining of synphilin-1 in substantia nigra pars compacta persisted in cell bodies and process of neurons even in the adult brain with a pattern similar to that observed for tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (Fig. 3). However, by analyzing adjacent sections, we found that more neuronal cell bodies were stained for tyrosine hydroxylase than for synphilin-1. This may be due to differences in the quality of the antibodies used or to partial migration of synphilin-1 to neuropil. Nevertheless synphilin-1 is expressed in human dopaminergic neurons, and it is present in the majority of Lewy bodies in PD, indicating that synphilin-1 co-localizes with the neurons affected by the disease (16Wakabayashi K.

Synphilin-1 immunostaining of substantia nigra neurons was specific since no labeling was observed when sections were incubated with preabsorbed anti-synphilin-1 antibody (Fig.2, inset).Figure 3Expression of synphilin-1 protein during development. A, rat brain protein lysates (50 μg) were obtained from animals with different ages, postnatal day 0 (P0) until adult (3 months) and analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against synphilin-1. Protein extract of N2A cells expressing recombinant synphilin-1 by transfecting full-length synphilin-1 in pRK5-HA plasmid was used as control (first lane, Sph1-HA). Levels of synphilin-1 in the brain are similar during development and adulthood. The apparent molecular weight of synphilin-1 decreased in rats older than postnatal day 14 (P14). The blot is representative of four independent experiments with three different preparations.

Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The decrease in cell body staining in adult brain was not caused by a decrease in synphilin-1 expression since synphilin-1 was expressed at similar levels in all animal ages. Nevertheless we observed a significant change in synphilin-1 apparent molecular weight during development (Fig.3 A). Synphilin-1 mobility was identical to the recombinant full-length protein until postnatal day 14 (Fig. 3). At postnatal day 30 and older ages, synphilin-1 gel mobility changed to ∼90 kDa (Fig. 3). Thus, redistribution of synphilin-1 toward the neuropil seems to parallel the decrease of its apparent size during development, implying a post-translational modification. Similar to that previously reported for α-synuclein (9Hsu L.J. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Withers G.S. George J.M. Banker G.A. Clayton D.F. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), synphilin-1 staining of neuropil in the adult brain indicated that it progressively accumulated in nerve terminals during development. In accordance, we found that synphilin-1 was enriched in biochemically purified nerve terminals prepared from adult but not young animals (Fig. 4 A). A similar pattern was observed for α-synuclein expression (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, synaptophysin was enriched in synaptosomes since early ages (Fig. 4 C). To further investigate the intracellular distribution of synphilin-1, we prepared subcellular fractions from rat brain tissue. We found that synphilin-1 was highly concentrated in LP2, a fraction enriched in synaptic vesicles (Fig. 4 D). The integral synaptic vesicle synaptophysin was used as an internal control for the preparation (Fig.4 E). To directly demonstrate synphilin-1 localization in nerve terminals, we carried out electron microscopy studies. When revealed with DAB, synphilin-1 immunoreactivity was observed at presynaptic nerve terminals of adult rat frontal cortex (Fig.5, A and B). Synphilin-1 immunoreactivity was absent from cell bodies or postsynaptic densities of mature cortical neurons (data not shown). Immunogold electron microscopy showed that synphilin-1 immunoreactivity was located in the vicinity or associated to synaptic vesicles (arrows) (Fig. 5 C). Gold particles were not found at postsynaptic densities. No specific DAB or immunogold staining was observed when sections were incubated with preabsorbed anti-synphilin-1 antibody (Fig. 5, D–H), suggesting that synphilin-1 decorates synaptic vesicles in a specific manner. To determine the degree of association between synaptic vesicles and synphilin-1, synaptic vesicles were immunoprecipitated with anti-synaptophysin antibody and checked for the presence of synphilin-1. Synphilin-1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with synaptic vesicles, suggesting that it associates in vivowith these structures (Fig.6 A). The interaction of synphilin-1 with synaptic vesicles was specific since no immunoprecipitation was observed with beads coupled to mouse IgG as a control. In a previous report, the region of interaction between synphilin-1 and α-synuclein was not thoroughly defined (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we mapped the first 349 amino acid residues of synphilin-1 as the minimal region for interaction with the first 65 amino acid residues of α-synuclein (Fig. 6 C). Further deletions of the N-terminal region of synphilin-1 abolished the interaction. To verify if the region that interacts with α-synuclein suffices for binding synaptic vesicles, we expressed the N-terminal synphilin-1 region and checked for its ability to pull down synaptic vesicles from the LP2 fraction. We found that synphilin-1-(1–349)-GST robustly associated with synaptophysin-containing synaptic vesicles, and this association was resistant to high salt washing (Fig.7). No binding to synaptic vesicles was observed with FKBP12-GST control. Because the region of synphilin-1 that binds to α-synuclein contains the region that associates to synaptic vesicles, it is possible that α-synuclein anchors synphilin-1 to the vesicles. However, this possibility is unlikely since biochemical and density gradient centrifugation experiments failed to detect the presence of α-synuclein in the synaptic vesicle fraction (23Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Müller V. Jacobsen H. Schindzielorz A. Okochi M. Uwe L. van der Putten H. Probst A. Kremmer E. Kretzschmar H.A. Hass C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the interaction of α-synuclein with synaptic vesicles is reversible, and the biochemical fractionation possibly dissociates the synuclein-synaptic vesicle complex. In accordance, we found that most of α-synuclein was cytosolic, and only a minor fraction was present in LP2 (data not shown). In addition, levels of α-synuclein in immunopurified synaptic vesicles were undetectable under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Thus, we now raise the possibility that α-synuclein modulates the binding of synphilin-1 rather than anchoring it to vesicles. We explored this possibility by adding purified α-synuclein to the incubation mixture and measuring the degree of association of synphilin-1 with synaptic vesicles. We found that both wild type and A53T mutant α-synuclein abolished the binding of synphilin-1 to synaptic vesicles, suggesting that α-synuclein negatively regulates the association of synphilin-1 with synaptic vesicles (Fig. 7). We did not detect binding of synaptic vesicles to α-synuclein-GST under our experimental conditions using high salt concentration (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that α-synuclein competes with synphilin-1 for the same site in the surface of the vesicles. We previously demonstrated that synphilin-1 specifically co-immunoprecipitates with α-synuclein from brain homogenates (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence supporting the notion that synphilin-1 is a synaptic partner of α-synuclein. We found that synphilin-1 was widely distributed in the brain and that it was localized to neurons. Like α-synuclein, synphilin-1 was found in the cell bodies of immature neurons and was redistributed toward the presynaptic nerve terminal during development. Similar to α-synuclein, segregation of synphilin-1 into synaptic terminals appeared late in the development of the central nervous system suggesting that synphilin-1 would be important in the maturation or perhaps modulation of synapses. α-Synuclein has been shown to undergo fast axonal transport (24Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The characterization of synphilin-1 transport toward the synaptic terminal may give some clues about the process that leads to abnormal accumulation of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein in the cell body of neurons in PD. The decrease of the apparent molecular weight of synphilin-1 in older animals raises the possibility that synphilin-1 undergoes post-translational modification during development, such as proteolysis. Supporting this idea is the fact that we previously found only one size of synphilin-1 mRNA (12Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore the parallel accumulation of synphilin-1 at nerve terminals and the decrease of its apparent molecular weight suggest that synphilin-1 may be more vulnerable to post-translational modification at the presynaptic nerve terminal. Further studies will be necessary to clarify the mechanism of synphilin-1 post-translational modification. α-Synuclein has been shown to regulate the size of the presynaptic vesicular pool in primary hippocampal neurons, and transgenic mice overexpressing α-synuclein have a loss of dopaminergic terminals (10Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein knockout mice display increased dopamine release under stimulated conditions, suggesting that α-synuclein is a negative regulator of dopamine neurotransmission (11Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D., Ho W.-H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M.G. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Philips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). We now show that α-synuclein also abolished the interaction of synphilin-1 with synaptic vesicles. Thus, it is conceivable that synphilin-1 plays a role on synaptic function in concert with α-synuclein. In addition, it has recently been described that synphilin-1 can be phosphorylated in cultured cells and that inhibition of synphilin-1 phosphorylation markedly reduces its ability to interact with α-synuclein (26Lee G. Lee S.S. Junn E. Kim Y.M. Bishop J.F. Mouradian M.M. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; 27: 324.1Google Scholar). Therefore, modulation of synphilin-1-α-synuclein interaction by phosphorylation may also be important to determine the amount of synphilin-1 bound to synaptic vesicles. Hyman and co-workers (13Kawamata H. McLean P.J. Sharma N. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique, have suggested that the C termini of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein specifically interact. Our data revealed that the first 349 amino acid residues of synphilin-1 were required for binding the N terminus of α-synuclein. Thus, both N and C termini of synphilin-1 may be required for interaction with α-synuclein. We were not able to further restrict the α-synuclein binding region of synphilin-1 by the yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that synphilin-1 may require a tertiary structure to interact with α-synuclein. In addition, we found that the N-terminal region of synphilin-1 bound strongly to synaptic vesicles. α-Synuclein interacts in vitro with synthetic membranes (27Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 28Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.-C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). An association of α-synuclein with synaptic vesicles was proposed based on the finding that it co-localizes with synaptophysin in brain sections and primary neuronal cultures (8Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M., Ge, N. Flanagan L. de Silva R.H. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 10Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when more comprehensive brain fractionation experiments were done, α-synuclein was found to be depleted from the synaptic vesicle-enriched fraction (LP2), and instead it was shown to be enriched in a vesicle-depleted supernatant, suggesting that the association of α-synuclein with synaptic vesicles is weak and reversible (23Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Müller V. Jacobsen H. Schindzielorz A. Okochi M. Uwe L. van der Putten H. Probst A. Kremmer E. Kretzschmar H.A. Hass C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). By contrast, synphilin-1 remained strongly bound to immunopurified synaptic vesicles (Fig. 6 A). Thus, it is unlikely that α-synuclein anchors synphilin-1 to synaptic vesicles. Instead our data imply that synphilin-1 may reversibly link α-synuclein to the surface of synaptic vesicles. Synphilin-1 has been shown to accumulate in Lewy bodies, indicating that abnormal distribution of synphilin-1 might also play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease (16Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 30Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Tanaka Y. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 520Google Scholar). Different from other regions of the brain, we detected synphilin-1 in cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons from substantia nigra of adult animals (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that synphilin-1 could be available as a core for Lewy body formation. In agreement, synphilin-1 is found in the core of Lewy bodies from patients with PD (16Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The persistence of synphilin-1 in the soma of neurons from substantia nigra may facilitate the formation of Lewy bodies that are characteristically found in this region. Taken together our data support the idea that synphilin-1 is a partner for α-synuclein in the synapse and that it could mediate the synaptic role of α-synuclein. Understanding the regulation of synphilin-1-α-synuclein interaction will help clarify the possible synaptic contribution for the pathogenesis of PD. The association of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein may be important for the pathogenesis of PD, and targeted disruption of their interaction could have therapeutic implications. Recently parkin was shown to weakly associate with synaptic vesicles (31Kubo S. Kitami T. Noda S. Shimura H. Uchiyama Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and it also interacts with synphilin-1 and α-synuclein (17Chung K.K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.H. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar,32Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Thus, synphilin-1 may be physiologically important to keep both α-synuclein and parkin in close association with synaptic vesicles. A better understanding of the dynamics of the interactions among these proteins may help determine the pathogenesis of the disease. We thank S. Leao and S. L. de Almeida for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2088020457,"Protein kinase C (PKC) regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride function has been demonstrated in several cell lines, including Calu-3 cells that express native, wild-type CFTR. We demonstrated previously that PKCε was required for cAMP-dependent CFTR function. The goal of this study was to determine whether PKCε interacts directly with CFTR. Using overlay assay, immunoprecipitation, pulldown and binding assays, we show that PKCε does not bind to CFTR, but does bind to a receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1), a 37-kDa scaffold protein, and that RACK1 binds to Na+/H+exchange regulatory factor (NHERF1), a binding partner of CFTR.In vitro binding assays demonstrate dose-dependent binding of PKCε to RACK1 which is inhibited by an 8-amino acid peptide based on the sequence of the sixth Trp-Asp repeat in RACK1 or by an 8-amino acid sequence in the V1 region of PKCε, εV1-2. A 4-amino acid sequence INAL (70–73) expressed in CFTR shares 50% homology to the RACK1 inhibitory peptide, but it does not bind PKCε. NHERF1 and RACK1 bind in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of RACK1 and CFTR revealed colocalization of the proteins to the apical and lateral regions of Calu-3 cells. The results indicate the RACK1 binds PKCε and NHERF1, thus serving as a scaffold protein to anchor the enzyme in proximity to CFTR.

Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). CFTR is a highly regulated chloride channel expressed in apical membranes of epithelia of the intestine, pancreas, sweat gland secretory coil, and conducting airways (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In the airways, CFTR plays a major role in maintaining optimal humidity and electrolyte balance and in achieving efficient mucociliary clearance through the secretion of fluid and electrolytes. Functioning in concert with CFTR is a basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport protein, which mediates uptake of chloride for secretion. Although CFTR is regulated primarily by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), it is stimulated to a modest extent by protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, our laboratory and others reported that inhibition of PKC activity using a general PKC inhibitor chelerythrine prevented forskolin- or epinephrine-stimulated CFTR function (3Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Liedtke C.M. Cole T. Am. J.

This laboratory established that activity of PKCε is necessary for cAMP-dependent CFTR function. However, the intracellular signaling mechanism that accounts for PKCε regulation of CFTR is not known. The goal of the present study is to elucidate this signaling mechanism.Only a short term incubation with chelerythrine is necessary to modulate CFTR function, suggesting that PKCε is proximal to and closely associated with CFTR. Alternatively, PKCε could regulate CFTR indirectly through an interaction with CFTR-associated proteins. Mounting evidence suggests that active and inactive PKC isotypes are localized near their target substrates by binding to anchoring or scaffold proteins (6Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Because constitutive activity of PKCε is necessary for modulation of CFTR function, we focused, in these studies, on proteins called RACKs, or receptors for activated C kinase. RACK1 was first cloned from a rat brain cDNA library and shown to be a homolog of the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). RACK1 shares with Gβ highly conserved repeating units, called WD repeats, which usually end in Trp-Asp (WD). RACK1 and Gβ belong to an ancient regulatory protein family of WD repeat proteins (9Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Although few WD repeat proteins are enzymes, several interact with other proteins through the WD repeat region to form complexes. The WD repeat regions of Gβ and RACK1 form a rigid seven-blade β propeller structure, arranged in a ring, which is thought to function as an adaptor or scaffold motif (10Garcia-Higuera I.

Hamm H.E. Sigler N.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). RACK1 is thought to function in intracellular signaling by recruiting and anchoring multiple proteins, including enzymes, in the same signaling cascade thus tethering the proteins in the proper subcellular localization for their function. PKC was the first enzyme identified as a RACK1-binding partner (for review, see Refs. 6Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and 7Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). It is now proposed that RACK1 binds PKC in an isotype-specific manner, which may also be cell type-specific (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 12Csukai M,. Chen C.-H., De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A PKCε-specific RACK has been identified by expression cloning and shown to bind activated PKCε at a site in the amino-terminal variable region (V1) of PKCε (13Hu K. Mochly-Rosen D. Boutjdir M. Am.

PKCβII also interacts with RACK1; however, binding involves two domains on PKCβII, a C2, or Ca2+ binding, domain (15Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and a 5-amino acid motif in the V5 domain at the carboxyl terminus (16Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

These interactions are often of high affinity, as with cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 (17Steele M.R. McCahill A. Thompson D.S. MacKenzie C. Isaacs N.W. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. Cell.

Binding of PKC, Src or integrin β subunit to RACK1 is inducible by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, suggesting that, for PKC and Src, enzyme activation is necessary for binding.

CFTR activity is also modulated by an interaction with the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF1), a 50-kDa protein that is also known as EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein-50). NHERF1 is a regulatory factor involved in cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 (28Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The NHERF1 PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains bind to CFTR carboxyl-terminal sequence QDTRL and play a role in the regulation of channel gating in a Calu-3 cell line (29Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc.

NHERF1 is thought to link CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with ezrin and that ezrin serves as a PKA-anchoring protein (32Dransfield D.T. Bradfore A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C.

Indeed, it has been proposed that the NHERF1-CFTR stoichiometry may modulate the magnitude of CFTR channel activity (29Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that down-regulation of PKCε prevented cAMP-dependent CFTR function in Calu-3 cells but did not alter agonist-stimulated Na-K-2Cl cotransporter activity (27Liedtke C.M. Cody D. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L739-L747Google Scholar). In the current project, we examined the interaction of endogenous proteins involved in the signaling between PKCε and CFTR. Protein-protein interactions were identified and characterized using coimmunoprecipitation, overlay assay, pulldown assay and direct binding assays. We report a new previously unidentified interaction between RACK1 and NHERF1. We also demonstrate that PKCε binds to RACK1 and that the interaction involves specific sites on the endogenous proteins.DISCUSSIONThese studies were initiated to clarify the signaling mechanism that explained regulation of cAMP-dependent CFTR function by PKCε in Calu-3 cells. An examination of the binding of activated PKCε to cellular proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and overlay, pulldown and binding assays leads us to conclude that PKCε binds directly to RACK1 and that RACK1 binds to NHERF1. This implies a new and unique role for the scaffold protein RACK1 in epithelial chloride channel function. Characterization of PKCε binding by overlay assay provided evidence for the absence of direct binding to CFTR (Fig. 2) even though coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest an interaction between CFTR and PKCε (Fig. 3). Overlay assay also revealed that other Calu-3 cellular proteins bind PKCε; one is a 37-kDa protein that corresponds in molecular mass to RACK1. Lack of coimmunoprecipitation of RACK1 and CFTR indicates that the two proteins do not interact directly (Fig. 4) even though both proteins are colocalized in the apical region of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 9). Rather, we found that RACK1 and NHERF1, a scaffold protein that binds four carboxyl-terminal amino acids (DTRL) of CFTR through either of its PDZ (PDZ1 and PDZ2) domains (29Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D.

NHERF1 and CFTR bind with high affinity, apparently to regulate other transport proteins, such as the renal outer medullary potassium channel and epithelial sodium channels and NHE3 (39Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallems S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Knuzelman K.

But, it is the potential dimerization of CFTR by bivalent NHERF1 which is postulated to regulate the full expression of CFTR channel function (29Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). NHERF1 may act as a scaffold protein to facilitate an interaction between CFTR and RACK1 or PKCε to achieve optimal cAMP-dependent CFTR function.These studies identify, for the first time, NHERF1 as a binding partner of RACK1 in airway epithelial cells, which express both proteins endogenously. RACK1 also binds PKCε, suggesting that the association of RACK1 and NHERF1 brings activated PKCε close to its site of action. RACK1 and its homolog, the Gβ subunit of heterotrimeric proteins, share a unique rigid β propeller structure, formed by WD repeat regions. The WD repeats have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, the first being binding of activated PKC (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is thought that binding to RACK1 is necessary for translocation of activated PKC and to protect activated PKC from degradation. Our results indicate that airway epithelial RACK1 binds multiple proteins that are implicated directly in the regulation of CFTR function, thus acting as a scaffold. The mode of interaction between RACK1 and NHERF1 is not known. RACK1 lacks a PDZ binding motif at its carboxyl terminus. However, we could speculate that RACK1 might express an internal motif that binds to the PDZ domains of NHERF1. Alternatively, NHERF1 might interact with RACK1 through non-PDZ motifs, such as in its interaction with ezrin (43Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).RACK1 is not phosphorylated by PKC (7Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), but our study provides convincing evidence for direct binding of PKCε to RACK1 in Calu-3 cells. PKCε bound to immunoprecipitates of endogenous RACK1 in an overlay assay (Fig. 2), and endogenous PKCε and RACK1 coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 4, A and B). Binding of PKCε to RACK1 was concentration-dependent with a preference for activated enzyme (Fig. 5, A andB). Binding was blocked by inhibitory peptides derived from the amino acid sequences of predicted binding sites on PKCε and RACK1 (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 14Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen H.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The inhibitory peptide εV1-2, based on an 8-amino acid sequence in the V1 region of the amino terminus of PKCε, preventedin vitro binding of RACK1 and PKCε (Fig. 7). The V1, or variable, region encodes a 145-amino acid segment at the amino-terminal region of PKCε which bears close resemblance to a C2 domain of conventional PKC isotypes (44Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C2 domain together with C1 domain of conventional PKC isotypes (α, β, γ) is responsible for interaction with PKC activators. Dioctanylglycerol and phorbol esters and Ptd-Ser bind to C1 and Ca2+ binds to C2 domains to achieve proper PKC activation (45Pappa H. Murray-Rust J. Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 1998; 6: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The C2-like domain of novel PKC isotypes (δ, ε, η, θ) regulates kinase activity through binding of PtdSer, lacks acidic side chains necessary for Ca2+binding, and also serves as a site of protein interactions (46Lopez-Lluch G. Bird M.M. Canas B. Godovac-Zimmerman J. Ridley A. Segala A.W. Dekker L.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other investigators and our current study demonstrate that C2 counterparts in PKCε have sites of interaction with RACK1.A second inhibitory peptide, based on an 8-amino acid peptide in the sixth WD repeat of RACK1 and designated VI-RACK, bound PKCε in a dose-dependent manner and blocked the interaction between PKCε and RACK1 (Fig. 6). We compared the sequence of VI-RACK with that of CFTR to determine whether an analogous binding site for PKCε is expressed in CFTR. Amino acids 70–73 of CFTR shared 50% homology with VI-RACK. To test binding of PKCε, a 12-amino acid peptide was designed to embed the 4-amino acid sequence INAL and still retain a CFTR signature. The CFTR-based peptide did not bind PKCε, thus direct binding is not likely to account for PKCε regulation of CFTR function. Instead, our data indicate that PKCε interacts with the sixth WD repeat of RACK1. Binding to RACK1 can, however, be more complicated, involving more than one binding site on RACK1 or its binding partner. For example, binding of PKCβII to RACK1 involves two sites, one in the C2 domain, the other in the V5 domain (16Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 47Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We have yet to identify an additional site for the interaction of airway epithelial PKCε with RACK1.A direct target of activated PKCε has yet to be defined. Only a short term incubation with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine is necessary to inhibit cAMP stimulation of CFTR (3Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Liedtke C.M. Cole T. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C293-C302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting acute regulation of CFTR function. In the Calu-3 cells, NHERF1, CFTR, and PKCε are each phosphoproteins but may well represent only a small pool of potential PKCε phosphorylation targets. Other proteins implicated in the regulation of CFTR include syntaxin 1A (48Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.K. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which binds to CFTR at the amino terminus. The phosphorylation state of NHERF1 and Munc18, a binding partner of syntaxin 1A, are thought to be important determinants in the functional consequences of binding to CFTR.How the interaction between PKCε and RACK1 and between RACK1 and NHERF1 regulates CFTR function is not known. The activity state of PKCε is often associated with its translocation. Selective activation of PKCε or inhibition of PKCε translocation has specific consequences in other cell types. Secretion of amyloid precursor protein (49Yeon S.W. Jung M.W., Ha, M.J. Kim S.U. Huh K. Savage M.J. Masliah E. Mook-Jung I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Res. 1997; 81: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) are all regulated by PKCε. RACK1 has been implicated in some of these effects of PKCε; however, the intracellular signaling mechanism still must be determined. Nevertheless, one model that emerges from these studies is that NHERF1 recruits a stable regulatory complex and that this is important for regulation of CFTR function. A protein complex of activated PKCε bound to RACK1, which binds NHERF1, would support cAMP-dependent CFTR function. One can conjecture that inactivation of PKCε would free the enzyme from RACK1, possibly to bind to another scaffold or anchor protein, with a subsequent loss of cAMP-dependent CFTR function. RACK1 might, as a consequence, dissociate from NHERF1 or alter NHERF1-CFTR interaction. Thus, PKCε may shift between anchor proteins depending on its activity state. The activity of PKCε may be an important determinant of its binding partner and phosphorylation state of its target protein as well as the functional status of CFTR. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in a gene encoding a protein called CFTR,1 cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). CFTR is a highly regulated chloride channel expressed in apical membranes of epithelia of the intestine, pancreas, sweat gland secretory coil, and conducting airways (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In the airways, CFTR plays a major role in maintaining optimal humidity and electrolyte balance and in achieving efficient mucociliary clearance through the secretion of fluid and electrolytes. Functioning in concert with CFTR is a basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport protein, which mediates uptake of chloride for secretion. Although CFTR is regulated primarily by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), it is stimulated to a modest extent by protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, our laboratory and others reported that inhibition of PKC activity using a general PKC inhibitor chelerythrine prevented forskolin- or epinephrine-stimulated CFTR function (3Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Liedtke C.M. Cole T. Am. J.

This laboratory established that activity of PKCε is necessary for cAMP-dependent CFTR function. However, the intracellular signaling mechanism that accounts for PKCε regulation of CFTR is not known. The goal of the present study is to elucidate this signaling mechanism. Only a short term incubation with chelerythrine is necessary to modulate CFTR function, suggesting that PKCε is proximal to and closely associated with CFTR. Alternatively, PKCε could regulate CFTR indirectly through an interaction with CFTR-associated proteins. Mounting evidence suggests that active and inactive PKC isotypes are localized near their target substrates by binding to anchoring or scaffold proteins (6Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Because constitutive activity of PKCε is necessary for modulation of CFTR function, we focused, in these studies, on proteins called RACKs, or receptors for activated C kinase. RACK1 was first cloned from a rat brain cDNA library and shown to be a homolog of the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). RACK1 shares with Gβ highly conserved repeating units, called WD repeats, which usually end in Trp-Asp (WD). RACK1 and Gβ belong to an ancient regulatory protein family of WD repeat proteins (9Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Although few WD repeat proteins are enzymes, several interact with other proteins through the WD repeat region to form complexes. The WD repeat regions of Gβ and RACK1 form a rigid seven-blade β propeller structure, arranged in a ring, which is thought to function as an adaptor or scaffold motif (10Garcia-Higuera I.

Although these and other findings document that MCs play beneficial immunosurveillance and effector roles in the body, it has been known for some time that MCs also exhibit adverse roles in numerous inflammatory disorders including asthma, chronic urticaria, and systemic anaphylaxis.

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of how different populations of MCs signal through their Ig, complement, and cytokine receptors, even though no signal transduction protein has been identified to date that is relatively specific to this cell type. The Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins plays pivotal roles in virtually every cell. GTP activates the varied Ras family members, whereas GDP inactivates them. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate these signaling proteins by dissociating bound GDP. All GEFs that have been identified to date in MCs (e.g. the Ras GEF Sos (10Turner H. Reif K.

Nevertheless, the fact that a few GEFs that are more restricted in their cellular expression have been identified during the last couple of years has raised the possibility that an undiscovered, more restricted GEF might be present in MCs. Three such relatively restricted regulatory proteins are Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein (RasGRP) 1 (also known as CalDAG-GEFII), RasGRP2 (also known as CalDAG-GEFI), and RasGRP3 (also known as KIAA0846 and CalDAG-GEFIII) (13Kedra D.

There is considerable interest in RasGRP1, RasGRP2, and RasGRP3, in part because these homologous GEFs have additional Ca2+ and phorbol ester/diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding motifs in their C-terminal domains that implicate their involvement in multiple signaling pathways. T cells express RasGRP1 and targeted disrupted of this GEF in mice results in a marked deficiency of mature CD4+/CD8− and CD4−/CD8+ T cells (22Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, at least one RasGRP is of critical importance in cellular differentiation and/or maturation.Mouse bone marrow-derived MCs (mBMMCs) developed with interleukin (IL) 3 (23Razin E. Cordon-Cardo C.

For example, mBMMC cDNA libraries have been used by us to clone mouse MC protease-5, mouse MC protease-7, transmembrane tryptase, and serglycin. We also have used mBMMCs to identify some of the key cells and cytokines that regulate the development and function of MCs.We now describe the cloning of a new GEF from human and mouse MCs and their progenitors. This intracellular protein is designated as RasGRP4 (or CalDAG-GEFIV based on the alternative nomenclature for these proteins) because it is the fourth member of its family. MCs express H-Ras (26Graham T.E. Pfeiffer J.R. Lee R.J. Kusewitt D.F. Martinez A.M. Foutz T. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6733-6744PubMed Google Scholar), and we show that recombinant RasGRP4 can activate this Ras isoform in vitro in a Ca2+- and Mg2+-regulated manner. The cloning of the mouse and humanRasGRP4 cDNAs and genes now provides investigators the opportunity to identify defects in this new signaling protein in MC-dependent diseases. In this regard, we additionally describe single nucleotide/amino acid polymorphisms of thehRasGRP4 gene, transcript, and protein. We also describe splice variants of the hRasGRP4 transcript in a mastocytosis patient, an asthma patient, and an immature MC line derived from a MC leukemia patient (27Butterfield J.H. Weiler D. Dewald G. Gleich G.J. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) that encode substantially altered forms of hRasGRP4. Finally, using the latter leukemia MC line, we show that RasGRP4 is a signal transduction protein that participates in the final stages of MC development, most likely by acting downstream of c-kit.DISCUSSIONWe describe a new mouse and human cation-dependent, GEF/phorbol ester receptor (designated RasGRP4) that is selectively expressed in MCs and their progenitors. The hRasGRP4 gene is >15 kb in size, consists of 18 exons, and resides on chromosome 19q13.1. Because the same four RasGRP genes are present in the mouse and human genomes, the varied members of its family apparently evolved >100 million years ago before the divergence of mice and humans. The hRasGRP1, hRasGRP2, andhRasGRP3 genes reside on chromosomes 15, 15, and 2, respectively (17Bottorff D. Ebinu J. Stone J.C. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). It now appears that an ancestralRasGRP-like gene duplicated twice, and the resulting three genes translocated to distinct chromosomes. The new gene that segregated to the genomic fragment that eventually became human chromosome 19 failed to duplicate again and became RasGRP4in both species. A similar situation occurred for theRasGRP3 gene that eventually developed on human chromosome 2. However, the ancestral RasGRP-like gene that segregated to the genomic fragment that eventually became human chromosome 15 duplicated one more time to become the RasGRP1 andRasGRP2 genes. The resulting four genes then underwent substantial amino acid divergence to create the final RasGRP1, RasGRP2, RasGRP3, and RasGRP4 genes in both species. All four genes were then maintained throughout the evolution of mice and humans. The biological significance of these evolutionary events is that most RasGRP data obtained in mice should be relevant to humans. In addition, mRasGRP4 should be active in human MCs and hRasGRP4 should be active in mouse MCs.As assessed by RNA blot (Fig. 2 a), RT-PCR (Fig. 2,b–d), and immunohistochemical (Fig. 4) analyses, RasGRP4 is an ∼75-kDa intracellular protein that is selectively expressed in mature MCs and their progenitors. When the four RasGRPs were compared (Fig. 5), the least conserved regions were found to be the N and C termini. The N terminus of hRasGRP2 is myristoylated and palmitoylated at Gly2 and Cys7, respectively (19Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although RasGRP4 has a conserved Cys at residue 14, residues 2 and 7 in this GEF are Asn and Lys, respectively (Figs. 1, 3, and 5). Not only does the N terminus of RasGRP4 fail to resemble that of RasGRP2, its amino acid sequence also does not resemble that found in other palmitoylated and myristoylated G proteins (38Gordon J.I. Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Gokel G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8647-8650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus, RasGRP4 and RasGRP2 appear to differ in at least one important structural feature.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) protein is required for the function of adenylate cyclase in yeast, and CDC25 promotes the exchange of guanine nucleotides bound to Ras (40Broek D. Toda T. Michaeli T. Levin L. Birchmeier C. Zoller M. Powers S. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 48: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar,41Jones S. Vignais M.L. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast replication is dependent on CDC25, and inactivation of this GEF results in cell cycle arrest in G1. The most conserved region within RasGRP1 and RasGRP4 corresponds to the catalytic domain of CDC25 (Fig. 5). A comparative three-dimensional model of residues 34–445 of hRasGRP4 (Fig. 6 a) predicted that the overall structure of this region resembles that of hSos1 even though the sequence identity is only ∼20%. The key residues in hSos1 needed to interact with H-Ras are all present in RasGRP4 when it is folded. These data therefore suggested that RasGRP4 probably functions in MCs as a GEF. As noted in Fig. 7, recombinant RasGRP4 is indeed able to activate H-Ras in vitro. MCs express varied members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins (12Song J.S. Gomez J. Stancato L.F.

However, because recombinant hRasGRP3 is able to transfer GTP to GDP-loaded H-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 in vitro (18Yamashita S. Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Tobiume M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25488-25493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined which Ras family members RasGRP4 prefers to interact with inside a living MC.Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that a substantial portion of the RasGRP4 present in the splenic mouse MCs resides on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane of the cell. Although this finding strongly implies that RasGRP4 participates in early signaling events at the plasma membrane of the MC, immunoreactive mRasGRP4 also was found in the cytoplasm. Subcellular fractionation studies of the mRasGRP4 and hRasGRP4 transfectants confirmed these ultrastructural findings. Based on these data, some unknown intracellular factor or post-translational modification event must regulate the movement of RasGRP4 from the cytoplasm to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the MC. Activation of MCs via FcεRI or c-kit results in the rapid generation of DAG, and the generation of this lipid has been linked to the morphological changes that occur in MCs. Mouse, rat, and human RasGRP1, RasGRP2, and RasGRP3 have C1-like domains, and recombinant hRasGRP3 expressed in E. coli can bind 12-[3H]phorbol 13-dibutyrate efficiently in the presence of phospholipids (20Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). We are unaware of any group that has expressed a truncated RasGRP lacking its C1 domain to map precisely the location of its phorbol ester/DAG-binding site. Nevertheless, the data reported in numerous studies (19Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M.

Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have led to the conclusion that DAG is required for the efficient movement of the varied RasGRPs from their cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane.The primary consequence of increased levels of DAG in MCs is thought to be activation of varied protein kinase C isoforms (50Swann P.G. Odom S. Rivera J. Razin E. Rivera J. Signal Transduction in Mast Cells and Basophils. Springer Press, New York1999: 152-170Crossref Google Scholar). However, the facts that RasGRP4 contains a potential DAG-binding domain (Fig.6 b) that is relatively conserved (Fig. 5) and that PMA treatment of RasGRP4-expressing fibroblasts results in dramatic morphologic changes (Fig. 8) now suggest that DAG and varied phorbol esters also regulate the movement of RasGRP4 to the plasma membrane and that this translocation process ultimately contributes to the membrane ruffling and spreading seen in activated MCs. Although the putative DAG-binding domain in RasGRP4 appears to be functionally important in the context of a living cell (Fig. 8), PMA does not enhance or suppress the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the major form of RasGRP4 expressed in MCs, at least in one in vitro assay. A similar finding has been reported for recombinant hRasGRP2 (19Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The specific receptor-mediated signaling pathway(s) in MCs that depends on RasGRP4 remains to be determined experimentally. All mature MCs appear to express FcεRI, c-kit, and RasGRP4. Although RasGRP4 could participate in FcεRI-mediated signaling pathways, our data suggest an important role for our intracellular protein in c-kit-mediated signaling. c-kit is the only cytokine and adherence receptor that is absolutely essential for the development of mature MCs (51Kitamura Y., Go, S. Hatanaka K. Blood. 1978; 52: 447-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kitamura Y. Go S. Blood. 1979; 53: 492-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MCs undergo substantial morphological changes when they bind to c-kitligand+ mesenchymal cells (53Levi-Schaffer F. Dayton E.T. Austin K.F. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. Gravallese P.M. Liu F.T. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3431-3441PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that RasGRP4-expressing fibroblasts undergo dramatic morphologic changes when exposed to PMA (Fig. 8) now suggests that RasGRP4 helps regulate the morphological changes that occur when MCs are activated via c-kit. W/W v mice are MC-deficient (51Kitamura Y., Go, S. Hatanaka K. Blood. 1978; 52: 447-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of a genetic abnormality in c-kit (54Geissler E.N. Ryan M.A. Housman D.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 185-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). This mouse strain contains normal numbers of MC-committed progenitors in its bone marrow, and these progenitors readily target to connective tissue sites. However, the committed progenitors cannot develop into mature MCs because of the genetic defect in the tyrosine kinase domain of c-kit that resides inside MCs and participates in signal transduction pathways. Interestingly, Gordon and Galli (55Gordon J.R. Galli S.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) noted that substantial numbers of mature MCs develop in the skin ofW/W v mice following exposure to PMA. This finding suggested that an undefined PMA-dependent signaling protein acts downstream of c-kit in mouse MC development.Human asthma is a polygenic disorder that is additionally influenced by environmental factors. It is generally accepted that pulmonary MCs play an important role in the initiation and/or progression of this disease. Thus, an intense effort has been made during the last decade to understand the varied signaling pathways that regulate the development and function of pulmonary MCs. We discovered that thehRasGRP4 gene resides at chromosome 19q13.1. Interestingly, gene-linkage studies carried out by others have revealed a human asthma susceptibility locus (p = 0.0013) at chromosome 19q13.1 in Caucasians (56Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The fact that many cytokine precursor transcripts undergo alternative splicing to produce receptor antagonists rather than receptor activators (57Atamas S.P. Choi J. Yurovsky V.V. White B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 58Klein S.C. Golverdingen J.G. Bouwens A.G. Tilanus M.G. de Weger R.A.

Life Sci. 1997; 61: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) documents the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in allergic asthma. Thus, we looked for the expression of altered forms of hRasGRP4 that would be caused by differential splicing of the precursor transcript. Although some of the single amino acid polymorphisms noted in Figs. 3 and5 c could result in forms of the GEF that differ slightly in their ability to activate H-Ras, we searched for the expression ofhRasGRP4 transcripts in an asthma patient that encodes more severely altered proteins. Sequence analysis of eight arbitrarily subcloned hRasGRP4 cDNAs from an asthma patient revealed the presence of two transcripts that contained a 117-nucleotide insertion due to a failure of the hRasGRP4-expressing MC progenitor to remove intron 5 from the precursor transcript (Fig. 9, a andd). No point mutation was noted at the exon 5/intron 5 or intron 5/exon 6 boundaries of the gene. Thus, the variant 1 transcript appears to be caused by an unprecedented post-transcriptional mechanism. Although the mechanism that hinders removal of intron 5 in this patient remains to be determined, the functional consequences of the post-transcriptional event are clear. The aberrant splicing event results in the expression of a 170-residue, non-functional protein.Another abnormal hRasGRP4 cDNA was identified in the asthma patient that also was caused by a failure to properly remove intron 5. In contrast to the variant 1 transcript, the variant 2 transcript possessed a 42-nucleotide deletion (Fig. 9, b andd). When translated, variant 2 should encode a 659-residue protein that lacks the Pro-rich, 14-mer sequence immediately preceding the CDC25-like catalytic domain. The three-dimensional model (Fig.6 a) predicts that the deleted sequence is an extended loop in the CDC25-like catalytic domain opposite the face that interacts with H-Ras, linking one helical domain with another. The loss of this “rigid” Pro-rich, 14-mer sequence undoubtedly will affect the interaction of the two helical domains within the N-terminal segment of hRasGRP4. Because the first helical region is postulated to stabilize the second region that interacts with H-Ras (34Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), disruption of the structure of the loop linking the two domains should adversely affect the ability of hRasGRP4 to transfer GTP to H-Ras. As noted in Fig.9 c, these two aberrantly spliced transcripts were not found in the MC progenitors in the blood of four normal individuals. The mouse counterparts of these two abnormal forms of hRasGRP4 also were not found in BALB/c mBMMCs. Nevertheless, preliminary RT-PCR analysis of 12 other asthma patients revealed that the expression of the non-functional, variant 1 form of hRasGRP4 is a common occurrence in this patient group. 2L. Li and R. L. Stevens, manuscript in preparation.Surprisingly, variant 1 is more prevalent in the human population than variant 2 (Figs. 9 c and 10) even though the former is the more severely altered form of hRasGRP4. Although it is possible that the expression of non-functional forms of hRasGRP4 in multiple asthma patients is coincidental, the gene-linkage studies are suggestive of an adverse role for hRasGRP4 in the development of asthma in some patients.The inbred BXH2 and AKXD13 mouse strains are particularly susceptible to leukemia viruses, and Li et al. (61Li J. Shen H. Himmel K.L. Dupuy A.J. Largaespada D.A. Nakamura T. Shaughnessy J.D., Jr. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) noted that spontaneous retroviral insertion into the RasGRP1 gene in these strains often results in myeloid, B cell, and T cell leukemia. The hRasGRP4 gene resides at chromosome 19q13.1. As noted at the “Mitelman Data base of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer” at the NCI web site (cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosome/Mitelman), breakpoint alterations at chromosome 19q13.1 often lead to leukemia. Systemic mastocytosis and MC leukemia are heterogeneous disorders that result in the production of excessive numbers of MCs. The genetic abnormality that occurs in most systemic mastocytosis patients has not been deduced. Nevertheless, many mastocytosis patients possess a mutation"

Distinct distribution patterns of the SERCA3 gene products were observed in a series of cell lines of hematopoietic, epithelial, embryonic origin, and several cancerous types, as well as in panels of rat and human tissues. Hypertension and protein kinase C, calcineurin, or retinoic acid receptor signaling pathways were found to differently control rat and human splice variant expression, respectively. Stable overexpression of each variant was performed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the SERCA3 isoforms were fully characterized.

This very tight control is necessary to enable cells to extract relevant information from the Ca2+ signal, but also implies that disturbances in the intracellular Ca2+ signal can lead to a plethora of consequences. Ca2+ signaling is highly complex and comprises elementary and global oscillatory events involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane proteins.

InsP3-Rs induce peaks in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration as a result of Ca2+ release from ER, whereas SERCAs are involved in the falling phase of Ca2+ transients because of Ca2+ resequestration into the ER Ca2+stores. Although many data are available on the role of InsP3-Rs in Ca2+ signaling, our knowledge of the role of SERCAs is more restricted. For 35 years research on these enzymes has focused on their biochemical and molecular characterization. The SERCA family includes three gene products, named SERCA1 (ATP2A1), -2 (ATP2A2), and -3 (ATP2A3), which give rise to alternatively spliced mRNA and protein isoforms. The SERCA1 and SERCA2 genes have been known for a while, and have two 3′ end splice variants encoding different carboxyl termini isoforms, mainly expressed in adult (SERCA1a) and neonatal (SERCA1b) skeletal muscles, in cardiac muscle (SERCA2a), and in all cell types (SERCA2b). Intriguingly as regards the variety of non-muscle cell functions, compared with muscle cells, until 1998, a unique so-called non-muscle SERCA3a isoform was described (5Burk S.E. Lytton J.

In recent years, there have been enormous advances in our understanding of SERCAs, including new insight into their structure (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) and their relevant physiological functions in human diseases (4Sakuntabhai A. Ruiz-Perez V. Carter S. Jacobsen N. Burge S.

Various SERCA2 gene mutations have been reported in Darier-White disease, a rare dermatosis characterized by focal areas of separation between keratinocytes (4Sakuntabhai A. Ruiz-Perez V. Carter S.

In contrast, knockout of SERCA2 and SERCA3 genes leads to impaired cardiac performance (11Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T.

These molecular genetic studies of causal genes in humans, coupled with the observation that distinct phenotypes were found in either SERCA2 or SERCA3 knock-out models, point to compensatory phenomena or to many more diseases than those known today caused by an altered function of one of the known or unknown Ca2+-transporting proteins (15Missiaen L. Robberecht W. Bosch L.V. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Nilius B. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the meanwhile, SERCA3 genes were suggested to possess a high degree of complexity. We and others showed that the human SERCA3 gene gives rise to two additional 3′ end transcripts, SERCA3b and -3c (16Bobe R. Lacabaratz-Porret C. Bredoux R. Martin V. Ozog A. Launay S. Corvazier E.

Paszty K. Bredoux R. Enyedi A. Enouf J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, these splice products would present an uncommonly high degree of species specificity, as mice express slightly different SERCA3b and -3c mRNAs (20Ozog A. Pouzet B. Bobe R. Lompré A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from those of human origin, whereas rats are devoid of similar splice variants, but express a so-called SERCA3b/c mRNA (21Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Papp B. Enouf J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of these mouse and rat SERCA3 proteins, however, is still lacking. Here, we report (i) a growing family of SERCA3 isoforms, including the rat 3b/c and two novel human SERCA3d and SERCA3e proteins; (ii) their plural, diverse, and species-specific distribution patterns; (iii) factors involved in the regulation of their expressions; and (iv) their distinct functional properties determining both cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations. Taken together, these results should help the understanding of pathophysiological cell Ca2+ signaling in a broad variety of cells. Human blood was obtained from different healthy volunteers, and the investigation was performed according to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki. The isolation of human platelets was performed as previously described (22Lacabaratz-Porret C. Launay S. Corvazier E. Bredoux R. Papp B. Enouf J. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab For expression constructs, the cDNAs encoding the h2b in pcDNA3.1 (Pr. D. H. MacLennan), r3a in pBR322 (Dr. G. Shull), and the inactive h3a in pMT2 (Dr. J. Lytton) were used. The r3a cDNA wasNotI/NheI-excised and subcloned inEcoRI-digested and dephosphorylated pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) (Dr. A. M.

The r3b/c complete cDNA was created by switching aSalI/ApaI fragment of r3a by the specific 3′ end r3b/c product. The cDNA of the inactive h3a wasEcoRI-excised and subcloned in pUC18. The active h3a was obtained by substituting a PCR-amplified 1149-bpBclI/EcoRV fragment where Ile 817 was replaced by Met. This cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI site of pcDNA3. 3′ end variant-specific cDNAs were generated by overlap extension of two variant-specific PCR products covering the region encompassing exon 18–23 (nucleotides 2674–3290). Specific products were subcloned in pCR2.1, and thenEcoRV/XbaI-excised after oriented subcloning in pUC18 vector. The h3a–e cDNAs were created by switching theEcoRV/XbaI fragment of the active h3a construct, by the 3′ end variant-specific products. Each construct was verified by automated dye terminator sequencing (Applied Biosystems AB1 100 model 377, Genome Express, Grenoble, France) across the junctions and through the modified regions (data not shown). cDNA for transfection was purified using the EndoFree plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were plated at a density of ∼1 × 104 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes. The following day, cells at ∼60% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of the different r3s and h3s and h2b cDNAs using the transfection agent ExGen 500 (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In short, cell monolayers were exposed to DNA-polymer complexes in a small volume of serum-free RPMI 1640 in an incubator. After 1 h, serum-containing medium was carefully added to monolayers. To establish cell lines that stably express the different SERCA3 isoforms, the neomycin-resistant colonies were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) in RPMI 1640. Approximately 2 weeks later, colonies were picked and grown as individual cell lines in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. A mean of 10–12 neomycin-resistant clones were screened for each SERCA transfection efficiencies by Western blotting (data not shown). A mean of three of the highest responsive clones was selected for characterization and Ca2+ response studies. Measurements of Ca2+ pumping activity was essentially performed as described (27Grynkiewics G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cell sample of 0.4 ml was diluted into 1.6 ml of calcium-free, Hepes/KCl (pH 7.4) composed of 100 mm KCl, 100 mm sucrose, 20 mmHepes, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mmNaN3, 1 μm Fluo-3, 5 μg/ml oligomycin, and 37.5 μg/ml saponin. After 5 min at 37 °C, it was transferred to a constant temperature cuvette holder of a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu Europe, Duisburg, Germany). The free Ca2+ level was adjusted by stepwise additions from a concentrated CaCl2 solution, after which 2 mmATP was added. Fluorescence intensities (F) were continuously recorded at 488-nm excitation and 526-nm emission wavelengths (slits of 10 nm). Calibrations were performed by addition of CaCl2 or EGTA to obtain F max andF min values, respectively. Levels of [Ca2+] were calculated from the binding equation [Ca2+] = K d β (F −F min)/(F max −F). Confluent HEK-293 cells were loaded with 1.75 μm Fura-2-AM in culture medium for 45 min at 37 °C, and then incubated with fresh medium for another 15 min. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, detached, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in 5 ml of Hepes buffer (pH 7.45) containing 136 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/mld-glucose, and 1 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence measurements were performed with cuvets containing 2 ml of cell suspensions in Hepes buffer, using the same fluorimeter. For calculation of the [Ca2+]c, the ratio of fluorescence at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (emission at 510 nm) was calibrated according to Ref. 28Keularts I.M. van Gorp R.M.

The human and rat SERCA3 genes were recently found to give rise to distinct and species-specific 3′ end splice variants, in addition to the h- and rSERCA3a mRNAs (h3a and r3a) (Fig.1 A). The hSERCA3b (h3b) and hSERCA3c (h3c) mRNAs result from the partial or complete insertion of a penultimate exon 21. In rat platelets a rSERCA3b/3c (r3b/c) variant (GenBank™ accession no. AF458230) is present, in which the 5′-part of exon 21 lacks an ACLYP sequence (black box) and its 3′-part is extended (red box) and terminated using a novel stop codon Sb/c (21Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Papp B. Enouf J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A search for similar 3b/c splice variant in human platelets (Fig.1 B), performing RT-PCR, with sets of primers located in exons 18–22, was unsuccessful. However, additional longer PCR products were detected either on agarose gels (Fig. 1 B, I,7) or by Southern blotting (Fig. 1 B,II, 7) when we used primers P3 and P6 amplifying exons 21 and 22. These data pointed to the insertion of a novel exon"
https://openalex.org/W2034514059,"Msx2 and Dlx5 are homeodomain proteins that play an important role in osteoblast differentiation and whose expression is induced by bone morphogenetic proteins. Recently we have identified a novel protein, Dlxin-1, that associates with these homeodomain proteins and regulates Dlx5-dependent transcriptional function (Masuda, Y., Sasaki, A., Shibuya, H., Ueno, N., Ikeda, K., and Watanabe, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5331–5338). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular function of Dlxin-1, two closely related RING finger proteins, Praja1 and Neurodap-1, were isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1 as bait. GlutathioneS-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation/Western blotting assays following co-transfection of Dlxin-1 and Praja1 revealed that Praja1 binds to the C-terminal necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1 in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Overexpression of Praja1 caused a decrease in Dlxin-1 protein level, which was reversed when a proteasome inhibitor was added. Overexpression of Praja1 with a mutation in the RING finger inhibited the decrease in Dlxin-1 protein, pointing to the importance of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity associated with RING finger. Wild-type Praja1, but not its RING finger mutant, promoted ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 in vivo. Finally, expression of Praja1 down-regulated Dlx5-dependent transcriptional activity in a GAL4-dependent assay. These results suggest that Praja1 regulates the transcription function of the homeodomain protein Dlx5 by controlling the stability of Dlxin-1 via an ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.

Dlxin-1 binds to the homeoprotein Dlx5 and regulates its transcriptional activity when overexpressed in HT1080 human fibroblast cells (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J.

Dlxin-1 binds not only to Dlx5 but also to other Dlx/Msx family proteins, suggesting that Dlxin-1 is a common transcriptional regulator for Dlx/Msx family proteins (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H.

MAGE family protein, classically subdivided into three clusters, MAGE-A,-B, and -C, has first been identified as a gene coding for a tumor antigen on melanoma cells (2van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomez P. Lurquin C., De Plaen E. Van den Eynde B. Knuth A. Boon T. Science. 1991; 254: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). Although many tumors express MAGE mRNA, the expression is usually restricted to male germ lines. In tumor cells, MAGE gene products are processed and presented as antigenic peptides in the context of major histocompatiblity complex class I molecules (3Boon T. Cerottini J.C. Van den Eyende B. Van den Bruggen P. Van Pel A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of MAGE-A,-B, and-C proteins in germ line cells and the significance in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. MAGE-D1, a novel class D molecule of the family (4Chomez P., De Backer O. Bertrand M., De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar), is the human ortholog of Dlxin-1, which is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues and has a peculiar amino acid repeat sequence adjacent to the MAGE/Necdin family protein homology domain, suggesting its unique function distinct from other MAGE family members (5Pold M. Zhou J. Chen G.L. Hall J.M. Vescio R.A. Berenson J.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Lucas S. Brasseur F. Boon T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4100-4103PubMed Google Scholar). Among the MAGE family the most characterized protein is Necdin, which is highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Necdin binds to E2F1 and inhibits cellular proliferation when overexpressed in SAOS-2 cells that lack Rb protein, mimicking a Rb-like function (7Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Necdin also associates with p53 and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis and gene expression (8Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Necdin interacts with NEFA, a calcium-binding protein, and regulates its subcellular localization and cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis (9Taniguchi N. Taniura H. Niinobe M. Takayama C. Tominaga-Yoshino K. Ogura A. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31674-31681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The chromosome locus including Necdin gene is maternally imprinted, and deletion of the paternal allele or disomy of the maternal allele causes Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease with various neurological abnormalities (10Jay P.

(13Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have shown that NRAGE, a rat homologue of Dlxin-1, binds to p75 neurotropin receptor (p75NTR) and confers NGF1-dependent apoptosis of developing neuronal cells (13Salehi A.H.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3821-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that Dlxin-1 mRNA is expressed in Sertoli cells in the testis and down-regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (14Hennuy B. Reiter E. Cornet A. Bruyninx M. Daukandt M. Houssa P. N′Guyen V.H. Closset J. Hennen G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3821-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although Dlxin-1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, the restricted expression of their binding partners or regulator proteins, such as Dlx/Msx family proteins or p75NTR, to certain cell types and developmental stages points to the possibility that Dlxin-1 may function in cell survival and differentiation, depending on cell types. Ubiquitination plays crucial roles in gene transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle via regulation of protein stability (15Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of target proteins is achieved in three enzymatic steps. First, ubiquitin forms a thioester bond to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent manner and is transferred to the ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). In the presence of an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, E2 transfers ubiquitin to a specific substrate. Among the molecules involved in ubiquitin conjugation reactions, E3 ubiquitin ligases play a pivotal role in substrate recognition. There are a wide variety of E3 proteins to recognize diverse target protein substrates. E3 proteins or E3 protein complexes have either the HECT domain or the RING finger domain as an E2-recognizing module (16Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 21Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified two RING finger proteins, Praja1 (22Mishra L. Tully R.E. Monga S.P., Yu, P. Cai T. Makalowski W. Mezey E. Pavan W.J. Mishra B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Neurodap1 (23Nakayama M. Miyake T. Gahara Y. Ohara O. Kitamura T. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as Dlxin-1-interacting proteins. Praja1 acts as an ubiquitin protein ligase against Dlxin-1 and mediates its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby down-regulating Dlx5-dependent transcription. Thus, our results suggest that Dlxin-1 is an adapter molecule regulating Dlx5-dependent transcription via ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation by Praja1. The BamHI fragment of Dlxin-1, which contains the whole Necdin/MAGE homology domain (NHD), was subcloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and used as a bait plasmid (pGBT9-DXN/Bam). The full-length Dlxin-1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with HA or FLAG epitope tagging at the N terminus to generate pHA-DXN and pF-DXN, respectively. The BamHI fragment of Dlxin-1 that contains NHD was subcloned as above to generate pHA-DXN-NHD or pF-DXN-NHD. pHA-DXN-ΔNHD or pF-DXN-ΔNHD was generated by deletion of BamHI fragment from pHA-DXN or pF-DXN, respectively. pHA-DXN-W encodes Dlxin-1 containing 18 of 25 WQXPXX repeats, which was derived from a positive clone in the yeast two-hybrid screening using Dlx5 as a bait. pHA-DXN-N was generated by deletion of the C-terminal Dlxin-1 fragment after the first BstXI site. Wild-type and a RING finger mutant (Cys353 to Ala) Praja1 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 with HA or Myc epitope tagging at the N terminus. For the construction of RING finger-deleted Praja1 (Praja-ΔC), a C-terminal fragment after thePstI site was deleted from the wild-type Praja1 cDNA. The Praja1 cDNA fragment was also subcloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for expression of GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Human ubiquitin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 with HA or FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus to generate HA or FLAG-tagged ubiquitin constructs (pHA-Ub and pF-Ub). All cDNAs and the constructs amplified by PCR were fully sequenced (ABI PRISMTM 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, a yeast strain Y153 was co-transformed with pGBT9-DXN/Bam (described above) and the mouse embryo (day 11) cDNA library (CLONTECH). The transformants were screened in the selection media plates in the absence of Trp, Leu, and His, and in the presence of 60 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies grown on the selection media were then selected for lacZ gene transactivation by β-galactosidase activity in filter assay. Prey plasmids were recovered from β-galactosidase-positive colonies and were subjected to sequence analysis. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum. LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) reagent was used for transfection. For in vitrobinding, GST pull-down assay was preformed as described previously (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled Dlxin-1 and its deletion mutant proteins were generated by in vitrotranscription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots were incubated with GST or GST-Praja1 in binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. For in vivo association, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with various plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were lyzed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and protein G adsorption (AmershamBiosciences). Precipitated proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed using anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma), anti-HA 3F10 antibody (Roche Diagnostics), or anti-Myc PL14 antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) and visualized by ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). A proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, was purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids with or without MG-132 treatment (0.5 nm). 24 h after transfection, cells were lyzed in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Aliquots of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-DXN-NHD Ab was used to detect endogenous Dlxin-1. Anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used for control of the protein amount. HEK293 cells were transfected with ubiquitin constructs (pHA-Ub or pF-Ub) and Dlxin-1 constructs (pF-DXN-NHD or pHA-DXN) with or without wild-type Praja1 or its RING finger mutants. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lyzed by incubation with 200 μl of 2% SDS in TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 800 μl of 1% Triton-X-100 in TBS were added, and lysates were sonicated. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged NHD of Dlxin-1 (F-DXN-NHD) or HA-tagged Dlxin-1 (HA-DXN) using anti-FLAG antibody (M2) or anti-HA antibody, respectively, separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect ubiquitinated and nonubiquitinated Dlxin-1 proteins. Gal4-mediated reporter gene assays for evaluating Dlx5-dependent transcription was performed as described (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with pG5-luc, pBIND-Dlx5ΔC, and Dlxin-1-expressing plasmids (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In all-transfection experiments, Renilla luciferase expression vector pCMV-RL (Promega) was used as an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, cells were lyzed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities (Lumat LB 9507, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Each assay was carried out at least in triplicates. Dlxin-1 has a domain homologous to other MAGE/Necdin family proteins in its C-terminal portion. In fact, Necdin associates with its binding partners, such as E2F1 and p53, through the NHD in exhibiting its function. To investigate the function of Dlxin-1 achieved by this domain and to identify Dlxin-1-binding proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using a fragment including NHD as bait. Screening of 3 million transformants resulted in isolation of three independent clones encoding Praja1 and another clone encoding the mouse orthologue of rat Neurodap1. Praja1 and Neurodap1 share a highly homologous C-terminal region, including a RING finger domain (Fig.1). All four prey plasmids covered a homologous region just proximal to the RING finger domain, suggesting that the overlapping C-terminal region may possess a Dlxin-1-binding domain (Fig. 1). To determine whether Praja1 directly binds to Dlxin-1, GST pull-down assay was performed using GST-Praja1 fusion protein and 35S-labeled Dlxin-1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the NHD of Dlxin-1 (DXN-NHD) specifically bound to GST-Praja1, which is consistent with the result of yeast two-hybrid screening. The full-length Dlxin-1 protein also bound to Praja1, although weakly. Dlxin-1 forms a homodimer or multimer (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and DXN-NHD is co-immunoprecipitated with DXN-ΔNHD, a construct lacking NHD (Fig.2 B), 2A. Sasaki and K. Watanabe, unpublished observation. suggesting that full-length Dlxin-1 tends to bind to Dlxin-1 via inter-or intramolecular interaction rather than to Praja1. DXN-ΔNHD and DXN-W, both lacking the NHD but containing WQxPxx repeats, failed to bind to GST-Praja1. These results suggest that the Praja1-binding domain of Dlxin-1 resides in the NHD (Fig. 2 B). Necdin also bound to Praja1, but much less efficiently than did Dlxin-1 (Fig. 2 A,two panels on the right). The RING finger motif of Praja1 is suggested to be the recognition module for E2 and therefore necessary for E3 activity (24Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). RING finger proteins, such as Mdm2, lose E3 activity by substitution of the conserved cysteine residues within RING finger domain to other amino acids (16Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 21Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc.

Thus, two Praja1 mutants, one that lacks almost all of the RING finger motif (Praja-ΔC) and the other that carries substitution of the cysteine at the residue 353 to alanine (Praja-C353A), were constructed to test its E3 activity for Dlxin-1 (Fig. 3 A). Wild-type Praja1 bound to Dlxin-1 in vivo when overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). Association of Dlxin-1 to two mutants, PrajaΔC and Praja-C353A, was also detected, indicating that the RING finger motif is dispensable for binding to Dlxin-1 (Fig. 3 B, from lane 3 tolane 6). These Praja1 mutants migrate slower than expected from the molecular weight of wild-type Praja1. Taken together with the observation by Fang et al. (16Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) that RING finger mutants of Mdm2 migrate slower than wild-type protein on SDS-PAGE (16Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the RING finger motif adopts a tight conformation even in the presence of detergent and that destruction of this motif may reduce mobility of proteins on SDS-PAGE. Next, immunoprecipitation of Msx2 was performed to determine whether Praja1 forms molecular complexes with Msx2 and Dlxin-1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Praja1 was co-precipitated with Msx2 either with (lane 5) or without (lane 4) Dlxin-1 transfection. These results suggest that Msx2, Praja1, and Dlxin-1 form molecular complexes in the cells and that endogenous Dlxin-1 may participate in the formation of this complex, because direct interaction between Msx2 and Praja1 was not observed (Fig.2 A). Although Praja1 has been shown to possess E3 activity for self-ubiquitination (21Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), its substrate for ubiquitination remains to be determined. The finding that Dlxin-1 associates with a RING finger protein Praja1 prompted us to hypothesize that Dlxin-1 may be a candidate for the substrate of Praja1. The protein level of ectopically expressed HA-Dlxin-1 (HA-DXN) was markedly decreased when wild-type Praja1, but not RING finger mutants (HA-PrajaΔC or HA-Praja-C353A), was co-expressed (Fig.4 A, left panel). This reduction of the Dlxin-1 protein in the presence of wild-type Praja1 was reversed by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG-132, suggesting that it is because of degradation of Dlxin-1 through proteasomes. Endogenous Dlxin-1 protein was also degraded upon introducing wild-type Praja1, but not its RING finger mutants, when assessed by immunoblotting using anti-Dlxin-1 polyclonal antibody (Fig.4 A, right panel). Similarly, the protein level of Msx2, which forms complexes with Dlxin-1 and Praja1, was reduced by overexpression of wild-type Praja1, but not the RING finger mutants, in a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (Fig. 4 B). Next, the E3 activity of Praja1 for Dlxin-1 was examined in vivo. HEK293 cells introduced with HA-tagged Dlxin-1 (HA-DXN) and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (F-Ub) were lyzed in SDS-containing buffer, and the cell lysates were boiled to dissociate noncovalent protein-protein interactions. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. In the absence of exogenous Praja1, slowly migrating smears corresponding to polyubiquitinated Dlxin-1 were detected, and the level of these conjugates was increased with MG-132 treatment (Fig.5 A, lanes 5 and6). The intensity of these slowly migrating smears increased with co-transfection of wild-type Praja1 in the presence of MG-132 (compare lanes 6 and 8). In contrast, ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 decreased with co-transfection of Praja1 RING finger mutants, suggesting that they act in a dominant-negative fashion (lanes 9–12). These results indicate that Dlxin-1 is ubiquitinated in mammalian cells and that Praja1 is involved in this ubiquitination process via its RING finger. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, a Praja1-binding domain resides in NHD of Dlxin-1. To determine whether ubiquitination occurs within this domain, the same experiment was performed using FLAG-tagged NHD of Dlxin-1 (F-DXN-NHD) and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub). In addition to smears of polyubiquitinated DXN-NHD, bands corresponding to DXN-NHD conjugated with one, two, or three ubiquitin molecules were observed (Fig. 5 B, upper panel), indicating that ubiquitination takes place within the NHD of Dlxin-1. In the presence of MG-132, ubiquitination of DXN-NHD increased with co-transfection of wild-type Praja1 (compare lanes 6 and 8, Fig.5 B), but not of its RING finger mutants (lanes 9–12). We have previously reported that the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 (Dlx5ΔC), which lacks homeodomain, possesses transcriptional activity (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When Dlx5ΔC cDNA was fused to GAL4-DNA-binding domain (pBIND-Dlx5ΔC) and co-transfected into 293 cells with pG5-luc reporter plasmid, which contains GAL4-binding sites and luciferase reporter gene, reporter activity was increased dependently on the amount of GAL4-Dlx5ΔC (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This assay was utilized to determine whether Praja1 is involved in Dlxin-1-mediated stimulation of Dlx5-dependent transcription. When DXN-W, the Dlx5-binding domain of Dlxin-1, was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, the transcriptional activity of GAL4-Dlx5ΔC decreased in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The construct DXN-W is expected to block the association of Dlx5ΔC with Dlxin-1, thereby acting in a dominant-negative fashion (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results indicate that endogenous Dlxin-1 regulates the transcriptional activity of GAL4-Dlx5ΔC in HEK293 cells. To examine whether Praja1 may modulate the transcriptional activity of Dlx5, wild-type Praja1 or its mutants were co-transfected with pBIND-Dlx5ΔC and pG5-luc. As shown in Fig.6, co-expression of Praja1 reduced the transcriptional activity mediated by GAL4-Dlx5ΔC dose-dependently, whereas the RING finger mutants of Praja1 failed to inhibit the transcriptional activity. It is to be noted that MG-132 treatment only partially rescued the inhibition of the transcription (Fig. 6). These results suggest that ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 per se, even without its proteasome-dependent degradation, can reduce Dlx5-dependent transcriptional activity, possibly by spatial redistribution and/or conformational changes of Dlxin-1 molecule. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is an important system for modifying protein function and regulating a wide variety of biological processes as diverse as cell cycling, signal transduction, and gene transcription. In this paper we presented evidence suggesting that the RING finger protein Praja1 binds to Dlxin-1 and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Dlxin-1 (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Dlxin-1 is recognized and ubiquitinated by Praja1, with subsequent degradation by proteasome (Fig. 4 A). Msx2, which forms complexes with Praja1 and Dlxin-1, is also degraded in the presence of Praja1 (Fig.4 B). Although it remains to be determined whether ubiquitination of Dlx/Msx family proteins takes place, Dlxin-1 may serve as an adapter molecule for Dlx/Msx family proteins to be recognized by proteasome. Recently, anti-differentiation activity of Msx has been demonstrated (27Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar, 28Odelberg S.J.

Thayer M.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Constitutive or ectopic expression of Msx proteins inhibit terminal differentiation not only of myogenesis but also of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis (27Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar, 29Woloshin P. Song K. Degnin C. Killary A.M. Goldhamer D.J. Sasson D. Thayer M.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Msx1 leads to dedifferentiation of myotubes to proliferating myoblasts, which keep the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes (28Odelberg S.J. Kollhoff A. Keating M.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Hu et al. (27Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the anti-differentiation activity of Msx proteins is coupled to up-regulation of cyclin D1 by Msx (27Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that tight regulation of Msx protein is required for cell differentiation process. The regulation of the stability of Msx proteins, as demonstrated in this study, may play a role in the precise execution of differentiation program. In this study we demonstrated that Praja1 inhibits Dlx5-dependent transcription in a RING finger-dependent manner (Fig. 6), suggesting that ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 is important for repressing Dlx5-mediated transcription. In view of the results that Msx2 was degraded when Praja1 was overexpressed, the mechanism of transcriptional repression may involve degradation of Dlx5. However, there remains the possibility that Praja1 or ubiquitinated Dlxin-1 may recruit a transcriptional repressor protein(s) to the complex, because transcriptional repression by Praja1 was only partially rescued by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, and because certain RING finger proteins have been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor (30Bach I. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Carriere C. Bhushan A. Krones A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Andersen B. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Schoorlemmer J. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Were F. Martinez R. Garcia E. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Vidal M.

Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nonubiquitinated Dlxin-1 may recruit a transcriptional co-activator(s), and when ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 takes place, the transcriptional co-activator may dissociate from Dlxin-1. The concept that Dlxin-1 acts as an adapter molecule for transcriptional repression apparently contradicts with the conclusion of our previous publication that Dlxin-1 functions as transcriptional activator on Dlx5-dependent transcription (1Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitination of Dlxin-1 may be strictly regulated in a physiological state. Whereas ubiquitination and degradation of Dlxin-1 take place constantly in artificial experimental systems employing overexpression of proteins, some triggering events may be required for ubiquitination in a physiological context. One of the candidates is phosphorylation of Dlxin-1, because Dlxin-1 contains potential target sequences of protein kinases (data not shown). In light of the findings that the stability of p53 increases with its acetylation because of protection from ubiquitination (33Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), acetylation may also stabilize Dlxin-1 protein through protection against degradation by Praja1. It remains to be determined whether post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, of Dlxin-1 play a role in the regulation of its stability. Recently, it has been shown that sumoylation (conjugation of SUMO-1) of the RING finger protein Mdm2, an E3 enzyme for p53, stabilizes Mdm2, thereby protecting self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and accelerating ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (34Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is possible that the E3 activity of Praja1 is also regulated by sumoylation, because a lysine residue required for both sumoylation and ubiquitination is conserved among these RING finger proteins. The association of Praja1 with the Necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1 suggests that Praja1 may also bind to other MAGE/Necdin family proteins and function as a common E3 enzyme. In fact, we obtained evidence that Praja1 bound to Necdin in vitro (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, some potential ubiquitination sites are present in the NHD of Dlxin-1 (Fig. 5 B). It is widely accepted that most antigenic peptides are generated by proteasomes in the pathway of the presentation on major histocompatiblity complex class I molecules (35Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The MAGE gene products are processed into 8–10-residue peptides and presented as antigens (3Boon T. Cerottini J.C. Van den Eyende B. Van den Bruggen P. Van Pel A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). If Praja1 acts as a common E3 for MAGE/Necdin family proteins, Praja1 may be a potentially useful tool for gene therapy for MAGE-expressing tumors. For example, when Praja1 is overexpressed in MAGE-expressing tumor cells, the increased rate of degradation of MAGE gene products is expected to accelerate the processing of antigen peptides derived from MAGE gene products, thereby augmenting tumor rejection by host immune system. Recently, Dlxin-1 has been shown to associate with p75 neurotropin receptor (p75NTR) and confer NGF-dependent apoptosis of developing neuronal cells (13Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In view of the reported findings that Dlxin-1 accumulates to plasma membrane concomitantly with NGF treatment of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells (13Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that Praja1 may also be recruited to p75NTR via association with Dlxin-1. Because cell surface expression and activity of certain growth factor receptors are regulated by ubiquitination (17Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar,26Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), Praja1 has the potential to modulate NGF signaling by ubiquitinating p75NTR-associated Dlxin-1.

These findings suggest the possibility that PKB/Akt might phosphorylate 14-3-3 proteins and regulate a function common to both proteins. The present study was initiated to determine whether PKB/Akt interacts with and phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ and whether phosphorylation by PKB/Akt regulates 14-3-3ζ dimerization. pUSE-myc-constitutive active Akt and pUSE-Akt were from Upsate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. PGEX-2T-14-3-3ζ and pcDNA3.1-HA-14-3-3ζ were obtained from Dr. Thierry Dubois, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. 14-3-3ζ was subcloned from PGEX-2T-14-3-3ζ into pRSET using BamHI and EcoRI, and pRSET-14-3-3ζ was used for bacterial expression and purification of recombinant 14-3-3ζ. Ser-58 on pRSET 14-3-3ζ was mutated to alanine with CLONTECH tranformer site-directed mutagenesis kit, using 5′-CCGTAGGTCAGGGTGGAGGGTGG-3′ as the mutation primer and 5′-CAGCAGGTGGCTCGGAATACAGAGA-3′ as the selection primer. The appropriate mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. His-tagged recombinant 14-3-3ζ (S58A) was bacterially expressed and isolated by nickel chromatography. Recombinant active Akt (400 ng) (Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (167 TBq/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) and 1 μg of recombinant 14-3-3ζ in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmNaVO3). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and terminated by addition of Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Ten μl of glutathione-agarose beads coupled to GST or GST-Akt (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with 250 ng of recombinant 14-3-3ζ in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm NaVO3) or with HEK293 cell lysate (800 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. HEK293 lysates were prepared by suspending 2 × 107 cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton x-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Following incubation, beads were washed twice with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-14-3-3ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HEK 293 cells (60% confluent) were incubated with 6:1 lipofectamine:plasmid in OPTI medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 6 h. Medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-14-3-3ζ, pUSE-myc-constitutive active-Akt, or co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-14-3-3ζ and pUSE-myc-constitutive active-Akt. Following overnight cultivation, the medium was replaced with 3 ml of phosphate-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was then replaced with 1 ml of minimal essential medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then lysed with 520 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Twenty-μl aliquots were taken to confirm transfection by immunoblott analysis for Myc and HA. Lysates (500 μl) were incubated with 4 μg of monoclonal anti-HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by 2-h incubation with 30 μl (1:1 slurry in phosphate-buffered saline) of protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography. Identification of phosphorylated proteins was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting, as described previously (18Rane M.J.

Recombinant 14-3-3ζ (2 μg) was incubated alone, with recombinant active Akt (400 ng) (Upstate Biotechnology) and no ATP or with recombinant active Akt and 1 mm ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmNaVO3) for 2 h at room temperature. Following incubations, proteins were separated by 10% non-denaturing PAGE followed by protein staining with Coomassie Blue or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using pI 4–7 immobilized pH gradient strips for isoelectric focusing and 10% Duracryl gels (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) in the second dimension. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted for 14-3-3ζ. The ability of PKB/Akt to directly interact with 14-3-3ζ was examined using GST pull-down assays. GST-Akt-coupled glutathione-agarose was incubated with recombinant 14-3-3ζ or HEK293 lysate, followed by immunoblot analysis for 14-3-3ζ. Fig.1A shows that recombinant 14-3-3ζ was precipitated by GST-Akt-agarose, but not by GST-agarose. Similarly, GST-Akt-agarose, but not GST-agarose, precipitated endogenous 14-3-3ζ from HEK293 cell lysate (Fig. 1B). To determine whether PKB/Akt phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ, recombinant active PKB/Akt was incubated with recombinant 14-3-3ζ in an in vitro kinase assay. Fig. 2 shows that PKB/Akt phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ, as well as undergoing autophosphorylation. No phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ was seen in the absence of recombinant active PKB/Akt. These data demonstrate that PKB/Akt and 14-3-3ζ directly interact in vitro, and this interaction is associated with PKB/Akt phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ.FIG. 2In vitro PKB/Akt phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ. Recombinant active PKB/Akt, recombinant 14-3-3ζ, or recombinant active PKB/Akt and 14-3-3ζ were incubated in the presence of [32P]ATP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography performed. The autoradiograph shows that Akt undergoes autophosphorylation, and Akt phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of PKB/Akt to phosphorylate 14-3-3ζ in intact cells was examined using HEK293 cells. Cells were transfected with constitutively active PKB/Akt and/or HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ. After 24 h cells were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate, lysed, and 14-3-3ζ immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 3A shows phosphorylation of a 30-kDa protein that was confirmed to be 14-3-3ζ by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. These findings indicate that PKB/Akt is capable of interacting with and phosphorylating 14-3-3ζ in intact cells. Our data show that PKB/Akt interacts with and phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins in vitro and in intact cells, as described previously for protein kinase C (13Hauaaer A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.

Other kinases reported to phosphorylate 14-3-3 isoforms include casein kinase I and SDK-1 (15Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L., Fu, H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Dubois T. Rommel C. Howell S. Steinhussen U. Soneji Y. J. Biol.

Three phosphorylation sites have been identified on 14-3-3 proteins, Ser-58, Ser-184, and Thr-232 (5Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Phermacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). As Ser-58 was recognized as a low stringency PKB/Akt phosphorylation (2.703%) site by Scansite (17Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 4: 348-353Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar), we created a mutant 14-3-3ζ in which alanine was substituted for Ser-58 (14-3-3ζ S58A). The ability of recombinant active PKB/Akt to phosphorylate this mutant protein was tested in an in vitrokinase assay. Fig. 4 shows that PKB/Akt phosphorylated wild type recombinant 14-3-3ζ, while phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ (S58A) was markedly inhibited. These data indicate that, like SDK-1, PKB/Akt phosphorylates Ser-58 on 14-3-3ζ. Based on the three-dimensional structure of 14-3-3, phosphorylation of Ser-58 was proposed to regulate dimer formation (5Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Phermacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 15Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L., Fu, H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The effect of 14-3-3ζ phosphorylation by PKB/Akt on dimerization was examined in an in vitro assay. Recombinant 14-3-3ζ was incubated in the presence or absence of active recombinant PKB/Akt. Proteins were then separated on non-denaturing SDS-PAGE and 14-3-3ζ monomers and dimers identified by protein staining. Fig. 5Ashows that the proportion of 14-3-3ζ in the dimeric form was not altered by phosphorylation by PKB/Akt. In parallel, 14-3-3ζ incubated in the presence or absence of active PKB/Akt was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblot analysis for 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 5B). The immunoblot demonstrated a pI shift consistent with phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ on only one amino acid. The percentage of 14-3-3ζ phosphorylated by PKB/Akt was estimated to be 45%, based on densitometry of protein at the two pI values. Although our data do not reveal the functional significance of PKB/Akt phosphorylation of Ser-58 on 14-3-3ζ, recent studies indicate that Arg-56 forms a salt bridge with phosphoserine on 14-3-3 ligands and that Ser-60 plays a minor role in phosphoserine binding (7Yaffe M.B.

Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation at Ser-58 may regulate 14-3-3 binding to phosphoserine-containing ligands, rather than to regulate dimerization. In summary, our results indicate that PKB/Akt should be included with protein kinase C as another AGC kinase that phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins. We determined that PKB/Akt directly interacts with 14-3-3ζ and phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ on Ser-58 both in vitro and in transfected HEK293 cells. Although 14-3-3ζ phosphorylation on Ser-58 has been proposed to regulate 14-3-3 dimerization, we could not detect an effect on this function. The crucial role of 14-3-3 binding to PKB/Akt substrates, however, suggests that PKB/Akt phosphorylation of 14-3-3 provides another level of regulation of PKB/Akt signaling."

A panel of optimal peptide substrates for MT1-MMP was identified using substrate phage display. The substrates can be segregated into four groups based on their degree of selectivity for MT1-MMP. Substrates with poor selectivity for MT1-MMP are comprised predominately of the Pro-X-X-↓-X Hy motif that is recognized by a number of MMPs. Highly selective substrates lack the characteristic Pro at the P3 position; instead they contain an Arg at the P4 position. This P4Arg is essential for efficient hydrolysis and for selectivity for MT1-MMP. Molecular modeling indicates that the selective substrates adopt a linear conformation that extends along the entire catalytic pocket of MT1-MMP, whereas non-selective substrates are kinked at the conserved P3 Pro residue. Importantly, the selective substrates can be made non-selective by insertion of a proline kink at P3, without significantly reducing overallk cat/K m values. Altogether the study provides a structural basis for selective and non-selective substrate recognition by MT1-MMP.

Consequently, the MMPs have been explored aggressively as drug targets. The MMP family can be segregated into two groups, the soluble type and the membrane type. The membrane-type MMPs are tethered to the plasma membrane by either a transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E.

Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP; also known as MMP-14) is the prototypic member of the MT-MMPs, and its expression has been associated with a variety of cellular and developmental processes, as well as multiple pathophysiologic conditions. Similar to most other MMPs, MT1-MMP cleaves a number of matrix proteins including collagen, fibronectin, and vitronectin (8Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

The importance of the broad substrate recognition specificity of MT1-MMP is consistent with the complex phenotype of the MT1-MMP-deficient mice. These mice exhibit overt dwarfism, but close inspection also showed several additional defects including arthritis, delayed ossification of bone, and the inability to respond to angiogenic stimuli (19Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Knowing the identity of these substrates, and the structural basis for their recognition, would provide an additional level of understanding of MT1-MMP. To this end, we used an unbiased substrate phage selection to identify optimal peptide substrates for MT1-MMP. Four groups of substrates with varying degrees of selectivity were identified. As anticipated, non-selective substrates comprised primarily of the Pro-X-X-↓-X Hysequence were identified. These substrates are collagen-like and have emerged as a canonical, and generally non-selective, MMP recognition motif (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

Most significantly, a group of highly selective substrates for MT1-MMP was identified. Each of the highly specific substrates is devoid of a Pro residue at the P3 position and contains a critical Arg at the P4 position. Modeling of the selective and non-selective substrates bound to the catalytic pocket of MT1-MMP indicates two separate binding modes. These modes are distinguished by the degree of distortion at the P3 position of substrate. These observations provide a solid structural basis for the recognition of distinct classes of substrates by MT1-MMP and for the design of highly specific inhibitors of this enzyme. Substrate phage libraries were generated using a modified version of the fUSE5 phagemid (24Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 25Smith G.P.

A FLAG epitope was engineered at the N terminus of the geneIII protein by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGGTTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CGACTACAAAGACGACGACGACAAAC-3′ and ligating them into fUSE5 at theKpnI and XbaI restriction sites. The random hexamers were generated by PCR extension of the template oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGAGGCCGACGTGGCCGTCATCAGGCGGCTCAGGC(NNK)6ACGGCCTCTGGGGCCGAAAC-3′, where N is any nucleotide and K is either G or T. The template oligonucleotide also encodes an SGGSG linker positioned in between the FLAG epitope and the random hexamer. A primer oligonucleotide 5′-AATTTCTAGTTTCGGCCCCAGAGGC-3′ and the template oligonucleotide were mixed and heated at 65 °C for 2 min. The heating block was switched off and allowed to cool passively to 40 °C to allow annealing of the extension oligonucleotide to the template oligonucleotide. Elongation of the template oligonucleotide was performed using Sequenase (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) (27Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C.

The final cDNA product was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in water, and digested with SfiI. The DNA insert and fUSE5 were mixed and ligated at a 5:1 molar ratio and electroporated into Escherichia coli MC1061(F−). Several phages were selected for sequencing to confirm randomness in the insert sequences and the correct reading frame. Recombinant versions of the catalytic domains of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were expressed, purified, and activated as described previously (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W.

The catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was amplified from a human Universal QUICK-Clone cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using the primers 5′-catatgTACGCCATCCAGGGTCTCAAATGG-3′ and 5′-gaattcttaCCCTGACTCACCCCCATAAAGTTGC-3′. The NdeI andEcoRI restriction sites and TAA stop codon are shown in lowercase. The amplified PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pFLAG-ATS (Sigma). The resulting plasmid (pGM-MT1) was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli and grown in 2YT supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 3 h of induction, the bacteria were collected and lysed, and inclusion bodies containing the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP were isolated by centrifugation. Recombinant MT1-MMP was purified from inclusion bodies by anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (AmershamBiosciences) in the presence of 8 m urea. The purified material was refolded by dilution to 100 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2, followed by an incubation at 12 °C for 1 h. The refolded MT1-MMP was used immediately in activity assays. The concentration of active enzyme was determined by active site titration. Active site titration of MT1-MMP was performed with the hydroxomate inhibitor AG3340 (K i = 3 × 10−10m) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2. The titrations of active MT1-MMP were equivalent; thus AG3340 was used to titrate the enzyme for this study. After pre-incubation, the steady-state rate of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Mca-PLGL-Dnp-AR-NH2 (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) was determined at ambient temperature using an fMax fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The steady-state rate was plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration and fitted with the equation V = SA(E0 − 0.5{(E0 + I + K i ) − [(E0 + I +K i )2 − 4E0I]0.5}), where V is the steady-state rate of substrate hydrolysis, SA is specific activity (rate per unit enzyme concentration),E0 is enzyme concentration. I is inhibitor concentration, and KI is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (29Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 248Google Scholar). An aliquot (2 × 1010 phage) of the substrate phage library was incubated with 5 μg/ml of MT1-MMP in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, and 0.05% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. A control selection was performed without protease. The cleaved phages were separated from the non-cleaved phages by immunodepletion. The M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (100 μg) was added to the phage samples and then incubated for 18 h with rocking at 4 °C. The phage-antibody complexes were precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The cleaved phages remaining in the supernatant were amplified using K91 E. coli as described previously (30Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hydrolysis of individual phage substrates was measured using a modified ELISA. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with anti-M13 antibody (AmershamBiosciences) at 2.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 10 mg/ml BSA. After blocking, 150 μl of supernatant from an overnight phage culture was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to allow for phage capture. Unbound phage were removed with three washes of ice-cold TBST. To assess hydrolysis, MT1-MMP (3.0 μg/ml) was added to the appropriate wells in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% BSA, 0.05% Brij-35) for 2 h at 37 °C. Control wells lacked protease. The protease solution was removed, and the wells were washed four times with ice-cold TBST. To determine the extent of hydrolysis of the peptides on phage by proteinase, anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (1.8 μg/ml in TBST with 1 mg/ml BSA) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Binding of anti-FLAG antibody to FLAG epitope was measured with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by detection at 490 nm. The extent of hydrolysis, taken as a measure of substrate hydrolysis, was calculated by the ratio of the optical density at 490 nm of the protease-treated samples versus controls. The cleavage site for MT1-MMP within peptide substrates was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MT1-MMP (23 nm) was incubated with 100 μm of each peptide sample in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. Following hydrolysis, the peptide samples were prepared according to methods described previously (32Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The mass of the cleavage products was determined using a Voyager DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). In all cases, the observed fragments corresponded to a single cleavage site. The kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis were measured using a fluorescamine incorporation assay that has been described previously (34Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were incubated with individual peptide substrates at concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 μmin 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2. At selected time points the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline. Peptide hydrolysis was determined by the addition of fluorescamine, followed by detection at λex 355 nm and λem 460 nm. The data were transformed to double reciprocal plots (1/[S] versus1/vi) to determine K m andk cat (34Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using different batches of protease. For some substrates,K m and k cat could not be determined individually, but the specificity constant,k cat/K m , was derived by the equation k cat/K m = vi/(E0)(S0) (35Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X. Moore W.G. Navre M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The complexes of MT1-MMP and cognate substrates were modeled using the Sybyl software package available from Tripos (www.tripos.com) using the MT1-MMP spatial structure taken from PDB file 1bqq (36Fernandez-Catalan C.

The catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was used in three successive rounds of selection to isolate optimum substrates from a phage library of 2.4 × 108 independent clones. Two-hundred clones were screened for their ability to be hydrolyzed by MT1-MMP using the substrate phage ELISA we reported previously (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Kridel S.J. Chen E. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Forty of the two-hundred clones were cleaved efficiently by MT1-MMP and were carried forward for additional analysis. In a second round of analysis, substrate phage ELISAs were used to compare relative rates of hydrolysis of phage peptide substrate by MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9 catalytic domains. Based on the activity profiles resulting from this analysis, the 40 phage substrates could be segregated into four distinct groups as follows: (i) those recognized by all three MMPS, (ii) those recognized equally by MT1-MMP and MMP-2, (iii) those recognized equally by MT1-MMP and MMP-9, and (iv) those selective for MT1-MMP (TableI).Table IPeptide sequence and grouping of phage selected by MT1-MMPIndividual phage were analyzed after three rounds of selection by MT1-MMP.

Open table in a new tab Individual phage were analyzed after three rounds of selection by MT1-MMP. The substrates are grouped according to their ability to be hydrolyzed by the three proteinases, relative to non-treated controls, as measured by substrate phage ELISA and expressed as % hydrolysis. The amino acid sequence of each phage peptide was determined by sequencing the corresponding DNA inserts of the selected phage, and the peptides are presented in Table I. These sequences reveal the structural features common to each group of substrates. The non-selective substrates of group I all contain Pro residues. Interestingly, all of the Pro residues were expressed at the same site in the random peptides. Upon first inspection, these substrates appear similar to the Pro-X-X-↓-Hy motif that is commonly cleaved by many MMPs (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Deng S.J. Bickett D.M. Mitchell J.L. Lambert M.H. Blackburn R.K. Carter H.L. Neugebauer J. Pahel G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This motif represents a canonical collagen-like MMP recognition motif (9-Google Scholar). The substrates in group II, which are susceptible to cleavage by MT1-MMP and MMP-2, were comprised primarily of substrates that appeared to be similar in primary sequence to an MMP-2 recognition motif we identified recently (39Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W., Li, W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The substrates in group III, which are susceptible to cleavage by MT1-MMP and MMP-9, were relatively small in number however. Consequently, no consensus could be defined. The substrates that were highly selective for MT1-MMP are in group IV and appeared to give little initial indication of consensus. It is noteworthy that Pro is absent from these peptides, however. Given the contrast in substrate selectivity between groups I and IV, we focused on trying to determine the structural basis for their distinct reactivity with MT1-MMP. Although the position of the scissile bond in the phage substrates could generally be surmised by the position of hydrophobic residues (Leu/Ile) that normally occupy the deep S1′ pocket, we confirmed the placements by analyzing the hydrolysis of synthetic peptides. Peptides were synthesized to mimic the peptides displayed by the individual phage clones. Following exposure to the MT1-MMP catalytic domain, the masses of the cleavage products were determined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). The MALDI analysis confirmed that hydrophobic amino acids occupied the P1′ position of the MT1-MMP substrates (TableII). In addition, a polar amino acid appears to be preferred at the P2′ position. Furthermore, an alignment of the group IV peptides based on their scissile bonds demonstrates a preference for Arg at the P4 position. Two substrates, A20 and A167, from group IV that lacked Arg at P4 were also examined. The masses of cleavage products of these two peptides indicate that the P4 position is Phe or Lys, respectively, which both contain long side chains like Arg that can participate in hydrophobic interactions (see below).Table IIKinetic analysis of MT1-MMP peptide substratesEach peptide was incubated with proteinase, and hydrolysis was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peptide names correspond to their phage clone designation.

Amino acid changes of the variant peptides are indicated in bold. Scissile bonds are indicated by ↓. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and S.D. were 15% or below. NA, not able to detect. Results from the substrate phage ELISA (Table I) indicate a rank order of substrate preference within each group of MT1-MMP substrates. To quantify precisely the rate of hydrolysis of the peptide substrates in group IV by MT1-MMP, the specificity constant (k cat/K m ) of selected peptides was determined (Table II). In these studies only MMP-9 was used for comparisons with MT1-MMP, because MMP-9 and MMP-2 share similar substrate specificity and cleavage efficiency. Each proteinase was incubated with increasing concentrations of peptide. Peptide hydrolysis was measured by incorporation of fluorescamine onto newly formed N termini. From these measurements, k catand K m values were derived for each peptide using double reciprocal plots of 1/[S] versus 1/vi. Among the peptides, overallk cat/K m values ranged from 8,200 M−1s−1 to 777,200 M−1s−1, and the selectivity of these peptides ranged from 2.2- to 83-fold when compared with hydrolysis by MMP-9. Because nearly one-half of the MT1-MMP-selective substrates lack Arg at P4, there may be other modes of selective recognition. Nevertheless, we suspect that some of these other peptides are related to the Arg-containing peptides. For example, peptides A167 and A20, which lack Arg at P4, showed the lowestk cat/K m values and the lowest selectivity ratios. Yet, Phe and Lys, which occupy P4 in these peptides, can participate in similar hydrophobic interactions. Because of the preponderance of Arg at the P4 position among the group IV substrates, we sought to determine the requirement for this residue in hydrolysis by MT1-MMP. Three peptides that contain this P4 Arg, A42, B175, and A176, were selected for mutational analysis. The P4position in each synthetic peptide was changed from Arg to Ala, andk cat/K m values were measured (Table II). This substitution decreasedk cat/K m of peptide A176 from 49,100 M−1s−1 to 5,900 M−1s−1. Similarly the same substitution in B175 reduced k cat/K m from 63,600 M−1s−1 to 10,400 M−1s−1. The Arg to Ala substitution had a less significant effect in the A42 peptide (3-fold reduction). We suspect that the very highk cat/K m of this peptide (777,200 M−1s−1) indicates the presence of several additional contacts that favor substrate recognition by MT1-MMP. Consequently, substitution of the Arg at P4 has less of an effect on A42. Altogether, the mutational analyses support our hypothesis that Arg at P4 is a key contact residue in the group IV substrates. An obvious distinction between the selective and non-selective substrates is the presence of Pro at the P3 position. We sought to determine whether the presence of a Pro at this position of the group IV substrates would be sufficient to override their selective docking. For this purpose, we chose the peptide with the highest selectivity for MT1-MMP (A176). When the P3 Ser of A176 was replaced with Pro, the k cat/K m by MT1-MMP was reduced by only 32%. Conversely, the hydrolysis of this peptide by MMP-9, a measure of selectivity, was increased 58-fold. Hence, substitution of Pro at the P3 position converted a substrate selective for MT1-MMP to a substrate that is recognized equally well by both MMPs. A similar substitution was made into the A176A peptide, in which the Arg at P4 of A176 was changed to Ala. This substitution caused a 9-fold reduction ink cat/K m ratio for MT1-MMP compared with the parent peptide. Yet, when Pro was substituted into the P3 position of this peptide thek cat/K m ratio for MT1-MMP increased by ∼6-fold. Consequently, the deleterious effect of the Arg to Ala substitution at P4 was rescued by substitution of Pro at P3. Equally as significant, this substitution reversed the selectivity ratio to favor MMP-9. These findings support the idea that MT1-MMP recognizes substrates in two distinct modes. One mode, demonstrated by the group I peptides, makes use of the P3 and P1′ positions as dominant contact points. The other mode, demonstrated by the selective group IV peptides, appears to use primarily the P4 and P1′ subsites as key contacts. To visualize the differences in these two binding modes, molecular modeling studies were conducted. A three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was generated from the coordinates of its known crystal structure (36Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain was then docked with peptides A176 (Ac-SGRSEN↓IRTA-NH2) and A176P (Ac-SGRPEN↓IRTA-NH2) using Sybyl. Because interactions between MMP and substrate at the S1′ subsite are known to make a major contribution to substrate binding, interactions around this site were kept constant to constrain the modeling procedure. Two restrictions were applied. First, the hydrogen"

DDP1 belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved proteins that are organized in hetero-oligomeric complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. They mediate the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. All of them share a conserved Cys4 metal binding site proposed to be required for the formation of zinc fingers. So far, the only missense mutation known to cause a full-blown clinical phenotype is a C66W exchange directly affecting this Cys4motif. Here, we show that the mutant human protein is efficiently imported into mitochondria and sorted into the intermembrane space. In contrast to wild-type DDP1, it does not complement the function of its yeast homologue Tim8. The C66W mutation impairs binding of Zn2+ ions via the Cys4 motif. As a consequence, the mutated DDP1 is incorrectly folded and loses its ability to assemble into a hetero-hexameric 70-kDa complex with its cognate partner protein human Tim13. Thus, an assembly defect of DDP1 is the molecular basis of Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome in patients carrying the C66W mutation.

The import of such preproteins into mitochondria and the correct sorting into mitochondrial subcompartments is mediated by a set of import systems in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane. Three distinct preprotein import systems have been described (1Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Bauer M.F. Hofmann I.

It mediates the recognition and binding of preproteins as well as their transfer across the outer membrane. Further movement of the translocation intermediates into and across the inner membrane is mediated by two distinct translocases in the inner membrane, the TIM23 and the TIM22 complexes. The TIM23 complex mediates import of preproteins with positively charged targeting signals at their N termini into the mitochondrial matrix space and into the inner membrane (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F.

The transfer of preproteins across the inner membrane strictly requires both an electrochemical potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane and the presence of ATP in the matrix as energy sources (9Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-36745Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The TIM22 complex is used by a class of hydrophobic inner membrane proteins with internal and so far less characterized targeting signals (10Kerscher O. Holder J. Srinivasan M. Leung R.S. Jensen R.E.

Typical substrates are the members of the mitochondrial carrier family that are synthesized without a matrix-targeting signal. In addition, the TIM22 complex appears to mediate the import of precursors of other hydrophobic membrane proteins such as Tim23 and Tim22, which do not belong to the class of mitochondrial carriers (16Leuenberger D.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Insertion of these precursors into the inner membrane is strictly dependent on Δψ but does not require ATP in the matrix.Proteins destined for the inner membrane require the help of small, structurally related Tim proteins in the intermembrane space. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five members of this protein family are expressed (19Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Of these, Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12 specifically support the import of mitochondrial carrier preproteins (11Koehler C.M.

They form two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes of 70 kDa, which interact with the hydrophobic precursors thereby keeping them in an import competent conformation. The TIM9–10 complex interacts with the carrier proteins early in the import pathway when they are partially translocated across the TOM complex. The carrier proteins are then handed over to the TIM9–10-12 complex, which is tightly associated with the TIM22 complex and mediates their insertion into the inner membrane.Tim8 and Tim13 assist the import of a distinct subgroup of inner membrane proteins such as Tim23, the major component of the TIM23 translocase (16Leuenberger D.

Like the other members of the family, they exist as hetero-oligomeric 70-kDa complexes in the intermembrane space but, in contrast to Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12, are not essential for the cell viability in yeast. The TIM8–13 complex binds to the incoming Tim23 precursor still associated with the TOM complex. In yeast, it is only required when the membrane potential is low and the membrane insertion of Tim23 is inefficient (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the TIM8–13 complex is necessary to accumulate the Tim23 precursor and present it to the TIM22 complex thereby facilitating its insertion into the inner membrane.The human homologue of Tim8 is encoded by the DDP1 (deafness dystonia peptide 1) gene. Mutations in the DDP1/TIMM8A gene cause the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation, and blindness (24Jin H.

The human complex is able to complement the function of the TIM8–13 complex in yeast. Although import of yeast Tim23 does not require the TIM8–13 complex under normal conditions, import of human Tim23 appears to be dependent on the assistance of the DDP1·hTim13 complex under all conditions studied (26Rothbauer U.

These zinc fingers may be crucial for the recognition and binding of translocation intermediates during their transfer through the aqueous environment of the intermembrane space.In this report, we analyzed the structural and functional consequences of a mutation (C66W), directly affecting the Cys4 metal binding motif. This cysteine to tryptophan exchange at amino acid position 66 is currently the only missense mutation known to cause Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (27Tranebjaerg L. Hamel B.C. Gabreels F.J. Renier W.O. Van Ghelue M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show that the DDP1C66Wis efficiently imported into mitochondria and correctly sorted into the intermembrane space. However, the mutant protein is no more able to complement the function of Tim8 in yeast mitochondria lacking the endogenous TIM8–13 complex; in particular, the mutant DDP1 cannot restore import of Tim23. Analysis of purified recombinant DDP1 revealed that the C66W exchange impairs the ability of DDP1 to bind zinc. As a consequence, DDP1C66W does not fold properly and is no longer able to interact with its partner protein hTim13. Thus, the C66W substitution leads to a defect in the formation of a functional DDP1·hTim13 complex. This may interfere with the biogenesis of the TIM23 complex and an impaired biogenesis of the mitochondria might by the pathomechanistic basis of the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome.DISCUSSIONDeletion of the DDP1/TIMM8A gene or loss-of-function mutations within the gene are associated with a severe disorder in humans, the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man #304700). Despite some variability in its phenotypic expression, Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental deterioration, and optic atrophy, indicating progressive neurodegeneration. Recently, a first case of Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome with a missense mutation inDDP1/TIMM8A was reported (27Tranebjaerg L. Hamel B.C. Gabreels F.J. Renier W.O. Van Ghelue M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutated gene encodes a full-length protein; however, the clinical outcome of this patient is indistinguishable from published clinical courses of patients with loss-of-function mutations leading to absent or truncated DDP1 proteins. The missense mutation is an amino acid exchange from cysteine to tryptophan (C66W) affecting one of the four highly conserved cysteine residues that constitute a Cys4 zinc finger motif (13Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The precise functional role of the putative zinc fingers is currently unknown. They may be involved in folding or stability of the protein, in complex assembly, or in substrate recognition.In the present study, we generated DDP1 constructs carrying the C66W mutation to analyze which function of DDP1 is affected. We combinedin vitro analysis of purified recombinant protein within vivo functional analysis of the mutant DDP1 in the yeast system. The Δ8/Δ13 yeast strain, lacking both yTim8 and yTim13, enabled us to test the function of the mutated DDP1. As demonstrated previously, expression of wild-type DDP1 together with human Tim13 in Δ8/Δ13 cells rescues the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Δ8/Δ13 yeast strain (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, when DDP1C66W instead of wild-type DDP1 was introduced into Δ8/Δ13 cells, transformants failed to grow on glucose at 15 °C, indicating that the mutant DDP1 is non-functional in yeast. Furthermore, mutant DDP1 is apparently no more able to take over the function of its yeast homologue Tim8 during import of Tim23. We showed that the DDP1C66W precursor is efficiently imported into mitochondria and correctly sorted into the intermembrane space. Although the mutant DDP1 appears to be about 2-fold more susceptible to degradation by endogenous proteases, it accumulates in mitochondria to a level near that of wild-type DDP1. Thus, the inability of the mutant DDP1 to complement strain Δ8/Δ13 does not result from a reduced protein level in mitochondria.The C66W mutation affects a highly conserved element within DDP1 consisting of four cysteines, which likely form a metal binding site. We recently demonstrated that DDP1 and its partner protein hTim13 indeed bind zinc in a 1:1 stoichiometry and thus appear to form zinc fingers (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have shown that the C66W mutation impairs the ability of DDP1 to bind zinc ions. As a consequence, the C66W mutation leads to an incorrectly folded protein, as indicated by its increased susceptibility to externally added protease. Likewise, pretreatment of wild-type DDP1 with the metal-chelating agent EDTA/o-phe results in an increased sensitivity of the protein to trypsin. It is likely, therefore, that the C66W mutation alters the three-dimensional structure of the zinc binding domain thereby influencing the folding properties of DDP1.What are the functional consequences of an altered zinc finger structure? Zinc fingers are ubiquitous structural elements that are associated with protein·nucleic acid recognition or protein·protein interactions (31Leon O. Roth M. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that a functional zinc finger is required for assembly of DDP1 into the 70-kDa complexes. Experiments in vitro using recombinant DDP1 and hTim13 showed that the interaction between these cognate partner proteins is completely abolished by the C66W mutation. Moreover, recombinant DDP1C66W had lost the ability to form higher molecular weight complexes. In contrast, purified wild-type DDP1 or hTim13 spontaneously assembled into hexameric complexes even in the absence of the cognate partner protein. Thus, the structural features of the zinc fingers are conserved between DDP1 and hTim13 allowing association into homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes. In vivo, both partner proteins are present in comparable concentrations and assemble into hetero-oligomers (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Currently, it is unclear whether the zinc finger in DDP1 is also involved in substrate recognition and binding during import of human Tim23. The DDP1C66W construct, however, is not suitable to answer this question, because it cannot be excluded that a loss of substrate binding is secondary to its inability to form a complex with hTim13. Thus, to identify the substrate binding sites of DDP1, the generation of further mutant DDP1 constructs that harbor an intact Cys4 metal motif and are able to interact with hTim13 is needed.In summary, we showed that exchange of one of the conserved cysteine residues leads to impaired zinc binding and subsequent incorrect folding of the zinc finger domain. The functional consequence of the C66W mutation is primarily a deficiency of DDP1 to form a 70-kDa complex together with hTim13 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Thus, although the mutated DDP1 protein is imported into mitochondria and correctly sorted, it is non-functional and leads to a full-blown clinical phenotype in Mohr-Tranebjaerg patients. With the exception of a few components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, all mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes. The import of such preproteins into mitochondria and the correct sorting into mitochondrial subcompartments is mediated by a set of import systems in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane. Three distinct preprotein import systems have been described (1Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Bauer M.F. Hofmann I.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All preproteins most likely use the general translocase in the outer membrane, the TOM1 complex. It mediates the recognition and binding of preproteins as well as their transfer across the outer membrane. Further movement of the translocation intermediates into and across the inner membrane is mediated by two distinct translocases in the inner membrane, the TIM23 and the TIM22 complexes. The TIM23 complex mediates import of preproteins with positively charged targeting signals at their N termini into the mitochondrial matrix space and into the inner membrane (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F.

Cell. 2000; 101: 401-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The transfer of preproteins across the inner membrane strictly requires both an electrochemical potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane and the presence of ATP in the matrix as energy sources (9Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-36745Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The TIM22 complex is used by a class of hydrophobic inner membrane proteins with internal and so far less characterized targeting signals (10Kerscher O. Holder J. Srinivasan M. Leung R.S. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1663-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G.

Typical substrates are the members of the mitochondrial carrier family that are synthesized without a matrix-targeting signal. In addition, the TIM22 complex appears to mediate the import of precursors of other hydrophobic membrane proteins such as Tim23 and Tim22, which do not belong to the class of mitochondrial carriers (16Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Insertion of these precursors into the inner membrane is strictly dependent on Δψ but does not require ATP in the matrix. Proteins destined for the inner membrane require the help of small, structurally related Tim proteins in the intermembrane space. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five members of this protein family are expressed (19Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Of these, Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12 specifically support the import of mitochondrial carrier preproteins (11Koehler C.M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They form two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes of 70 kDa, which interact with the hydrophobic precursors thereby keeping them in an import competent conformation. The TIM9–10 complex interacts with the carrier proteins early in the import pathway when they are partially translocated across the TOM complex. The carrier proteins are then handed over to the TIM9–10-12 complex, which is tightly associated with the TIM22 complex and mediates their insertion into the inner membrane. Tim8 and Tim13 assist the import of a distinct subgroup of inner membrane proteins such as Tim23, the major component of the TIM23 translocase (16Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M.

A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Like the other members of the family, they exist as hetero-oligomeric 70-kDa complexes in the intermembrane space but, in contrast to Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12, are not essential for the cell viability in yeast. The TIM8–13 complex binds to the incoming Tim23 precursor still associated with the TOM complex. In yeast, it is only required when the membrane potential is low and the membrane insertion of Tim23 is inefficient (21Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the TIM8–13 complex is necessary to accumulate the Tim23 precursor and present it to the TIM22 complex thereby facilitating its insertion into the inner membrane. The human homologue of Tim8 is encoded by the DDP1 (deafness dystonia peptide 1) gene. Mutations in the DDP1/TIMM8A gene cause the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation, and blindness (24Jin H. May M. Tranebjaerg L. Kendall E. Fontan G. Jackson J. Subramony S.H. Arena F. Lubs H. Smith S. Stevenson R. Schwartz C. Vetrie D. Nat.

In human mitochondria, DDP1 forms a hetero-oligomeric complex of 70 kDa together with hTim13 (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J.

The functional consequence of the C66W mutation is primarily a deficiency of DDP1 to form a 70-kDa complex together with hTim13 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Thus, although the mutated DDP1 protein is imported into mitochondria and correctly sorted, it is non-functional and leads to a full-blown clinical phenotype in Mohr-Tranebjaerg patients. Deletion of the DDP1/TIMM8A gene or loss-of-function mutations within the gene are associated with a severe disorder in humans, the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man #304700). Despite some variability in its phenotypic expression, Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental deterioration, and optic atrophy, indicating progressive neurodegeneration. Recently, a first case of Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome with a missense mutation inDDP1/TIMM8A was reported (27Tranebjaerg L. Hamel B.C. Gabreels F.J. Renier W.O. Van Ghelue M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutated gene encodes a full-length protein; however, the clinical outcome of this patient is indistinguishable from published clinical courses of patients with loss-of-function mutations leading to absent or truncated DDP1 proteins. The missense mutation is an amino acid exchange from cysteine to tryptophan (C66W) affecting one of the four highly conserved cysteine residues that constitute a Cys4 zinc finger motif (13Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The precise functional role of the putative zinc fingers is currently unknown. They may be involved in folding or stability of the protein, in complex assembly, or in substrate recognition. In the present study, we generated DDP1 constructs carrying the C66W mutation to analyze which function of DDP1 is affected. We combinedin vitro analysis of purified recombinant protein within vivo functional analysis of the mutant DDP1 in the yeast system. The Δ8/Δ13 yeast strain, lacking both yTim8 and yTim13, enabled us to test the function of the mutated DDP1. As demonstrated previously, expression of wild-type DDP1 together with human Tim13 in Δ8/Δ13 cells rescues the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Δ8/Δ13 yeast strain (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, when DDP1C66W instead of wild-type DDP1 was introduced into Δ8/Δ13 cells, transformants failed to grow on glucose at 15 °C, indicating that the mutant DDP1 is non-functional in yeast. Furthermore, mutant DDP1 is apparently no more able to take over the function of its yeast homologue Tim8 during import of Tim23. We showed that the DDP1C66W precursor is efficiently imported into mitochondria and correctly sorted into the intermembrane space. Although the mutant DDP1 appears to be about 2-fold more susceptible to degradation by endogenous proteases, it accumulates in mitochondria to a level near that of wild-type DDP1. Thus, the inability of the mutant DDP1 to complement strain Δ8/Δ13 does not result from a reduced protein level in mitochondria. The C66W mutation affects a highly conserved element within DDP1 consisting of four cysteines, which likely form a metal binding site. We recently demonstrated that DDP1 and its partner protein hTim13 indeed bind zinc in a 1:1 stoichiometry and thus appear to form zinc fingers (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have shown that the C66W mutation impairs the ability of DDP1 to bind zinc ions. As a consequence, the C66W mutation leads to an incorrectly folded protein, as indicated by its increased susceptibility to externally added protease. Likewise, pretreatment of wild-type DDP1 with the metal-chelating agent EDTA/o-phe results in an increased sensitivity of the protein to trypsin. It is likely, therefore, that the C66W mutation alters the three-dimensional structure of the zinc binding domain thereby influencing the folding properties of DDP1. What are the functional consequences of an altered zinc finger structure? Zinc fingers are ubiquitous structural elements that are associated with protein·nucleic acid recognition or protein·protein interactions (31Leon O. Roth M. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that a functional zinc finger is required for assembly of DDP1 into the 70-kDa complexes. Experiments in vitro using recombinant DDP1 and hTim13 showed that the interaction between these cognate partner proteins is completely abolished by the C66W mutation. Moreover, recombinant DDP1C66W had lost the ability to form higher molecular weight complexes. In contrast, purified wild-type DDP1 or hTim13 spontaneously assembled into hexameric complexes even in the absence of the cognate partner protein. Thus, the structural features of the zinc fingers are conserved between DDP1 and hTim13 allowing association into homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes. In vivo, both partner proteins are present in comparable concentrations and assemble into hetero-oligomers (26Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear whether the zinc finger in DDP1 is also involved in substrate recognition and binding during import of human Tim23. The DDP1C66W construct, however, is not suitable to answer this question, because it cannot be excluded that a loss of substrate binding is secondary to its inability to form a complex with hTim13. Thus, to identify the substrate binding sites of DDP1, the generation of further mutant DDP1 constructs that harbor an intact Cys4 metal motif and are able to interact with hTim13 is needed.

To elucidate the mechanism of interfacial activation of cPLA2, we measured the effects of mutations of selected ionic and hydrophobic residues in the catalytic domain on the enzyme activity and the membrane binding of cPLA2. Mutations of anionic residues located on (Glu419 and Glu420) or near (Asp436, Asp438, Asp439, and Asp440) the active site lid enhanced the affinity for cPLA2 for anionic membranes, implying that the electrostatic repulsion between these residues and the anionic membrane surface might trigger the opening of the active site. This notion is further supported by a biphasic dependence of cPLA2 activity on the anionic lipid composition of the vesicles. Mutations of a cluster of cationic residues (Lys541, Lys543, Lys544, and Arg488), while significantly enhancing the activity of enzyme, abrogated the specific activation effect by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). These data, in conjunction with cell activity of cPLA2 and mutants transfected into HEK293 cells, suggest that the cationic residues form a specific binding site for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that the specific PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding is involved in cellular activation of cPLA2. Also, three hydrophobic residues at the rim of the active site (Ile399, Leu400, and Leu552) were shown to partially penetrate the membrane, thereby promoting membrane binding and activation of cPLA2. Based on these results, we propose an interfacial activation mechanism for cPLA2 which involves the removal of the active site lid by nonspecific electrostatic repulsion, the interdomain hinge movement induced by specific PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding, and the partial membrane penetration by catalytic domain hydrophobic residues.

However, the role of the catalytic domain in the membrane binding and activation of cPLA2 is still poorly understood. A recent crystal structure of cPLA2 revealed some unique structural features of the protein that provide a clue to the potential role of the catalytic domain in the interfacial activation of cPLA2(7Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). First, the C2 and the catalytic domains are connected by a narrow and flexible linker region (see Fig. 1), implying that a hinge motion of this linker might be involved in cPLA2 activation. Second, the active site entry of the enzyme is partially blocked by a largely amphiphilic lid (residues 413–457) that is flanked by highly flexible lid hinges (see Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, the interfacial activation of cPLA2 should involve the removal of the lid from the active site. Third, several anionic and cationic patches are present on the putative membrane-binding surface of the catalytic domain that surrounds the active site cavity (see Fig. 1). In particular, two clusters of anionic residues are present in the active site lid and in the lid hinges, respectively, whereas two prominent cationic patches are found in the molecular periphery (see Figs. 1 and2). Finally, several hydrophobic residues are located at the rim of the active site (Fig. 2).Figure 2Schematic representation of the cPLA2 active site region. Three anionic residues (Asp418, Asp419, and Asp420) are located on the external side of the lid α-helix, and four anionic residues (Asp436, Asp438, Asp439, and Asp440) are present in a flanking hinge. The electrostatic repulsion between these residues and anionic lipids in the membrane would remove the lid from the active site opening, exposing the active site and several hydrophobic residues (Ile399, Leu400, and Leu552) at the rim of the active site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the catalytic domain in membrane binding and activation of cPLA2.In vitro mutational analyses of ionic and hydrophobic residues in the catalytic domain using surface plasmon resonance, monolayer penetration, and activity assays, in conjunction with the studies of HEK293 cells transfected with cPLA2 and selected mutants tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), provide new insights into the mechanism of cPLA2 activation and the roles of catalytic domain residues in this process. 1,2-Di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) was from Sigma. 1,2-Di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DHPG) was prepared from DHPC by phospholipase D-catalyzed transphosphatidylation as described (8Comfurius P.

Acta. 1977; 488: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). 1,2-Bis[12-(lipoyloxy)-dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (BLPG) and 1-O-(1-pyrenedecyl)-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PyArPC) were synthesized as described previously (9Cho W., Wu, S.K. Yoon E. Lichtenbergova L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) were generous gifts of Dr. Karol Bruzik of University of Illinois, Chicago. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis. [3H]Arachidonic acid (AA) was purchased from American Radiochemical Co.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and used without further purification. Ampicillin, Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CHAPS were from Sigma. Octyl glucoside was from Fisher. Human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), Zeocin, and Ponasterone A were from Invitrogen. Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNAs of cPLA2 with appropriate catalytic domain mutations were generated by the overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pVL1392-cPLA2 (10Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as a template. Transfection of Sf9 cells with mutant pVL1392-cPLA2 constructs was performed using the BaculoGoldTM transfection kit from BD PharMingen. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to avoid possible endotoxin contamination. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 350-ml suspension cultures and infected with high titer recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. For harvesting, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 35 ml of extraction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To the supernatant, 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added, and the mixture was kept shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h. The protein was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. cPLA2 fractions were concentrated and desalted in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of mixed liposomes was carried out as described previously (9Cho W., Wu, S.K. Yoon E. Lichtenbergova L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μm PyArPC (1 mol %) inserted in 9.9 μm BLPG was incubated with enzymes at 37 °C in 2 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 μmBSA, 0.16 m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 378 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 345 nm. Spectral bandwidth was set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. Specific activity was determined from the initial slope of the reaction as described previously. Activity of cPLA2 on zwitterionic [14C]SAPC vesicles was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [14C]AA release as described previously (11Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y.

The preparation of vesicle-coated Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore) was described in detail elsewhere (12Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sensor surface was coated with DHPC or DHPG vesicles. In control experiments, the fluorescence intensity of the flow buffer after rinsing the sensor chip coated with vesicles incorporating 10 mm 5-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) was monitored to confirm that the vesicles remained intact on the chip. All experiments were performed with a control cell in which a second sensor surface was coated with BSA. All kinetic measurements were performed at 24 °C and at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. For data acquisition, five or more different concentrations (typically within a 10-fold range above or below the K d ) of each protein were used. After each set of measurements, the entire immobilized vesicles were removed by injection of 25 μl of 40 mm CHAPS, followed by 25 μl of octyl glucoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was re-coated with a fresh vesicle solution for the next set of measurements. By using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore), the association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein-binding site on the vesicle) ↔ (complex). The association phase was analyzed using the equation, R = (k a C/(k a C +k d ))R max(1 − e−(k aC+kd)(t−t 0)+ RI, where RI is the refractive index change;R max is the theoretical binding capacity;C is the analyte concentration; k a is the association rate constant, and t 0 is the initial time. The dissociation phase was analyzed using the equation,R =R 0e−k d(t−t 0), where k d is the dissociation rate constant, andR 0 is the initial response. The dissociation constant (K d ) was then calculated from the equation,K d = k d /k a . It should be noted that in our SPR analysis K d is defined in terms of not the molarity of phospholipids but the molarity of protein-binding sites on the vesicle (see above). Thus, if each protein-binding site on the vesicle is composed of n lipids,nK d is the dissociation constant in terms of molarity of lipid monomer (13Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to difficulty involved in accurate determination of the concentration of lipids coated on the sensor chip, however, only K d was determined in our SPR analysis, and the relative affinity was calculated as a ratio ofK d values assuming that n values are essentially the same for wild type and mutants. Surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough (4 × 1 cm) was measured using a Wilhelmy plate attached to a computer-controlled Cahn electrobalance (model C-32) as described previously (13Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Five to ten microliters of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) or chloroform was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 mmCa2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (π0). The subphase was continuously stirred at 60 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Once the surface pressure reading of monolayer had been stabilized (after ∼5 min), the protein solution (typically 30 μl) was injected into the subphase and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 30 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (i.e. 1 μg/ml). Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The Δπversus π0 plots were constructed from these measurements. EGFP was cloned from the vector pEGFP (CLONTECH) by PCR with its stop codon removed. It was inserted between the HindIII and the NotI site of a modified pIND vector (Invitrogen) to create the plasmid pIND/EGFP. For subcloning of cPLA2 and its mutants into the pIND/EGFP vector, NotI andBglII sites were introduced to the 5′ and the 3′ ends, respectively, of corresponding pVL1392-cPLA2 vectors by PCR. The PCR product was digested and ligated into pIND/EGFP plasmid to create an amino-terminal EGFP fusion protein with a spacer sequence, MRPH. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to avoid possible endotoxin contamination. A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all cell studies. Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells between the 5th and 20th passage were passaged into 8 wells of a Lab-TechTM chambered coverglass. For transfection, these cells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented DMEM containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) for 7–8 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed; the cells were washed once with FBS-supplemented DMEM and overlaid with FBS-supplemented DMEM containing ZeocinTM (Invitrogen) and 140 μg/ml Ponasterone A to induce protein production. Images were obtained using a 4-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. A 505-nm line pass filter and a ×63, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective were used for all experiments. All experiments were carried out at the same laser power, which was found to induce minimal photobleaching over 30 scans, and at the same gain and offset settings on the photomultiplier tube. Cells for imaging were selected based on their initial intensity. The LSM 510 imaging software was used to control the time intervals for imaging calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2. Immediately before imaging, induction media were removed, and the cells were washed twice with 150 μl of 2 mm EGTA and then overlaid with 150 μl of HEK buffer (1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.67 mm d-glucose, 6.4 mm sucrose) containing 2 mm EGTA and 10 μm ionomycin. After initial imaging of the cells, 150 μl of HEK buffer containing 6 mm CaCl2 was added to transfected cells to induce the calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 and its mutants. Control experiments were done with dimethyl sulfoxide in place of ionomycin. Although the expression of cPLA2 and mutants in HEK293 cells was induced as described above, cells were radiolabeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA (200 Ci/mmol). After 20 h at 37 °C, medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with the DMEM, 10% FBS medium. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm ionomycin in 0.5 ml of the medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The culture medium was collected and briefly centrifuged, and 0.25-ml aliquots were subjected to scintillation counting. Cells were then removed from the plate by adding 200 μl of trypsin/EDTA solution and collected by brief centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of the medium and was subjected to scintillation counting to obtain total radioactivity of the cells. The [3H]AA release is expressed in terms of the percentage of total radioactivity incorporated into cells. The x-ray crystal structure of cPLA2 (7Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D.

Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) indicates the presence of two clusters of anionic residues in the lid blocking the active site and the hinge region that connects the lid to the rest of the molecule, respectively (see Figs. 1 and2). Glu418, Glu419, and Glu420 on the lid are surface-exposed in the structure, and the Asp436, Asp438, Asp439, and Glu440 in the hinge region are also expected to be exposed although their coordinates have not been defined due to high flexibility. Because all intracellular membranes, including perinuclear membranes, contain considerable amounts of anionic phospholipids (15White D.A. Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dwason R.M.C.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1973: 441-482Google Scholar), the docking of cPLA2 to these membranes by the C2 domain would create energetically unfavorable contacts between the membrane surface and the catalytic domain. This suggests that the interfacial activation of cPLA2, i.e. the removal of the lid from the active site, might be triggered by the electrostatic repulsion. To test this notion, we mutated these surface anionic residues to lysines,i.e. D436K/D437K/D438K/E440K. For Glu419 and Glu420, E419A/E420A mutation was selected over E419K/E420K due to low stability of the latter. We then measured the membrane binding affinities of these mutants for zwitterionic (DHPC) and anionic vesicles (DHPG) by SPR analysis. DHPG was selected over its phosphatidylserine (PS) derivative due to difficulty involved in the synthesis of latter. We also measured the enzyme activities of wild type and mutants toward zwitterionic [14C]SAPC vesicles and anionic mixed vesicles of PyArPC (1 mol %)/BLPG. We previously showed that PyArPC is selectively hydrolyzed in PyArPC/BLPG mixed vesicles because of extremely low activity of cPLA2 on BLPG (9Cho W., Wu, S.K. Yoon E. Lichtenbergova L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As summarized in Table I, cPLA2 wild type has ∼4-fold higher affinity for PC vesicles than for PG vesicles. As expected, E419A/E420A and D436K/D438K/D439K/E440K had wild type-like affinities for zwitterionic PC vesicles. Similarly, the mutations yielded activities toward [14C]SAPC vesicles within a factor of 2 for wild type. Modestly decreased activities are likely to reflect minor local conformational changes that interfere with the activation process. When the affinity for anionic PG vesicles was measured, the quadruple mutant D436K/D438K/D439K/E440K showed 5-fold higher affinity than wild type; as a result, it binds PG vesicles slightly better than PC vesicles. The large increase in affinity for anionic vesicles by the charge reversal indicates that the hinge region containing the Asp436/Asp438/Asp439/Glu440cluster would make energetically unfavorable contact with the anionic membrane surface as cPLA2 approaches the membrane. Interestingly, D436K/D438K/D439K/E440K was only 60% more active than wild type toward PyArPC/BLPG mixed vesicles. This is much lower than expected from its enhanced affinity for PG vesicles, even after taking into account a partial loss of enzyme activity caused by the mutation (see above). The lower-than-expected activity suggests that electrostatic attraction between cationic residues introduced to the lid hinge region of cPLA2 and the anionic membrane surface interferes with the enzyme activation process. This in turn supports the notion that interfacial activation of cPLA2 involves the removal of the active site lid by the electrostatic repulsion. On the other hand, E419A/E420A had a modest but definite 30% gain in affinity for PG vesicles and a slight 10% decrease in activity toward PyArPC/BLPG vesicles. These changes are much smaller than those seen with D436K/D438K/D439K/E440K, largely because E419A/E420A has a two-site charge removal in lieu of a four-site charge reversal in the latter mutant. The data still support the notion, however, that the two lid anionic residues unfavorably interact with the anionic membrane surface.Table IRelative activities and affinities of cPLA 2 ionic site mutantsEnzymeRelative activity1-aAbsolute specific activity values for wild type were 100 ± 15 and 20 ± 4 nmol/mg min for SAPC and PyArPC/BLPG vesicles, respectively.PC affinity,K dPG affinity, K dSAPCPyArPC/BLPG mWild type11(4.2 ± 0.3) × 10−9(1.6 ± 0.4) × 10−8E419A/E420A0.80.9(4.0 ± 0.5) × 10−9(1.2 ± 0.2) × 10−8D436K/D438K/D439K/E440K0.61.6(4.0 ± 0.7) × 10−9(3.2 ± 0.5) × 10−9K271A/K273A/K274A1.10.3(4.3 ± 1.5) × 10−9(3.0 ± 0.5) × 10−8R467A0.90.6(4.0 ± 0.5) × 10−9(3.2 ± 0.7) × 10−8K541A/K543A/K544A2.32.6(4.2 ± 0.4) × 10−9(1.2 ± 0.3) × 10−8R488E1.21.5(4.5 ± 0.6) × 10−9(1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−8Each value was determined as an average of triplicate measurements.1-a Absolute specific activity values for wild type were 100 ± 15 and 20 ± 4 nmol/mg min for SAPC and PyArPC/BLPG vesicles, respectively.

Although the full-length cPLA2 has ∼4-fold higher affinity for PC vesicles than for PG vesicles, this preference is significantly less than that of the isolated C2 domain that strongly prefers PC vesicles (16Nalefski E.A.

Furthermore, it has been reported that cPLA2 can tightly bind anionic phosphatidylmethanol vesicles (18Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing PC vesicles (19Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) even in the absence of calcium. These data suggest that the catalytic domain favorably interacts with anionic membrane surface, independently of its calcium-dependent, PC-favoring C2 domain. Consistent with this notion, the catalytic domain of cPLA2 contains a number of surface-exposed cationic residues, forming two prominent patches (i.e.Arg488/Lys541/Lys543/Lys544and Lys271/Lys273/Lys274/Arg467) on its putative membrane-binding surface (see Fig. 1). To assess the roles of these cationic residues in the membrane binding of cPLA2, we selectively mutated them to either Glu or Ala, depending on the relative stability of mutants. Specifically, K271A/K273A/K274A, R467A, K541A/K543A/K544A, and R488E were generated, and their membrane affinity and lipolytic activity were measured. Mutations of one cationic patch, i.e. K271A/K273A/K274A and R467A, led to 2–3-fold reduction in both affinity for PG vesicles and activity on PyArPC/BLPG vesicles while exhibiting the wild type-like affinity for and activity on PC vesicles. Thus, these clustered residues seem to play some role in binding to anionic membranes. On the other hand, the mutations in the other cationic patch, K541A/K543A/K544A and R488E, did not significantly change the affinity for either PC or PG vesicles, indicating that they do not make close contact with the membrane. Unexpectedly, however, K541A/K543A/K544A had >2-fold higher activity than wild type toward both SAPC and PyArPC/BLPG vesicles, whereas R488E was modestly more active than wild type toward both substrates. These data indicate that the mutations of cationic patch composed of Arg488/Lys541/Lys543/Lys544result in a conformational change of protein that leads to enzyme activation. This in turn suggests that the cationic cluster might be involved in keeping the enzyme in an inactive conformation in the resting state. It has been long known that some anionic phospholipids can increase cPLA2 activities (20Leslie C.C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In particular, PtdIns(4,5)P2 was shown to specifically activate cPLA2 (19Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the origin of this activation is not fully elucidated. To investigate this aspect systematically, we measured the enzyme activity and membrane affinity of cPLA2and selected mutants in the presence of different anionic phospholipids in mixed vesicles with PC. First, we measured the effect of PG on the vesicle affinity and the enzyme activity of cPLA2. As expected from the preference of cPLA2 for PC vesicles (see Table I), the affinity of cPLA2 for DHPC/DHPG-mixed vesicles determined"

Biochemical and genetic studies showed that induction of these detoxifying enzymes is primarily due to transcriptional activation of the genes and is regulated by an enhancer, called an antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)1 or electrophile-responsive element (9Favreau L.V.

It was found to be a potent inhibitor of both CYP1A and -2B in rat liver in vivo andin vitro (15Langouet S. Maheo K. Berthou F. Morel F. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Glaise D. Coles B. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and of CYP1A2 and -3A4 in primary human hepatocyte cultures (16Langouet S. Coles B. Morel F. Becquemont L. Beaune P. Guengerich F.P. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5574-5579PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that oltipraz was also capable of increasing mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2B1/2 in rat liver following its transient inhibitory effect (15Langouet S. Maheo K. Berthou F.

Desmots F. Corcos L. Guillouzo A. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A similar induction of CYP1A expression and activity was observed in lung and kidney, and CYP2B1 apoprotein was dramatically decreased via a proteasome-dependent pathway in rat lung after administration of oltipraz (18Le Ferrec E. Ilyin G. Maheo K. Bardiau C. Courtois A. Guillouzo A. Morel F. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The CYP1A subfamily catalyzes the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which generates genotoxic metabolites that bind DNA thus mediating PAH-induced carcinogenesis. TheCYP1A genes do not contain any closely matching ARE sequence, indicating their transcriptional induction by oltipraz involves an ARE-independent pathway. Classically, CYP1A1/2transcription is induced by PAH via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The PAH bind the cytosolic AhR ligand-binding subunit, which undergoes a transformation or activation process involving several steps: translocation in the nucleus; release of 90-kDa heat-shock proteins; and heterodimerization with a protein partner, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt). This heterodimer interacts with a 5′-GCGCT-3′ DNA sequence, the core binding motif of the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), present in multiple copies upstream of the CYP1A1 gene promoter (19Corchero J. Pimprale S. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Several reports have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) in the XRE-inducible transcription of the CYP1A1 gene mediated through the AhR (20Berghard A.

A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) demonstrated that regulation of the ARE also involves a PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (14Yu R.

Because MAPK and PKC targeting are regulated by intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) (23Maasch C. Wagner S. Lindschau C. Alexander G. Buchner K. Gollasch M. Luft F.C. Haller H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1570-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), this ubiquitous second messenger might be one of the initial events involved in gene induction mediated by oltipraz or PAH. Interestingly, it has been shown that benzo[a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, two known CYP1A1 inducers, increase [Ca2+] i in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (26Tannheimer S.L. Lauer F.T. Lane J. Burchiel S.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Dithiolethiones and food contaminant PAH first accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, which expresses some CYP1A metabolic capacity (27de Waziers I. Cugnenc P.H. Yang C.S. Leroux J.P. Beaune P.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 387-394PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that in the presence of oltipraz, activation of these carcinogens could be altered. In this study we confirmed that CYP1A is expressed in the rat intestine and is inducible after administration of oltipraz to rats. To further characterize the mechanism of induction of CYP1A1 by this compound, we used the Caco-2 cell line derived from a human colon carcinoma. These cells differentiate into enterocytes at confluency and exhibit a highly inducible CYP1A1 by benzimidazole or PAH derivatives (omeprazole and β-naphtoflavone or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), respectively) (28Boulenc X. Bourrie M. Fabre I. Roque C. Joyeux H. Berger Y. Fabre G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1471-1478PubMed Google Scholar, 29Daujat M. Charrasse S. Fabre I. Lesca P. Jounaidi Y. Larroque C. Poellinger L. Maurel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We brought evidence that CYP1A1 induction by oltipraz is dependent upon both [Ca2+] i and the Ah receptor.DISCUSSIONThe pleiotropic effects of oltipraz, a promising chemopreventive agent, are now well recognized, and recent evidence has been brought that this compound can induce both phase I and phase II enzymes either in liver or extrahepatic tissues. Although differences have been observed regarding the response of phase I and phase II enzymes between rat tissues, CYP1A appears to be among the most sensitive of the CYPs. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, which are expressed, respectively, mostly in nonhepatic and hepatic tissues, are involved in the bioactivation of a number of carcinogens such as PAH as well as other toxicants. The results reported here show that oltipraz is also an inducer of CYP1A1 in the intestine and, using human Caco-2 cells, that its induction is calcium- and Ah receptor-dependent.To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that oltipraz dramatically increases CYP1A1 in both rat intestine and human Caco-2 cells. Moreover, the data presented here strongly indicate that this induction occurs through the XRE and that oltipraz and PAH inducers utilize the same AhR-mediated signal transduction pathway to regulate the expression of CYP1A1. First, a comparative analysis of CYP1A1 mRNA levels shows the same pattern of induction in the presence of oltipraz or benzo[a]pyrene (starting after 2 h with a maximum induction between 8 and 12 h). Second, Caco-2 cells are known to possess a functional AhR (29Daujat M. Charrasse S. Fabre I. Lesca P. Jounaidi Y. Larroque C. Poellinger L. Maurel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Third, the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA was superinduced when oltipraz was used in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (data not shown). Fourth, use of luciferase reporter constructs demonstrates that oltipraz is a potent inducer of both the XRE-containing 5′-flanking region of CYP1A1 gene and XRE-driven gene expressions. Fifth, resveratrol (an antagonist of AhR) inhibits the oltipraz increase of both CYP1A1 mRNA level and p1A1-Fl- or pGL3-XRE3-luciferase activities. Finally, oltipraz shares several structural features with CYP1A1/2 classical inducers such as 3-methylcholanthrene, TCDD, and β-naphtoflavone; it is hydrophobic, planar, and of polycyclic structure. Although its behavior is quite similar to that of PAH, it cannot be excluded that oltipraz (or one of its metabolites) is an activator of AhR without binding to it, as already shown for other compounds such as omeprazole (42Lesca P. Peryt B. Larrieu G. Alvinerie M. Galtier P. Daujat M. Maurel P. Hoogenboom L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Singh S.S. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Previous reports and the present study clearly indicate that oltipraz is able to increase transcriptional activity of phase II enzymes andCYP1A1 through the binding of transcriptional factors to the ARE and XRE sequences, respectively. However, early cellular events occurring upon cell exposure to oltipraz and leading to this transcriptional activation are still unknown and remain to be described. In an attempt to determine whether calcium, which is a well established transcriptional regulator, is involved in CYP1A1induction, we looked for an effect of oltipraz on intracellular calcium level in Caco-2 cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that oltipraz induces a rapid and transient increase of [Ca2+] i in these cells, which mediates oltipraz induction of CYP1A1. Increases in intracellular calcium in most cell types are mediated by either the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum via inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate or an influx via plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (voltage-dependent calcium channels, receptor-operated calcium channels, and/or store-operated Ca2+ channels) or by both. In the present case, the lack of [Ca2+] i increase following the addition of oltipraz in a calcium-free medium (containing EGTA) strongly supports the involvement of plasma membrane calcium channels. This was confirmed by using 2-APB, an inhibitor of store-operated Ca2+channels, which inhibits oltipraz-CYP1A1 induction in a dose-dependent manner. Store-operated Ca2+channels are defined as plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, in which activation is mediated by a decrease in Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum (44Putney J.W., Jr. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These channels are thought to be responsible for replenishing Ca2+ lost from the endoplasmic reticulum via membrane Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase. Thus, the addition of oltipraz in the cell culture medium rapidly increases [Ca2+] i via an entry of this ion species through store-operated channels, which is likely to be activated following an effect on the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results also support the hypothesis that this rapid increase of [Ca2+] i is the initial event leading to the induction of CYP1A1 by oltipraz. Interestingly, Marc et al. (45Marc N. Galisteo M. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Fautrel A. Joannard F. Guillouzo A. Corcos L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have brought evidence for the involvement of Ca2+ in the induction of mouse Cyp2b9/10 by phenobarbital, a compound that also induces CYP1A1 in rat (46Corcos L. Marc N. Wein S. Fautrel A. Guillouzo A. Pineau T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and CYP1A2 in rainbow trout hepatocytes (47Sadar M.D. Ash R. Sundqvist J. Olsson P.E. Andersson T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17635-17643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, TCDD, benzo[a]pyrene, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, three known CYP1A1 inducers, have been reported to increase [Ca2+] i in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (26Tannheimer S.L. Lauer F.T. Lane J. Burchiel S.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Tannheimer S.L. Barton S.L. Ethier S.P. Burchiel S.W. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular Ca2+ might be a key factor in the induction ofCYP1A1 by various compounds. This hypothesis is reinforced by experiments carried out with Caco-2 cells treated with BAPTA-AM or 2-APB, which also partially inhibit CYP1A1 induction by TCDD, benzo[a]pyrene, or 3-methylcholanthrene (data not shown).Several studies have demonstrated that changes in free intracellular Ca2+ are rapidly transformed into changes in the activity of several kinases including protein kinase A, PKC, MAPKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), and CaMKK (23Maasch C.

Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previous investigations revealed that DNA binding by human and mouse AhR-Arnt heterodimers requires phosphorylation of both proteins, whereas formation of AhR-Arnt heterodimers requires phosphorylation of Arnt only (20Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Pongratz I. Stromstedt P.E. Mason G.G. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16813-16817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Long et al. (21Long W.P. Chen X. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12391-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that a PKC-mediated event is required for the AhR to form a functional transcriptional complex that leads to trans-activation. Thus, in the process ofCYP1A1 induction by oltipraz, [Ca2+] i might be a determinant step in the activation of PKC and hence the phosphorylation of AhR. Interestingly, recent findings indicate an important role for both PKC and MAPK pathways in the induction of ARE-dependent phase II detoxifying enzymes, with Nrf2 being phosphorylated by PKC (13Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 14Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J., Wu, J. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Consequently, it could be postulated that the increases in both CYP1A1 and phase II enzymes in the presence of oltipraz are dependent on a common initial signal, which is the oltipraz-induced entry of calcium inside the cells. This has yet to be established regarding phase II enzymes. Thus, the entry of extracellular calcium inside the cells through store-operated Ca2+ channels might be the initial event leading to the activation of the AhR receptor and its subsequent binding to the XRE sequence.Although oltipraz exhibits a chemopreventive effect during different stages of experimental colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane in rats (4Rao C.V. Rivenson A. Katiwalla M. Kelloff G.J. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2502-2506PubMed Google Scholar), compounds that induce CYP1A1 are regarded as potentially harmful because of the property of this CYP to activate carcinogenic PAH. Furthermore, rat intestinal conjugation enzymes have been demonstrated to be less susceptible to induction by oltipraz than their hepatic counterparts (50Ansher S.S. Dolan P. Bueding E. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1986; 24: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 51Vargas M. Lamb J.G. Franklin M.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the ability of oltipraz to induce CYP1A1 in intestinal cells raises the critical question of whether, in some cases, oltipraz might potentiate the deleterious effects of a particular compound to which an individual is also exposed. Oltipraz, a synthetic derivative of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, is considered as one of the most promising chemopreventive agents in development, based on preclinical studies (1Boone C.W. Kelloff G.J. Malone W.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2-9PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kensler T.W. Helzlsouer K.J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1995; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Liu Y.L.

Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1379-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and a recent Phase IIa clinical trial in China (6Qian G.S. Ross R.K., Yu, M.C. Yuan J.M. Gao Y.T. Henderson B.E.

Groopman J.D. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1996; 5: 253-261PubMed Google Scholar). This compound was first claimed to act as a chemopreventive agent by enhancing activities of phase II enzymes such as glutathioneS-transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductase, and epoxide hydrolase (for a review see Ref. 8Primiano T. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 293-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies showed that induction of these detoxifying enzymes is primarily due to transcriptional activation of the genes and is regulated by an enhancer, called an antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)1 or electrophile-responsive element (9Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been implicated as an essential component of an ARE-binding transcriptional complex (12Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 13Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently oltipraz was also reported to influence cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression and activities. It was found to be a potent inhibitor of both CYP1A and -2B in rat liver in vivo andin vitro (15Langouet S. Maheo K. Berthou F. Morel F. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Glaise D. Coles B. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and of CYP1A2 and -3A4 in primary human hepatocyte cultures (16Langouet S. Coles B. Morel F. Becquemont L. Beaune P. Guengerich F.P. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5574-5579PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that oltipraz was also capable of increasing mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2B1/2 in rat liver following its transient inhibitory effect (15Langouet S. Maheo K. Berthou F. Morel F. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Glaise D. Coles B. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Maheo K. Morel F. Antras-Ferry J. Langouet S. Desmots F. Corcos L. Guillouzo A. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A similar induction of CYP1A expression and activity was observed in lung and kidney, and CYP2B1 apoprotein was dramatically decreased via a proteasome-dependent pathway in rat lung after administration of oltipraz (18Le Ferrec E. Ilyin G. Maheo K. Bardiau C. Courtois A. Guillouzo A. Morel F. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The CYP1A subfamily catalyzes the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which generates genotoxic metabolites that bind DNA thus mediating PAH-induced carcinogenesis. TheCYP1A genes do not contain any closely matching ARE sequence, indicating their transcriptional induction by oltipraz involves an ARE-independent pathway. Classically, CYP1A1/2transcription is induced by PAH via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The PAH bind the cytosolic AhR ligand-binding subunit, which undergoes a transformation or activation process involving several steps: translocation in the nucleus; release of 90-kDa heat-shock proteins; and heterodimerization with a protein partner, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt). This heterodimer interacts with a 5′-GCGCT-3′ DNA sequence, the core binding motif of the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), present in multiple copies upstream of the CYP1A1 gene promoter (19Corchero J. Pimprale S. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several reports have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) in the XRE-inducible transcription of the CYP1A1 gene mediated through the AhR (20Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Long W.P. Chen X. Perdew G.H. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) demonstrated that regulation of the ARE also involves a PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (14Yu R.

Because MAPK and PKC targeting are regulated by intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) (23Maasch C. Wagner S. Lindschau C. Alexander G. Buchner K. Gollasch M. Luft F.C. Haller H.

We have previously shown that they can repress transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we provide the first functional evidence that these proteins can also repress gene function in a manner that does not require deacetylase activity. This functionality can be attributed in part to Ikaros interactions with the HDAC-independent corepressor, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). However, mutations that block Ikaros-CtBP interactions do not abolish Ikaros's repression activity, implicating the involvement of additional corepressors. Consistent with this expectation, we show that Ikaros can interact with a CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP), which has also been linked to a deacetylase-independent strategy of repression. Despite being a CtBP interactor, CtIP's association with Ikaros does not require CtBP but instead relies upon its Rb interaction domain. Significantly, Ikaros can interact with Rb, which itself can repress gene function in a deacetylase-independent manner. A mutation in Ikaros that abrogates CtIP interactions significantly reduces repression, and a double mutation that prevents interaction with both CtIP and CtBP even further alleviates repression. Finally, we show that CtIP and CtBP can interact with the general transcription factors, TATA binding protein and transcription factor IIB, which suggests a possible mechanism for their deacetylase-independent mode of repression.

Thus, Ikaros isoforms can be distinguished into two groups based on their DNA-binding ability. Genetic studies have clearly established that Ikaros proteins play critical roles during hemo-lymphopoiesis (9Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.-H. Molnár Wu, P. Winandy S. Sharpe A.

Ikaros is required from the earliest stages of hemopoiesis, at the level of the hemopoietic stem cell (12Nichogiannopoulou N. Trevisan M. Naben S. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), to the later stages of lymphoid cell fate determination; in addition, Ikaros proteins regulate lymphocyte proliferation and homeostasis (13Winandy S., Wu, L.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Molecular and biochemical studies aimed at understanding the basis for these complex biological roles have revealed that Ikaros, in addition to functioning as an activator (15Koipally J. Heller E.J. Seavitt J.R. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), can also potently repress gene expression (16Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repressors can be categorized in several ways. A common approach is to classify them as long range or short range repressors. Members of the former group, such as Groucho and Sir proteins, are capable of making a promoter resistant to all enhancers regardless of their distance from the promoter, whereas short range repressors, such as Kruppel and Giant, act in a less general manner to block the activity of locally bound activators (17Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative but non-mutually exclusive approach to repressor classification is based on the utilization, or the lack thereof, of the activity of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs)1for repressor function. HDAC-mediated repression is expected to occur through the removal of acetyl groups from the N termini of histones, which presumably creates a compact chromatin configuration that inhibits transcription. Examples of HDAC-recruiting corepressors include the Sin3 and Mi-2β proteins (18Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 19Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase-independent repressors are believed to function through multiple mechanisms, but the strategy that has been most extensively studied is the interaction of such factors with the basal transcriptional machinery; these interactions affect recruitment of the RNA Polymerase II holoenzyme to the promoter or events associated with promoter clearance and re-initiation (20Muscat G.E.O.

Investigation of the mechanisms behind CtBP-mediated repression has revealed that, although CtBP can interact with histone deacetylases, it can repress transcription even when deacetylase activity is inactivated, suggesting its ability to use alternative repression mechanisms (26Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).

In addition to interacting with CtBP, CtIP has also been shown to bind the tumor suppressors, Rb/p130 (28Meloni A. Smith E. Nevins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Significantly, mutations in BRCA1 found in breast cancer patients prevent interactions with CtIP, suggesting an important role for CtIP in BRCA1's tumor-suppressive function (34Yu X., Wu, L.C.

CtIP has been implicated in BRCA1's DNA repair function (35Li S. Ting N.S. Zheng L. Chen P.L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Upon genotoxic stress, such as γ-irradiation, CtIP becomes phosphorylated by the ATM kinase, which apparently prevents CtIP-BRCA1 interactions, thus allowing BRCA1 to activate genes involved in DNA repair such as p21 andGADD45 (35Li S. Ting N.S. Zheng L. Chen P.L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These findings have, however, been strongly contested (36Wu-Baer F. Baer R. Nature. 2001; 414: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is very likely that CtIP plays important roles in regulating the tumor suppressive functions of BRCA1, Rb, and other regulators. We have previously shown that Ikaros can interact with the HDAC-recruiting factors, Sin3 and Mi-2β (16Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Consistent with such interactions, Ikaros repression of the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter is relieved by the deacetylase-inhibitor trichostatin A (16Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, Ikaros also interacts with CtBP that can repress transcription in a deacetylase-independent manner (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the HDAC-independent repression potential of Ikaros. We show that Ikaros-mediated repression of the thymidine kinase (tk), unlike that of the AdML promoter, is insensitive to deacetylase inhibitors. In addition to CtBP, Ikaros can interact with two corepressors, CtIP and Rb, that can work through a deacetylase-independent pathway. Mutations that abrogate CtIP interactions reduce repression by Ikaros whereas those that prevent both CtBP and CtIP associations even further alleviate repression. We provide evidence to suggest that Ikaros repression through this pathway may involve interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery. BXG1, BXG1-Ik1, BXG1-Aio, BXG1-MAD, BXG1-mMAD, the reporters G5tkCAT and G5AdMLPCAT, CDM8-Ik1, CDM8-HA-Ik1, CDM8-FLAG-Aio3, CDM8-FLAG-Helios, CDM8-FLAG-Eos (Daedalus), CDM8-MT-Sin3A, pCMV2-FLAGIk1, pCMV2-FLAGIk1cm, and GST-hCtBP1 have been previously reported (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Deletion and point mutants of Ik6 were generated by the Stratagene mutagenesis kit using Ik6 in the context of the BXG1 vector, which encodes the Gal4 DBD (amino acids 1–147) under the control of the SV40 promoter or in a CDM8FLAG vector. The following reagents were generously provided by the indicated investigators: GST-TFIIB and pSG5-SMRT (Dr. M. Privalsky), MT-CoREST (Dr. G. Mandel), MT-Cabin1 (Dr. J. Liu), MT-BCoR (Dr. V. Bardwell), MT-Groucho (Dr. Y. Kim), MT-CtIP and its CtBP and Rb interaction mutants (Drs. A. Meloni and J. Nevins), an expression vector for Rb (Drs. T. Chen and Dr. J. Wang), and FLAG-HDRP (Dr. X. Zhou and Dr. P. Marks). 293T and NIH3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Transfections of these cell lines were carried out using the HEPES buffered saline-CaPO4 method. For repression assays, 1 μg of the Gal4 fusion plasmid, 10 μg of the Gal4-reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the pXGH5 growth hormone transfection efficiency control plasmid were used. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were fed with fresh media, and 18–24 h later cells were harvested and processed for CAT assays as described previously (8Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In those instances where trichostatin A (Upstate Biotech) was employed, we added the drug to the cells 16–18 h before harvesting. Growth hormone assays were done as recommended by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute). Transfections were typically performed in duplicate and repeated between three and six times. Whole-cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with the relevant plasmids were prepared as previously described (8Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and pre-cleared using Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pre-cleared extracts were incubated with the antibody of interest or the relevant isotype control on ice for 1 h. 30 μl of Protein G beads was then added to the extract, and the extracts were rotated overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TS buffer. The beads obtained after this procedure were treated with SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 15 min, and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with 8–10% of the cell extract used for the immunoprecipitation. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the relevant antibody, and examined by autoradiography with ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). FLAGM2 purification of Ikaros complexes has been described before (37Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K.

Antibodies used were: Myc-tag, MT (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), HA (BAbCO), FLAG M2 (Sigma), Gal4, Sin3B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HDAC2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Rb (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and anti-Ikaros and Mi-2, which have been previously described (37Kim J.

Anti-HDRP was provided by Dr. X. Zhou and Dr. P. Marks. GST, GST-TBPN, GST-TBPC, and GST-TFIIB were prepared using previously described protocols (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 1–2 μg of the GST proteins was incubated with proteins programmed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed extensively with MT/phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer and fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were then dried and visualized by autoradiography. Histone deacetylase assays were performed using tritiated chicken reticulocyte histones as described previously (37Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates from 293T whole cell extracts were washed 3× in TS buffer and incubated with 100,000 cpm of tritiated acetylated histones for 45 min at 30 °C in HD assay buffer. The reaction was stopped by acidification, and the released tritium was extracted with ethyl acetate. We have previously shown that Ikaros repression of the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter is relieved in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. Thus, we suggested that Ikaros mediates repression of this promoter through the action of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig.1, left panel) (16Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that Ikaros interacts with the corepressor CtBP, which can repress transcription in a histone deacetylase activity-independent manner (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on this finding we claimed that Ikaros, in addition to repressing transcription through HDAC, can also function using HDAC activity-independent mechanisms (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To address the possible ability of Ikaros to repress in a deacetylase activity-independent manner, we set out to identify promoters that Ikaros might repress using this alternate repression mechanism. In a recent report we showed that the Ikaros corepressor, CtBP, can repress the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in a deacetylase activity-independent manner (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ikaros's repression of the tk promoter might also utilize a similar strategy, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with G5tkCAT and expression vectors encoding Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) fusions of Ikaros and its family member, Aiolos. As controls, we included the empty vector, the vector expressing the Gal4 DBD alone, and Gal4 DBD fusions to the Sin3 interaction domain of MAD (MAD) or a mutant version of this domain that cannot interact with Sin3 (mMAD); the MAD protein serves as a positive control, because it has been shown to repress the tk promoter in a deacetylase-dependent manner (39Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) whereas its mutant variant serves as the negative control. Transfectants were either treated with trichostatin A or left untreated. CAT assays revealed that repression of the tk promoter by Gal4-Ik1 and Gal4-Aiolos, unlike Gal4-MAD, was not relieved over background levels in the presence of the deacetylase inhibitor (Fig. 1, right panel). Thus, Ikaros- and Aiolos-mediated repression of the tk, unlike the AdML promoter, is not dependent on the activity of histone deacetylases. This observation is highly reminiscent of the corepressors Rb and HDRP, which also repress the tk promoter in a manner that does not rely on HDACs (40Luo R. Postigo A. Dean D. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 41Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This provides the first functional evidence that Ikaros and Aiolos can repress transcription in a manner independent of HDAC activity. Ikaros interactions with CtBP can account, in part, for this alternate repression strategy. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that other corepressors are also involved, because mutations that abolish the Ikaros-CtBP interaction still permit significant levels of repression (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This supposition is further strengthened by the observation that Aiolos, which cannot interact with CtBP (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), continued to repress the tk promoter in the presence of the deacetylase inhibitor. To identify other Ikaros-interacting factors that can account for its deacetylase-independent repression strategy, we screened a panel of seven well-established corepressors for binding the most full-length Ikaros isoform, Ik1, through a co-transfection/co-immunoprecipitation approach. These studies highlight the specificity that Ikaros shows in its interactions with corepressors. Of all the proteins tested, only CtIP and our positive control, Sin3A, were capable of binding Ikaros at detectable levels (Fig. 2 A). Significantly, CtIP has been implicated in effecting HDAC-independent repression through the tumor suppressor, Rb (28Meloni A. Smith E. Nevins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, CtIP interactions with Ikaros may play a role in Ikaros's deacetylase-independent repression mechanism. We next tested whether other Ikaros isoforms, like Ik1, could also interact with CtIP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that all the tested isoforms, Ik2, -3, and -7, could interact with CtIP (Fig.3 A). To determine whether the CtIP-Ikaros interactions seen in vitro could be recapitulated in vivo, we probed Western blots containing Ikaros complexes immunopurified from resting and cycling T lymphocytes. CtIP was found in complexes from both sources (Fig. 3 B). Thus, CtIP appears to be an interactor of Ikaros proteins in lymphocytes. Because both Ikaros and CtIP bind CtBP (24Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we tested whether the CtIP-Ikaros interaction was mediated through this common corepressor. Wild type Ikaros (Ik1) and a mutant form that cannot interact with CtBP (Ik1cm) were transfected along with CtIP and tested for binding. Interestingly, Ik1 and Ik1cm were capable of interacting with CtIP, albeit less strongly (Fig. 3 C, compare IP lanes 1 and 4). Thus, although CtIP may be recruited to Ikaros through CtBP, it can also be recruited through CtBP-independent means. In addition to interacting with CtBP, CtIP also interacts with the tumor suppressor and corepressor, Rb (24Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Meloni A. Smith E. Nevins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine whether CtIP might be recruited to Ikaros through an Rb-dependent mechanism, we co-transfected Ikaros with wild type CtIP and CtIP mutants that are defective for interactions with Rb (−Rb) and CtBP (−CtBP). Wild type CtIP interacted strongly with Ikaros whereas CtIP defective for interactions with CtBP showed a reduced interaction (Fig.3 C, compare IP lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, CtIP that was defective for Rb interactions was significantly impaired in its interactions with Ikaros (Fig.3 C, compare IP lanes 1–3). Taken together, these data show that Ikaros can bind CtIP through a mechanism that relies upon an intact Rb binding domain on CtIP (summarized in Fig.3 D). So, can Ikaros associate with Rb? FLAG-Ik1 and Rb were co-transfected and tested for association by immunoprecipitation. Rb was indeed immunoprecipitated with Ikaros (Fig. 3 E), which lends support to our earlier finding that CtIP interactions with Ikaros require a functional Rb interaction motif. In summary, these data indicate that Ikaros interactions with CtIP do not require CtBP but instead require a functional Rb motif on CtIP. Consistent with the finding that Ikaros does not require CtBP to interact with CtIP, the Ikaros family members, Helios, Aiolos, and Eos, which do not interact with CtBP, can bind CtIP (Fig. 3 F). Further support for CtBP-independent recruitment of CtIP to Ikaros and its family comes from the finding that exon 7 of Ikaros, which lacks a CtBP-binding motif, can also interact with CtIP (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). These data suggest that a region in exon 7 is most likely the CtBP-independent domain through which CtIP associates with Ikaros. To obtain CtIP interaction-defective Ikaros mutants, we targeted several mutations in exon 7 of the Ikaros isoform, Ik6 (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Of these mutants, M8, which contains a 20-amino acid deletion spanning residues 416–435, was found to significantly decrease CtIP binding (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine the role of the CtIP-Ikaros interaction, we tested the effect of this mutation on repression by Ik6, the most potent repressor among the Ikaros isoforms. Like the CtBP interaction mutant (M1), the CtIP mutant (M8) caused a 50% reduction in repression of the tk promoter (Fig.4 B). When both these mutations were incorporated in a single molecule (M9), repression was further reduced to 15% of wild type Ik6 levels (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that CtIP and CtBP are major components of the deacetylase-independent repression strategy of Ikaros on the tk promoter. What is the mechanism of CtIP-mediated repression? Although CtIP has been implicated in deacetylase-independent repression, little is known about its interactions with deacetylases. To determine whether CtIP can interact with endogenous histone deacetylases, we immunoprecipitated CtIP, and as a positive control Sin3A, from 293T cells. CtIP, unlike Sin3A, was not found associated with any significant amount of HDAC2 (Fig.5 A). This was verified by histone deacetylase assays of these immunoprecipitates, which indicated that HDAC activity associated with CtIP was close to background levels. In contrast, Sin3A, which associates strongly with HDACs, supported 18-fold higher activity than background levels (Fig. 5 A). These data lend support to the suggestion that CtIP likely utilizes HDAC-independent means to repress gene expression. A well studied HDAC-independent repression strategy involves interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery that negatively affect pre-initation complex assembly and/or promoter clearance (20Muscat G.E.O. Burke L.J. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using GST fusions of different components of the basal transcriptional machinery, we found that in vitrotranslated CtIP can bind TFIIB (Fig. 5 B) whereas the other deacetylase-independent Ikaros corepressor, CtBP, can associate with both the N (amino acids 1–128) and C termini of TBP as well as with TFIIB (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, Ikaros itself can interact with the C terminus of TBP (amino acids 128–328) and with TFIIB (Fig. 5 B). Taken together these findings raise the possibility that the HDAC activity-independent repression mediated by Ikaros on the tk promoter may occur through interactions with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. We have previously shown that Ikaros and Aiolos can repress transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (16Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, Ikaros interacts with CtBP, which can repress through HDAC activity-independent mechanisms (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). On the basis of this interaction, we proposed that Ikaros might also be capable of this alternate repression strategy. Here, we provide the first functional evidence that Ikaros and Aiolos can effect repression in a manner that is independent of deacetylase activity. However, mutations in Ikaros that abolished interactions with CtBP could still repress transcription, indicating the involvement of other corepressors (38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with this expectation, we show that Ikaros interacts with the corepressors, CtIP and Rb, which are capable of deacetylase-independent repression. Finally, mutations that abrogate CtIP interactions with Ikaros alleviate repression, and those that prevent both CtBP and CtIP interactions even further reduce repression of the tk promoter. Because both Ikaros and CtIP contain the CtBP penta-peptide interaction module and because both these factors can bind CtBP (24Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 38Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that their association was mediated via CtBP. However, Ikaros proteins bearing mutations that prevented interactions with CtBP, were still able to interact with CtIP. Therefore, interaction with CtBP was not essential for CtIP associations with Ikaros. In support of this finding, a domain of Ikaros lacking a CtBP interaction domain (exon 7), as well as the Ikaros family members that cannot associate with CtBP, could bind CtIP. Thus, CtIP is a good candidate for a corepressor that effects repression of the tk promoter by Ikaros and Aiolos. What is the CtBP-independent mode of CtIP association with Ikaros? CtIP interactions with Ikaros require the former's intact Rb interaction motif, suggesting that CtIP may associate with Ikaros through Rb family proteins. In support of this suggestion, both CtIP and Ikaros can interact with Rb. But why might Ikaros need two independent ways to recruit CtIP? It has recently been shown that the binding of CtBP to its interacting proteins is regulated by the levels of nicotinamide adenine nucleotides, NAD+ and NADH; agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulate interactions between CtBP and its interactors and thereby increase repression (42Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we posit that having a CtBP-independent mode of recruitment would permit Ikaros·CtIP complexes to function under conditions that do not favor Ikaros-CtBP interactions. How does CtIP mediate repression? CtIP cannot interact with HDAC2 and immunoprecipitates very small amounts of deacetylase activity, supporting its classification as a deacetylase-independent repressor. Significantly, CtIP, CtBP, and Ikaros can interact with components of the basal machinery, namely TBP and TFIIB. Several repressors have been shown to effect repression through such interactions. Studies with Rb have shown that it affects the formation of an effective pre-initiation complex possibly through its interactions with the TFIID (22Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) whereas detailed studies with the nuclear receptor corepressor, NCoR, have indicated that it blocks interactions between TAFII32 and TFIIB, which are crucial for transcriptional initiation (20Muscat G.E.O. Burke L.J. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). NCoR has also been hypothesized to lock interactions with basal transcriptional components into a non-functional complex or conformation that abrogates transcription. Future studies using in vitro transcription systems will allow us to address the role, if any, of Ikaros and its corepressors' interactions with basal transcriptional factors in repression. Recently, it has also been shown that the CtIP interacting proteins, CtBP and Rb, can repress gene function in a deacetylase-independent manner through the recruitment of Polycombs (30Dahiya A. Wong S. Gonzalo S. Gavin M. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that Ikaros may also utilize this avenue of deacetylase-independent repression. The importance of the Ikaros-CtIP interaction in deacetylase-independent repression was consolidated by mutational analysis. Mutation of the CtIP interaction site on Ik6 significantly reduced repression of the tk promoter by 50% of wild type levels. Thus, CtIP is a component of the deacetylase-independent repression by Ikaros of this promoter. Furthermore, mutations that abrogated CtIP and CtBP interactions reduced repression to roughly 15% of levels supported by the wild type protein. Thus, CtIP and CtBP appear to collaborate to repress the tk promoter. The fact that repression is not completely abolished suggests the potential role of still other corepressors. In this context, we have recently found that Ikaros can interact with another corepressor, histone deacetylase-related protein (HDRP) (data not shown). HDRP was first identified as an interactor of a key muscle regulatory protein, MEF2 (25Sparrow D. Miska E. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and was recently shown to bind CtBP and to repress the tk promoter in an HDAC-independent manner (41Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, another Ikaros interactor, Sin3, which usually represses using deacetylases, has also been shown to be capable of HDAC-independent repression; for this function, Sin3 appears to target components of the basal transcriptional machinery (21Wong C. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). An enigma resulting from these studies is the basis for why repression of the tk versus the AdML promoters requires Ikaros to utilize two different repression strategies. If histone deacetylation is involved in repression through effecting DNA compaction, one would have expected HDAC recruitment to repress all promoters. One possible explanation for a promoter-selective function of HDACs is that the promoter context, defined by the other trans-acting factors bound to it, may only permit HDAC recruitment on a promoter like AdML but not one like tk. Thus, selective recruitment of co-factors by a DNA binding factor, influenced by its binding context, may underlie a transcription factor's promoter-specific transcriptional functions. Thus far, CtIP has been shown to interact with two tumor suppressors, BRCA1 (29Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Yu X., Wu, L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that dysregulation of Ikaros expression causes rapid development of leukemias and lymphomas (10Winandy S., Wu, P. Georgopoulos K.

The availability of the Ikaros-CtIP interaction mutant will allow this hypothesis to be tested. In conclusion, in this report we have presented several lines of evidence to show that Ikaros can function as a deacetylase-independent repressor in addition to its ability to repress through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (Fig. 6). This is a significant step forward in the attempt to molecularly dissect the workings of this key hemo-lymphoid regulator. We thank Audrey Jackson for excellent technical assistance.

Aberrant expression of MAO is implicated in several psychiatric and neurogenerative disorders. In this study, we have shown that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increases human MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression. The sequence between −246 and −225 bp consists of overlapping binding sites (Sp1/Egr-1/Sp1) that are recognized by Sp1, Sp3, and PMA-inducible Egr-1 is essential for PMA activation. PMA transiently increases egr-1 and c-jun gene expression. Mutation studies show that Egr-1 and c-Jun transactivate the MAO B promoter and increase endogenous MAO B transcripts via the Sp1/Egr-1/Sp1 overlapping binding sites. Sp3 inhibits Sp1 and Egr-1 activation of MAO B gene expression. c-fos gene expression was increased by PMA but not involved in MAO B gene transcription. Furthermore, protein kinase C inhibitor blocks the PMA-dependent activation of MAO B. Co-transfection of the MAO B promoter with dominant negative forms of Ras, Raf-1, MEKK1, MEK1, MEK3, MEK7, ERK2, JNK1, and p38/RK inhibit the PMA-dependent activation of the MAO B promoter. These results indicate that MAO B expression is selectively induced by the activation of protein kinase C and MAPK signaling pathway and that c-Jun and Egr-1 appear to be the ultimate targets of this regulation.

The degradation of monoamines by MAO yields hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, the MAO exists in two isoforms (MAO A and MAO B) that exhibit distinct substrate and inhibitor specificity (for a review, see Ref. 1Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). MAO A deficiency was associated with a syndrome of impulsive aggressive behavior and mild mental retardation in affected males of a Dutch family (2Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefield X.O. Ropers H.H. Van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). On the other hand, low platelet MAO B activity was implicated in bipolar disorders, suicidal behavior, alcoholism (3Devor E.J. Cloninger C.R. Hoffman P.L. Tabakoff B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 48: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), sensation seeking (4Oreland L. Monoamine Oxidase: Basic and Clinical Aspects. VSP Press, Utrecht, The Netherlands1993: 219-247Google Scholar), and poor impulse control (5Holschneider D.P. Shih J.C. Psychopharmocology: The Fourth Generation of Progress. CD ROM edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, New York1998Google Scholar). Although both MAO A and MAO B are widely distributed in the central nervous system and in the periphery, they differ in cell- and tissue-specific and developmental expressions. For instance, fibroblasts and placenta express predominantly MAO A (6Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Egashira T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1976; 26: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas platelets and lymphocytes express predominantly MAO B (8Bond P.A. Cundall R.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 80: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MAO A are found in catecholaminergic neurons, whereas MAO B are in serotonergic neurons and astrocytes (9Westlund K.N. Denney R.M. Rose R.M. Abell C.W. Science. 1985; 230: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 10Levitt P. Pintar J.E. Breakefield X.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6385-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MAO B, but not MAO A, activity increases progressively in the brain throughout adult life (11Fowler C.J. Wiberg A. Oreland L. Marcusson J. Winblad B. J. Neural Transm. 1980; 49: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Arai Y. Kinemuchi H. J. Neural Transm. 1988; 72: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aberrant increase of MAO B activity in the elderly has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (13Schneider G. Oepen H. Von Wedel H.R. Arch. Psychiatr. Nervenkr. 1981; 230: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (14Jossan S.S. Gillberg P.G. Gottfries C.G. Karlsson I. Oreland L. Neuroscience. 1991; 45: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and Huntington's disease (15Mann J.J. Kaplan R.D. Bird E.D. J. Neural Transm. 1986; 65: 15-30Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The human MAO A and MAO B are encoded by two different genes located on the X chromosome (Xp11.2–11.4) (16Lan N.C. Heinzmann C. Gal A. Klisak I. Orth U. Lai E. Grimsby J. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Shih J.C. Genomics. 1989; 4: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The two genes consist of 15 exons with identical exon-intron organization (17Grimsby J. Chen K. Wang L.J. Lan N. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and share 70% sequence similarity in amino acid sequence (18Bach A.W.J. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.-W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequences of MAO A and MAO B genes have been sequenced and characterized. The maximal promoter activities for MAO A and MAO B genes were found to be in the −206/−60 and −246/−99 regions, respectively. Although both of these promoter regions are GC-rich and share ∼60% sequence identity, they contain a distinct organization of cis-acting elements, which may explain differential expression of the MAO A and MAO B genes (19Zhu Q.S. Grimsby J. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the role of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the regulation of MAO A and B genes. We showed that MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression was rapidly induced following PMA treatment. The region between nucleotides −246 and −225 of MAO B promoter was essential for PMA-induced expression. The PMA-responsive region was further refined to a single Sp1/Egr-1/Sp1 overlapping binding site located between nucleotides −239 and −227. Our results also show that MAO B promoter activity is regulated via a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that includes protein kinase C (PKC), Ras, MEK1, MEK3, MEK7, ERK2, JNK1, and p38/RK. The HepG2 (human hepatocytoma) cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Polyclonal antisera against Sp1, Sp3, Egr-1, JAK1, ERK2, and p38 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). PMA and calphostin C were purchased from Sigma. TheBamHI/BamHI MAO B promoter fragment (−2099/−99 bp) was cloned into the polylinker site (BglII) upstream of the luciferase gene (luc) in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Serial deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion using the pGLB−2099/−99luc as a template followed by Klenow fill-in and self-ligation. The following restriction enzymes were used to generate the deletion constructs: XhoI/AspI (pGLB−1313/−99);XhoI/BglII (pGLB−1180/−99);XhoI/SpeI (pGLB−868/−99);XhoI/ApaI (pGLB−425/−99);XhoI/PstI (pGLB−246/−99). The pGLB−225 construct was generated by digesting the −246/−99 promoter fragment with HaeIII and then ligating the −225/−99 bp fragment into polylinker site of pGL2-Basic. The restriction enzymesPstI and HindIII were used to select positive clones and to verify the correct orientation. One recombinant clone for each of the constructs was chosen, and the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using Qiagen Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to mutate potential transcription elements (Sp1 and Egr-1 elements) in the proximal promoter region (−246 to −99). Mutant promoter constructs (m1, m2, and m3) were generated using pGLB-246 construct as a template. Mutagenesis was carried out using an Amersham Biosciences mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis (mutations underlined) were as follows: 5′-ACCGCCCCCGCAAGCAGCTCTG-3′ (m1); 5′-AGGGCCACCGAACCCGCCCGCA-3′ (m2); 5′-AGGGCCACCGAACCCGCAAGCA-3′ (m3). The mutated nucleotide sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections in HepG2 cells were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown until 50% confluence (24–36 h). For promoter deletion and mutagenesis studies, 1 μg of MAO B promoter-luciferase construct was co-transfected into the HepG2 cells with 20 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene, which is used as an internal control; Promega). The plasmids were mixed with 100 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free medium and 10 μl of Superfect reagent. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) were added to the DNA-Superfect complexes. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with DNA-Superfect complexes. After a 2-h incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics). Cells were harvested 48 h later with luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega). The expression plasmids pCMV-Sp1, pCMV-Sp3, and pSCTKr24 (Egr-1 expression plasmids) were kindly provided by Drs. Robert Tjian, Guntram Suske, and P. Charnay, respectively. Wild-type ERK1 and ERK2 and dominant negative ERK1 (K71R) and ERK2 (K52R), each cloned in pCEP4, were kindly provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb. Dominant negative Ha-Ras (S17N), cloned in pSR-α was obtained from Dr. Robert Chiu. Dominant negative Raf-1 (C4B) was obtained from Dr. Reinhold Krug. Dominant negative MEKK1 (K432M) cloned in pSR-α, and dominant negative MEK1 and MEK2, each cloned in pEECMV, were obtained from Dr. Dennis Templeton. Kinase-negative MKK7 (MKK7KL), cloned in pSR-α was gift from Dr. Eisuke Nishida. Dominant negative MKK3 (MKK3 Ala), cloned in pRSV; dominant negative p38 MAPK (p38 AGF), cloned in pCMV5; and dominant negative JNK1 (JNK1 APF), cloned in pcDNA3, were generously provided by Dr. Roger Davis. Dominant negative Gal4-c-Jun, cloned into the Rc/RSV expression vector, was a gift from Dr. Anning Lin. The expression plasmids for c-Jun and c-Fos were generously provided by Dr. Robert Chiu. For co-transfection experiments, the total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector pCMV3.1. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pelleted. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 3 pellet volumes of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min. The pellets were then resuspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. Nuclear proteins were then centrifuged for 30 min and dialyzed for 4 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol). Protein extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The DNA fragment for gel shift assay was radiolabeled by Klenow fill-in. Labeled probes were purified by gel electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide) and eluted in Tris-EDTA (pH 8). For DNA-protein binding, 5-μg nuclear extracts were diluted in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Sigma)) with a total volume of 20 μl. Antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, or Egr-1 were added (when required), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled probe (0.2 ng) was added to the mixture and incubated for additional 20 min at room temperature. The samples were then run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA at 150 V for 3 h. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). One hundred micrograms of total proteins (for MAO A and B detection) or 50 μg of nuclear proteins (for Egr-1, c-Jun, and c-Fos detection) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with anti-MAO A or anti-MAO B antibodies (1:1000) or anti-Egr-1 or anti-c-Jun or anti-c-Fos or anti-JAK1 or anti-ERK2 or anti-p38 antibodies (1:2000) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS overnight at room temperature. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h, the bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase reaction 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine Tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma). HepG2 cells were grown to confluence, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. One hundred micrograms of total proteins were incubated with 100 μm14C-5-HT (for MAO A) or 10 μm14C-labeled PEA (for MAO B) (AmershamBiosciences) in the assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl. The reaction products were then extracted with benzene/ethyl acetate (1:1) (for MAO A) or water-saturated ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1) (for MAO B) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The organic phase containing the reaction product was extracted, and its radioactivity was obtained by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Total RNA were purified using TRIzol Reagents (Invitrogen). Thirty micrograms of total RNA from HepG2 cells grown to confluence were loaded onto each gel lane. Electrophoresis, transfer onto BrightStar nylon membrane, and hybridization were carried out using NorthernMax according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). The human MAO A probe (specific activity = 1.8 × 108 cpm/μg), MAO B probe (specific activity = 2 × 108 cpm/μg), and an internal control probe encoding human β-actin were labeled by a random-priming technique using the Multiprime kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane hybridized with the MAO A or MAO B probe was autoradiographed for 48 h. When the β-actin control probe was used, membrane was autoradiographed for 6 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, both MAO A and B mRNA were constitutively expressed in HepG2 cells. PMA treatment of HepG2 cells increased MAO B mRNA level, which could be detected as soon as 30 min following PMA addition. The amounts of MAO B mRNA reached the highest level at 8 h after PMA treatment and then gradually returned to the basal level. In contrast, the MAO A mRNA level remained constant throughout the time course of PMA treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the induction of MAO B mRNA was accompanied by an increase of MAO B protein level at 2–4 h after PMA treatment, and the protein level remained elevated up to 24 h. Consistent with the MAO A mRNA level, treatment of PMA had no effect on the MAO A protein expression. Furthermore, PMA treatment of HepG2 cells increased MAO B activity ∼4-fold with no significant change in MAO A activity (Fig. 1 C). To identify the most proximal region responsible for PMA induction, the 5′-flanking sequence of MAO B gene was progressively deleted, ligated upstream of luciferase reporter gene (pGL2-Basic), and transfected into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig.2, deletion constructs pGLB-2099 to pGLB-246 showed both basal promoter activity and PMA inducibility. However, no PMA-induced promoter activity was observed when the region between −246 and −225 bp was further deleted (pGLB−225), indicating that this region was responsible for the PMA-induced promoter activity. This observation led us to define the −246/−225 region as the most proximal sequence for the PMA-induced MAO B promoter activity. Sequence analysis revealed that the −246/−225 region contained overlapping consensus regulatory elements for two Sp1 and one Egr-1 (Fig. 3 A). Gel shift assay was performed to further define the sequences involved in PMA induction and to identify trans-acting factors bound to this region. The 22-bp DNA fragment spanning the −246/−225 region was radiolabeled and incubated with HepG2 (PMA-treated or not) nuclear proteins. Two major shifted complexes (complexes I and II) were observed with nuclear proteins from untreated HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 B,lane 1). Incubation with the same probe with nuclear proteins from PMA-treated cells showed an additional complex (complex III) (lane 2). Since this region contained the cis-elements for transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1, we investigated the possible involvement of Sp and Egr family members in the complexes identified. Supershift experiments were carried out to identify the proteins in the complexes using antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, and Egr1. Incubation with anti-Egr-1 antibody supershifted complex III (lane 3), whereas the presence of the anti-Sp1 antibody supershifted complex II (lane 4). The complex I was completely supershifted following the incubation with anti-Sp3 antibody (lane 5). Taken together, these results identified Sp3, Sp1, and Egr-1 as the protein components of complexes I, II, and III, respectively. To further identify the binding sites for Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 within the −246/−225 region, mutant oligonucleotides derived from the −246/−225 sequence were used as probes in gel shift assays. Sequence-specific mutations (m1, m2, and m3), which specifically disrupted Sp1 and Egr-1 binding sites, were introduced into the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites (Fig. 3 A). The wild-type or mutant (m1, m2, and m3) oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and incubated with HepG2 (PMA-treated or not) nuclear proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 C, mutations at positions −239 and −238 (m1), which disrupted the distal Sp1 binding site, had minor effect on the protein binding compared with the wild type with PMA treatment (lane 3). Oligonucleotide m2, carrying mutations on nucleotides −232 and −231, reduced the binding for Egr-1 and Sp1 (lane 4). Oligonucleotide m3 carrying both of the above mutations abolished the binding for Egr-1, Sp1, and Sp3 (lane 5), suggesting that these proteins interact mostly with the proximal Egr-1/Sp1 sites and less extent with the distal Sp1 site. Taken together, these results indicated that, within the −246/−225 region, the Egr-1 and Sp1 sites were the binding sites involved in the binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the expression of Egr-1 in PMA-treated HepG2 cells. Low basal expression of Egr-1 was observed in untreated cells. Induced Egr-1 expression was observed as early as 0.5 h after PMA treatment, reached the maximal level at 2 h after treatment, and gradually returned to basal level after 24 h (Fig.4 A). To determine the function of Egr-1 in MAO B gene expression, the pGLB−246/−99 promoter-reporter gene construct was co-transfected with increasing amounts of an expression plasmid for Egr-1 into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig.4 B, overexpression of Egr-1 activated the MAO B promoter in a dose-dependent manner up to ∼4-fold at the highest concentration. To examine the function of the Egr-1 site, specific mutations were introduced into Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites of the pGLB−246/−99 construct (Fig. 4 C). Mutant construct m1 contained mutations in the nucleotides −239 and −238 (Fig.3 A), which was shown to have no effect on the binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 in gel shift assay (Fig. 3 C,lane 3). Mutant construct m2 contained mutations in the nucleotides −232 and −231, and mutant construct m3 contained mutations at the nucleotides −239/−238 and −232/−231, which reduced the binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 to the Sp1/Egr-1 binding site (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 and 5). These mutant constructs were transiently co-transfected with the expression plasmid for Egr-1 into HepG2 cells and assayed for promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 4 C, mutations at nucleotides −239 and −238 had no significant effect on the Egr-1-driven promoter activation compared with the wild type (pGLB-246). In contrast, mutations at nucleotides −232 and −231 (m2) and mutations at both sites (m3) reduced the Egr-1-induced MAO B promoter activation, indicating that the Sp1/Egr-1 binding site was necessary for the Egr-1-induced MAO B promoter activation. We then used the same mutant constructs to map the PMA-inducible element within the −246/−225 region. The results from Fig. 4 D showed that mutation of nucleotides −232 and −231 had no effect on PMA-induced MAO B promoter activity. However, mutations at −232 and −231 (m2) reduced (∼60%) but did not abolish PMA-induced promoter activation. Mutations at both sites (m3) completely abolished PMA-induced promoter activation. Taken together, these results showed that the Sp1/Egr-1 binding site was responsible for PMA-induced MAO B promoter activation. Although −246/−225 contained overlapping binding sites for Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1, only one of these factors can bind to the Sp1/Egr-1 site at the same time due to steric hindrance (20Gidoni D. Kadonaka J.T. Barrere-Saldana H. Takahashi K. Chambon P. Tjian R. Science. 1985; 230: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To further test the function of the Sp1/Egr-1 site with Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1, the pGLB−246/−99 construct was co-transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids for Sp1, Sp3, and/or Egr-1 into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 E, consistent with previous results, overexpression of Sp1 or Egr-1 increased MAO B promoter activity ∼4-fold. In contrast, overexpression of Sp3 has no effect on the promoter activity. However, co-expression of Sp3 inhibited the promoter activation by Sp1 or Egr-1, possibly by competing for binding to the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site. Co-transfection of Sp1 with Egr-1 had no additive or synergistic effect on the promoter activity. Northern blot analysis showed that the amounts of the endogenous MAO B transcript were consistent with MAO B promoter activity in these co-transfection experiments (Fig. 4 E). To investigate the function of the c-Jun and c-Fos in the MAO B promoter activity, Western blot analysis was first carried out to determine the expression levels of the immediate early genes c-Jun and c-Fos during PMA treatment in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the increase of c-Jun expression was observed as soon as 2 h after PMA treatment, remained elevated up to 8 h, and then returned to basal level at 24 h. Similarly, the expression of c-Fos increased at 2–4 h after PMA treatment and then gradually returned to basal level. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of the −246/−255 promoter region did not reveal any identity or homology with the consensus AP1 site for c-Jun (5′-TGAGTCA-3′). However, it was shown that c-Jun can bind to Sp1 and activate promoters that contained the Sp1 binding site such as the promoter of the human p21 WAF1 / Cip1 gene (21Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Then the pGLB−246/−99 was transiently co-transfected with various combinations of Sp1, c-Jun, and c-Fos into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, overexpression of Sp1 activated MAO B promoter activity, which is consistent with our previous data. Similarly, overexpression of c-Jun also activated the promoter activity ∼3-fold. In contrast, overexpression of c-Fos had no effect on promoter activity. However, co-transfection of Sp1 and c-Jun had a synergistic effect on promoter activity and increased activity over 8-fold, suggesting a cooperative function of these factors on MAO B promoter activity. Co-transfection of Sp1 and c-Fos stimulated promoter activity ∼2-fold with a slight decrease compared with the result of transfection of Sp1 alone. Co-transfection of c-Jun and c-Fos inhibited the c-Jun activation ∼40%. The endogenous MAO B activities induced by various expression proteins mentioned above were also examined by Northern blot. The expression of mRNA of MAO B was similar as a result of transit transfection (Fig. 5 B). To evaluate the role of Sp1 in the c-Jun-driven activation, promoter constructs with mutations in the Sp1 binding sites were transfected with the expression plasmids for Sp1 and c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 5 C, mutation in the distal Sp1 site (−239/−233) had no significant effect on c-Jun/Sp1-driven promoter activation. In contrast, mutation in the proximal Sp1 site (−233/−227) and mutations at both Sp1 sites (m3) reduced c-Jun/Sp1-driven activation by 67 and 83% compared with the wild type. We next designed experiments to identify the individual steps of the signaling cascade in the PMA-induced MAO B gene activation. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the PMA-induced MAO B promoter activation can be inhibited by calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the activation of PKC is required for this PMA response. Ras was shown to be a downstream target of PKC (22Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras activity is required for MAO B promoter activation, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with pGLB−246/−99 and the expression plasmid encoding the dominant negative form of Ras (24Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, the dominant negative form of Ras (dnRas) inhibited both basal and PMA-dependent MAO B promoter activity. Ras was shown to activate multiple downstream targets, including Raf-1 and MEKK1 (25Lange Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 26Lange Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the dominant negative form of Raf-1 or MEKK1 suppressed PMA-induced MAO B promoter activation. Raf-1 is known to activate downstream targets ERK1 and ERK2 through the activation of MEK1 and MEK2 (27Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W.

To examine the role of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in MAO B promoter activation, we transfected HepG2 cells with pGLB-246 and the wild-type and dominant negative forms of MEK1, ERK1, and ERK2. The dominant negative form of MEK1 suppressed basal and PMA-dependent promoter activation (Fig.6 B). A similar suppression of promoter activity was observed using PD90859, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor. Wild type ERK1 and ERK2 increased basal activity ∼2-fold (Fig. 6 C). The dominant negative form of ERK2, but not ERK1, suppressed PMA-dependent activity. In addition to the Raf-1 signaling cascade, Ras can activate the MEKK1 cascade. MEK4 and MEK7 were shown to be the targets of MEKK1. The dominant negative form of MEK4 had no effect on promoter activation, whereas the dominant negative form of MEK7 significantly decreased PMA-dependent promoter activation (Fig. 6 D). Co-transfection of dominant negative forms of JNK1 and c-Jun suppressed PMA-dependent promoter activation. MEKK1 can also activate MEK3, which subsequently activates p38 MAPKs (30Derijard B.

As shown in Fig. 6 E, dominant negative form of MEK3 or p38/RK suppressed the PMA-dependent MAO B promoter activation. The specificities of dominant negative constructs were evaluated by Western blot. As showed in Fig. 6 F, the protein levels of JNK1, ERK2, and p38 were decreased after transfection with their respective dominant negative constructs, indicating that these dominant negative constructs were selectively blocking the kinases they were intended to target. The schematic representation of the proposed model for the regulation of the human MAO B promoter by PMA was depicted in Fig. 7.Figure 7Proposed signaling pathway for the regulation of human MAO B gene expression.

HepG2 cells are derived from human hepatocytoma. Both MAO A and B have been found in human liver tissue (32Grimsby J. Lan N.C. Neve R. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 55: 1166-1169Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells express both MAO A and B as well. Moreover, this cell line is easy to maintain and proliferate rapidly, which makes it an excellent model system to study the regulation of MAO A and B genes (33Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 852-859Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We showed that treatment of HepG2 cells with PMA induced MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression. The induction of MAO B mRNA could be detected as soon as 30 min following PMA addition and reached a maximum 8 h after PMA stimulation, whereas the induction of Egr-1 was detected as soon as 30 min and achieved a maximum 2 h after PMA stimulation, and induction of c-Jun was detected as early as 1 h and achieved a maximum 2–8 h after PMA treatment. These findings suggest that Egr-1 may play a major role in the earlier course and c-Jun may play a major role in the later course of the induction of MAO B gene transcription by PMA. Deletion analysis of the MAO B gene promoter revealed that the region located between nucleotides −246 and −255 bp was responsible for the PMA-inducible activation. The −246/−255 region consisted of overlapping consensus elements for two Sp1 binding sites and one Egr-1 binding site (Sp1/Egr-1/Sp1) that were able to bind to Sp1 and Sp3 constitutively and Egr-1 following PMA stimulation. Specific mutation of the overlapping sites (Sp1mut/Egr-1mut/Sp1mut) greatly reduced the bindings of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1. The overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 elements are present in a number of gene promoters including the acetylcholinesterase (34Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β1 (35Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding of two adjacent Sp1 molecules to a DNA sequence required at least 10 bp between the central C of the two Sp1 elements (GGGCGGG) (20Gidoni D. Kadonaka J.T. Barrere-Saldana H. Takahashi K. Chambon P. Tjian R. Science. 1985; 230: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since the two Sp1 and the Egr-1 binding sites are tightly overlapped, possibly only one of these factors can bind to the Sp1/Sp3/Egr-1 overlapping site at a time. Thus, competition between these factors and/or other members of the zinc finger transcription factor family for the binding to the overlapping site may play an important role in the control of basal and inducible gene expression. Mutations of the Egr-1 site (m2) completely abolished the Egr-1-mediated promoter activation, demonstrating the functional role of this site. However, the same mutation reduced but did not abolish induction by PMA, whereas mutations at both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites (m3) abolished the induction by PMA, suggesting that in addition to Egr-1 Sp1 may mediate the residual induced activity. Emerging evidence has suggested that Sp1 may function as a carrier bringing c-Jun to the promoter and subsequently trans-activates gene transcription. For example, c-Jun was shown to physically interact with Sp1 and trans-activate the human p21 WAF/Cip1 gene by acting as a superactivator of Sp1 in HepG2 cells. It was suggested that the interaction between c-Jun and Sp1 superactivated Sp1-dependent promoters by stabilizing the interactions between Sp1 and the basal transcription machinery factors TAFII110 and TAFII130 (components of the TFIID complex) (21Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, the EGF- or PMA-inducible (12S)-lipoxygenase gene activation was mediated by the interaction between c-Jun and Sp1 (40Chen B.K. Chang W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10406-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of c-Jun and Sp1 synergistically activated MAO B promoter. Mutation analysis showed that the proximal Sp1 binding site within the Sp1/Egr1/Sp1 overlapping site plays a major role in the synergistic trans-activation by Sp1 and c-Jun. Both c-Jun and Egr-1 were shown to be targets of the PKC and MAPK signaling pathway. In our study, we showed that the PMA-dependent increase of MAO B promoter activity was inhibited by calphostin C, a specific PKC inhibitor. Ras is a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein and has been shown to be a mediator of PKC action (22Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of Ras suppressed both basal and PMA-induced MAO B promoter activity, suggesting that Ras activation is important for MAO B gene expression. Activation of Ras in turns activates the downstream Raf-1/MEK/ERK, MEKK1/MEK4,7/JNK, and MEKK1/MEK3/p38/RK signaling cascades (for reviews, see Ref. 41Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the effects of dominant negative forms of the downstream kinases of each cascade on the PMA-dependent promoter activation. Our results showed that MEK1, MEK3, MEK7, ERK2, JNK1, and p38/RK inhibited the PMA-dependent MAO B promoter activation. In contrast, dominant negative forms of MEK4 and ERK1 fail to suppress PMA-dependent activity. In summary, we have demonstrated that PMA increases MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression. We have also shown that the promoter region between −246 and −225 bp was critical for PMA-induced MAO B gene expression. This region was recognized by the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1. Functional and mutagenesis studies have shown that overexpression of Egr-1 and c-Jun activated the MAO B promoter activity via the Egr-1/Sp1 overlapping binding sites. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the PKC and MAPK signaling pathways were important for the PMA-dependent MAO B gene expression. This study provides novel information on the molecular mechanism for the differential regulation of MAO A and B gene expression. Future studies along this line will help us understand the pathophysiology of the MAO B-related psychiatric disorders and neurogenerative diseases and may lead to design of new therapeutics.

A trademark of these enzymes is a set of well conserved amino acid sequences termed “helicase motifs” (5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Helicases are generally believed to generate single-stranded DNA by catalyzing the melting of stable helical DNA structures utilizing energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. Analysis of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicates that there are 134 open reading frames containing with helicase-like features that represent ∼2% of its genome (7Shiratori A. Shibata T. Arisawa M. Hanaoka F. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The presence of such a large number of helicases or helicase-like proteins in cells, many of unknown function in vivo, most likely reflects a complexity of nucleic acid metabolic reactions and the distinct structural template requirements for a given helicase. Alternatively, many helicases may play roles that functionally overlap, making it difficult to determine a specific role for a given helicase. For example, each mutant cell of the two yeast helicases, Sgs1 and Srs2, grows with wild-type kinetics, but the combination of an sgs1 mutation with loss of the helicase srs2 resulted in a severe growth defect (8Lee S.K. Johnson R.E., Yu, S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A majority of sgs1 and srs2 mutant cells stops dividing stochastically as large budded DNA (9McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such double mutant cells are unable to replicate DNA at restrictive temperature and unable to efficiently transcribe rDNA (8Lee S.K. Johnson R.E., Yu, S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that these two helicases provide a redundant but essential activity for DNA replication and rDNA transcription. Despite well conserved motifs specific to helicase family proteins, there are several proteins for which no helicase activity has been demonstrated, indicating that helicase motifs cannot, without additional information, be used to define a protein as a helicase. For example, the chromatin-remodeling factor SWI2/SNF2 containing these motifs lacks helicase activity, although its ability to hydrolyze ATP is stimulated by DNA (10Richmond E. Peterson C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3685-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Travers A. Cell. 1999; 96: 311-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis provides the energy required to alter protein-DNA structure rather than duplex DNA or RNA structure. This suggests that proteins with helicase motifs may have functions that do not involve unwinding of nucleic acids.As a continued effort to understand the role ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe DNA helicase I that we reported previously (12Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we identified a human homolog of this fission yeast enzyme and named it hFBH1 (humanF-box DNA helicase 1) because it contains a well conserved functional F-box motif (13Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K., Ma, L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In this report, we present data that hFBH1 is not only an ATPase/DNA helicase but also is an F-box protein that can form an SCF (SKP1-CUL1 (Cdc53)-Rbx1-F-box protein) complex with human SKP1 and CUL1. SCF complexes constitute a new class of E31 ligase that plays important roles in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction by catalyzing ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (14Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Winston J.T.

The substrate specificity of an SCF complex is governed by the interchangeable F-box protein subunit, which recruits a specific set of substrates for ubiquitination to the SCF core complex composed of SKP1, Cdc53, ROC1, and the E2 enzyme Cdc34. The polyubiquitinated proteins are rapidly captured by the 26 S proteasome, an abundant, self-compartmentalized protease particle (19Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). To date, hFBH1 is the first example of an F-box protein that contains intrinsic enzymatic activity, suggesting that a helicase can play a role in a certain aspect of DNA metabolism that requires ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The potential biological role of this interesting human DNA helicase will be discussed.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that hFBH1 is a DNA helicase that translocates in the 3′ to 5′ direction and interacts with SKP1 in a manner that requires a functional F-box motif. Besides, hFBH1 interacted with CUL1/ROC1 and formed a SCF complex that contained all known four subunits (SKP1, hFBH1, CUL1, and ROC1). Moreover, SCFhFBH1 displayed ubiquitin ligase activity in a F-box motif-dependent fashion. The polyubiquitination activity of the SCFhFBH1 complex was dependent upon functional E1 and E2 enzymes, demonstrating that the complex interacts with the ubiquitination machinery. Our study showed that hFBH1 is the first example of an F-box protein that harbors an intrinsic enzymatic activity, catalyzing a helicase reaction. In addition, hFBH1 is the first F-box protein implicated in nucleic acid metabolism. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that the role of hFBH1 is most likely to recruit a target protein, most likely involved in some aspect of DNA metabolism, to the protein degradation pathway. Thus, a protein involved in DNA metabolism would be marked by hFBH1 for degradation via the highly regulated ubiquitin degradation pathway.As an initial attempt to evaluate the role of the F-box motif of the enzyme in this regard, we decided to identify a protein(s) that interacts specifically with hFBH1 using the yeast two-hybrid screen. This screen resulted in the isolation of human MAT1 (data not shown), which is a regulatory subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase (29Yee A. Nichols M.A., Wu, L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yee A., Wu, L. Liu L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Hall F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that MAT1 is a direct substrate of SCFhFBH1 E3 ligase activity because a substrate phosphorylation is a prerequisite step prior to recognition by an F-box protein (31Elsasser S. Chi Y. Yang P. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Deshaies R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MAT1 in Cdk-activating kinase may play a role leading to the phosphorylation of a substrate in proximity with hFBH1, thereby facilitating the subsequent ubiquitination of the substrate by the SCFhFBH1complex. In support of this possibility, we failed to detect any ubiquitination of MAT1 (data not shown). These findings raise the possibility that MAT1 may play a direct role in the phosphorylation of hFBH1 instead of acting as a substrate for the E3 ligase activity of the SCFhFBH1 complex. Therefore, the level of hFBH1 itself is likely to be regulated by posttranslational modifications that involve both Cdk-activating kinase and E3 ligase activities. Because it has been reported that F-box proteins can be degraded autocatalytically in a ubiquitination-dependent fashion (33Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the F-box motif of hFBH1 may regulate the level of hFBH1 through auto-ubiquitination during cell cycle progression. However, we were not able to demonstrate this, because the endogenous levels of hFBH1 were too low to be detected with the antibodies that we have (data not shown). We also explored whether hFBH1 is ubiquitinated in vivo. Although the hFBH1 was indeed ubiquitinated in vivo (data not shown), the efficiency of hFBH1 ubiquitination was independent of the intact F-box motif, suggesting that ubiquitination occurred in trans by some other ubiquitinating activity. Reconstitution of the SCF complex containing hFBH1 with the purified proteins will help to address this question.Although the biological function in vivo of hFBH1 is unclear at present, mutational studies of the S. pombe fdh1 + gene (encoding the S. pombe homolog of hFBH1) have provided some clues. When the S. pombe fdh1 + gene was deleted, the cells showed elongated cell morphology and uneven distribution of chromosomes in dividing cells. 2S. H. Lee and Y. S. Seo, unpublished observation. In addition, deletion of either the F-box motif or a single amino acid change in the ATP-binding motif resulted in phenotypes similar to those of the null mutation.2 These observations suggest that both the F-box and ATPase/helicase activity of hFBH1 are required for the physiological function of the enzyme. Currently, both genetic and biochemical studies are underway using an S. pombe model system to delineate the precise biological role of hFBH1. DNA helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that play essential roles in various DNA transactions involved in replication, repair, and recombination (1Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev.

Johnson R.E., Yu, S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A majority of sgs1 and srs2 mutant cells stops dividing stochastically as large budded DNA (9McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such double mutant cells are unable to replicate DNA at restrictive temperature and unable to efficiently transcribe rDNA (8Lee S.K. Johnson R.E., Yu, S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that these two helicases provide a redundant but essential activity for DNA replication and rDNA transcription. Despite well conserved motifs specific to helicase family proteins, there are several proteins for which no helicase activity has been demonstrated, indicating that helicase motifs cannot, without additional information, be used to define a protein as a helicase. For example, the chromatin-remodeling factor SWI2/SNF2 containing these motifs lacks helicase activity, although its ability to hydrolyze ATP is stimulated by DNA (10Richmond E. Peterson C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3685-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Travers A. Cell. 1999; 96: 311-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis provides the energy required to alter protein-DNA structure rather than duplex DNA or RNA structure. This suggests that proteins with helicase motifs may have functions that do not involve unwinding of nucleic acids. As a continued effort to understand the role ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe DNA helicase I that we reported previously (12Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we identified a human homolog of this fission yeast enzyme and named it hFBH1 (humanF-box DNA helicase 1) because it contains a well conserved functional F-box motif (13Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K., Ma, L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In this report, we present data that hFBH1 is not only an ATPase/DNA helicase but also is an F-box protein that can form an SCF (SKP1-CUL1 (Cdc53)-Rbx1-F-box protein) complex with human SKP1 and CUL1. SCF complexes constitute a new class of E31 ligase that plays important roles in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction by catalyzing ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (14Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Winston J.T.

Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of an SCF complex is governed by the interchangeable F-box protein subunit, which recruits a specific set of substrates for ubiquitination to the SCF core complex composed of SKP1, Cdc53, ROC1, and the E2 enzyme Cdc34. The polyubiquitinated proteins are rapidly captured by the 26 S proteasome, an abundant, self-compartmentalized protease particle (19Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). To date, hFBH1 is the first example of an F-box protein that contains intrinsic enzymatic activity, suggesting that a helicase can play a role in a certain aspect of DNA metabolism that requires ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The potential biological role of this interesting human DNA helicase will be discussed. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that hFBH1 is a DNA helicase that translocates in the 3′ to 5′ direction and interacts with SKP1 in a manner that requires a functional F-box motif. Besides, hFBH1 interacted with CUL1/ROC1 and formed a SCF complex that contained all known four subunits (SKP1, hFBH1, CUL1, and ROC1). Moreover, SCFhFBH1 displayed ubiquitin ligase activity in a F-box motif-dependent fashion. The polyubiquitination activity of the SCFhFBH1 complex was dependent upon functional E1 and E2 enzymes, demonstrating that the complex interacts with the ubiquitination machinery. Our study showed that hFBH1 is the first example of an F-box protein that harbors an intrinsic enzymatic activity, catalyzing a helicase reaction. In addition, hFBH1 is the first F-box protein implicated in nucleic acid metabolism. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that the role of hFBH1 is most likely to recruit a target protein, most likely involved in some aspect of DNA metabolism, to the protein degradation pathway. Thus, a protein involved in DNA metabolism would be marked by hFBH1 for degradation via the highly regulated ubiquitin degradation pathway.As an initial attempt to evaluate the role of the F-box motif of the enzyme in this regard, we decided to identify a protein(s) that interacts specifically with hFBH1 using the yeast two-hybrid screen. This screen resulted in the isolation of human MAT1 (data not shown), which is a regulatory subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase (29Yee A. Nichols M.A., Wu, L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yee A., Wu, L. Liu L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Hall F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that MAT1 is a direct substrate of SCFhFBH1 E3 ligase activity because a substrate phosphorylation is a prerequisite step prior to recognition by an F-box protein (31Elsasser S. Chi Y. Yang P. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Deshaies R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MAT1 in Cdk-activating kinase may play a role leading to the phosphorylation of a substrate in proximity with hFBH1, thereby facilitating the subsequent ubiquitination of the substrate by the SCFhFBH1complex. In support of this possibility, we failed to detect any ubiquitination of MAT1 (data not shown). These findings raise the possibility that MAT1 may play a direct role in the phosphorylation of hFBH1 instead of acting as a substrate for the E3 ligase activity of the SCFhFBH1 complex. Therefore, the level of hFBH1 itself is likely to be regulated by posttranslational modifications that involve both Cdk-activating kinase and E3 ligase activities. Because it has been reported that F-box proteins can be degraded autocatalytically in a ubiquitination-dependent fashion (33Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the F-box motif of hFBH1 may regulate the level of hFBH1 through auto-ubiquitination during cell cycle progression. However, we were not able to demonstrate this, because the endogenous levels of hFBH1 were too low to be detected with the antibodies that we have (data not shown). We also explored whether hFBH1 is ubiquitinated in vivo. Although the hFBH1 was indeed ubiquitinated in vivo (data not shown), the efficiency of hFBH1 ubiquitination was independent of the intact F-box motif, suggesting that ubiquitination occurred in trans by some other ubiquitinating activity. Reconstitution of the SCF complex containing hFBH1 with the purified proteins will help to address this question.Although the biological function in vivo of hFBH1 is unclear at present, mutational studies of the S. pombe fdh1 + gene (encoding the S. pombe homolog of hFBH1) have provided some clues. When the S. pombe fdh1 + gene was deleted, the cells showed elongated cell morphology and uneven distribution of chromosomes in dividing cells. 2S. H. Lee and Y. S. Seo, unpublished observation. In addition, deletion of either the F-box motif or a single amino acid change in the ATP-binding motif resulted in phenotypes similar to those of the null mutation.2 These observations suggest that both the F-box and ATPase/helicase activity of hFBH1 are required for the physiological function of the enzyme. Currently, both genetic and biochemical studies are underway using an S. pombe model system to delineate the precise biological role of hFBH1.

However, 1,25(OH)2D3 failed to reduce the abundance of its mRNA or its encoded protein in human keratinocytes.

Thus, the apparent reduction in 1α-hydroxylase activity induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 is due to increased catabolism of both substrate and product by the 24-hydroxylase.

It has been postulated that the conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 is inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3 itself, through inhibition of 1α-hydroxylase gene expression (8Bikle D.D. Nemanic M.K. Gee E.

However, recent studies (17Schuessler M. Astecker N. Herzig G. Vorisek G. Schuster I. Steroids. 2001; 66: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Schuster I. Egger H. Astecker N. Herzig G. Schussler M. Vorisek G. Steroids. 2001; 66: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have suggested that 1,25(OH)2D3 may not regulate the 1α-hydroxylase by such a mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 on the abundance of 1α-hydroxylase mRNA and protein in cultured normal human keratinocytes compared with the apparent activity of the 1α-hydroxylase under conditions in which 24-hydroxylase was inhibited. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 did not inhibit 1α-hydroxylase enzyme activity or the abundance of its mRNA or protein. Rather, the feedback regulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 involves its catabolism by 24-hydroxylase induction instead of its synthesis by 1α-hydroxylase. Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal human foreskins and grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as previously described (19Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hincenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskins by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 4 °C, overnight), and primary cultures were established in KGM containing 0.07 mmcalcium. First and second passage keratinocytes were plated with KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium and used in the subsequent experiments described. To measure 1α-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase activities, we used the method of Bikle et al. (8Bikle D.D. Nemanic M.K. Gee E. Elias P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.05 μCi of [3H]25(OH)D3 or [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 (AmershamBiosciences) was added to cultured normal human keratinocytes in 6-well plates. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of methanol. Both cells and medium were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.G. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). Metabolites in the chloroform extract were separated and quantitated by a Waters high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) linked to a Flow Scintillation Analyzer (Packard, Meriden, CT). HPLC utilized a DuPont Zorbax Sil column (4.6 × 25 cm) and a non-linear concave gradient from 97:3 to 90:10 hexane:isopropanol for 1α-hydroxylated steroids or 90:10 hexane:isopropanol for 24-hydroxylated steroids. Output was monitored by radioactivity with a Flow Scintillation Analyzer (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Chemically synthesized standards were used to determine the elution volumes of the metabolites. Total RNA was isolated from the keratinocytes using the STAT-60™ kit (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX), according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The isolated RNA (20 mg per lane) was electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+;Amersham Biosciences) using PosiBlot 30–30 Pressure Blotter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and immobilized by baking the membrane at 80 °C for 2 h. Complementary DNA probes for human 1α-hydroxylase (4Fu G.K. Lin D. Zhang M.Y.H. Bikle D.D. Shackleton C.H.L. Miller W.L. Portale A.A. Mol.

The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 20 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA with the 32P-labeled human 1α-hydroxylase and involucrin cDNAs. After hybridization at 65 °C overnight, the membrane was washed in solutions with decreasing ionic strength and increasing temperature to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The [32P]cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by exposing to x-ray film. The 18 S ribosomal RNA on the same RNA blot hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA for 18 S RNA was used as a control. Keratinocytes were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin for 5 min. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, incubated on ice for 15 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of the lysate was measured by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein were then electrophoresed through 7.5% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 30 min and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 micron, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in an electroblotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol) at 130 V for 2 h. After incubation in blocking buffer (100 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 5% non-fat milk, and 0.5% Tween 20), the blot was incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. 1α-hydroxylase protein was detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human antibody (21Zhang M.Y.H.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:20,000 in blocking buffer. Involucrin protein was detected with a monoclonal mouse anti-human involucrin antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer. After washes in the blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate anti-IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in the blocking buffer. After a second series of washes, bound antibody complexes were visualized using the SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent Kit (Pierce) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film. To determine the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to inhibit its own production, we incubated keratinocytes overnight with varying concentrations (from 10−12 to 10−8m) of 1,25(OH)2D3 and measured the production of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3, [3H]24,25(OH)2D3, and [3H]1,24,25(OH)2D3 from [3H]25(OH)2D3 at 16 h later. The apparent production of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 from [3H]25(OH)D3 in keratinocytes was dramatically reduced by a pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.1). This effect was dose-dependent with essentially no [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 recoverable from keratinocytes preincubated with 10−8m1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, the concentrations of [3H]24,25(OH)2D3 and [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3 increased in response to pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. The increase in [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3was biphasic with maximal concentration of 1,24,25(OH)3D3 observed in keratinocytes pretreated with 10−10m1,25(OH)2D3. These results indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3inhibited 1α-hydroxylase activity and stimulated 24-hydroxylase activity. We then determined whether the abundances of 1α-hydroxylase mRNA and protein were regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3. A 2.4-kb mRNA transcript and a 56-kDa protein were detected by Northern and Western analysis, respectively. The levels of 1α-hydroxylase mRNA and its protein in human keratinocytes were not regulated by 10−11 to 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, the level of mRNA and protein for involucrin (22Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), a marker for keratinocyte differentiation and analyzed on the same blots, were stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.2, A and B). These data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 does not regulate 1α-hydroxylase mRNA or protein expression. These results led us to hypothesize that the apparent inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D3 production by 1,25(OH)2D3 is due to increased catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 via induction of the 24-hydroxylase. To test this hypothesis, we incubated human keratinocytes with [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 for 1 h after exposing them to 10−8m1,25(OH)2D3 for 16 h. The results showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly enhanced the ability of keratinocytes to metabolize [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 to both [3H]1α,23(S),25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3and [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3. Only 20% of the added [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 was recovered in the cells preincubated with 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas 60% of the added [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 was recovered in the cells pretreated with vehicle (Fig.3). These data demonstrate that exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates the catabolism of endogenously produced 1,25(OH)2D3 in human keratinocytes. To test this hypothesis further, we examined the effect of an inhibitor of the 24-hydroxylase (VID400) (18Schuster I. Egger H. Astecker N. Herzig G. Schussler M. Vorisek G. Steroids. 2001; 66: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Schuster I. Egger H. Bikle D.D. Herzig G. Reddy G.S. Stuetz A. Stuetz P. Vorisek G. Steroids. 2001; 66: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) on 1α-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase activities in keratinocytes. Cells were preincubated overnight with either 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle, and the conversion of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 to [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3 or [3H]25(OH)D3 to [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 was measured in the absence or presence of 25, 50, 100, and 200 nm VID400. VID400 inhibited 24-hydroxyalse activity in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition at 200 nm (Fig. 4 A). However, 200 nm VID400 inhibited 1α-hydroxylase activity by more than 30% (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, 100 nmVID400 inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity by more than 90% (Fig.4 A) but only slightly inhibited 1α-hydroxylase activity (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we used 100 nm VID400 to determine the degree to which induction of 24-hydroxylation contributed to the apparent inhibition of 1α-hydroxylase activity by 1,25(OH)2D3. Keratinocytes were preincubated for 24 h with 1,25(OH)2D3, and the conversion of [3H]25(OH)D3 to [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 was measured with and without the presence of VID400. Preincubation with 10−9m 1,25(OH)2D3reduced the apparent 1α-hydroxylase activity by 90%. However, addition of 100 nm VID400 restored most of the apparent reduction in 1α-hydroxylase activity (Fig.5). When the concentration of VID400 was increased to 200 nm, no reduction in apparent 1α-hydroxylase activity was observed in the cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, although basal activity was reduced (data not shown). In agreement with recent data (18Schuster I. Egger H. Astecker N. Herzig G. Schussler M. Vorisek G. Steroids. 2001; 66: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the 1α-hydroxylase activity is not regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3. The apparent reduction in 1,25(OH)2D3 production is due to increased catabolism of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 and [3H]25(OH)D3 via the 24-hydroxylase, induced by 1,25(OH)2D3.Figure 4The effect of VID400 on 24-hydroxylase and 1α-hydroxylase activities. To assess the effect of VID400 on 24-hydroxylase (A) and 1α-hydroxylase (B) activities, second passage keratinocytes were plated in 6-well plates with KGM plus 0.03 mm calcium at 70–80% confluency. After treatment overnight with 1,25(OH)2D3 at 10−9m(for the 24-hydroxylase assay) or without 1,25(OH)2D3 (for the 1α-hydroxylase assay), cells were washed and incubated for 15 min either with vehicle (Me2SO) or with VID400 at the concentrations indicated. Then, cells were incubated for 1 h with 0.05 μCi of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 or [3H]25(OH)D3. Cells were harvested, and the relative levels of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 and [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3 or [3H]25(OH)D3 and [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 were measured using HPLC. The conversion rates of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 to [3H]1,24,25(OH)3D3 and [3H]25(OH)D3 to [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 representing 24-hydroxylase and 1α-hydroxylase activity, respectively, were calculated.

Transcription of the gene encoding 24-hydroxylase is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, and the promoter of this gene contains two vitamin D-responsive elements (24Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) that mediate the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce this gene in keratinocytes (25Sherwood L.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 1601-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and other cells. Studies purporting to demonstrate negative regulation of 1α-hydroxylase by 1,25(OH)2D3 need to be reconsidered in light of our observations. For example, mice lacking the vitamin D receptor have increased amounts of 1α-hydroxylase mRNA (3Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Sato T. Kobori M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Science. 1997; 277: 1827-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), suggesting a genomic mechanism of regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3. However, parathyroid hormone can induce transcription of the gene for 1α-hydroxylase (26Kong X.F. Zhu X.H. Pei Y.L. Jackson D.M. Holick M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and parathyroid hormone is quite elevated in mice lacking the vitamin D receptor. Thus, increased serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone, rather than decreased 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genomic activity, could well be responsible for the increased abundance of 1α-hydroxylase mRNA in these animals. The present data support the conclusion that the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 levels by 1,25(OH)2D3 itself involves induction of its catabolism rather than inhibition of its production. This mechanism appears to be a unique mode for autoregulation of steroid hormone synthesis. We thank Dr. Anton Stuetz, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, for the gift of VID400."

Despite our understanding of the structural changes, which occur upon Cdk/cyclin formation and activation, little is known about the dynamics of the molecular events involved. We have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2/cyclin A complex formation and activation at the molecular and dynamic level by rapid kinetics and demonstrate here that it is a two-step process. The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of Cdk2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin to yield an intermediate complex in which the threonine in the T-loop is not accessible for phosphorylation. Additional contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin then induce the isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form by promoting the exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by CAK and the formation of the substrate binding site.

The activation of monomeric Cdk subunits involves the binding of a cyclin partner, which confers basal kinase activity to the Cdk/cyclin complex and enables subsequent phosphorylation of the Cdk on a conserved threonine in the activation loop (Thr160 in Cdk2), thereby finally converting the complex into a fully active form (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 2Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). The determination of the structure of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Cdk2/cyclin A complexes has revealed that cyclin binding induces conformational changes within Cdk2 that are critical for its activation (3Pavletich N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 4Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P.

The most significant feature is the reconfiguration of the ATP binding site into a conformation that favors its nucleophilic attack by the substrate and brings Glu51 together with Lys33and Asp145 for catalysis. In addition, cyclin binding induces a positional switch of the T-loop by 20 Å, which opens the catalytic cleft, affects the orientation of the putative substrate binding site of Cdk2, and leads to appropriate exposure of Thr160. Subsequent phosphorylation of Thr160 by Cdk7/cyclin H (CAK) induces further conformational changes in the T-loop and in the C-terminal lobe of Cdk2 and stabilizes the substrate binding site (5Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 6Brown N., R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J. Johnson L.N. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), Cdk2/cyclin M (8Card G.L. Knowles P. Laman H. Jones N. McDonald N.Q.

Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggest that interactions involving the C-lobe of Cdks play an important role in activation and regulation of the latter. Although the structural changes involved in Cdk/cyclin formation and activation have been identified, the mechanism and dynamics of the molecular events underlying this process are still poorly understood. We have characterized the process of Cdk/cyclin complex formation at the molecular and dynamic level (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Morris C.M. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14257-14266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To dissect this mechanism in this work, we have combined transient kinetics, fluorescence spectroscopy, and directed mutagenesis. We demonstrate here that the formation of Cdk/cyclin complexes is a two-step process involving the initial rapid association of the two subunits into a non-phosphorylatable intermediate followed by a conformational change in the C-lobe of the Cdk, which is selective for its natural cyclin and which is critical for conversion of the complex into a fully mature and activable form. Cdks and cyclins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant forms of GST-Cdk2 (Cdk2I49A, Cdk2R50A, Cdk2K278A, and Cdk2Y179A) were purified to homogeneity using a glutathione-Sepharose column followed by the removal of the GST tag with thrombin and further purification by size-exclusion chromatography. Cdk2 and Cdc2 phosphorylation on Thr160 was performed with GST-Civ-1 in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm ATP for 1 h at 25 °C. GST-Civ-1 was then removed by chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column, and phosphorylated Cdks were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The phosphorylation of Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin B complexes was performed with active Cdk7/cyclin H expressed in baculovirus. Complexes were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using a PTI spectrofluorometer with a spectral bandpass of 2 and 8 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the different Cdks (0.1–1.0 μm protein) was measured and corrected as described previously (11Morris C.M. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14257-14266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP was monitored by following the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Cdks at 340 nm upon excitation at 295 nm. The affinities between Cdks and cyclins were measured by fluorescence titration of Cdk/N-methylanthraniloyl-ATP (mant-ATP) complexes with different cyclin concentrations as described previously (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Titration curve fitting was accomplished with a standard quadratic equation using the Grafit program (Erithacus Software Ltd) as described previously (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C on a SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow apparatus (High-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, England). The kinetics of formation of Cdk/cyclin complexes were performed by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of mant-ATP through a filter with a cut-off at 408 nm after excitation at 350 nm. Data collection and primary analysis were performed with the package from High-Tech Scientific, and secondary analysis was performed with the Grafit program using a non-linear square procedure to a single exponential as described in Equation 1 F=Fo+A(1−exp(−kobs1t))Equation 1 or double exponential as described in Equation 2F=Fo+A(1−exp(−kobs1t))+B(1−exp(−kobs2t))Equation 2 where F is the fluorescence at time t,F o is the fluorescence intensity at the beginning of the experiment, A and k obs1 are the amplitude and the observed rate constant for the first kinetic step, respectively, and B and k obs2 are the amplitude and the observed rate constant for the second kinetic step. To determine the dissociation constants, the observed rate constants were analyzed using the equation k obs1 =k 1[cyclin] + k −1. Radioactive analytical kinase reactions were performed as described previously (12Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Lawrie A. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L. Endicott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using histone H1 as a substrate. The reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C and quenched by the addition of EDTA. Kinase assays were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels followed by autoradiography. mant-ATP is a powerful tool to monitor the conformational changes that occur in the catalytic site of Cdks upon the binding of cyclin or p13suc1 (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Morris C.M. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14257-14266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The net increase in the fluorescence of mant-ATP observed upon the binding of a cyclin to a Cdk offers a powerful means to investigate the presteady-state kinetics of the formation of different Cdk/cyclin complexes. The different proteins (Cdks and cyclins) were purified to homogeneity (Fig.1 A), and their kinetics of association were analyzed using changes in mant-ATP fluorescence. We found that the formation of Cdk2/cyclin A complexes follows a double exponential consisting of a rapid first phase and a slow second phase (Fig. 1 B). If we assume that we are dealing with a two-step mechanism (Scheme FS1), the overall dissociation constant can be described as K d =K 1 K 2/(1 +K 2), where K 1 =k −1/k 1 andK 2 =k −2/k 2.Figure FS1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) That the two steps are very different in a time scale allows the analysis of each step independently. The dependence of each step on the concentration of cyclin A was investigated in pseudo-first order conditions using a fixed concentration of 100 nm Cdk2. The pseudo-first order rate constant (k obs1) for the first phase increased linearly with the concentration of cyclin A (Fig.1 C). To determine the dissociation constant, the observed rate constants were plotted against the concentration of cyclins, and an association rate constant (k 1) of 1.9 × 107m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant (k −1) of 25 s−1 were calculated from the slope and the intercept, respectively. Using these first rate constants, the equilibrium constant can be calculated to 1.3 μm. However, this value is 27-fold greater than that determined by direct titration under similar conditions (48 nm) (for review see Ref. 10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This discrepancy suggests that a simple one-step process is not sufficient to describe this mechanism. In contrast to the first step, the rate constant for the second step k obs2 (2.5 s−1) is not dependent on the concentration of cyclin A.

The observed rate constants k obs2 were fitted according to a double exponential model and are a function of bothk 2 and k −2 . We next investigated the dependence of each step on the specificity of the cyclin partner. The term “unusual” was used arbitrarily to describe the formation of Cdk/cyclin complexes other than those isolated in vivo. We have previously shown that unusual cyclin partners can form stable complexes with Cdksin vitro with 25-fold lower affinity than “natural” cyclin partners (10Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinetics of association between Cdk2 and an unusual cyclin partner, cyclin H, also reflected a double exponential process with a rapid first step dependent on the concentration of cyclin H. The calculated association rate (k 1 = 1.2 × 107m−1 s−1) and dissociation rate (k −1 = 24 s−1) are not significantly different from the values obtained for cyclin A. In contrast, the observed rate constant of the second step, corresponding to the conformational change of the preformed Cdk2/cyclin H complex, was 22-fold lower (k obs2 = 0.11 s−1) compared with that of Cdk2/Cyclin A. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the formation of Cdk/cyclin complexes occurs in a characteristic two-step fashion involving a rapid initial association step followed by a slow conformational change within the preformed Cdk/cyclin complex, which is directly dependent on the nature of the cyclin. We have already reported that the phosphorylation of Thr160 in the T-loop of Cdk2 does not dramatically affect the binding of cyclin A (12Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Lawrie A. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L. Endicott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) but seems to be essential for the stabilization of other Cdk/cyclin complexes (13Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Similarly, when we measured the kinetics of association of phosphorylated Cdks with natural cyclin partners, we did not observe significant differences compared with their unphosphorylated counterparts (Fig. 1 C and Table I). However, we did observe a 1.5-fold faster conformational step when Cdk2 was phosphorylated, suggesting that contacts between cyclin A and the T-loop are in part involved in the conformational change in agreement with the fact that the phosphorylation of the T-loop increases its flexibility (12Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Lawrie A. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L. Endicott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Notably, in the case of unusual cyclin H, this second step was affected by the phosphorylation of Thr160 up to 3.2-fold compared with the corresponding unphosphorylated complex and >100-fold when compared with p160Cdk2/cyclin A (k obs2 = 0.034 s−1) (Table I). This result suggests that the interaction between the cyclin and the T-loop must be at least in part involved in the conformational change occurring during the second step, and that phosphorylation may control the selectivity for the cyclin partner. The structure of Cdk2/cyclin A complex reveals that the main structural motifs involved in the subunit interface are the PSTAIRE-containing α1-helix of Cdk2 and the α3, α4, and α5-helices in the first helical fold of cyclin A (4Jeffrey P.D.

Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The PSTAIRE motif is essential for kinase activity. The mutations in this domain have been shown to be lethal, leading to cell cycle arrest or to an inability to rescue temperature-sensitive mutants in yeast (14Endicott J. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the PSTAIRE domain in the kinetics of Cdk2/cyclin A formation, we designed two mutants of Cdk2, Ile49Ala and Arg50Ala. These two residues are directly involved in the interaction with cyclin A and are located in the hydrophobic pocket interacting with the side chains of Lys263, Phe267, Leu299, Leu306, and Lys266. Moreover, Arg50is also involved in the stabilization of phosphorylated Thr160. The mutations Ile49Ala and Arg50Ala reduced the affinity of Cdk2 for ATP by a factor of 3–4 compared with wild-type Cdk2 (K d = 0.18 μm) with dissociation constants of 0.60 and 0.72 μm for Cdk2I49A and Cdk2R50A, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, both mutations dramatically affected the binding of cyclin A to Cdk2 compared with wild-type Cdk2 (K d = 48 nm) with dissociation constant values of 1.2 and 1.8 μm for Cdk2R50A and Cdk2I49A, respectively. The formation of Cdk2I49A/cyclin A and of Cdk2R50A/cyclin A followed single exponential kinetics (Fig. 3 A and Table I). Both mutations dramatically reduced the rate of the initial association between cyclin A and Cdk2 and abolished the subsequent conformational step. The association rate (k 1) was reduced to 9.1 × 105 and 6.2 × 105m−1 s−1, and the dissociation rate (k −1) was reduced to 0.82 and 0.89 s−1 for Cdk2I49A and Cdk2R50A, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these values lead to 1/K 1 values of 0.90 μm for Cdk2I49A/cyclin A and 1.36 μm for Cdk2R50A/cyclin A, similar to those calculated from the steady-state experiments. The finding that both association and dissociation rates are affected by the mutations Ile49Alaand Arg50Ala reveals that the PSTAIRE helix plays a major role in the initial recognition between a Cdk and a cyclin partner.Figure 3Kinetics of cyclin A association with mutants of Cdk2.

Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). To determine the impact of these protein/protein contacts in the formation of active Cdk2/cyclin A, two mutations, Y179A and K278A, were introduced into the C-terminal lobe of Cdk2. These mutations did not affect the affinity for ATP (Fig. 2 A) but reduced the affinity of the Cdk for its cyclin partner 3–4-fold (Fig.2 B) with K d values for cyclin A of 120 nm for Cdk2Y179A and 198 nm for Cdk2K278A. Stopped-flow experiments revealed that these mutations in the C-lobe did not modify the rate of the initial Cdk2/cyclin A interaction (Fig. 3 B) but dramatically reduced the rate of the conformational step with k obs2values of 0.024 s−1 for Cdk2Y179A and 0.009 s−1 for Cdk2K278A (Fig. 3 A and Table I). We further characterized Cdk2Y179A/cyclin A and Cdk2K278A/cyclin A complexes from a biochemical point of view. We first examined their ability to be phosphorylated by yeast Civ-1, which preferentially phosphorylates monomeric Cdk2 (15Thuret J.Y. Valay J-G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and by CAK, which requires cyclin binding to the Cdk2 (12Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Lawrie A. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L. Endicott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both mutants were phosphorylated by Civ-1 in the monomeric form to the same extent as wild-type Cdk2 (Fig.4 B). In contrast, CAK was unable to phosphorylate Cdk2Y179A/cyclin A, and only a very weak phosphorylation of Cdk2K278A/cyclin A was detected (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that the mutations in the C-terminal lobe of Cdk2 affect the proper binding of the cyclin and inhibit the positional switch of the T-loop to expose Thr160 for phosphorylation by Cdk7/cyclin H. The crystal structure of phosphorylated Cdk2/cyclin A reveals three key Arg residues (Arg50, Arg150, and Arg126), which form hydrogen bonds with the three oxygens of the phosphate of phosphorylated Thr160. In addition, Tyr179 interacts with Arg126 and has been shown to be involved in the stabilization of the T-loop following phosphorylation by CAK (5Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutation of Tyr179 directly affects the orientation of the T-loop. In the case of the Cdk2K278A mutant, no direct contacts with the T-loop have been described, and this mutation may directly affect the conformational change induced upon interaction with cyclin A. Lys278 was found to form a side-chain hydrogen bond at the Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdk2/cyclin M interface with residues Asp181 and Tyr178 in the cyclins (4Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 8Card G.L. Knowles P. Laman H. Jones N. McDonald N.Q. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2877-2888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the finding that the mutation of Ser277Asp in Xenopus Cdc2 compensates for a Thr161Ala mutation and induce oocyte maturation (16Pichkam K.M. Donoghue D. J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and that the mutation Ala280Asn in Xenopus Cdk2 abolishes the binding of cyclin A (17Goda T. Funakoshi M Suhara H. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15415-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformation of the C-lobe is important to maintain the structure of the activation loop in Xenopus Cdc2 and Cdk2. The recent structure of the γ-Herpesvirus cyclin M in complex with Cdk2 reveals that the stability of the complex is increased compared with that of Cdk2/cyclin A because of extended contacts between the C-lobe of Cdk2 and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin. Taken together, these data suggest that the contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and α-N-terminal helix of the cyclin promote exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation. We next examined the kinase activity of these mutants (Fig.4 A). When phosphorylated by Civ-1 prior to association with cyclin A, both Cdk2Y179A and Cdk2K278Aexhibited very low kinase activity ∼80% lower than that of Cdk2/cyclin A phosphorylated by Civ-1 in the same conditions. Interestingly, this low level of kinase activity was similar to that obtained for unusual cyclin partners like cyclin H, suggesting that the conformational change brought about through contacts between the C-lobe of Cdk2 and the N-terminal helix of cyclin A is required for robust kinase activity of phosphorylated Cdk2. In agreement with our results, the mutation of Arg283 in Cdc28 (Arg274 in Cdk2) has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest with no detectable kinase activity (18Lörincz A.T. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4099-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the stabilization of the C-lobe and the T-loop was recently suggested to be required for catalysis and substrate binding based on the crystal structures of Cdk2/cyclin A/substrate peptide (6Brown N., R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and of the Cdk2/KAP complex (9Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N. Noble M.E.M. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In particular, the Cdk2/KAP complex shows that phosphatase KAP only interacts with the C-lobe of Cdk2 and maintains it in an active conformation in the absence of cyclin A (9Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N. Noble M.E.M. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of Cdk/cyclin complexes suggest that Cdk regulation is mainly associated with conformational changes (3Pavletich N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2/cyclin A complex formation and activation by rapid kinetics and have demonstrated that it is a sequential two-step process involving an initial rapid association between the two subunits to yield a non-phosphorylatable intermediate followed by a slow critical isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form. Taking together our kinetic results and the crystal structures of Cdk2/cyclin A, we now propose a model to describe the mechanism of Cdk/cyclin complex activation (Scheme FS1 and Fig. 5). (i) The initial step involves rapid association of the Cdk/cyclin complex through the interaction of the PSTAIRE helix of the Cdk and the α3 and α5-helices of cyclin, irrespective of the cyclin and the Cdk type, and is responsible from the structural point of view for the rotation of the PSTAIRE helix and the reorganization of the ATP binding site. At this stage, the complex is still in a “non-activable” conformation. (ii) The second step corresponds to the slow isomerization of the Cdk/Cyclin complex and involves the C-lobe and the T-loop of the Cdk as well as the N-terminal helix of cyclin A. This conformational change constitutes the rate-limiting step for the activation of the Cdk, exposes the T-loop for phosphorylation, and enables full kinase activity through the formation of the substrate binding site. Moreover, this conformational change constitutes a critical event, which is selective for the cyclin partner and activation of specific natural Cdk/cyclin complexes. The specificity of Cdk/cyclin partnerships at a particular stage of the cell cycle is in part regulated by coincidental temporal expression and degradation patterns of Cdks and cyclins. However, many biological situations suggest that additional mechanisms that prevent temporally inappropriate activation of the Cdk kinases are likely to exist. Based on the kinetic study described here, we propose that the selectivity of a Cdk for a natural cyclin partner in vivo may be at least in part controlled by the second step of the association mechanism, the conformational switch that is essential for in vivo kinase activation. Our results reveal that the C-lobe of the Cdk plays an essential role in the regulation and activation of Cdk/cyclin complexes. In agreement with our finding, the recent determination of the structures of Cdk6/cyclin K and Cdk2/cyclin M has provided structural evidence that contacts between the C-lobe and the T-loop of the Cdks play a central role in the activation and regulation of Cdk/cyclin complexes (7Jeffrey P.D. Tong L. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Card G.L. Knowles P. Laman H. Jones N. McDonald N.Q. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2877-2888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the role of the C-lobe of Cdks in their regulation is also suggested from the crystal structures of Cdks with Cks subunits (19Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and with the protein phosphatase KAP (9Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N. Noble M.E.M. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, the determination of the crystal structures of Cdk6/p16, Cdk6/p19, and Cdk6/cyclin K/p18 complexes has led to a structural model of Cdk/cyclin inhibition, which highlights the importance of structural changes in the C-lobe of the Cdk. Indeed, these small protein inhibitors have been shown to interact with both the C- and N-lobes of Cdk2, thereby changing their alignments, disrupting the contacts between the C-lobe of Cdk6 and the cyclin, and also promoting changes in the T-loop (7Jeffrey P.D.

Pancreatic CEase once secreted into the duodenum and activated by primary bile salts catalyzes the hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of substrates including cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerides, phospholipids, and esters of lipid-soluble vitamins (1Wang C.-S.

Most probably, the role of CEase extends beyond that of simply hydrolyzing dietary lipids. Circulating CEase may function as a cholesterol transfer protein (3Myers-Payne S.C. Hui D.Y. Brockman H.L. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and may have a deleterious effect in atherosclerosis processes, because it has been reported to convert the larger and less atherogenic low density lipoprotein to the smaller and more atherogenic low density lipoprotein subspecies (4Brodt-Eppley J. White P. Jenkins S. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the role of plasmatic CEase in atherogenesis and the relationship of the enzyme to various pathological conditions are not clearly established so far (2Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CEase belongs to the α/β-hydrolase fold family of proteins whose members, mostly serine esterases, share secondary and tertiary structural features (5Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Reington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 6Cygler M.

Ester hydrolysis is catalyzed by the operation of a catalytic triad (Ser-194, His-435, and Asp-320 in the case of CEase numbered for the rat enzyme). This triad is stereochemically convergent with catalytic triads of serine proteases, and like serine proteases, serine esterases of the α/β-hydrolase fold family use an acylation-deacylation mechanism. Both the acylation and deacylation stages transit tetrahedral intermediates that are stabilized by a tripartite oxanion hole (5Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M.

In recent years, much attention has focused on the inhibition of CEase as a potential target particularly for the development of hypocholesterolemic agents. Sharing a common mechanism for substrate hydrolysis, CEase and serine proteases might be expected to be inhibited by the same classes of mechanism-based inhibitors that indeed have been demonstrated for boronic and borinic acids, aryl haloketones, aryl phosphates and phosphonates, and carbamates (8Feaster S.R.

Baker N. Hui D.Y. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16723-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inhibition occurs because of rapid carbamylation of the active site serine followed by slow decarbamylation. Biphasic time courses reflect the progressive loss of enzyme activity in a nonlinear phase and a subsequent steady-state phase of the reaction. From their kinetic mechanism, such inhibitors are best described as pseudo-substrate inhibitors or as alternate substrate inhibitors (8Feaster S.R. Quinn D.M.

This concept has found less attention for the development of CEase inhibitors. However, 6-chloro-2-pyrones, representatives of a known class of mechanism-based inhibitors of serine proteases, have recently been described as potent CEase inhibitors (19Deck L.M. Baca M.L. Salas S.L. Hunsacker L.A. Vander Jagt D.L. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although having the potential to act as alternate substrates or suicide inhibitors, competitive inhibition of CEase was postulated. In the kinetic study presented in this paper, fused 1,3-oxazin-4-ones and 1,3-thiazin-4-ones were investigated as inhibitors of CEase. The acylation-deacylation mechanism by which 3,1-benzoxazin-4-ones and analogous thieno[1,3]oxazin-4-ones interact with various serine proteases is well documented (18Krantz A. Spencer R.W. Tam T.F.

Their potency to inhibit serine proteases derives from the ratio of the acylation and deacylation rates. So far, these alternate substrate inhibitors of serine proteases have not been investigated as inhibitors of CEase. The aim of this study was (i) characterization of fused 1,3-oxazin-4-ones and 1,3-thiazin-4-ones as inhibitors of CEase, (ii) investigation of a CEase-catalyzed turnover of these heterocyclic compounds, and (iii) examination to what extent inhibitory potency can be concluded from the kinetic parameters of the enzyme-catalyzed conversion. CEase from bovine pancreas (41 units/mg), sodium taurocholate (TC), and p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) were obtained from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany). Compounds 1–6 and 8 were prepared as described elsewhere (22Gütschow M. Neumann U. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Gütschow M. Kuerschner L.

Chem. 1999; 64: 5109-5115Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The synthesis and structural elucidation of compound 7 was done using general methods and instruments as reported previously (22Gütschow M. Neumann U. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric assays were done on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 16 UV-visible spectrophotometer with a cell holder equipped with a constant temperature water bath. Incubation experiments were performed using an Eppendorf thermomixer comfort. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Bischoff chromatograph 2200 with an UV detector Lambda 1000. A 5-μm Phenomenex Jupiter 250 × 4.6-mm column was used at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Alkaline hydrolysis of the compounds was followed spectrophotometrically at a fixed wavelength (compound 1 = 348 nm; compounds2–4 = 335 nm; and compounds 5 and6 = 385 nm) by monitoring the disappearance of the compounds at 25 °C in 50 mm CAPS, pH 9.5, for compound1 and pH 11.25 for all other compounds, respectively. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared in Me2SO. The final inhibitor concentration was 20 μm, and the final Me2SO concentration was 5%. The reactions were monitored for at least two half-lives. For compounds 5 and6 (5 μm each), a final Me2SO concentration of 15% was used, and reactions were followed for 50 h. Curves were analyzed as first-order reactions. CEase inhibition was assayed spectrophometrically (9Feaster S.R. Lee K. Baker N. Hui D.Y. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16723-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,26Hosie L. Sutton L.D. Quinn D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 260-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Assay buffer was 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. A stock solution of CEase (2.44 mg/ml) was prepared with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, freshly diluted with the same buffer and kept at 0 °C. TC (12 mm) was dissolved in assay buffer and kept at 0 °C. Stock solutions of pNPB and of the inhibitors were prepared in acetonitrile. Into a cuvette containing 430 μl of assay buffer, 500 μl of TC solution, 40 μl of acetonitrile, 10 μl of pNPB solution, and 10 μl of an inhibitor solution were added and thoroughly mixed. After incubation for 2 min at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of the enzyme solution. It was mixed again, and the reaction was monitored 1 min after the addition of the enzyme. Concentrations were as follows: 200 μm pNPB, 6 mm TC, 19.5 ng/ml CEase, 6% acetonitrile, and different inhibitor concentrations. Uninhibited enzyme activity was determined by adding acetonitrile instead of the inhibitor solution. The determination of the Michaelis-Menten constant and maximum velocity for the substrate pNPB was done at eight different pNPB concentrations to result in values of K m S = 110 ± 11 μm and V maxS = 5.09 ± 0.15 μm/min, respectively. A molar extinction coefficient, ε = 7.67 mm−1 cm−1, forp-nitrophenol at pH 7.0 was used. The rates of CEase-catalyzed pNPB hydrolysis were corrected by those of the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of pNPB as determined by using 10 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, instead of the enzyme solution. Progress curves were monitored at 405 nm over 5 min, fitted, and analyzed as described below. Similarly, the inhibition of CEase by compound 3 was studied in the presence of different substrate concentrations. The enzymatic conversion of the compounds was followed spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. Into a cuvette containing assay buffer, 500 μl of TC solution, 50 μl of acetonitrile, and 10 μl of an inhibitor solution were added, thoroughly mixed, and incubated for 2 min at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding a volume (9–12 μl) of an enzyme solution (122 μg/ml). This volume was adjusted by the determination of a 1:6250 dilution that converts pNPB (200 μm) with a rate of 1.8 μm/min. The entire volume was 1 ml containing the following concentrations: 6 mm TC, CEase (adjusted activity), 6% acetonitrile, and 10–25 μm inhibitor. The reactions were analyzed by monitoring UV-visible spectra in fixed time intervals or by following the time course at a fixed wavelength. For the latter experiments, the absorption maxima of the compounds were used. The molar extinction coefficient for each analyzed compound at the corresponding wavelength was determined separately in triplicate experiments. Control experiments to prove the stability of the compounds were performed by adding 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, instead of the enzyme solution. Similarly, the influence of different ethanol concentrations on the kinetics of the CEase-catalyzed turnover of compounds 2(measured at 331 nm) and 3 (measured at 349 nm) was determined. The entire volume was 1 ml containing the following concentrations: 6 mm TC, 12.2 μg/ml CEase, 6% acetonitrile, 50 μm compounds 2 or3, and different ethanol concentrations. The CEase-catalyzed turnover of selected compounds was followed by HPLC. The mobile phase was a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and 50 mm phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4/KH2PO4), pH 5.1. A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used, and absorption was monitored at 225 nm. A mixture of compound 4, TC, and assay buffer was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by adding a volume (9–12 μl) of an enzyme solution (122 μg/ml). This volume was adjusted by the determination of a 1:6250 dilution that converts pNPB (200 μm) with a rate of 1.8 μm/min. The entire volume was 1 ml containing the following concentrations: 6 mm TC, CEase (adjusted activity), 6% acetonitrile, and 20 μm compound 4. The mixture was incubated for 30 h at 25 °C, and 20-μl aliquots were injected 5 min after enzyme addition and then in intervals of 6 h. The linearity of the peak areas versus concentration of compound 4(range 1–24 μm) was controlled in separate experiments. The reaction of CEase with compound 6 (10 μm) was similarly investigated. The following retention times were observed: compound 4 = 64 min; compound6 = 104 min; compound 8 = 10.7 min. A series of fused 1,3-oxazin-4-ones and analogous 1,3-thiazin-4-ones was evaluated as inhibitors of bovine pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Detailed investigations were performed with 2-diethylamino derivatives1–6 whose structures are shown in TableI. The reactions were followed over the period of 1–6 min after initiation by the addition of the enzyme. Progress curves were characterized by a linear steady-state turnover of the substrate, and values of a linear regression were fitted to an equation of competitive inhibition to obtainK i values (Table I). Strong inhibition was detected for thieno[2,3-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ones 3 and4 with K i values < 2 μm. As an example, the analysis of the inhibition kinetics of the thieno[2,3-d][1,3]oxazin-4-one3 is illustrated in Fig.1.Table IInhibition constants and kinetic parameters of the CEase-catalyzed turnover and alkaline hydrolysis of fused 1,3-oxazin-4-ones and 1,3-thiazin-4-onesEnzyme inhibition was assayed in the presence of the chromogenic substrate pNPB (200 μm).

It was determined next whether the inhibitors are active site-directed. This was done exemplary for the most potent inhibitor 3. The Hanes-Woolf plot [S]/v versus substrate concentration is shown in Fig. 2. The relevant relationship is given in Equation 1[S]/v={[1+([I]/Ki2)][S]/VmaxS}+{[1+([I]/Ki1)]KmS/VmaxS}Equation 1 where [S], V maxS, andK m S are the concentration and the Michaelis-Menten parameters of pNPB, respectively, and v is the relative steady-state velocity (v =v s /v 0 × 100%). [I] is the concentration of inhibitor 3, and K i1 andK i2 are inhibition constants to estimate the type of inhibition. Linear regression gave values for slopes and vertical intercepts that were replotted against [I] to calculateK i1 and K i2 , respectively. A formally competitive inhibition could be deduced, and a value ofK i1 = 0.65 μm was obtained in agreement with the result from the inhibition assay for compound3 (K i = 0.58 μm) (TableI). The possibility that fused 1,3-oxazinones and 1,3-thiazinones are substrates of CEase was checked for compounds1–6. The solutions of each compound were incubated with CEase at 25 °C in the presence of TC. The enzyme concentration was ∼60-fold higher compared with the inhibition experiments in the presence of pNPB. Reactions were monitored spectrophometrically or by means of HPLC. Compound 3 indeed underwent an enzymatic turnover to form the corresponding thiophenecarboxylic acid7 (see structure in Fig. 3). This could be concluded, because the final UV spectra obtained for the reaction with CEase (Fig.5 A) were identical with that of the reference compound7 synthesized. Accordingly, the final spectra of the CEase-catalyzed conversion of compound 4 (data not shown) revealed the thiophenecarboxylic acid 8 (see structure in Fig. 3) as the product. The formation of compound 8 as the only product of the CEase-catalyzed transformation of compound4 was additionally demonstrated by HPLC analysis using the synthesized thiophenecarboxylic acid 8 as reference. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of compounds 1 and 2(Fig. 4 A) and 4 was also examined spectrophotometrically. To a minor extent, compound 6was converted by CEase. This reaction was monitored by HPLC. The acylation-deacylation mechanism as concluded from these results is shown exemplary for compounds 3 and 4 in Fig.3.Figure 5Kinetics of the CEase-catalyzed hydrolysis of compound 3. Reaction was performed in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 with 6 mm TC and 6% acetonitrile. Initial concentration of compound 3 was 25 μm.

Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. A Mechanistic Reference. IV. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 93-109Google Scholar). V maxI andK m I are the Michaelis-Menten parameters for the heterocyclic compounds as substrates of CEase. Michaelis-Menten constants could be ascertained being K m I> 25 μm for 1, 2, and5. The kinetic analysis for the CEase-catalyzed hydrolysis of compound 2 is illustrated in Fig.4. The determination of kinetic parameters of the enzymatic hydrolysis of compound 3 to form 7 is depicted in Fig.5. The reaction approximated a zero-order kinetics until the conversion of 3 was nearly finished. As it could be anticipated from Fig. 5 B,K m I was relatively low (0.56 μm).

Although normally synthesized at different anatomic sites, both proteins participate in the innate immune response to microbial challenge. To discern the roles of specific domains in the function of SP-D in vivo, a fusion protein (SP-D/Congneck+CRD) consisting of the NH2-terminal and collagenous domains of rat SP-D (rSP-D) and the neck and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) of bovine conglutinin (Cong) was expressed in the respiratory epithelium of SP-D gene-targeted (SP-D(−/−)) mice. While SP-D/Congneck+CRDfusion protein did not affect lung morphology and surfactant phospholipid levels in the lungs of wild type mice, the chimeric protein substantially corrected the increased lung phospholipids in SP-D(−/−) mice. The SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein also completely corrected defects in influenza A clearance and inhibited the exaggerated inflammatory response that occurs following viral infection. However, the chimeric protein did not ameliorate the ongoing lung inflammation, enhanced metalloproteinase expression, and alveolar destruction that characterize this model of SP-D deficiency. By contrast, a single arm mutant (RrSP-DSer15,20) partially restored antiviral activity but otherwise failed to rescue the deficient phenotype. Our findings directly implicate the CRDs of both SP-D and conglutinin in host defense in vivo. Our findings also strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired pulmonary host defense and abnormal lipid metabolism are distinct from those that promote ongoing inflammation and the development of emphysema.

These proteins contribute to innate immunity, at least in part, by recognizing carbohydrates and lipids expressed on the surface of viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens and enhancing their presentation to host defense cells. The collectins, which include SP-A, SP-D, conglutinin, CL-43, and the mannose-binding protein (MBP), share well conserved carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) and possess collagenous amino-terminal regions that associate to the larger oligomerized formation of the proteins found in the airspace or bodily fluids. SP-D and conglutinin are unique in that they are both preferentially assembled as dodecamers of homotrimeric subunits. SP-D is highly expressed by epithelial cells lining the lung, but it is also synthesized and secreted by various other tissues (3Crouch E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L90-L98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus,in vitro findings suggest that the CRD of conglutinin shares antiviral activities with SP-D and that the amino-terminal and collagen domains contribute to antiviral activity. Gene targeting in transgenic mice revealed a number of unexpected functions for SP-D in pulmonary homeostasis. While SP-D(−/−) mice survived after birth, the mice developed pulmonary emphysema and accumulations of both tissue and airspace phospholipids (16Korfhagen T.R. Sheftelyevich V. Burhans M.S. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Wert S.E. Stahlman M.T. Jobe A.H. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Fisher J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28438-28443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Alveolar macrophages from SP-D(−/−) mice were lipid-laden and constitutively expressed matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 (17Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, SP-D(−/−) macrophages expressed high levels of H2O2, demonstrating that SP-D plays a critical role in the constitutive regulation of oxidant signaling in alveolar macrophages (18LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richardson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Increased metalloproteinase expression was at least in part mediated by the spontaneous activation of NF-κB in alveolar macrophages occurring in the absence of SP-D (19Yoshida M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7514-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). All of these abnormalities were corrected with a genetic rescue in which expression of rat SP-D was targeted to lung epithelial cells (20Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V., Ho, Y. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, trimeric SP-D subunits (RrSP-DSer15,20) failed to correct the lipidosis, emphysema, and inflammation in SP-D(−/−) micein vivo (21Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the oligomerization of trimeric subunits contribute to the biological activity of SP-D. SP-D-deficient mice were more susceptible to pulmonary infection and inflammation after exposure to influenza A or respiratory syncytial virus in vivo (18). Viral killing was defective, and lung inflammatory responses were enhanced in the absence of SP-D. It is known that the interactions of SP-D with influenza virus involve binding of the CRDs to N-linked oligosaccharides on viral coat proteins (2Reid K.B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, recombinant trimeric neck and CRD domains bind to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), inhibit infectivity in vitro, and increase viral clearance when administered to RSV-infected mice in vivo (22Hickling T.P. Bright H. Wing K. Gower D. Martin S.L. Sim R.B. Malhotra R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3478-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the precise domains of SP-D required to ameliorate the various metabolic and structural abnormalities seen in the absence of SP-D remain unclear. In the present studies the SP-D and conglutinin fusion protein SP-D/Congneck+CRD was expressed under control of the lung epithelial-specific promoter element derived from the SP-Cpromoter in lungs of wild type and SP-D(−/−) mice. We hypothesized that the CRD of conglutinin would restore host defense activities and possibly exert an anti-inflammatory effect while failing to correct surfactant lipid homeostasis. Although the SP-D/Congneck+CRD protein corrected defects in the clearance of influenza virus, it also substantively corrected the abnormal lipid homeostasis. On the other hand, the chimera did not influence alveolar macrophage activation, metalloproteinase expression, or the development of emphysema. These findings strongly suggest that the domains of SP-D regulating oxidant injury and lung remodeling are specific for the neck and CRD of SP-D and are not complementable by the corresponding domains of conglutinin. Mice that are described under “Experimental Procedures” were handled in accordance with approved protocols through the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All mice had been maintained in the vivarium in barrier containment facilities. Sentinel mice in the colony were serologically negative for common murine pathogens. The 1.3-kb hybrid cDNA encoding SP-D/Congneck+CRD was described previously (15Hartshorn K.L. Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L90-L98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of the 3.7SP-C/SV40 expression vector (23Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Restriction enzyme digestion confirmed the orientation of the insert. The vector contained the 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter, which drives expression in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (24Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar) in a pattern similar to that of the endogenous SP-D gene. The transgene was microinjected into fertilized FVB/N oocytes by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Transgenic Core facility, and founders were identified by Southern blot analysis using a32P-radiolabeled probe that recognized the SP-D/Congneck+CRD hybrid cDNA. Transgene-specific PCR using the upstream primer 5′-ATA GGA CCC CAA GGC AAA CCA G-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AGG TTC AGG GGG TGG TGT GG-3′ was also used. Transgenic animals were crossed with SP-D-null mice (16Korfhagen T.R. Sheftelyevich V. Burhans M.S. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Wert S.E. Stahlman M.T. Jobe A.H. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Fisher J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28438-28443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) to generate heterozygous transgenic mice. Heterozygous mice were bred to generate SP-D/Congneck+CRD transgenic mice either in wild type (SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(+/+)) or SP-D-null backgrounds (SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−)). Non-transgenic littermates in both SP-D(+/+) and SP-D(−/−) backgrounds were used as control mice. The absence of a 589-bp PCR product for the mSP-D gene and the presence of a 438-bp PCR product for the neomycin resistance gene was used to confirm the SP-D(−/−) genotype. The RrSP-DSer15,20 transgenic mice (lines 75 and 52) were bred into the SP-D(−/−) background as previously described (21Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these mice, RrSP-DSer15,20 is expressed under the control of the h3.7SP-C promoter in SP-D(−/−) mice. The RrSP-DSer15,20 forms trimers, but does not form higher order oligomers that require Cys15,20 in the NH2-terminal domain of SP-D. Comparisons were made among non-transgenic and transgenic littermates in similar strains. Animals were weighed, anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, and exsanguinated by severing the distal aorta. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed five times with saline for each lung, and the volume of return was measured (25Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was centrifuged at low speed to remove cells, and an aliquot of BALF was obtained. The remaining BALF was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate surfactant lipid from supernatant. The lipid pellets were resuspended in equal volumes of saline. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and subjected to Western blot analysis to estimate partition of SP-D or SP-D/Congneck+CRD in the fraction. 25 μl of BALF from each mouse was dried and reconstituted in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with or without prior sulfhydryl reduction with β-mercaptoethanol. After resolution on a 10–20% SDS/Tris/glycine/polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated at room temperature overnight with rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antiserum diluted 1:5,000 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween. Blots were washed with TBS/Tween and incubated at room temperature for 4 h with 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Calbiochem). After washing, blots were developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The rabbit anti-SP-D antibody was generated against purified mouse SP-D and affinity absorbed against lung homogenates from SP-D(−/−) mice (6Hull W.M. Stahlman M. Gray M.P. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: A42Google Scholar). Immunostaining was completely blocked by co-incubation with purified mouse SP-D. IAV strain H3N2 A/Phillipines/82 (Phil/82) was grown in chorioallantoic fluid of 10-day-old embryonated hen eggs. Two days after inoculation with virus, allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 40 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 135,000 × g to collect the virus. Virus was further purified on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient as previously described (12Hartshorn K.L. Chang D. Rust K. White M.R. Heuser J. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L753-L762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral stocks were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), divided into aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. Six-week-old wild type, SP-D(−/−), line 81 and 85 (SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−)) mice and lines 52 and 75 (RrSP-DSer15,20(+), SP-D(−/−)) mice were anesthetized with 3% isofluorine. IAV 5 × 105 ffu in 50 μl of PBS was dripped into the nostril for inhalation into lungs. Three days after viral instillation the mice were killed by an overdose of pentobarbital, and their lungs were weighed and homogenized. After centrifugation aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed for IAV titer and cytokine concentrations. IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistical differences between mouse lines were evaluated by ANOVA Fisher analysis. Differences ofp < 0.05 were considered significant. For quantitative viral titers of mouse lung homogenates, the entire lung was removed, homogenized in 2 ml of sterile PBS, quick-frozen, weighed, and then stored at −80 °C. Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers were prepared in 96-well plates for the viral focus assay as previously described (15Hartshorn K.L. Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L90-L98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The layers were incubated with lung homogenates diluted in PBS containing 2 mm calcium for 45 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were washed three times in virus-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The monolayers were incubated for 7 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and repeatedly washed. The cells were fixed with 80% (v/v) acetone for 10 min at −20 °C. The monolayers were then incubated with monoclonal antibody directed against IAV nucleoprotein (monoclonal antibody A-3) and then with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescent foci were counted directly under fluorescent microscopy. The resulting titer was divided by the lung weight and reported as fluorescent foci (ff)/gram of lung. We performed the saccharide inhibition ELISAs (13Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml yeast mannan in 5 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3 at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed three times with TBS/NTC (20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Tween-20) after each subsequent step. After coating, the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. BALF from wild type, line 81 and 85 SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice was incubated with increasing concentrations of maltose or GlcNAc, rabbit anti-SP-D antibody (1:1,000 dilution), and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1,000 dilution). After washing,o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) was added to each well, andA 490 nm was read in an ELISA plate reader. The concentration of sugar that inhibited 50% binding was defined as IC50. Lung lavage was performed on 8–10-week-old mice using five 1-ml aliquots of isotonic saline. After lavage, lung tissue was homogenized. Saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) was measured as previously described (25Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Lung phospholipid levels were determined (n = 13–28) in each genotype. Differences between each genotype were analyzed by ANOVA Fisher. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Lungs were fixed at 25 cm of water pressure with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed into paraffin blocks. 7-μm sections from each lobe were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Alveolar macrophages (5 × 105) were isolated by centrifuging BALF from wild type, SP-D(−/−), line 81 and 85 (SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−)) mice and cultured for 24 h in 1% Nutridoma/RPMI 1640 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Proteinases in the conditioned media were concentrated with gelatin-Sephadex beads (Amersham Biosciences) and assayed by zymography as described previously (17Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Two founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis using the 1.3-kb SP-D/Congneck+CRDcDNA as a probe (data not shown). Germ line transmission was demonstrated in both founder lines using transgene-specific PCR on tail DNA (data not shown). Western blot analysis of BALF from 4 to 8 mice from each genotype confirmed the expression of transgenic protein, and representative results are shown in Fig.2. Both mouse lines (81 and 85) had similar copy numbers of the transgene. Similar concentrations of the SP-D/Congneck+CRD protein were detected in BALF from both lines. The calculated molecular mass of SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein is virtually identical to that of the SP-D protein (43-kDa monomer). Under reducing conditions, a rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antibody was used to detect the 43-kDa fusion protein in BALF from SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice in both transgenic mouse lines (Fig. 2 A, lower panel, lanes 4 and 8). Because of interchain disulfide bond linkages, SP-D protein in wild type mouse BALF was detected as an oligomer migrating more slowly than the 200-kDa standard (Fig.2 A, upper panel, lanes 1 and5). The SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein from SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice migrated at the same position when separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A,upper panel, lanes 4 and 8), demonstrating that the SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein formed disulfide cross-linked oligomers similar to those formed by SP-D. To assess partitioning of SP-D and the mutant protein in lipids and supernatant, Western blot analysis of the surfactant lipid pellet and supernatant was performed. While mouse SP-D was associated with both the supernatant and lipid phases. SP-D/Congneck+CRDfusion protein was not detected in the lipid fraction, but was readily detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2 B). To determine the saccharide binding specificity of the secreted SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein, inhibition ELISAs were performed using BALF from controls and mice expressing the chimera. The binding of SP-D or SP-D/Congneck+CRD to yeast mannan was competitively inhibited with increasing concentrations of maltose or GlcNAc. The IC50 of maltose for binding to BALF from wild type mice was in the range of 2 to 4 mm, consistent with that previously observed with the SP-D protein (13Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Table I). The IC50 of maltose for BALF from SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice was 23 mm for line 81 and greater than 50 mm for line 85 (Table I), demonstrating that the SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein had less affinity for maltose, consistent with the saccharide preferences of conglutinin. The IC50 for GlcNAc binding to BALF protein from SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice was 2–3 mm for lines 81 and 85, but greater than 50 mmfor wild type BALF (Table I). Since SP-D has higher affinity for maltose than GlcNAc, and conglutinin has a higher affinity for GlcNAc than maltose (26Holmskov U.L. APMIS Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59PubMed Google Scholar), the secreted SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein binds saccharides with a selectivity similar to that of conglutinin.Table IBinding (IC 50 ) of SP-D and SP-D/Cong neck+CRD to Maltose and GlcNAcMonosaccharide Binding Selectivity (IC50)MaltoseGlcNAc mmWT2–4>50Line 81232Line 85>503BAL from wild type, line 81 and line 85 SP-D/Congneck+CRD + SP-D(−/−) mice were incubated in mannan coated ELISA plates with increasing concentration of maltose or GlcNAc.

Open table in a new tab BAL from wild type, line 81 and line 85 SP-D/Congneck+CRD + SP-D(−/−) mice were incubated in mannan coated ELISA plates with increasing concentration of maltose or GlcNAc. The saccharide concentrations that inhibited 50% binding to mannan were defined as IC50. Expression of SP-D/Congneck+CRD transgene in the wild type background did not perturb alveolar, tissue, or total Sat PC levels (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and1, respectively). Expression of SP-D/Congneck+CRD transgene in SP-D(−/−) background significantly reduced pulmonary Sat PC levels by 70% (alveolar), 55% (tissue), and 65% (total) compared with SP-D(−/−) mice (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 3, respectively). While the SP-D/Congneck+CRD substantially corrected Sat PC levels, levels remained modestly increased in SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice compared with wild type mice (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 1, respectively). Expression of SP-D/Congneck+CRDfusion protein in wild type mice did not perturb lung morphology at 12 weeks of age in either transgenic line (Fig.4, panels B and C). However, expression of SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein in SP-D(−/−) background did not correct the emphysema and foamy macrophage accumulation typical of SP-D(−/−). These findings are distinct from previous studies in which the SP-C promoter was used to express the wild type rat SP-D protein in SP-D(−/−) mice (20Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V., Ho, Y. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emphysema, enlarged, and foamy macrophages (arrows) and peribronchiolar lymphocyte aggregates (arrowheads) were detected in both transgenic mouse lines in SP-D(−/−) background (Fig.4, panels E and F), findings identical to those in SP-D(−/−) mice (Fig. 4, panel D). Proteinase activity gels were used to assess the level of production of MMP-9 and MMP-2 by alveolar macrophages isolated from wild type, SP-D(−/−) and SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice. While MMP-9 and MMP-2 production was barely detected in conditioned media from wild type mice (Fig. 5, lane 1), metalloproteinase activities were markedly increased in both lines of SP-D(−/−) mice expressing the SP-D/Congneck+CRD protein (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5). In vitro studies previously demonstrated that the SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein had enhanced anti-influenza activity compared with SP-D or conglutinin (15Hartshorn K.L. Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L90-L98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate anti-influenza A viral activity of the SP-D/Congneck+CRD fusion protein in vivo, IAV (5 × 105 ffu) was administered into mouse lungs intranasally, and viral titers were measured in the lung homogenates three days later. While the viral titer from SP-D(−/−) mouse lung homogenates was 16,052 ± 2,326 ffu/g of tissue (mean ± S.E., n = 10), no detectable IAV was recovered from lung homogenates from wild type or from SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+), SP-D(−/−) mice for either line 81 or line 85, demonstrating complete correction of viral clearance. Significantly increased IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were observed in lung homogenates from SP-D(−/−) compared with wild type mice. In contrast, cytokine concentrations in SP-D/Congneck+CRD(+) (both line 81 and line 85) mice were not different from those from wild type mice following infection (Fig. 6), demonstrating complete correction of both viral clearance and inflammatory responses by the chimeric protein. To further determine the role of CRD and oligomerization in viral clearance we tested whether another mutant SP-D protein, RrSP"

Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of human cyclin T interaction with Tat has proved to be most critical and significant (6Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 15Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated to support a model, i.e. human cyclin T forms a complex with Tat and a cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9, a component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Subsequently, the Tat-cyclin T-containing complex is recruited to TAR by specific interactions between Tat and the bulge region of TAR, and between cyclin T and the loop region of TAR. As a result, the cyclin T-associated CDK9 kinase induces phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, thus resulting in efficient and processive HIV-1 transcription. Besides cyclin T, other Tat-interacting proteins and/or cofactors include Tip60, HT2A, CA150, TFIID, Tat-SF1, Tip30, p300, and CBP (7Zhou Q. Sharp P.A.

Many of these factors regulate Tat transactivation function through directly regulating Tat interaction with TAR, and/or Tat interaction with other transcription factors.In addition to Tat protein, a number of cellular transcription factors can also regulate the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity through targeting the regions or elements other than TAR within the LTR promoter (for review, see Ref. 14Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These regions are located upstream of TAR, and include the basal promoter, the core enhancer, and the modulatory region (25Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Transcription activators, such as SP1, NF-κB, and TBP, bind within the core promoter and stimulate HIV-1 transcription (26Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 27Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), whereas others including NF-AT, USF, and COUP regulate the HIV-1 LTR promoter through interaction with the modulatory region (28Shaw J.P.

Thus, it has become increasingly evident that interaction between Tat, host cellular factors, and transcription factors forms a complex regulatory network, through which regulation of HIV-1 gene expression is achieved in a diverse range of host cells and under a variety of extracellular stimuli.During our attempts to characterize the roles of Tat protein in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, we isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a novel nuclear Tat-interactingprotein of 110 kDa, or Tip110. We show that Tip110 directly transactivates the HIV-1 LTR promoter, but also interacts and synergizes with Tat to argument Tat-mediated transactivation activity. Moreover, we show that down-modulation of constitutive Tip110 expression inhibits HIV-1 viral gene expression. In corroboration with the observed activities, we show that Tip110 is a nuclear protein and exclusively localized in a nuclear structure termed nuclear speckles. These data together suggest that Tip110 plays an important role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report a novel HIV-1 Tat-interacting protein and its potentiating activity on Tat-mediated gene expression and HIV-1 virus production. We initially isolated the partial cDNA during the yeast two-hybrid cloning (33Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M., Bu, G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the partial and full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) revealed that the cDNA was almost identical to the KIAA0156 gene (42Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (, 199–210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro coupled transcription/translation analysis demonstrated that the full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 110 kDa (data not shown). Thus, we re-named the gene as a Tat-interactingprotein of 110 kDa, or Tip110. The KIAA0156 gene was earlier cloned from a human myloid cell line KG-1 cDNA library with unknown functions (42Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (, 199–210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have implicated this gene in RNA metabolism (49Gu J. Shimba S. Nomura N. Reddy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in tumor antigen presentation (50Yang D. Nakao M. Shichijo S. Sasatomi T. Takasu H. Matsumoto H. Mori K. Hayashi A. Yamana H. Shirouzu K. Itoh K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4056-4063PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that KIAA0156, or Tip110 as we termed it, exhibits strong synergistic effects with Tat through direct interaction. In addition, we have also identified a 11-bp deletion isoform of Tip110, which encodes a protein containing only the N-terminal 350 amino acids of Tip110 (Fig. 1), suggesting that alternate splicing may be involved in the regulation of Tip110 expression level and function.We confirmed in vivo interaction between the full-length Tip110 and Tat using the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2) and Western blot combined with immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). The direct and specific binding was further supported by the data obtained from mutagenesis analysis (Figs. 4 and 5) and a GST pull-down assay (data not shown). The protein structure analysis predicted that Tip110 contained seven motifs of HAT, a TPR at the N terminus (Figs. 1 and4 a). The TPR motif is a well conserved protein-protein interaction module, structurally consisting of two antiparallel α helices (for review, see Ref. 51Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of TPR, our studies identified the N-terminal HAT-rich domain of Tip110 that was responsible for interaction of Tip110 and Tat (Fig. 4). In addition, our data suggest that multiple copies of HATs may be able to form functional TPR(s) and thus, determine the specificity of protein-protein interaction.Like many Tat-interacting proteins/co-factors, Tip110 was found to interact with the core domain of Tat (Fig. 5), which is essential for Tat transactivation function. Although Tip110 contained two RNA recognition motifs (Fig. 1) and has been shown to bind to RNA (49Gu J. Shimba S. Nomura N. Reddy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Tip110 did not exhibit the TAR binding activity, or any effects on Tat-TAR interaction, determined by the yeast three-hybrid RNA-protein interaction assay (Table I) and the gel mobility retardation assay (data not shown). Transient expression of Tip110 in 293T cells showed transactivation activity on the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Fig.6 a), and also on the TAR-deleted LTR promoter (Fig.6 b). Importantly, co-expression of Tip110 and Tat greatly potentiated Tat transactivation function on the LTR-driven reporter gene assay (Fig. 6 b). Interestingly, although Tip110 did not bind to TAR (Table I), the synergistic effects were TAR-dependent, as these effects were attenuated by deletion of the TAR sequence from the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Fig. 6 b). Furthermore, the synergistic effects were also dependent on the Tat binding activity, as deletion of the Tat-binding HAT-rich domain of Tip110 (Tip110ΔNT) resulted in no changes on Tat-mediated reporter gene expression (Fig. 6 c). These data together demonstrate that Tip110 is capable of targeting TAR through interaction with Tat, as well as interacting with other regulatory regions or elements other than TAR within the HIV-1 LTR promoter.Consistent with the LTR-driven CAT reporter gene assay, our results also showed that Tip110 expression also enhanced HIV-1 viral gene expression (Fig. 7 a). The enhancement effects were correlated with Tat binding activity of Tip110, as Tip110ΔNT mutant exhibited no effects on HIV-1 gene expression (Fig. 7 a). Surprisingly, down-modulation of constitutive Tip110 expression inhibited HIV-1 viral gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 c). These results support an essential role of Tip110 in the process of Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene expression. Because TPR-containing proteins have been shown to be often associated with multiprotein complexes and involved in functioning of chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport (for review, see Ref.4Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 732-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we speculate that Tip110 may be part of the transcription elongation complex P-TEFb. This is further supported by our findings that Tip110 was localized exclusively in a nuclear structure called nuclear speckles (Fig. 9), in which cyclin T and CDK9, two critical components of the P-TEFb complex, have recently been localized (52Herrmann C.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we were not able to detect any direct interaction between Tip110 and cyclin T and/or CDK9 (data not shown). In addition, many cellular splicing factors are localized in the nuclear speckled structure, where the post-transcriptional mRNA processing is believed to occur (53Eilbracht J. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3849-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 54Dye B.T. Patton J.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 55Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol.

Our studies did not rule out the possibility that Tip110 binding to Tat may play a role in the splicing process of HIV-1 viral mRNA transcripts and/or other Tat-mediated processes, such as HIV-1 reverse transcription (57Harrich D. Ulich C. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional studies are needed to define the molecular mechanisms of Tip110 function in Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene expression. Unlike simple retroviruses, the complex retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 encodes additional regulatory proteins that are essential for HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 2Emerman M. Malim M.H. Science. 1998; 280: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). One of them is HIV-1 Tat, which transactivates HIV-1 transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and3Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Tat distinguishes itself from other classic transcriptional activators by functioning at the stage of transcription elongation (4Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol.

Sequence analysis of the partial and full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) revealed that the cDNA was almost identical to the KIAA0156 gene (42Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N.

In addition, our data suggest that multiple copies of HATs may be able to form functional TPR(s) and thus, determine the specificity of protein-protein interaction.Like many Tat-interacting proteins/co-factors, Tip110 was found to interact with the core domain of Tat (Fig. 5), which is essential for Tat transactivation function. Although Tip110 contained two RNA recognition motifs (Fig. 1) and has been shown to bind to RNA (49Gu J. Shimba S. Nomura N. Reddy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Tip110 did not exhibit the TAR binding activity, or any effects on Tat-TAR interaction, determined by the yeast three-hybrid RNA-protein interaction assay (Table I) and the gel mobility retardation assay (data not shown). Transient expression of Tip110 in 293T cells showed transactivation activity on the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Fig.6 a), and also on the TAR-deleted LTR promoter (Fig.6 b). Importantly, co-expression of Tip110 and Tat greatly potentiated Tat transactivation function on the LTR-driven reporter gene assay (Fig. 6 b). Interestingly, although Tip110 did not bind to TAR (Table I), the synergistic effects were TAR-dependent, as these effects were attenuated by deletion of the TAR sequence from the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Fig. 6 b). Furthermore, the synergistic effects were also dependent on the Tat binding activity, as deletion of the Tat-binding HAT-rich domain of Tip110 (Tip110ΔNT) resulted in no changes on Tat-mediated reporter gene expression (Fig. 6 c). These data together demonstrate that Tip110 is capable of targeting TAR through interaction with Tat, as well as interacting with other regulatory regions or elements other than TAR within the HIV-1 LTR promoter.Consistent with the LTR-driven CAT reporter gene assay, our results also showed that Tip110 expression also enhanced HIV-1 viral gene expression (Fig. 7 a). The enhancement effects were correlated with Tat binding activity of Tip110, as Tip110ΔNT mutant exhibited no effects on HIV-1 gene expression (Fig. 7 a). Surprisingly, down-modulation of constitutive Tip110 expression inhibited HIV-1 viral gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 c). These results support an essential role of Tip110 in the process of Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene expression. Because TPR-containing proteins have been shown to be often associated with multiprotein complexes and involved in functioning of chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport (for review, see Ref.4Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 732-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we speculate that Tip110 may be part of the transcription elongation complex P-TEFb. This is further supported by our findings that Tip110 was localized exclusively in a nuclear structure called nuclear speckles (Fig. 9), in which cyclin T and CDK9, two critical components of the P-TEFb complex, have recently been localized (52Herrmann C.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we were not able to detect any direct interaction between Tip110 and cyclin T and/or CDK9 (data not shown). In addition, many cellular splicing factors are localized in the nuclear speckled structure, where the post-transcriptional mRNA processing is believed to occur (53Eilbracht J. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3849-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 54Dye B.T. Patton J.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 55Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 56Zeng C. Kim E. Warren S.L. Berget S.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our studies did not rule out the possibility that Tip110 binding to Tat may play a role in the splicing process of HIV-1 viral mRNA transcripts and/or other Tat-mediated processes, such as HIV-1 reverse transcription (57Harrich D. Ulich C. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional studies are needed to define the molecular mechanisms of Tip110 function in Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene expression. In this study, we report a novel HIV-1 Tat-interacting protein and its potentiating activity on Tat-mediated gene expression and HIV-1 virus production. We initially isolated the partial cDNA during the yeast two-hybrid cloning (33Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M., Bu, G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the partial and full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) revealed that the cDNA was almost identical to the KIAA0156 gene (42Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (, 199–210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro coupled transcription/translation analysis demonstrated that the full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 110 kDa (data not shown). Thus, we re-named the gene as a Tat-interactingprotein of 110 kDa, or Tip110. The KIAA0156 gene was earlier cloned from a human myloid cell line KG-1 cDNA library with unknown functions (42Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (, 199–210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have implicated this gene in RNA metabolism (49Gu J. Shimba S. Nomura N. Reddy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in tumor antigen presentation (50Yang D. Nakao M. Shichijo S. Sasatomi T. Takasu H. Matsumoto H. Mori K. Hayashi A. Yamana H. Shirouzu K. Itoh K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4056-4063PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that KIAA0156, or Tip110 as we termed it, exhibits strong synergistic effects with Tat through direct interaction. In addition, we have also identified a 11-bp deletion isoform of Tip110, which encodes a protein containing only the N-terminal 350 amino acids of Tip110 (Fig. 1), suggesting that alternate splicing may be involved in the regulation of Tip110 expression level and function. We confirmed in vivo interaction between the full-length Tip110 and Tat using the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2) and Western blot combined with immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). The direct and specific binding was further supported by the data obtained from mutagenesis analysis (Figs. 4 and 5) and a GST pull-down assay (data not shown). The protein structure analysis predicted that Tip110 contained seven motifs of HAT, a TPR at the N terminus (Figs. 1 and4 a). The TPR motif is a well conserved protein-protein interaction module, structurally consisting of two antiparallel α helices (for review, see Ref. 51Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of TPR, our studies identified the N-terminal HAT-rich domain of Tip110 that was responsible for interaction of Tip110 and Tat (Fig. 4). In addition, our data suggest that multiple copies of HATs may be able to form functional TPR(s) and thus, determine the specificity of protein-protein interaction.

We have genetically engineered a truncated version of smooth muscle myosin containing the motor domain and the essential light chain-binding region (MDE), with a single tryptophan residue at position 425 (F425W-MDE) in the actin-binding cleft. Steady-state fluorescence of F425W-MDE demonstrates that Trp-425 is in a more solvent-exposed conformation in the presence of MgATP than in the presence of MgADP or absence of nucleotide, consistent with closure of the actin-binding cleft in the strongly bound states of MgATPase cycle for myosin. Transient kinetic experiments demonstrate a direct correlation between the rates of strong actin binding and the conformation of Trp-425 in the actin-binding cleft, and suggest the existence of a novel conformation of myosin not previously seen in solution or by x-ray crystallography. Thus, these results directly demonstrate that: 1) the conformation of the actin-binding cleft mediates the affinity of myosin for actin in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and 2) actin induces conformational changes in myosin required to generate force and motion during muscle contraction.

Myosin possesses two striking functional features that allow it to act as a molecular motor protein, namely its ability to 1) generate force and motion with actin filaments through a putative powerstroke and 2) alter its affinity for actin by more than 4 orders of magnitude at different stages of its enzymatic MgATPase cycle. The myosin MgATPase cycle can be described by a kinetic scheme (1Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Chock S.P. Chock P.B. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3244-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), where A, M, and AM represent actin, myosin, and the acto-myosin complex, respectively (Scheme 1). In Scheme 1, myosin binds strongly to actin with nanomolar affinity in the presence of MgADP or in the absence of nucleotide, and weakly to actin with micromolar affinity in the ATP and ADP·Pi states of the contractile cycle. Thus binding of MgATP to myosin is thought to initiate the transition to the weakly bound states of the MgATPase cycle, and phosphate release is believed to be associated with the transition to the strongly bound states of the MgATPase cycle and the subsequent powerstroke. Although the biochemical basis for the ability of myosin to interact with actin in a nucleotide-dependent manner is well established (3Goldman Y.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the structural basis for its enzymatic and motile functions are less well understood. Crystal structures of myosin (see Fig. 1)solved in different nucleotide states (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G.

Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), as well as other studies (3Goldman Y.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), have identified key structural rearrangements within the light chain-binding region of myosin that suggest how it may generate force and motion. However, the domain motions within the actin-binding region of myosin that are responsible for its ability to cycle between weak and strong actin-binding states during its MgATPase cycle are still unclear. Thus, examining the conformational changes that mediate the large changes in the affinity of myosin for actin during the contractile cycle are important to fully understand the molecular details of the acto-myosin interaction. Within the putative actin-binding interface of myosin there are three main regions that are thought to interact with actin (Ref. 10Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar; see Fig.1) (amino acid residues refer to smooth muscle myosin sequence, see Ref. 11Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1999Google Scholar for comparison of myosin isoforms). First, there is a highly charged surface loop (residues 628–657) known as loop 2 or the actin-binding loop that is not visible in the crystal structures of myosin, but has been cross-linked to actin (12Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2110-2120Google Scholar) and contains a proteolytic site that is protected in the presence of actin (13Mornet D. Bertrand R.U. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochemistry. 1981; 21: 2110-2120Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Second, a helix-loop-helix motif (residues 531–561) located in the lower 50-kDa region has been implicated in forming hydrophobic contacts in a strongly bound complex with actin (14Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12944-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Onishi H. Morales M.F. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11965-11969Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, a loop (residues 406–416) located on the upper 50-kDa region, known as loop 3 or the “myopathy loop” because a mutation in this region in β-cardiac myosin causes a form of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, may participate in hydrophobic contacts that mediate the change in actin affinity upon ADP release (16Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The large change in affinity associated with the transition from weak to strong actin binding has been suggested to involve a conformational change in the cleft that separates the actin-binding region of myosin (i.e. the actin-binding cleft), which traverses from the nucleotide-binding site into the actin binding interface (18Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of myosin have predominantly shown the actin-binding cleft to be in one conformation regardless of the nucleotide bound to myosin. This conformation of the actin-binding cleft was originally referred to as open because several hydrophobic residues in the interior of the cleft are exposed to solvent and a more closed conformation was predicted based on the acto-myosin subfragment 1 (S1) cryo-EM structure in the absence of nucleotide (18Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Only a small, 10 degrees, closure of the lower 50-kDa region was observed in the presence of a few nucleotide analogs (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 5Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a more recent cryo-EM reconstruction of acto-smooth muscle myosin S1 in the presence and absence of MgADP have suggested the actin-binding cleft of myosin adopts a more closed conformation compared with the structure in the absence of actin (17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, only indirect experimental evidence exists linking the conformation of this actin-binding cleft and affinity of myosin for actin. Thus, critical questions remain about the relationship between the structure of the actin-binding cleft and myosin function in solution. In particular, can the actin-binding cleft of myosin in solution be shown to change its conformation significantly in the transitions between the weak and strong binding states of the MgATPase cycle? And if so, does myosin bind to actin in a strongly bound complex with an actin-binding cleft that is open, partially closed, or fully closed? Finally, is actin required for conformational changes in the actin-binding cleft of myosin to be fully realized? To address these important and unresolved questions, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to examine changes in the conformation of the actin-binding cleft during the MgATPase cycle of smooth muscle myosin. A mutant fragment of smooth muscle myosin (F425W-MDE), containing the motor domain with the essential light chain (MDE), was engineered to contain a single tryptophan located at residue 425 (normally a phenylalanine) in the upper 50-kDa subdomain of the actin-binding cleft. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from F425W-MDE was used to examine changes in the environment of Trp-425 during different stages of the MgATPase cycle of myosin. In addition, we used the fluorescence signal from Trp-425 in transient kinetic experiments to directly examine the relationship of structural changes in the actin-binding cleft to transitions between the weak (AM·ATP, AM·ADP·Pi) and strong (AM·ADP, AM) actin-binding states. We have identified structural changes that occur in the actin-binding cleft upon binding nucleotide and actin, providing direct evidence for the role of this cleft in mediating the affinity of myosin for actin during muscle contraction.

All other reagents were the highest quality available. A stock solution of BeCl2 (Be, atomic absorption standard solution, in 1% HCl) was adjusted to pH 5.0 by addition of 1 n NaOH. Stock solutions of 1 mNaF were freshly prepared each day. All experiments were performed in MOPS1 buffer, (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Imidazole buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was used during protein purification (described below). A stop solution (140 mm EDTA, 20% SDS, pH 6.5) and a color developer solution (2% ammonium molybdate, 18 mm FeSO4·7H20, 0.5 mH2SO4) were used during the steady-state ATPase assays (described below). We performed site-directed mutagenesis on a clone of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, containing the motor domain and truncated after the essential light chain-binding site (residues 1–819, kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen M. Trybus, University of Vermont), to produce a mutant containing a single tryptophan at residue 425. We constructed this mutant by mutating the seven endogenous MDE tryptophans to phenylalanine (or methionine in the case of Trp-546) and replacing phenylalanine 425 with a tryptophan (highlighted as a space-filling model in Fig. 1). We also constructed a mutant containing no tryptophans (null-MDE), and a molecule containing all seven native tryptophans (WT-MDE) as described previously (14Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12944-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope sequence was attached at the C terminus of all MDE constructs for purification purposes (19Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar). The baculovirus system was used to express all MDE constructs by co-infecting Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the desired myosin heavy chain and essential light chain sequences. Following incubation with baculovirus for 3 days, the Sf9 cells were lysed, fractionated between 40 and 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed overnight in imidazole buffer at 4 °C. The dialysate was bound to an anti-FLAG antibody column and eluted with the homologous peptide and dialyzed overnight into MOPS buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol present. The degree of purity of the MDE was assessed by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using Coomassie-stained gels. Purified MDE concentrations (on a per head basis since MDE is a single-headed myosin construct) were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad microplate assay with WT-MDE as a standard. All experiments were performed on 2–3 different MDE preparations. Actin was purified from chicken pectoralis muscle using an acetone powder method (22Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A.

The concentration of purified actin was determined spectophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 mg/ml−1 cm−1 at 290 nm and the pyrene-actin concentration was determined according Pollard (23Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MDE trapped with ADP-BeFX or ADP-AlF4 was prepared as described previously (24Werber M.M. Peyser Y.M. Mulrad A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6 μm purified MDE in MOPS buffer was mixed with 1 mm MgCl2, 3 μm ADP, 2 mm NaF, and 0.2 mmAlCl3 or BeCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. The MDE-analog complexes formed with greater than 85% efficiency based on the inhibition of their ammonium (0.4 mNH4Cl, 35 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C) ATPase activities. Steady-state actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in low ionic strength MOPS buffer using the method of White (25White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ATPase reaction (0.5 ml of 1 μm purified MDE in the presence of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 μm actin, final concentrations) was started by adding MgATP (2 mm final), and a 50-μl aliquot of the reaction was added to 50 μl of stop solution each 10 min over a 70-min period. The phosphate concentration at each time point was determined by adding 200 μl of color developing solution, incubating for 20 min at room temperature, and measuring the absorbance at 700 nm in a spectrophotometer. The absorbance values were background corrected using a blank solution (the reaction mixture at time = 0) and compared with a phosphate standard curve (0.1–0.7 mminorganic phosphate). The average ATPase rates (nanomoles of Pi × (nmol of MDE−1 s−1)) of three separate preparations of F425W- and WT-MDE were plotted as a function of actin concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, using a non-linear least squares method in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), to determine the values of V max andK ATPase. A Quantamaster fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a 75-W Xenon arc lamp as an excitation source, excitation/emission monochrometers, and a WG-320 cut-off emission filter (Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) was used to measure steady-state fluorescence from tryptophan. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were measured by exciting the sample at 295 nm and collecting the emitted fluorescence from 305 to 400 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2 nm. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for variations in the wavelength sensitivity of the detector system and the presence of Raman scatter and background fluorescence in the appropriate buffer solution. The fluorescence emission spectrum of F425W-MDE was measured in the presence of 2 mm MgADP or MgATP, as well as in the absence of nucleotide. The fluorescence spectrum of F425W-MDE was also measured complexed with the nucleotide analogs, MgADP-AlF4− and MgADP-BeFXas described above. Acrylamide quenching was used to determine the degree of exposure to solvent of Trp-425 in the absence and presence of various nucleotide complexes. The decrease in fluorescence intensity at the peak fluorescence emission wavelength (λmax) was measured as a function of increasing acrylamide concentrations ([Q]). Fluorescence in the absence of quencher (F 0) divided by the fluorescence in the presence of quencher (F) was used to quantify the relative change in fluorescence from acrylamide quenching (F 0 /F).F 0/F was plotted as a function of [Q] and fit to the Stern-Volmer relationship, taking into account both the static (V) and dynamic (K SV) quenching constants:F 0/F = (1 +K SV[Q])(expV[Q]) (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The Stern-Volmer plots were fit using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Transient kinetic measurements of tryptophan and pyrene-actin fluorescence were performed in MOPS buffer at 25 °C with an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow instrument. The dead time was determined to be a 1.2 ms. Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and the fluorescence emission observed through a WG-320 cut-off filter (Oriel Corp.). Pyrene was excited at 365 nm and the fluorescence emission measured using a 400 cut-off filter (Oriel Corp.). Nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data was done with software provided with the instrument or with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Errors reported are standard errors of the fits. Functional assays were performed to examine the impact of the conservative mutations made to generate the smooth muscle myosin single tryptophan-containing F425W-MDE mutant. This construct displayed V max values that were reduced 2–3-fold, and K ATPase values 2–3-fold lower compared with WT-MDE, although the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K ATPase) of F425W-MDE was virtually identical to that of WT-MDE (TableI). In addition, F425W-MDE was found to have a high affinity for actin in the absence of nucleotide (24 nm), measured by monitoring the rate of pyrene-actin fluorescence quenching and its recovery in the presence of excess unlabeled actin (27Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), that was within 8-fold of WT-MDE (3.1 nm). Previously, similar MDE mutants were shown to decorate actin with the classic arrowhead appearance as demonstrated by electron microscopy (16Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and thus F425W-MDE is likely to bind actin similarly. Therefore, despite slight alterations in ATPase activity and actin binding, F425W-MDE still behaves very much like the wild-type motor protein, displaying enhanced MgATPase rates in the presence of actin with a similar catalytic efficiency to WT-MDE, and maintaining nanomolar affinity for actin in the absence of nucleotide.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of F425W- and WT-MDEMDE construct V max K ATPase k cat K D (actin) s −1 μm μm −1 s −1 nmWT-MDE0.741-aThe maximum actin-activated ATPase (V max) and actin concentration at which there is half-maximal activation (K ATPase) of the mutant and wild-type constructs were determined in MOPS buffer at 37 °C, assuming Michaelis-Menton kinetics.

Open table in a new tab We examined the fluorescent properties of F425W-MDE in the presence of nucleotides and nucleotide analogs to determine how the structural environment of Trp-425 is altered throughout the MgATPase cycle. The peak fluorescence emission of F425W-MDE was reduced (20%) and red-shifted 5–6 nm (339 to 345 nm) in the presence of MgATP, but only slightly reduced (2%) and red-shifted (339 to 341 nm) in the presence of MgADP compared with the nucleotide-free environment (Fig.2 A). The fluorescence emission spectra of F425W-MDE complexed with nucleotide analogs, MgADP-BeFX or MgADP-AlF4−, were identical to that observed in the presence of MgATP (data not shown). To examine the solvent exposure of Trp-425 in the absence of actin in different nucleotide states we performed acrylamide quenching experiments on F425W-MDE in the presence of MgATP and MgADP, and in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 2 B). The Stern-Volmer relationship was used to quantitatively assess the amount of acrylamide quenching (see “Experimental Procedures”). The dynamic quenching constants, indicative of the quenching that occurs by interaction of acrylamide with the excited state of Trp-425, were calculated to be 5.7 ± 0.1, 4.1 ± 0.1, and 4.1 ± 0.1m−1, in the presence of MgATP and MgADP, and absence of nucleotide, respectively. Thus, in agreement with the steady-state fluorescence data, the acrylamide quenching results suggest that Trp-425 is in a more polar solvent-exposed environment in the nucleotide states that bind weakly to actin (M·ATP and M·ADP·Pi) compared with the nucleotide states that bind strongly to actin (M·ADP and M). Therefore, we propose that the significant change in fluorescence intensity and solvent exposure indicates that the actin-binding cleft of smooth muscle myosin adopts a more closed conformation in the strong binding states, and a more open conformation in the weak binding states, of the MgATPase cycle. Crystallographic studies have previously identified two conformations of the actin-binding cleft of myosin. An open conformation was first observed in the chicken skeletal muscle myosin nucleotide-free structure (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar) and subsequently in the presence of analogs mimicking the ADP or ATP states of the MgATPase cycle in Dictyosteliummyosin II structures (5Fisher A.J.

A partial closing of the actin-binding cleft due to a 10° rotation of the lower 50-kDa subdomain was observed in the post-hydrolysis ADP·Pi state of the MgATPase cycle in both Dictyostelium (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M.

Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). However, this partial closing of the actin-binding cleft in myosin observed by crystallography was less than predicted by fitting crystal structures of skeletal (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle myosin (17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) into cryo-EM maps of S1 decorated actin filaments. Our results suggest that the actin-binding cleft in smooth muscle myosin is in a more closed conformation in the strongly bound ADP and nucleotide-free states of the MgATPase cycle relative to the weakly bound ATP and ADP·Pi states even in the absence of actin. This conflicts with the previous crystallographic studies on myosin in which the ADP state was observed to have a more open conformation of the actin-binding cleft than the ADP·Pi state of the MgATPase cycle. Thus, the current study provides evidence for at least one new conformational state of myosin not previously observed by x-ray crystallography or cryo-EM reconstructions (i.e. a closed actin-binding cleft in the ADP or nucleotide-free states of the MgATPase cycles). It is less clear how the open conformation of the actin-binding cleft of myosin in the current study corresponds to the open and/or partially closed conformations observed previously in the weakly bound states of the MgATPase cycle by x-ray crystallography, or whether the tryptophan at position 425 would even be sensitive to such a small partial closing of the actin-binding cleft. The 2-nm red-shift in the peak fluorescence intensity of F425W-MDE induced by the addition of MgADP may also relate directly to changes in the affinity of myosin for actin in different states of the MgATPase cycle. This result suggests a slight alteration in the environment around Trp-425, consistent with a small additional closing of the actin-binding cleft of myosin upon ADP release. In addition, Volkman et al. (17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by comparing the cryo-EM structures in the presence and absence of MgADP that the upper 50-kDa region changes conformation during ADP release, resulting in a small closure of the actin-binding cleft. We have also previously shown that the myopathy loop, which is connected to the same helix that contains Trp-425 (425-helix), changes conformation upon ADP release as well (16Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Overall, the current study, in conjunction with these two previous studies (16Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggests that the MgADP-induced changes in the upper 50-kDa subdomain may mediate the 5-fold increase in actin affinity observed upon ADP release (27Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The transition from the strong to weak actin-binding states of the MgATPase cycle can be monitored by changes in pyrene-actin fluorescence (Table II). The pyrene fluorescence is quenched when myosin is strongly bound to actin (AM) and recovers (indicated by an asterisk on actin in Scheme 2, A*M·ATP) upon formation of the weakly bound acto-myosin complex induced by MgATP binding.Table IITransient kinetic parameters of F425W-MDERate or equilibrium constantTrp-425Pyrene-actin K 1 k +22-aThe second-order rate constant for MgATP binding to F425W-MDE.2.2 (± 0.1) μm−1 s−1 K 1′k +2′2-bSecond-order rate constant for MgATP binding to acto-F425W-MDE.1.6 (± 0.1) μm−1 s−11.4 (± 0.2) μm−1 s−1 k +2′2-cThe maximum rate of MgATP binding to F425W-MDE.631 (± 83) s−1697 (± 77) s−1 k +62-dThe rate of binding to actin in the absence of nucleotide.13 (± 0.8) s−115 (± 0.3) s−1MOPS buffer at 25 °C.2-a The second-order rate constant for MgATP binding to F425W-MDE.2-b Second-order rate constant for MgATP binding to acto-F425W-MDE.2-c The maximum rate of MgATP binding to F425W-MDE.2-d The rate of binding to actin in the absence of nucleotide. Open table in a new tab MOPS buffer at 25 °C. We compared the time course of changes in pyrene-actin fluorescence and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from F425W-MDE bound to pyrene-actin following rapid mixing with MgATP. The time course of the fluorescence change from Trp-425, which was quenched upon MgATP binding to the acto-myosin complex, was well fit by a single exponential and was hyperbolically dependent on the MgATP concentration as shown in Fig. 3 A. The initial slope of the curve demonstrates a second-order binding constant for MgATP binding to actomyosin (K 1′ k +2) of 1.6 ± 0.1 μm−1 s−1 and the maximum rate of the curve (k +2) was calculated to be 631 ± 83 s−1. The second-order binding constant for MgATP binding to F425W-MDE in the absence of actin was similar to values obtained in the presence of actin (K 1 k +2 = 2.2 ± 0.1 μm−1 s−1) (data not shown). The time course of the fluorescence increase of pyrene-actin upon MgATP binding to F425W-MDE was nearly identical (K 1′ k +2 = 1.4 ± 0.2 μm−1 s−1,k +2 = 697 ± 77 s−1) (Fig.3 B) to structural changes in the actin-binding cleft of myosin monitored by changes in the Trp-425 fluorescence. The calculated rate constants for MgATP binding to acto-F425W-MDE are in excellent agreement with those reported in the literature for smooth muscle myosin S1 (27Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Overall, our results demonstrate that Trp-425 changes conformation during the transition from the strongly bound to weakly bound acto-myosin complex, suggesting that MgATP binding opens the actin-binding cleft which dramatically reduces the affinity of myosin for actin, causing dissociation of the acto-myosin complex. Binding of F425W-MDE to actin increased the Trp-425 fluorescenceAM↔K1′AM(ATP)↔k+2′A*M·ATP⇵K8M·ATPScheme 2 A*+M↔k6′AM*Scheme 3 at a rate that increased linearly with actin concentrations between 1 and 5 μm (Fig.4). Binding was modeled according to Scheme 3, where M* represents high F425W-MDE fluorescence and A* represents high pyrene-actin fluorescence. The second-order rate constant for F425W-MDE binding to actin was obtained from the slope (13 ± 0.8 μm−1s−1) and is nearly identical to that obtained with pyrene-actin (15 ± 0.3 μm−1s−1), which reports formation of the strongly bound complex (28Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, Trp-425 is sensitive to the transition from weak to strong actin binding, consistent with closure of the actin-binding cleft upon formation of the strongly bound complex in the absence of nucleotide. More importantly, these results also suggest that actin binding stabilizes a conformation of myosin, not yet seen by crystallographic studies performed in the absence of actin, which allows for a more complete closure of the actin-binding cleft. This last conclusion arises from the fact the fluorescence signal from Trp-425 increases upon actin binding even in the absence of nucleotide, as evidenced by the stopped-flow measurements of the association kinetics between F425W-MDE and pyrene-actin. Our results suggest a simple structural mechanism for coupling conformational changes at the active site to conformational changes in the actin-binding region of myosin. The actin-binding cleft is open in the weak binding states of the MgATPase cycle (M·ATP and M·ADP·Pi) and Trp-425 is in a polar, solvent exposed conformation. Coordination of the γ-phosphate of MgATP by the switch II region, which is connected via the switch II loop to the helix containing Trp-425, may stabilize an open cleft conformation in myosin (see Fig. 1). Phosphate release is associated with closure of the cleft, which shifts Trp-425 to a more nonpolar, solvent protected conformation in the strongly bound states of the MgATPase cycle (M·ADP and nucleotide-free). It is unclear at this time whether phosphate release occurs prior to, simultaneously with, or immediately after cleft closure and formation of the strong actomyosin complex. However, an actomyosin·ADP·Pi complex in which both the upper and lower 50-kDa subdomains are interacting with actin may be required to trigger movement of the switch II region and accelerate the release of phosphate. Furthermore, the release of MgADP from the active site appears to be associated with a more complete closure of the actin-binding cleft and stronger interactions between actin and myosin. This latter conclusion is supported by the current study, previous cryo-EM studies on the acto-smooth muscle myosin complex (17Volkman N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and previous fluorescence studies showing that the myopathy loop at the end of the 425-helix changes conformation upon MgADP release from the active site (16Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a pathway of communication between the active site of myosin, whose occupancy determines the nucleotide state of the MgATPase cycle, and the actin-binding interface, via the 425-helix which extends to the myopathy loop in the actin-binding region of myosin. Finally, MgATP binding to the rigor actomyosin complex reverses the structural changes in the switch II and actin-binding regions of myosin, opening the actin-binding cleft, disrupting the hydrophobic contacts between actin and myosin, and dissociating the actomyosin complex. In summary, our results demonstrate that the conformation of the actin-binding cleft, as probed by fluorescence changes from Trp-425, is indeed an important structural determinant for mediating the affinity of myosin for actin during the contractile cycle. Furthermore, we have shown that the actin-binding cleft of myosin adopts a unique conformation, induced by actin binding itself, which is more closed than observed previously by crystallographic studies. Thus, actin plays a critical role in the molecular mechanism of muscle contraction by inducing conformational changes in myosin required for its function as an efficient molecular motor protein."

Although different MAPKs are regulated by distinct signaling modules, they can be activated by a subset of the same kinases that are used in more than one signaling pathway. Therefore, mechanisms to ensure signaling specificity are required for proper response to distinct stimuli. One emerging mechanism is the formation of multienzyme complexes through scaffold proteins (56Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin.

However, it has not been elucidated how dual specificity MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can be integrated into MAPK signaling complexes or interact selectively with these complexes. SKRP1 (68Zama T.

Although SKRP1 does not bind directly to its target JNK, it specifically co-precipitates with MKK7. Furthermore, SKRP1 and JNK bind to different regions on MKK7. These findings indicate that SKRP1 interacts indirectly with its physiological target JNK through MKK7, thereby leading to the specific regulation of the JNK signaling pathway.

Briefly, immunoprecipitations or glutathione-Sepharose precipitations from cell lysates were carried out using appropriate antibodies together with protein G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) or using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the complexes were processed for in vitro kinase assays using a substrate protein (3.0 μg). For coupled protein kinase assays, 2.0 μg of MAPKs (His-JNK2 and His-p38α) and 5.0 μg of MAPK substrates were used. NIH3T3 cells (1.0 × 105 cells) were transiently transfected with the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene) and the indicated expression plasmids together with pRL-TK (Promega) to measure the transfection efficiency. Expression plasmids were transfected at the following amounts: 200 ng of pFR-Luc, 12.5 ng of pFA-ATF2 (Stratagene), and 200 ng of pRL-TK; 0, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 ng of Myc-SKRP1; 125 ng of HA-MKK7; 125 ng of HA-JNK2. The total amount of DNA (1162.5 ng) was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector DNAs. After culture for 48 h, luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega), in which relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to theRenilla luciferase activities. The relative firefly luciferase activities detected in the cell lysates are presented. The data shown are the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).

This study showed that SKRP1 interacted with MKK7, but not with MKK4, and their selective interaction was detected in both quiescent and activated cells (Fig.1). To explore further the relevance of the interaction of SKRP1 and the MKK7-JNK pathway, we examined the effect of SKRP1 on the MKK7 activity and the activation of transcription by this pathway in mammalian cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MKK7 and GST-JNK2 together with varying amounts of Myc-SKRP1, and both kinases precipitated from the cell lysates were processed for in vitro kinase assays. Coupled protein kinase assays demonstrated that SKRP1 biphasically regulated the phosphorylation of JNK2 by MKK7 (Fig.2 A, top) but did not cause any change in the phosphorylation of JNK2 by MKK4 (data not shown). Furthermore, in parallel to the activity of MKK7, SKRP1 biphasically regulated that of JNK2 induced by MKK7 (Fig.2 A, 2nd panel). Next, we tested whether SKRP1 suppresses the MKK7 catalytic activity by dephosphorylating the critical residues of MKK7 required for its activation. We therefore examined whether the SKRP1 catalytically inactive mutant (SKRP1 C149S) also inhibits the MKK7 activity. HA-MKK7 was co-expressed in COS-7 cells together with SKRP1 C149S at the same amounts as when the inhibitory effect of SKRP1 was detected as shown in Fig. 2 A, followed by a coupled protein kinase assay. This study showed that the inhibitory effect was also detected when SKRP1 C149S was expressed together with MKK7 (Fig. 2 B, top), suggesting that SKRP1 phosphatase activity was not required for this inhibition. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, we observed the stable interaction of SKRP1 with both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of MKK7 (Fig. 2 B, 2nd panel). These findings raised the possibility that SKRP1 disturbs the physical interaction between MKK7 and its substrate JNK and thereby inhibits the MKK7-mediated JNK2 phosphorylation. However, because SKRP1 did not compete with JNK2 for the interaction with MKK7 (68Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23909-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we ruled out this possibility. Finally, because the JNK pathway is known to regulate the transcription factor ATF2 (77van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of SKRP1 expression on the MKK7-induced ATF2 transcriptional activity in either untreated or stress-activated cells. In vitro kinase assays showed that SKRP1 strongly inhibited both TNFα- and thapsigargin-induced JNK activation (68Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23909-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore performed transient reporter-gene assays in untreated or thapsigargin-treated cells, and we found that SKRP1 suppressed or enhanced MKK7-induced ATF2 activity (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the result in Fig.2 A. Thus, overexpression of SKRP1 biphasically regulated signaling through the MKK7-JNK pathway. SKRP1 overexpression within the limited range suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK2 by MKK7, raising the possibilities as described above. However, we ruled out these possibilities because of our observations. Here we found that SKRP1 overexpression also enhances the MKK7-induced JNK2 phosphorylation. The finding i"

Thus, this novel post-translational modification of Tat was found to govern two essential interactions necessary for HIV-1 transcription: binding of Tat to TAR and to positive transcription elongation factor b.In the present work, we analyzed the role of Tat acetyl- acceptor lysines in virus replication. We show that mutation of lysine 28 and lysine 50 to either arginine or glutamine severely affected the replication of HIV-1 in a T-cell line. Additionally, the effect of Lys28 and Lys50 mutation on Tattrans-activation was dependent on the promoter context (integrated versus nonintegrated LTR). Our results highlight the importance of lysine 28 and lysine 50 of Tat in virus replication and the mechanism of Tat-mediated trans-activation.DISCUSSIONThe HIV-1 trans-activator Tat is absolutely required for virus replication and plays a critical role in AIDS pathogenesis. In this report, we have analyzed the role of acetyl-acceptors Lys28 and Lys50 in virus replication and Tat transcriptional activity. Thus, lysines 28 and 50 were mutated to either arginine (to conserve the positive charge) or glutamine (to neutralize the positive charge). By introducing these mutations in the pNL4-3 Tat minus background, using a previously described strategy (45Huang L.M. Joshi A. Willey R. Orenstein J. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,47Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we show that acetyl-acceptor Lys28 and Lys50 play a critical role in virus replication. Mutation of Lys28 or Lys50 to glutamine results in replication-incompetent virus and transcriptionally inactive Tat on integrated and nonintegrated LTR. Interestingly, mutation of lysine 50 to arginine did not affect Tat-mediated trans-activation of either integrated or nonintegrated LTR but led to a 4-day delay in virus replication. Mutation of lysine 28 to arginine affected virus replication and activation of an integrated LTR without affecting LTRtrans-activation in a transient transfection assay.To investigate how mutation of Tat acetyl-acceptor lysines affects Tat transcriptional activity, we analyzed the effect of these mutations on Tat/TAR, Tat/cyclin T1, and Tat/PCAF interactions. Consistent with our previous report (40Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), mutation of lysine 50 to glutamine reduced the ability of Tat to bind TAR RNA without affecting its interaction with cyclin T1 or PCAF. Moreover, Tat K50Q has an altered cellular localization with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in 90% of transfected cells. Thus, the lack of binding of Tat K50Q to TAR RNA and its abnormal cellular localization probably contribute to its inability to support virus replication and trans-activation of the LTR.Tat K28R is able to interact with TAR and cyclin T1 but failed to interact with PCAF, one of the histone acetyltransferases that has been shown to assist Tat-mediated trans-activation of integrated LTR (27Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that the two-exon form of Tat activates an integrated LTR more efficiently than the Tat one-exon form (50Jeang K.T. Berkhout B. Dropulic B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24940-24949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of chromatin, Tat also has to overcome the chromatin repression exerted by the nucleosomal architecture of the integrated provirus (51Verdin E. Paras P., Jr. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 52El Kharroubi A. Piras G. Zensen R. Martin M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this respect, Tat has been shown to disrupt the repressive nucleosome 1 (nuc1) to activate the transcription from integrated LTR (52El Kharroubi A. Piras G. Zensen R. Martin M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of Tat K28R to activate an integrated LTR and, consequently, the reduced replication of viruses carrying this mutation may be due to the loss of its interaction with PCAF. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental difference in the mechanism by which Tattrans-activates an integrated versusnonintegrated LTR.Mutation of Tat Lys28 to glutamine had no effect on Tat/TAR, Tat/cyclin T1, and Tat/PCAF interaction. Despite this, Tat K28Q was transcriptionally inactive on both integrated and nonintegrated LTR. Tat K28Q showed an altered subcellular localization with 44% of transfected cells stained in both cytoplasm and nucleus. The inability of Tat K28Q to activate the LTR and consequently to support virus replication may be explained, at least in part, by its altered subcellular localization. Additionally, K28Q mutation may affect the interaction between Tat and other cellular factors involved in trans-activation of the LTR and virus replication.Mutation of Tat K50R did not affect its interaction with TAR, cyclin T1, or PCAF. Tat K50R activated both integrated and nonintegrated LTRs as efficiently as Tat wild type. However, K50R mutation delayed virus replication by 4 days. Transcriptionally competent Tat mutants unable to support optimal virus replication have been reported previously (47Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How could transcriptionally active Tat fail to support optimal virus replication? Besides its primary function as atrans-activator of the viral promoter, Tat has been shown to have pleiotropic effects on cellular genes and metabolism (20Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Tat is a secreted protein that is taken up by neighboring cells (2Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 3Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It has been shown that soluble Tat protein can activate noninfected cells, thus preparing a favorable cellular environment for virus replication (53Ott M. Emiliani S. Van Lint C. Herbein G. Lovett J. Chirmule N. McCloskey T. Pahwa S. Verdin E. Science. 1997; 275: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Soluble Tat is able to activate transcription factors, such as NF-κB, that in turn activate the HIV-1 promoter (54Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Demarchi F. Gutierrez M.I. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7080-7086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5156-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tat also plays an important role in reverse transcription of the viral RNA (1Harrich D. Ulich C. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the K50R mutation within Tat may affect its nontranscriptional activities and, consequently, virus replication. Consistent with this hypothesis, only 7% of transfected cells showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Tat K50R compared with 22% of Tat wild type-transfected cells, suggesting a defect in its secretion. Taken together, these results suggest that the transcriptional activity of Tat is necessary but not sufficient to support virus replication.Accumulating evidence suggests that Tat may also be an important virulence factor in vivo. Vaccination of nonhuman primates with Tat, either alone or in combination with other viral products, reduces virus replication (6Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas native Tat protein is cytotoxic, a modified Tat protein is considered an attractive target for HIV vaccine development. Thus, identification of Tat mutants able to compete with and inhibit wild-type Tat function will help to engineer the optimal Tat protein vaccine candidate. Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)1 Tat is a regulatory protein encoded by two exons localized on either side of theenv gene. Tat is a multifunctional protein, absolutely required for virus replication and AIDS progression. Besides its primary function as the viral transcription factor, Tat has been proposed to be required for efficient reverse transcription (1Harrich D. Ulich C. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Tat is secreted from infected cells (2Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

Extracellular Tat is a cellular toxin that increases the efficiency of virus dissemination and reduces antiviral immunity to promote HIV-1 disease (6Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8324-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells treated with Tat show increased expression of chemokine receptors (7Huang L. Bosch I. Hofmann W. Sodroski J. Pardee A.B. J.

Furthermore, Tat has been shown to have chemokine-like properties that may serve to recruit chemokine receptor-expressing monocytes/macrophages toward HIV-producing cells and facilitate infection (3Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 4Albini A. Ferrini S. Benelli R. Sforzini S. Giunciuglio D. Aluigi M.G.

Finally, extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein has been shown to selectively inhibit the entry and replication of T-cell tropic X4, but not macrophage-tropic R5, virus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which has been proposed as a mechanism to select against X4 viruses, thereby influencing the early course of HIV-1 disease (13Xiao H. Neuveut C. Tiffany H.L. Benkirane M. Rich E.A. Murphy P.M. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11466-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The primary function attributed to Tat is its role in HIV-1 promoter activation. Tat is an atypical transcriptional activator that functions through binding, not to DNA, but to a short leader RNA,trans-activation responsive region (TAR) localized at the 5′ termini of all viral transcripts (14Berkhout B.

Recently, reporter enzymes in combination with compounds that inhibit proteasome function have been used to study the effect of blocking transcription factor degradation on gene activation. While investigating the effect of proteasome inhibition on steroid receptor activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, we found that treatment with proteasome inhibitors enhanced glucocorticoid activation of the promoter attached to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter, but inhibited activation of MMTV attached to a firefly luciferase or β-galactosidase reporter. MMTV RNA levels under these conditions correlated with the promoter activity observed using the CAT reporter, suggesting that proteasome inhibitor treatment interfered with luciferase or β-galactosidase reporter assays. Washout experiments demonstrated that the majority of luciferase activity was lost if the proteasome inhibitor was added at the same time luciferase was produced, not once the functional protein was made, suggesting that proteasome inhibition interferes with production of luciferase protein. Indeed, we found that proteasome inhibitor treatment dramatically reduced the levels of luciferase and β-galactosidase protein produced, as determined by Western blot. Thus, treatment with proteasome inhibitors interferes with luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter assays, possibly by inhibiting production of a functional reporter protein.

Thus, treatment with proteasome inhibitors interferes with luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter assays, possibly by inhibiting production of a functional reporter protein. The degradation of most proteins in mammalian cells occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (1Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In this process, substrate proteins are covalently linked to multiple ubiquitin molecules, which target the protein to the 26 S proteasome for degradation (2Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a 2-MDa multisubunit complex that degrades proteins in an ATP-dependent manner into peptides 3–20 amino acid residues in length (1Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The proteasome degrades both short-lived proteins (t1/2 < 3 h) and more stable proteins (t1/2 of hours or days). Since 1994, reagents that inhibit proteasome function have facilitated the investigation of protein turnover by this pathway (1Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). These inhibitors are now commonly used to study the degradation of proteins from many cellular pathways. Although one of the proteasome's major roles is the breakdown of misfolded proteins, it also regulates the levels of potent regulatory molecules such as transcription factors, cell cycle proteins, and tumor suppressor proteins (3Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, the relationship between steroid receptor-mediated transcription and receptor degradation has been investigated using proteasome inhibitors in combination with widely available reporter enzymes such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) 1The abbreviations used are: CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGRglucocorticoid receptorMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusdexdexamethasonePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideGAPDHglyceraldehyde dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptase and firefly luciferase (4Lange C.A.

Reporter enzymes such as firefly luciferase, and β-galactosidase and CAT from Escherichia coli, are commonly used in cellular and molecular biology to study promoter activation of genes in mammalian cells. In general, the activity of these reporters is unaffected by the specific treatment regimen, and interference of the treatment with the reporter itself is generally not considered. However, both firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase can be inactivated under conditions of stress to the cell, such as thermal stress, chemical stress, or oxidative stress (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, the interpretation of these assays can be compromised under certain treatment conditions, such as those inducing stress. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glucocorticoid receptor mouse mammary tumor virus dexamethasone polyvinylidene difluoride glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase reverse transcriptase While investigating the effect of proteasome inhibitors on glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, we noticed that several of these compounds interfere with both firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase enzymatic activity in tissue culture cells, while CAT activity is unaffected. MMTV RNA levels induced by glucocorticoid and proteasome inhibitor treatment correlated with CAT activity from the MMTV promoter, but not luciferase or β-galactosidase activity. The inhibition of activity occurred primarily if the proteasome inhibitor was added before production of the protein, rather than after formation of the fully functional protein. Further investigation indicated that proteasome inhibitor treatment reduced the levels of both luciferase and β-galactosidase protein, suggesting that these compounds interfere with production of a functional protein. Thus, use of proteasome inhibitors in combination with the luciferase and β-galactosidase reporters may lead to an unexpected reduction of enzymatic activity and interference with interpretation of these assays. A1-2 cells were derived from T47D breast cancer cells by stable transfection with pGRneo and MMTV-LTR-luc plasmids as described previously (10Nordeen S.K. Kuhnel B. Lawler-Heavner J. Barber D.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GR2 cells were derived by stably transfecting a GR-neo expression vector into a T47D-based cell line lacking the GR, but containing a stably integrated MMTV-CAT reporter (11Kinyamu H.K. Fryer C.J. Horwitz K.B. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20061-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both A1-2 and GR2 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained with 1 μg/ml puromycin (GR2) or 160 μg/ml G418 (A1-2). HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For analysis of integrated MMTV-luc and MMTV-CAT reporters, A1-2 and GR2 cells were plated onto six-well and 100-mm dishes, respectively, and either left untreated or treated with dexamethasone (dex), MG132, or the combination as described in the figure legends to Figs. 1, A, and B, and2A. CAT activity was determined by a kinetic assay and normalized for total protein (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol.

Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase assay system with Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions and normalized for total protein. For analysis of constitutively expressed luciferase, cells were plated onto six-well dishes and transfected the next day with a pGL3-control plasmid (Promega) using the LipofectAMINE Plus protocol (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected for 3 h, then treated as indicated in the figure legends to Fig. 2, C and D. For β-galactosidase assays, cells were plated and transfected the next day with an MMTV-lacZ construct using the same procedure as for the luciferase assay. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system with reporter lysis Buffer (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. All assays were carried out in either duplicate or triplicate.Figure 2Proteasome inhibitors decrease the production of luciferase protein.A, A1-2 cells were treated as described in the schematic and luciferase activity determined.B, A1-2 cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and whole cell lysates prepared.

For β-galactosidase protein determination, cells were transfected with an MMTV-lacZ reporter plasmid the day before treatment. Whole cell lysates were prepared using SDS lysis buffer (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were briefly resuspended in 1× Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing β-mercaptoethanol, then sonicated to shear DNA. Care was taken to ensure that each lysate was produced from the same number of cells. Samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on 8% NOVEX Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with antibodies to luciferase (1:500) (Promega), β-galactosidase (1:500) (Promega), or glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Research Diagnostics Inc.). Cells were left untreated or treated as described in the figure legends to Fig. 1C. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized as described previously (13Fryer C.J. Nordeen S.K. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1175-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For PCR of the cDNA, two separate reactions were run for each experimental condition. The cDNA was combined with 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, 10 pmol of MMTV-619, and 0.25 pmol of MMTV-22. MMTV-22 was end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase to generate a 32P-labeled single-stranded primer. Human β2-microglobulin was similarly amplified using sequences previously described (13Fryer C.J. Nordeen S.K. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1175-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PCR products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screens or autoradiography film for analysis. To investigate the effect of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on glucocorticoid-activated transcription, we used the well characterized steroid-responsive MMTV promoter. Using a similar MG132 dose and time course previously used by others (5Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 6Wallace A.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42714-42721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we observed the same amplification of glucocorticoid-induced transcription in the T47D-based human breast cancer cell line, GR2, as has previously been reported in HeLa cells (6Wallace A.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42714-42721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The GR2 cell line contains the GR and a stably integrated MMTV-CAT reporter construct (Fig. 1A). Treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dex, activated the promoter, and MG132 enhanced this activation. However, using a second T47D-based cell line containing the GR and a different promoter-reporter construct, MMTV-luciferase, we observed contradictory results. In contrast to the enhanced activation of MMTV-CAT by MG132, treatment with this proteasome inhibitor decreased dex activation of the MMTV-luciferase reporter (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 4). This inactivation was not limited to the compound, MG132, because the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and proteasome inhibitor I had the same inhibitory effect. 2B. J. Deroo and T. K. Archer, our unpublished results. To determine whether the luciferase or CAT activity reflected the actual RNA being produced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we analyzed levels of MMTV-luciferase RNA after dex and MG132 treatment (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the observed luciferase activity, MG132 enhanced the dex-induced increase in MMTV-luciferase RNA (Fig. 1C). We observed an identical RNA profile in GR2 cells containing MMTV-CAT (14Deroo, B. J., Rentsch, C., Sampath, S., Young, J., DeFranco, D. B., and Archer, T. K. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol.22, in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, RNA production from MMTV-luciferase matched the activation seen from the CAT, but not luciferase reporter. It appeared that proteasome inhibitor treatment interfered with luciferase activity under the treatment conditions of our assay, but did not affect production of RNA. We next investigated at what stage of luciferase production the inhibition might occur. To determine whether luciferase inactivation by proteasome inhibitors occurred during or after luciferase protein production, we took advantage of the steroid-inducible production of luciferase via the MMTV promoter (Fig. 2A). To study the inactivation of luciferase during protein production, cells were treated for 8 h with dex in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of MG132. To study the effect of MG132 on luciferase after the protein was produced, cells were treated for 8 h with dex, and then the steroid was removed to block further production of luciferase. The cells were then either left untreated (lane 4) or treated with MG132 (lane 5). Compared with the dex-only controls, co-treatment led to a loss of ∼70% of luciferase activity (compare lanes 2 and 3), while post-treatment reduced activity by 25%. Note that some loss of luciferase activity is expected after steroid is removed, because the half-life of luciferase is ∼3 h (compare lanes 2 and 4) (15Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Therefore, the majority of luciferase inactivation occurs if the proteasome inhibitor is present when luciferase protein is initially produced. If proteasome inhibitor treatment interferes with the early stages of luciferase protein formation, then the levels of luciferase protein should be reduced by this treatment in parallel with the loss of activity. We therefore examined luciferase protein levels by Western blot using whole cell SDS lysates with an anti-luciferase antibody after stimulation by glucocorticoid and/or proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2B). As expected, treatment with dex increased luciferase protein levels (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, MG132 treatment reduced these levels dramatically (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4). A control enzyme, GAPDH, was unaffected by these treatments. Therefore, it appears that the loss of luciferase activity is at least partly due to a reduction in luciferase protein levels. We then confirmed that inactivation of luciferase was not a promoter or steroid-dependent phenomenon. Luciferase produced from a plasmid constitutively expressing luciferase (pSV-luciferase) was also inactivated by proteasome inhibitor treatment in both T47D and HeLa cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the reduction in luciferase activity of the MMTV promoter by proteasome inhibitor treatment is not restricted to luciferase produced from a steroid-responsive promoter, but represents a general inhibition of luciferase activity. Both firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase are inactivated by heat shock, ATP depletion, and treatment with ethanol or indomethacin (an anti-inflammatory drug) (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Roussou I. Nguyen T. Pagoulatos G.N. Bensaude O. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine whether proteasome inhibitors would also interfere with β-galactosidase activity. We observed an identical loss of β-galactosidase activity from the MMTV promoter in the presence of proteasome inhibitors as we did for luciferase activity (Figs.1B and 3A). Again, this loss of activity correlated with a loss of β-galactosidase protein (Fig. 3B). Levels of a control enzyme, GAPDH, were again unchanged under identical treatment conditions. It therefore appears that production of both luciferase and β-galactosidase protein is inhibited by treatment with proteasome inhibitors, while RNA production is unaffected. Reporter enzymes are commonly used to study promoter activity both in vitro and in vivo (16Naylor L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Enzymes such as luciferase, β-galactosidase, and CAT are not naturally expressed in mammals, making them particularly useful to study gene expression in mammalian cells. These transcriptional reporters are used in many model systems, treatment conditions, and cell types, but rarely is consideration given to the effect of the treatment on the activity of the reporter enzyme itself. During reporter studies investigating the effect of proteasome inhibition on steroid-mediated transcription of the MMTV promoter, we discovered that proteasome inhibitor treatment enhanced glucocorticoid-mediated transactivation of an MMTV-CAT reporter (Fig. 1A), but had the opposite effect on the MMTV-luciferase reporter (Fig. 1B). Levels of MMTV RNA induced by steroid and proteasome inhibitor treatment duplicated the CAT activity results, but not luciferase activity (Fig. 1C). Wash-out experiments indicated that maximal inactivation occurred if the proteasome inhibitor was present at the time luciferase was initially produced, rather than after luciferase was made (Fig. 2A). The loss of luciferase activity correlated with a general loss in luciferase protein (Fig. 2B). Importantly, this effect of MG132 on luciferase activity was not limited to the steroid dependent activation of the reporter as it was seen for the constitutively active pSV-luciferase reporter (Fig. 2C). Nor was it specific for T47D cells as a similar effect was observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). The observed inactivation and reduced production of luciferase protein was also observed for the β-galactosidase reporter (Fig. 3). Our results suggest that proteasome inhibitors interfere with luciferase and β-galactosidase production by a post-transcriptional mechanism. The inactivation of firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase has previously been reported and usually occurs under conditions of cellular stress. Both enzymes are inactivated by heat shock, ATP depletion, and treatment with ethanol or indomethacin (an anti-inflammatory drug) (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Roussou I. Nguyen T. Pagoulatos G.N. Bensaude O. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In several of these cases, the inactivation occurs because the enzyme is denatured, forming insoluble aggregates that are detected in the insoluble fraction of a cellular lysate (17Nollen E.A. Salomons F.A. Brunsting J.F. Want J.J. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12038-12043Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The accumulation of abnormal or denatured proteins when proteasome function is blocked is known to activate the heat shock response, indicative of the cell's response to a stressful condition (18Zhou M., Wu, X. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We initially considered that the cytotoxic nature of proteasome inhibitors might therefore denature luciferase and β-galactosidase, rendering these proteins insoluble, as has been observed under conditions of cellular stress. In these studies, total levels of luciferase and β-galactosidase in SDS lysates are unchanged, although the levels of protein in the insoluble fraction increase when loss of activity is observed (17Nollen E.A. Salomons F.A. Brunsting J.F. Want J.J. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12038-12043Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Pinto M. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13941-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, we do not observe a loss of solubility,2 but rather a general reduction in luciferase and β-galactosidase protein levels from SDS lysates, in which both insoluble and soluble luciferase are detectable (Figs. 2B and 3B) (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms could explain the loss of luciferase and β-galactosidase protein in response to proteasome inhibitor treatment. One possibility is that the proteasome inhibitor blocks or inhibits translation of these proteins. Second, blocking proteasome function may enhance the proteolysis of newly formed luciferase and β-galactosidase through a proteasome-independent pathway. Third, denaturation of luciferase and β-galactosidase in response to the proteasome inhibitor-mediated cellular stress may render the proteins undetectable by their respective antibodies. However, we consider this third mechanism unlikely, because the same luciferase antibody used in this study readily detects thermally denatured luciferase (21Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thermally denatured β-galactosidase is also readily detectable by its antibody (7Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10487-10492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of protein production is one mechanism by which cells control intracellular pathways (22Macdonald P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following stress, protein synthesis is down-regulated in eukaryotic cells, possibly as a protective mechanism that prevents production of toxic proteins (23Sheikh M.S. Fornace A.J., Jr. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the cytotoxic effect of proteasome inhibitor treatment results in inhibition of production of luciferase and β-galactosidase proteins. In Jurkat cells, proteasome inhibitors can interfere with translation by promoting degradation of eIF4GI, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor that acts as a molecular bridge between components of the ribosomal initiation complex (24Morley S.J. Pain V.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An interesting question is why the production of luciferase and β-galactosidase may be affected, while production of CAT is not. Translational regulation can occur in an mRNA-specific manner, such that translation of one mRNA may be affected while others are not under identical conditions (22Macdonald P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This may at least partially explain why the production of CAT is unaffected by proteasome inhibitor treatment. It is also possible that proteasome inhibitor treatment may trigger the proteolysis of newly formed luciferase and β-galactosidase via a ubiquitin-independent degradation pathway. In addition to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, the calcium-dependent calpain protease degradation pathway is the second major pathway regulating protein turnover in mammalian cells (25Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Perhaps proteasome inhibitor treatment activates calpain-mediated cleavage of luciferase and β-galactosidase. Interestingly, treatment with proteasome inhibitors may trigger apoptosis, and calpain-mediated degradation has been implicated in proteolysis occurring during apoptosis (26An W.G. Hwang S.G. Trepel J.B. Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 27Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Teitz T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In summary, we have observed a novel mechanism by which proteasome inhibitor treatment inactivates firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. These results suggest that consideration should be given to the choice of reporter enzyme used when the transcriptional effect of cytotoxic compounds is investigated.

The present study was performed to develop a new modification for production of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which remain capable of inducing degradation of the target mRNA, are stable in serum, and exhibit less cytotoxicity. For this purpose, we adopted antisense ODNs modified with inverted thymidine at both 5′- and 3′-ends, designated as 5′-,3′-inverted T antisense ODNs, according to recent reports (21Sioud M. Leirdal M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat.

Inverted thymidine modification at 5′- or 3′-ends is aimed to protect the ODNs against exonuclease attack. The utility of the new modification was evaluated by monitoring anti-cancer activity of midkine (MK) antisense ODN produced by the proposed method. MK, a heparin-binding growth factor, is a 13-kDa protein rich in basic amino acids and cysteine (23Kadomatsu K. Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, we established PS-modified antisense ODN targeting MK, which blocked the growth of mouse rectal carcinoma cells (CMT-93) in vitro andin vivo, and indicated its possible usefulness for cancer therapy (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of 5′-,3′-inverted T-modified ODNs and PS-modified ODNs were compared. ODNs modified with inverted thymidine at both 5′- and 3′-ends (5′-,3′-inverted T) or at 3′-end (3′-inverted T) and PS-modified ODNs were synthesized with an automated solid-phase nucleotide synthesizer (Expdite8900 Nucleic Acid Synthesis System, Applied Biosystems) and subsequently purified using a Wakopak Handy ODS column (Waters Associates). The ODNs showed single bands upon 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7 m urea (33Kandimalla E.R. Manning A. Zhao Q. Shaw D.R. Byrn R.A. Sasisekharan V. Agrawal S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The target sequence for MK antisense ODN (core region, 18-mer) corresponded to the region of bases 15–32 of MK mRNA; the region was located shortly after the translation initiation site, and secondary structure prediction indicated that it was in the first loop region after ATG (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of each antisense (AS) ODN used in this study were as follows (cf. Fig.1): 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 5′-TAGGGCGAGAAGGAAGAAGT-3′; 3′-inverted T AS, 5′-AGGGCGAGAAGGAAGAAGT-3′; PS AS, 5′-agggcgagaaggaagaag-3′; 5′-,3′-non-inverted T AS, 5′-TAGGGCGAGAAGGAAGAAGT-3′. Sense (SEN) and reverse (REV) ODNs were also designed as controls as follows: 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN, 5′-TCTTCTTCCTTCTCGCCCTT-3′; 5′-,3′-inverted T REV, 5′- TGAAGAAGGAAGAGCGGGAT-3′; PS SEN, 5′-cttcttccttctcgccct-3′; PS REV, 5′-gaagaaggaagagcggga-3′. The underlined Ts in the above sequences indicate inverted thymidine. Uppercase sequences are PO, and lowercase sequences are PS. We also used ODNs labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at each 5′-end, which were synthesized and purified in a manner identical to the unlabeled one. CMT-93 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) derived from mouse rectal carcinoma were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells (3 × 105/35-mm tissue culture dish) were seeded and transfected for 3 h with ODNs in serum-free medium using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described previously (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection complex contained 5 nmol of ODNs and 6.8 nmol of lipids. Then, 1 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS was added, and incubation was continued for 4 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing insulin (10 mg/ml), transferrin (5.5 mg/ml), sodium serenite (6.7 ng/ml), and heparin (20 μg/ml). After 16 h of incubation, conditioned medium was collected for analysis. The transfection complex (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T.

ODNs (5 × 10−11 mol) were labeled at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in 50 μl of reaction mixture as described previously (34Tari A.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 313: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was placed in the upper chamber of Microcon YM3 (cut off value 3,000 Da, Millipore Corp.). After adding 200 μl of MilliQ water, it was centrifuged (4,000 × g, at room temperature), and the procedure was repeated 4 times. Material remaining in the upper chamber was regarded as 32P-labeled ODNs. Five nmol of unlabeled ODNs was mixed with 25 pmol of32P-labeled ODNs and complexed with LipofectAMINE PLUS, which contained 6.8 nmol of lipids as described before (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). It was then placed in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (cut-off value 10,000 Da, Pierce) and dialyzed against 2 liters of MilliQ water for 2 h. MilliQ water was changed twice, and radioactivity remaining in the cassette was determined. ODN-transfected CMT-93 cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well. Three hours later, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cells were cultured for up to 5 days. Cell proliferation was monitored using a cell counting kit (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan). Cells (2 × 105/well in a 24-well plate) were seeded in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured overnight. Then, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN or PS SEN was added to cultures. The final concentrations of ODNs were 0, 50, 100, and 200 μm as indicated in Fig. 3. Twenty four and 48 h later, cell survival was monitored using a cell counting kit as described above. Cells were seeded in Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) coated with Permanox and transfected with FITC-labeled various ODNs. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and mounted using a ProLong® Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Cells were photographed using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). Proteins in conditioned media were separated by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (35Kadomatsu K. Hagihara M. Akhter S. Fan Q.W. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated with rabbit anti-MK antibody (35Kadomatsu K. Hagihara M. Akhter S. Fan Q.W. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Bioscience). Quantitative analysis of the blots was performed with an imaging densitometer. A total of 1.5 × 106untransfected CMT-93 cells were subcutaneously inoculated in 0.3 ml of serum-free medium through a 24-gauge needle into both lower flanks of 8-week-old athymic nude mice obtained from SLC (Tokyo, Japan). After 7–9 days when tumors reached an average volume of ∼60 mm3, the tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into five different treatment groups (5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN, 3′-inverted T AS, PS AS, and PS SEN). All ODNs were dissolved in DMEM and mixed with an equal volume of atelocollagen (final concentration of atelocollagen, 1.75%) kept at 4 °C and injected directly into the tumor region as reported previously (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentration of PS SEN and AS was 50 μm and that of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and SEN and 3′-inverted T AS was 200 μm. Each therapeutic reagent (50 μl) was injected into the tumors every 2 weeks after the first injection. Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, Nagoya University School of Medicine. Tumor diameters were measured at regular intervals with digital calipers, and tumor volume in mm3 was calculated by the formula: volume = (width)2 × length/2 (36Burfeind P. Chernicky C.L. Rininsland F. Ilan J. Ilan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Cationic liposome (LipofectAMINE PLUS) as a delivery reagent was examined in tumor therapy experiment. One hundred μl of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS stock solution (1 mm) and the plus reagent (50 μl) were mixed in DMEM (100 μl). After immediate mixing with a Vortex mixer and standing at room temperature for 15 min, the LipofectAMINE reagent (25 μl) in DMEM (225 μl) was added, and the mixture was left at room temperature for 15 min. Fifty μl of the mixture was injected into the preformed tumor. On day 14, another injection was done, and tumor diameters were monitored as described above. Each ODN was incubated in 5% FBS at 37 °C. Aliquots of the reaction were removed at different time intervals for electrophoretic analysis. Nuclease reactions were stopped by adding formamide gel loading buffer to each sample and heating at 95 °C for 10 min (33Kandimalla E.R. Manning A. Zhao Q. Shaw D.R. Byrn R.A. Sasisekharan V. Agrawal S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All samples were then run on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 murea (Bio-Rad) and visualized by staining with a SYBR® Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). All reagents for PAGE were nuclease-free grade. To test the stability of ODNs complexed with liposome, each ODN was at first mixed with cationic liposome reagent (LipofectAMINE PLUS). Thus, 2.5 μl of each ODN stock solution (1 mm) and the plus reagent (5 μl) were mixed in MilliQ water (52.5 μl) in a small sterile tube. After immediate mixing with a Vortex mixer and standing at room temperature for 15 min, the LipofectAMINE reagent (2 μl) in MilliQ water (50 μl) was added, and mixture was left at room temperature for 15 min. 5.9 μl of FBS was added (final 5%) to the transfection complex (112 μl), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. For calculation of the half-life of each ODN in serum, all bands were analyzed with an imaging densitometer, GelDoc 1000 system (Bio-Rad). ODNs (200 μm 5′-,3′-inverted T AS or 50 μm PS AS) in 50 μl of 1.75% atelocollagen were subcutaneously injected into both lower flanks of 8-week-old male athymic nude mice. One and 7 days after injection, blood was taken from the infraorbital vein and after allowing to clot for 1 day (4 °C), and sera were analyzed using HITACHI Clinical Analyzer 7170 by SRL, Inc. (Nagoya, Japan). Seven days after injection, mice were killed, and gross anatomy of organs was examined. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and probability values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate significant differences. We examined whether 5′-,3′-inverted T AS can decrease MK secretion in CMT-93 rectal carcinoma cells. 5′-,3′-Inverted T AS transfected with the aid of a cationic liposome reagent (LipofectAMINE PLUS) suppressed synthesis and secretion of MK (Fig.2 A, lane 1), whereas 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN and 5′-,3′-inverted T REV showed no effects (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Densitometric analysis of the blots revealed that 5 μm5′-,3′-inverted T AS decreased MK production to 9% of that in controls (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). We also observed that 3′-inverted T AS and PS AS exhibited almost identical effects after transfection (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and5). These inhibitory effects on MK production by 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and 3′-inverted T AS were dose-dependent (Fig. 2 B). We also examined whether the nature of the complex formed between the cationic lipid delivery agent and ODNs were different depending on ODNs. When FITC-labeled ODNs were mixed with LipofectAMINE PLUS and observed by confocal microscopy, the diameter of the particles of the labeled complex was 278.5 ± 65.6 nm (n = 20) for PS AS, 293.5 ± 53.8 nm (n = 20) for PS SEN, 285.3 ± 48.4 nm (n = 20) for 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 310.4 ± 53.9 nm (n = 20) for 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN, 289.6 ± 48.6 nm (n = 10) for 5′-,3′-inverted T REV, and 274.5 ± 43.5 (n = 10) for 3′-inverted T AS. The results indicated that the size of the complex was not different between PS AS, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 3′-inverted T AS, and other controls. To measure the amount of ODNs bound to liposomes, we relied on the observation that ODNs complexed with liposomes stay within the dialysis tube after dialysis, whereas free ODNs are dialyzed out (34Tari A.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 313: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, without LipofectAMINE reagents, only 2% of 32P-labeled ODNs stayed in the dialysis apparatus after the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, around 70–80% of32P-labeled ODNs were in the dialysis apparatus in the presence of the LipofectAMINE reagents. Actual values were as follows: 82.2% for 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 73.0% for 3′-inverted T AS, and 72.7% for PS AS. Therefore, the efficiency of the complex formation was not significantly different between different ODNs. In the transfection complex the amount of ODN was 5 nmol, of which about 75% formed complex with liposomes, and the amount of lipids was 6.8 nmol. Thus, the ratio of ODNs to lipids in the liposome was about 1:1.8 When a high dose of PS SEN was added to cultures of CMT-93 cells, it showed noticeable cytotoxic effects on survival of the cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.3 B). On the other hand, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN showed almost no cytotoxicity at least up to 48 h (Fig. 3 A). The cellular uptake and distribution of 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN and PS SEN were examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, both FITC-labeled 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN and PS SEN showed similar cellular distributions, mainly in nuclei as stained by propidium iodide, indicating that both ODNs entered the cells and reached the inside of the nuclei upon cationic liposome-mediated transfection. FITC-labeled 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 5′-,3′-inverted T REV, 3′-inverted T AS, and PS AS showed similar localization and intensity in the cell, excluding the possibility that the relative difference of uptake affected the result. The presence or absence of FITC did not change their effects on MK production in the case of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN (Fig. 2 C), and 3′-inverted T AS (data not shown). ODNs with the natural PO backbone are digested by nucleases in less than 5 minin vivo, making them unsuitable for therapeutic use (4Sands H. Gorey-Feret L.J. Cocuzza A.J. Hobbs F.W. Chidester D. Trainor G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 932-943PubMed Google Scholar, 5Agrawal S. Temsamani J. Galbraith W. Tang J. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1995; 28: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PS-modified ODNs are considerably more stable in vivo (6Smith C.C. Aurelian L. Reddy M.P. Miller P.S. Ts'o P.O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2787-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,37Zhang R. Diasio R.B. Liu T. Jiang Z. Galbraith W.M. Agrawal S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Any modified ODN that would be useful as an antisense agent should show reasonable stability against nucleases as well as acceptable hybridization with the target mRNA. Thus, we studied the stability of ODNs in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS. Fig.5 shows the stability of the ODNs under these conditions. 5′-,3′-Non-inverted T AS was quickly digested by nucleases in serum, consistent with the reported data on PO-ODN (4Sands H. Gorey-Feret L.J. Cocuzza A.J. Hobbs F.W. Chidester D. Trainor G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 932-943PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h, only a faint band of intact ODN was present (Fig. 5 D). Unexpectedly, PS-modified ODN was not stable in serum, as indicated in Fig. 5 C. In contrast to the above observations, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and 3′-inverted T AS were strongly resistant to nucleases in serum (Fig. 5, A andB). In the case of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, even though intact 5′-,3′-inverted T AS disappeared by 24 h, the produced fragment, probably 3′-inverted T AS, remained intact for up to 96 h. The half-lives of each ODN determined by densitometric analyses were as follows: 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 30 h; 3′-inverted T AS, 110 h; PS AS, 10 h; 5′-,3′-non-inverted T AS, 5 h. We also examined the stability of the complex of ODNs and LipofectAMINE PLUS to serum nucleases (Fig. 5). The complex formation to liposome generally increased the stability of ODNs, and more than half 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and most 3′-inverted T AS remained as the original one even after 96 h. As compared with them, PS AS and non-inverted T AS were still much more unstable. Transfection of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS into CMT-93 cells inhibited their growth especially 3–5 days after addition (Fig.6). However, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN showed no such effects (Fig. 6). We also observed a similar inhibitory effect of 3′-inverted T AS. We then injected preformed tumors with 5′-,3′-inverted T AS. Untreated CMT-93 cells were inoculated into nude mice as described previously (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). Nine days after inoculation when a palpable tumor was formed, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS, 3′-inverted T AS, PS AS, 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN, or PS SEN, which were premixed with atelocollagen, was injected into the tumor, and the injection was repeated every 14 days. 5′-,3′-Inverted T AS markedly suppressed tumor growth as compared with 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN and PS SEN (p < 0.001) (Fig.7 A). 3′-Inverted T AS also significantly suppressed tumor growth as compared with 5′-,3′-inverted T SEN (p < 0.001). PS AS also suppressed tumor growth, as reported previously (Ref. 32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 7 A). As tumor volume at the initial injection in the present experiment (Fig. 7 A) was larger than that in the previous report, the effect of PS AS was slightly less as compared with that in the previous report (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8486-8491PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the tumor-suppressive effect of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS was greater than that of 3′-inverted T AS and PS AS (p < 0.01). In the above experiment, tumor growth was monitored by determining tumor volume estimated with digital calipers. At the end of the study (41 days after initiation of tumor therapy), all animals were sacrificed, and tumor weight was determined. 5′-,3′-Inverted T AS significantly suppressed the increase of tumor weight as compared with controls (Fig. 7 B). We used atelocollagen as the carrier of ODNs, because liposomes do not consistently give good delivery in vivo (38Dean, N. M., and Mckay, R. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 11762–11766Google Scholar). Indeed, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS showed much weaker effects, when LipofectAMINE PLUS was used as a carrier (Fig. 8). Injection of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS or PS AS in atelocollagen at the dose used for tumor therapy did not show apparent toxicity to nude mice. Thus, serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were not different between control animals and those injected with the above ODNs in atelocollagen (data not shown). Gross anatomy of organs was also unaffected. Antisense therapeutics using synthetic oligonucleotides are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer, inflammation, and viral diseases (12Monteith D.K. Levin A.A. Toxicol. Pathol. 1999; 27: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most antisense ODNs under development for clinical application contain a PS backbone, whereas side effects and toxicities were reported to be induced by PS-modified ODNs (12Monteith D.K. Levin A.A. Toxicol. Pathol. 1999; 27: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In primates, the primary acute side effects are associated with complement activation (13Galbraith W.M. Hobson W.C.

Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and systemic effects due to accumulation of high concentrations of PS-modified ODNs in the kidneys (39Henry S.P. Bolte H. Auletta C. Kornbrust D.J. Toxicology. 1997; 120: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Horner M.J. Monteith D.K. Gillett N.A. Butler M. Henry S.P. Bennett C.F. Levin A.A. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 36 (suppl.): 147Google Scholar). In rodents, the primary side effect is immune stimulation characterized by lymphoid hyperplasia and mononuclear cell infiltrates in multiple tissues (14Henry S.P. Monteith D. Levin A.A. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar). At extraordinarily high doses (15–50 times the planned clinical doses), hepatocellular (>50 mg/kg) and renal tubular degeneration (>100 mg/kg) are evident in rodents (14Henry S.P. Monteith D. Levin A.A. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sarmiento U.M. Perez J.R. Becker J.M. Ramaswamy N. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Henry S.P. Grillone L.R. Orr J.L. Brunner R.H. Kornbrust D.J. Toxicology. 1997; 116: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Henry S.P. Taylor J. Midgley L. Levin A.A. Kornbrust D.J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the liver, Kupffer cell hyperplasia and exacerbation of background foci of inflammatory cells were observed as typical effects induced by PS-modified ODNs (12Monteith D.K. Levin A.A. Toxicol. Pathol. 1999; 27: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of the liver toxicity was not clear. To overcome the toxic effects of PS-modified ODNs described above, 5′-,3′-inverted T antisense ODNs were devised as new reagents to suppress gene expression, and their effectiveness was confirmed by suppression of MK synthesis, leading to suppression of growth of CMT-93 rectal carcinoma in nude mice. 5′-,3′-Inverted T MK antisense ODN indeed exhibited less toxicity than the PS MK antisense ODN. Thus, we could administer larger amounts of 5′-,3′-inverted T MK antisense ODN and obtain better therapeutic effects than with the use of PS MK antisense ODN. In the presence of serum, 20-mer 5′-,3′-inverted T AS was converted to a slightly shorter oligonucleotide, probably a 19-mer, and remained stable. On the other hand, the 19-mer 3′-inverted T AS was stable in serum. These results suggested that 5′-inverted T of 5′-,3′-inverted T AS was susceptible to an exonuclease in the serum, whereas the 3′-inverted T was resistant to the nuclease. Consistent with these observations, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and 3′-inverted T AS exhibited similar growth inhibitory activity to CMT-93 rectal carcinoma cells. However, 5′-,3′-inverted T AS exhibited stronger antitumor activity in nude mice than 3′-inverted T AS. Exonucleases in the tumor tissue probably degraded these AS in a manner different from that in serum. Recently, various new strategies have been introduced to produce antisense DNA, e.g. replacement of the sugar-phosphate backbone to 2-aminoethyl glycine (16Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Berg R.H Buchardt O. Science. 1991; 254: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar, 45Egholm M. Nielsen P.E. Buchardt O. Berg R.H. J. Am. Chem.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Comparative evaluation of the 5′-,3′-inverted T AS and these new reagents should be performed in future studies. Nucleotide-mediated therapeutics require effective delivery systems. Atelocollagen is produced by elimination of antigenic telopeptides attached to both ends of the collagen with pepsin (47Ochiya T. Takahama Y. Nagahara S. Sumita Y. Hisada A. Itoh H. Nagai Y. Terada M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, it is neither antigenic nor toxic in animals. In addition, atelocollagen is liquid at 4 °C and a gel at 37 °C. Satisfactory delivery of plasmid DNA (47Ochiya T. Takahama Y. Nagahara S. Sumita Y. Hisada A. Itoh H. Nagai Y. Terada M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and PS-modified ODNs (32Takei Y. Kadomatsu K. Matsuo S. Itoh H. Nakazawa K. Kubota S. Muramatsu T.

Kubota, submitted for publication. via atelocollagen was recently achieved. The present study shows that atelocollagen is also suitable for delivering another DNA structure, 5′-,3′-inverted T ODN, and supports the usefulness of atelocollagen in delivery of various DNA compounds. The antisense strategy is a hopeful new approach to cure malignant tumors (48Tamm I. Dorken B. Hartmann G.

https://openalex.org/W2042009143,"The solution structure of antimicrobial peptide tachystatin A from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and distance-restrained simulated annealing calculations. The correct pairs of disulfide bonds were also confirmed in this study. The obtained structure has a cysteine-stabilized triple-stranded β-sheet as a dominant secondary structure and shows an amphiphilic folding observed in many membrane-interactive peptides. Interestingly, tachystatin A shares structural similarities with the calcium channel antagonist ω-agatoxin IVA isolated from spider toxin and mammalian defensins, and we predicted that ω-agatoxin IVA also have the antifungal activity. These structural comparisons and functional correspondences suggest that tachystatin A and ω-agatoxin IVA may exert the antimicrobial activity in a manner similar to defensins, and we have confirmed such activity using fungal culture assays. Furthermore, tachystatin A is a chitin-binding peptide, and ω-agatoxin IVA also showed chitin-binding activities in this study. Tachystatin A and ω-agatoxin IVA showed no structural homology with well known chitin-binding motifs, suggesting that their structures belong to a novel family of chitin-binding peptides. Comparison of their structures with those of cellulose-binding proteins indicated that Phe9 of tachystatin A might be an essential residue for binding to chitin. The solution structure of antimicrobial peptide tachystatin A from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and distance-restrained simulated annealing calculations. The correct pairs of disulfide bonds were also confirmed in this study. The obtained structure has a cysteine-stabilized triple-stranded β-sheet as a dominant secondary structure and shows an amphiphilic folding observed in many membrane-interactive peptides.

Therefore, antimicrobial proteins, lectins, and phenoloxidases play the most important role in the host-defense activities of invertebrates (1Hoffmän J.A. Reichhart J.M. Hetru C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Söderhall K.

Although vertebrate animals have acquired innate immunities and are defended by their complex defense activities, invertebrate animals cannot use the diversification of antibodies, and the defending molecules must distinguish self from nonself. Self-defense by antimicrobial substances involves a direct attack on infectious agents. This is the fundamental mechanism of the host-defense systems identified in all species, including both invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and is an important object of study with regard to biological and immunological self-defense reactions. The defense actions of the horseshoe crab have been found to be carried out by innate immune substances derived from hemocytes in hemolymph plasma (2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem.

Whereas the hemolymph of crustacean animals in general have three kinds of hemocytes (granular, small granular, and nongranular), in the case of the horseshoe crab, granular hemocytes comprise 99% of all hemocytes. The granular hemocytes contain two kinds of granules, large and small, which store the peptides and proteins related to self-defense activities (7Toh Y. Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The clotting factors are stored in the large granules, and most antimicrobial substances are present in the small ones (7Toh Y. Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The hemocytes are sensitive to lipopolysaccharides, which are major components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and defense molecules are secreted by exocytosis to clot body fluid and to kill infectious pathogens in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation (2Iwanaga S.

Tachystatin A consists of two isopeptides made up of 44 amino acid residues; tachystatin A1 contains phenylalanine at the C-terminal end, and tachystatin A2 contains tyrosine at the corresponding site (9Osaki T. Omotezako M. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. Kasahara J. Hattori J. Sugiyama H. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26172-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Tachystatin A inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and fungi (9Osaki T. Omotezako M. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. Kasahara J. Hattori J. Sugiyama H. Kawabata S.

Whereas tachystatin A has no similarities with the other three peptides in terms of molecular mass or amino acid sequence, tachystatin A shows weak sequence similarity to ω-agatoxin IVA (ω-aga IVA)1 (10Mintz I.M.

Because the horseshoe crab is an invertebrate animal phylogenetically close to spiders and scorpions, it is possible that both molecules have a common ancestor. Furthermore, tachystatin A has a chitin-binding property that is a common feature of the components of small granular derived antimicrobial peptides. It is likely that this property has two explanations. First, the property may be important for killing fungal pathogens, because chitin is one of the major components of the fungal cell wall. Second, this property may contribute to the healing of the damaged exoskeleton of the horseshoe crab, since chitin is the major component of this exoskeleton. In this study, we determined the structure of tachystatin A in an aqueous solution using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and distance geometry-simulated annealing calculations. The solution structure involved a triple-stranded β-sheet and two β-turns. This folding differed from that of the antimicrobial peptides, tachyplesins (13Kawano K. Yoneya T. Miyata T. Yoshikawa K. Tokunaga F. Terada Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15365-15367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tachycitin (14Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), isolated from the horseshoe crab. With respect to the chitin-binding property, no chitin-binding domains with the structural motif of tachystatin A have yet been found. In this paper, we show that the folding of tachystatin A produces a unique motif not only as an antimicrobial peptide but also as a chitin-binding peptide. Hemocyte debris from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) was prepared by the methods of Nakamura et al. (4Nakamura T. Furunaka H. Miyata T. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Niwa M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16709-16713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tachystatin A was purified by the methods of Osaki et al. (9Osaki T. Omotezako M.

Samples were prepared for NMR spectroscopy by dissolving tachystatin A in 10% D2O, 90% H2O or 99% D2O at a final concentration of 2 mm. The sample pH was adjusted to 3.5 to observe amide protons by decreasing the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates. All NMR spectra were observed on a JEOL JNM-alpha 500 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 500 MHz with a sample temperature of 298 K. Two-dimensional DQF-COSY (15Rance M. Sørensen O.W.

Soc. 1985; 107: 6394-6396Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar) measurements were recorded in a phase-sensitive mode. TOCSY spectra were obtained with mixing times of 80 and 100 ms. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 100, 150, and 300 ms. For water signal suppression, the DANTE pulse method (20Zuiderweg E.P.R. Hallenga K. Olejniczak E.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 70: 336-343Google Scholar) was applied to all NMR experiments. The proton chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate-2,2,3,3-D4. The spectral width of all measurements was 6002.40 Hz. All two-dimensional measurements were recorded with 1024 × 512 frequency data points and were zero-filled to yield 1024 × 1024 data matrices except for the high resolution DQF-COSY and E. COSY. High resolution DQF-COSY and E. COSY were recorded with 4096 × 512 data points in thet 2 and t 1 dimensions, respectively, and zero-filled to 8192 × 8192 points to measure the coupling constants. All NMR data were processed by NMRPipe software (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11561) Google Scholar). Time domain data in both dimensions were multiplied by a sine bell window function with a 90° phase shift prior to Fourier transformation. Base-line correction was applied using a fifth order polynomial. All NMR spectra were assigned with the program XEASY (22Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra recorded with the samples dissolved in H2O were used to identify the spin systems of all residues. In addition, one-dimensional and DQF-COSY spectra were used to identify the amide protons protected from solvent exchange using a sample that had been lyophilized from H2O solution and resuspended in D2O. Three-dimensional structures of tachystatin A were calculated with the program X-PLOR 3.1 (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) on the R5000 processors of a Silicon Graphics Indy work station. Distance restraints for calculations were estimated from the cross-peak intensities in NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 150 ms; the estimated restraints were then classified as strong, medium, or weak and assigned upper limits of 2.7, 3.5, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Pseudo-atom corrections were used for unresolved NOE cross-peaks and those of methyl protons, nonstereospecifically assigned methylene, and aromatic protons according to the protocol of X-PLOR. In addition, 0.5 Å was added to the upper limit of the distance constraints of only the involved methyl protons according to the report by Clore et al. (24Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The restraints of the dihedral angle φ were based on3 J HNα coupling constants measured in high resolution DQF-COSY and E-COSY. When3 J HNα was more than 8.0 Hz, the dihedral angle φ was constricted to −120 ± 40°. Hydrogen bond restraints were used as distance constraints of 1.5–2.5 Å between amide protons and carbonyl oxygens and 2.5–3.5 Å between amide nitrogens and amide protons. All analyses of r.m.s. of difference values as well as secondary and tertiary structures of tachystatin A were performed with the program MOLMOL (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). Tachystatin A was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2m urea, and digested with trypsin and thermolysin (E/S ratio = 1:20, w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digest was separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Chemcosorb 5-ODS-H column (2.1 × 150 mm; Chemco Scientific Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Peptides containing disulfide bonds were identified by amino acid analysis after performic acid oxidation. Antimicrobial activity of ω-agatoxin IVA was assayed as described by Saito et al. (5Saito T. Kawabata S. Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Cho J. Nakajima H. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Pichia pastoriswas plated on nutrient agar plates. Fungal culture was collected at the logarithmic phase of growth, washed twice with 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and adjusted to 5000–10000 cells/ml with the same buffer. The peptide solution (50 μl) was added to 450 μl of the fungal suspension, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (100 μl) was then plated onto the agar plate. After 24 h of incubation at 30 °C, the number of colonies on the plates was counted. As a control experiment, the phosphate buffer was added to the fungal suspension, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h, plated on agar, and cultured. Chitin (0.5 mg) was mixed with ω-aga IVA in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 mNaCl and 2 mm CaCl2 and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was washed with 1 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl. The peptide concentrations of the eluate were determined using a micro BCATM protein assay kit from Pierce. Well resolved spectra were obtained for the sample conditions and methods described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cross-peaks observed in all of the two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were assigned completely. Fig. 1 summarizes the sequential assignments derived from NOESY with a mixing time of 150 ms. The sequential NOE connectivities deduced from the combination of overall strong d αN(i, i+ 1) and weak d NN(i, i + 1) indicate that the peptide is rich in β-structures (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Medium and long range NOEs were also assigned completely using NOESY spectra, and no characteristic NOEs for the helical structure were found as a result of the sequential assignments. The analysis of the one-dimensional spectra and DQF-COSY, which were recorded 24 h after dissolving the sample in D2O, revealed the backbone amide protons of Phe9, Cys11, Leu27, Thr28, Arg30, Gly39, Arg40, Cys41, and Gln42 exchange slowly with a deuterium solvent, thus indicating that these amide protons form hydrogen bonds or are buried inside the molecule. The coupling constants between αH and backbone NH,3JHNα, the value of which is used to determine the restraint of dihedral angle φ, were estimated from the high resolution DQF-COSY spectrum. Generally, residues consisting of a β-sheet produce a value of more than 8.0 Hz for3JHNα, and those consisting of an α-helix produce a value of less than 6.0 Hz (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Coupling constants3JHNα of more than 8.0 Hz were identified for 17 of the 44 residues in tachystatin A, and there were no peaks with a3JHNα value of less than 6.0 Hz. Slowly exchanging amides and coupling constants3JHNα are also summarized in Fig. 1. The above evidence regarding 3JHNα and exchange rates as well as the properties of sequential assignments may suggest that tachystatin A is rich in β-structures. It was possible to identify the secondary structure of tachystatin A as consisting of a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet constructed by Phe9–Val12, Thr28–Arg30, and Gly39–Gln42 from the compatible combination of NOEs, φ angle values estimated from 3JHNα, and hydrogen bonds predicted by slowly exchanging amide protons. As an important factor in the determination of the β-sheet, three long range NOEs were observed between αHs, which are located between Asn10 and Arg40, Val12 and Tyr38, and Cys29 and Cys41. Fig.2 shows a schematic diagram of this β-sheet structure, including the observed NOEs and hydrogen bonds. From these analyses, it was found that the main element of the secondary structure of tachystatin A is a triple-stranded β-sheet with a topology of +2x, −1 (27Hyberts S.G. Märki W. Wagner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Tachystatin A was treated with iodoacetamide in the presence of 8 m urea, under nonreducing conditions. Amino acid analysis revealed that no cysteine residues wereS-alkylated, thereby indicating the presence of three disulfide bonds. The intact tachystatin A was digested with trypsin and thermolysin, and one disulfide-containing peptide (T-TL-15) was isolated, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” By amino acid analysis, T-TL-15 was found to be composed of two chains, Phe9–Cys11 and Leu27–Arg30, indicating the presence of a disulfide linkage of Cys11–Cys29. Peptides containing the remaining two disulfide bonds could not be isolated, because the -Cys23-Cys24- sequence was highly resistant to proteolytic digestion. These disulfide bonds connecting Cys23, Cys24, and the remaining two cysteine residues have been established by nuclear magnetic resonance, which we used to elucidate the conformational structure of tachystatin A. We carried out the structural calculations using the program X-PLOR version 3.1 (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) to determine the three-dimensional solution structure of tachystatin A with the restraints derived from NMR experiments. This solution structure consisted of 274 intramolecular NOEs, 19 dihedral angles, and 22 hydrogen bonds. The 274 NOEs as distance restraints included 56 intraresidues (‖i −j‖= 0), 120 sequential (‖i −j‖= 1), 20 medium range (2 ≤‖i −j‖≤ 4), and 78 long range (‖i −j‖≥ 5) NOEs. In the first step, the structure calculations were performed without the restraints of dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, or disulfide bonds and with only the distance constraints estimated from the NOE intensity. Restraints with large violations were removed or modified in this step. In the next step, a total of 22 hydrogen bond and three disulfide bond restraints were added for calculation. Hydrogen bond restraints were added for the pairs indicated in the analysis of secondary structure shown in Fig. 2. Although three pairs of disulfide bonds are composed of six cysteines, positions 4, 11, 23, 24, 29, and 41 in this molecule, only one pair, Cys11–Cys29, was determined by chemical methods. There are three possibilities in the other two pairs, Cys4–Cys23 and Cys24–Cys41, Cys4–Cys24 and Cys23–Cys41, and Cys4–Cys41 and Cys23-Cys24. In the NOESY spectra, the NOE cross-peaks that correspond to disulfide bonds were observed between the β protons of Cys4 and Cys24 and of Cys23 and Cys41. However, no NOE cross-peaks corresponding to the other patterns of disulfides were observed. These results strongly suggested that the reasonable disulfide bonds are Cys4–Cys24 and Cys23–Cys41. In addition, to confirm the correct connections from the standpoint of energetic study, the calculations were performed with Cys11–Cys29 connectivity and with one of three patterns of disulfide bond connectivities, Cys4–Cys23 and Cys24–Cys41, Cys4–Cys24 and Cys23–Cys41, or Cys4–Cys41 and Cys23–Cys24. Well converged structures were then obtained in the case of Cys4–Cys24 and Cys23–Cys41 at 110 kcal/mol and 80 kcal/mol lower than the structures obtained with disulfide bonds Cys4–Cys23 and Cys24–Cys41 and Cys4–Cys41 and Cys23–Cys24, respectively, in terms of the average total molecular potential energy calculated by X-PLOR. The energy analysis of these sets of structures proved that the disulfide bonds Cys4–Cys24 and Cys23–Cys41 were the correct bonds, so these pairs were used for the final calculation step. Finally, a family of 20 accepted three-dimensional structures was selected with the lowest potential energies that contained no experimental violations greater than 1.0 Å and 1° in the distance and torsion angle restraints, respectively. In a Ramachandran plot, 99.6% of the backbone dihedral angles of the 20 converged structures fall either in the β-sheet region or in generally allowed regions. A summary of the energetic statistics for tachystatin A is shown in TableI. Pairwise r.m.s. of difference values for the 20 lowest energy structures of well defined regions of the 4–14, 21–32, and 37–42 residues were found to be 0.70 Å for backbone atoms and 1.63 Å for all heavy atoms when the structures were fitted in this region.Table IStructural statistics for 20 structures of tachystatin AParametersValuesAverage potential energies (kcal mol−1)1-aE impr,E VDW, E NOE, andE cdih are the energy of improper torsion angles, the van der Waals repulsion energy, the square well NOE potential energy, and the dihedral potential energy, respectively.

The distances between αC atoms at positions i and i + 3 of the first (Leu6–Phe9) and second (Cys24–Leu27) β-turns were 5.16 and 5.39 Å, respectively. Although the first turn had a nearly type II conformation from the viewpoint of the dihedral angles of constructing residues, there was no capability to form an intraturn hydrogen bond, because Phe9 was involved in the first strand, and the carbonyl formed a hydrogen bond with the amide of Cys41. This turn was therefore defined as a β E γ-type turn (29Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) (i.e. a type IV turn (miscellaneous type) in the classical nomenclature). In contrast, the second turn has a typical type II (βPγ-type) conformation with an intraturn hydrogen bond between Cys24 and Leu27. The loop regions with disordered conformation were constructed by Tyr16–Pro22 (loop 1) and Tyr32–Thr37 (loop 2). The average r.m.s. of difference values for these loops were 2.57 and 1.63 Å for the backbone atoms, respectively, when the structures were superposed as shown in Fig. 3. Both loops were rich in hydrophobic residues, and most of these residues were exposed to solvent. Because the hydrophobicity encourages interaction with the membrane, these loops might be an important factor in interactions with the bacterial membrane. Whereas few structural similarities have been identified between tachystatin A and other invertebrate antimicrobial peptides, it has been found that tachystatin A shows a weak amino acid sequence homology (22%) with ω-aga IVA (10Mintz I.M.

Nevertheless, using a chimeric receptor approach, we previously found that RYK can signal via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Recently, it has been shown that murine Ryk can bind to and be phosphorylated by the ephrin receptors EphB2 and EphB3. In this study, we show that human RYK associates with EphB2 and EphB3 but is not phosphorylated by them. This association requires both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of RYK and is not dependent on activation of the Eph receptors. It was also previously shown that AF-6 (afadin), a PDZ domain-containing protein, associates with murine Ryk. We show here that AF-6 does not bind to human RYK in vitroor in vivo. This suggests that there are significant functional differences between human and murine RYK. Further studies are required to determine whether RYK modulates the signaling of EphB2 and EphB3.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2009-2014PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of RYK is quite short when compared with other RTKs,1 being only 183 amino acids long. It appears to be largely devoid of features characteristic of other RTKs, such as immunoglobulin-like domains (5Williams A. Barclay A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar), fibronectin type III repeats (6Petersen T. Thogersen H. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Sahl P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), or cysteine-rich domains (7Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J. Dull T. Gray A. Tam A. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). However, it contains two leucine-rich motifs that are usually implicated in highly specific protein/protein interactions (8Schneider R. Schneider-Scherzer E. Thurnher M. Auer B. Schweiger M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4151-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in cell adhesion (10Rothberg J. Jacobs J. Goodman C. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2169-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). There is also a tetrabasic protease cleavage site (KRRK) flanked by two cysteine residues in the extracellular domain that is predicted to give rise to two fragments. Another interesting feature in the extracellular domain of RYK is the presence of a WIF (Wnt inhibitoryfactor) module (11Patthy L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 12-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that RYK may bind to one of the members of the Wnt family of proteins. The ability of RYK to signal downstream was investigated using a chimeric receptor approach (2Katso R.M. Russell R.B. Ganesan T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This conclusively demonstrated that the catalytic domain of RYK is inactive and that the amino acid alterations in the activation domain contribute to the lack of catalytic function. However, a tyrosine-phosphorylated 75-kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor, independently of stimulation, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was observed following stimulation of the receptor. Interestingly, when the invariant lysine in subdomain II of the catalytic domain was mutated to alanine (K334A), abolishing any existing kinase activity, the receptor failed to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to bind and/or phosphorylate the 75-kDa protein. Further, RYK is overexpressed in ovarian tumors, and this correlates adversely with survival (12Katso R.M. Manek S. Ganjavi H. Biddolph S. Charnock M.F. Bradburn M. Wells M. Ganesan T.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of RYK is unknown, and its ligand has not been identified. A mouse model, where Ryk was homozygously deleted by homologous recombination, revealed an unusual, completely penetrant phenotype (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mice were small, compared with wild type, and died within a week because of cleft palate. Such a phenotype has been found in other knockout mice, including those lacking members of the Ephrin receptor family (14Orioli D. Henkemeyer M. Lemke G. Klein R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6035-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that although Ryk cannot autophosphorylate, it can associate and be phosphorylated by two members of the Eph family of receptors: EphB2 and EphB3 (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Ephrin receptor family, which consists of 14 members, has been shown to mediate contact-dependent cell interactions that regulate the repulsion and adhesion mechanisms involved in the cell guidance and assembly of multicellular structures (15Holder N. Klein R. Development. 1999; 126: 2033-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Feng G.P. Laskowski M.B. Feldheim D.A. Wang H.M. Lewis R. Frisen J. Flanagan J.G. Sanes J.R.

They are important in the development of a range of vertebrate species, in the formation of blood vessels, axonal guidance, and metastasis of transformed cells (15Holder N. Klein R.

Yeast two-hybrid analysis, using the cytoplasmic domain of murine Ryk as a probe, has identified an interaction with AF-6, a PDZ domain-containing protein (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This interaction involved the PDZ domain of AF-6 and the C-terminal region of Ryk, especially the critical C-terminal valine residue. This valine residue is completely conserved among RYK homologues from Drosophila to human. AF-6 is a scaffold protein found at sites of cell-cell contact and a target of the Ras family of proteins (18Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The RYK.V5 plasmid was constructed by cloning RYK (GenBankTM accession number NM002958) in pTracer (Invitrogen) in frame with the V5 tag. A NotI site was created at the 3′ end of the cDNA, and the TGA stop codon was mutated to TGG by PCR using the primer TGAGCGGCCGCGAGAGGAGCCAGACGTAGG. The RYKEC construct was made by cloning an EcoRI-HindIII fragment (nucleotides 1–1201; GenBankTM accession number NM002958) in frame with GFP in pEGFP vector (CLONTECH). The recombinant human NGF was purchased from R & D Systems. The N-terminal TrkA-specific monoclonal antibody 5C3 was a gift from U. Saragovi, the N-terminal anti-mouse Ryk antibody RYK3 was a gift from Steven Stacker (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research) (24Halford M.M. Oates A.C. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Stacker S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7379-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the anti-human RYK polyclonal antibody 15.2 was raised against the C-terminal region of RYK (25Katso R.M. Manek S. Biddolph S. Whittaker R. Charnock M.F. Wells M. Ganesan T.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2265-2270PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies are commercially available: AF-6 (Transduction Laboratories), EphB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Trk N-terminal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), HA tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), V5 tag (Invitrogen), His tag (Novagen), GFP mouse monoclonal (CLONTECH), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). HEK293T cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For double transfections, RYK.V5 and HA.EphB3 or EphB2 were used in the ratio 4:1. The cells were treated with 1 mm sodium butyrate, a nonspecific transcriptional inducer, 5 h after transfection. 24–48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Alternatively, radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) was used to lyse cells. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The cell lysates were incubated with antibodies and protein A- or G-agarose beads at 4 °C. All of the immunoprecipitations were washed twice in lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl and once in unsupplemented lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols and then transferred onto nylon membranes. The antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's conditions. The 15.2 and RYK3 antibodies were used 1:500 in 1% milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for blotting. For the induction studies with NGF, cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline and then incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium 30 h after transfection. The quiescent cells were stimulated with recombinant human NGF (100 ng/ml) for different time intervals (0, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min) before being lysed. The catalytic domain of RYK (nucleotides 1019–2138; GenBankTMaccession number NM002958) was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-TTAACTGCAGAGAAGTGTCACTCTTTTGGAG-3′ and M13 reverse primer from pBluescript. The cDNA was cloned as aPstI/EcoRI fragment in a baculovirus vector (pBlueBacHis2; Invitrogen) in frame with a His tag on the N-terminal end and expressed in SF9 cells. The cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10, grown at 27 °C, and lysed after 4 days in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, the protein was bound on a cobalt-Sepharose column (Talon, CLONTECH) for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. The resin was washed thoroughly with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl, 50 mm imidazole. The protein was concentrated using a Centriplus YM-10 (Amicon), dialyzed against a 20 mm Tris, pH 8, solution, and stored at −70 °C in 10% glycerol. HA.EphB3 was transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. 1 μg of purified RYK catalytic domain was bound to protein G-agarose beads using an anti-His antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl and twice in kinase buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The proteins bound to the agarose beads were resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. They were washed in kinase buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted, and phosphorylation was detected using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. For the kinase assay using full-length RYK as a substrate, HA.EphB3, Myc.AF-6, and RYK.V5 were transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA tag, and anti-AF-6 and anti-V5 antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl and twice in kinase buffer. HA.EphB3 was resuspended with Myc.AF-6 or RYK.V5 in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed in kinase buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted, and phosphorylation was detected using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. A Myc-tagged AF-6 construct was transfected in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. The cell lysate from untransfected HEK 293T cells was also immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody. The protein G-agarose beads were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline, and 1 μg of the purified RYK catalytic domain, RYK.cat, was added. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in lysis buffer and resuspended in sample buffer before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Transfection of HEK 293T cells with a C-terminal V5-tagged RYK, followed by immunoprecipitation by an anti-V5 antibody and immunoblotting with the same antibody, identified two major signals: a set of bands at around 80 kDa (comprising three bands of 70, 75, and 80 kDa) and another at 45 kDa. The 45-kDa band was detected by the anti-V5 (Fig.1 A) and 15.2 antibodies (a polyclonal antibody directed against a C-terminal epitope from RYK) (Fig. 1 C). The RYK3 antibody, directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor (24Halford M.M. Oates A.C. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Stacker S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7379-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), only detected the high molecular mass bands of 70, 75, and 80 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The 45-kDa form must therefore lack the part of the extracellular domain containing the RYK3 epitope. It is probable that the receptor is cleaved at the tetrabasic protease cleavage site (KRRK), which would remove the first 192 amino acids, resulting in a predicted protein of 41 kDa. Surprisingly, whereas the anti-V5 antibody detects all of the isoforms, the 15.2 antibody does not recognize the 75- and 80-kDa bands. RYK has not been shown to have catalytic activity, in vitro on a peptide substrate, using the whole protein or the catalytic domain on its own produced in bacteria (1Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We undertook to study the ability of RYK to autophosphorylate using a biochemical approach. We cloned the catalytic domain in a baculoviral vector, expressed it in SF9 insect cells, and purified it under nondenaturing conditions. An in vitrokinase assay using the purified protein showed that the catalytic domain of RYK is unable to autophosphorylate (Fig.2). As a positive control, EphB3 was phosphorylated in the presence of ATP. We transfected HEK 293T cells with RYK.V5 together with HA.EphB3 or a kinase-inactive mutant of EphB3 (EphB3K665R) (21Buchert M. Schneider S. Meskenaite V. Adams M.T. Canaani E. Baechi T. Moelling K. Hovens C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Upon immunoprecipitation of RYK by the anti-V5 antibody, both wild type EphB3 and EphB3K665R were detected (Fig.3, A–C). This shows that EphB3 and RYK interact and that this association is not dependent on activation and phosphorylation of the Eph receptor. However, although the binding with RYK was demonstrated under stringent conditions using radioimmune precipitation buffer (data not shown), there was no phosphorylation of RYK (Fig. 3 D) when it is co-expressed with EphB3. To further evaluate the ability of EphB3 to phosphorylate RYK, we performed an in vitro kinase assay on immunoprecipitated proteins. HEK 293T cells were transfected with HA.EphB3, RYK.V5, or Myc.AF-6, and these proteins were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies. An in vitro kinase assay was performed using immunoprecipitated EphB3 and RYK or AF-6, and their phosphorylation was detected with 4G10 antibody. EphB3 failed to phosphorylate full-length RYK (Fig.4, A, B, andD), whereas the positive control AF-6 was phosphorylated (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). Furthermore, EphB3 was unable to phosphorylate the catalytic domain of RYK in anin vitro kinase assay (data not shown).Figure 4In vitro kinase assay using full-length RYK as a substrate. EphB3, RYK.V5, and AF-6 were immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293T cells using anti-HA, anti-V5, and anti-AF-6 antibodies, respectively. An in vitrokinase assay was performed using immunoprecipitated EphB3 as a kinase and RYK.V5 or AF-6 as a substrate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody blot shows phosphorylation of EphB3 and AF-6 when they are present in the kinase assay.

Interestingly, only the 80-kDa form of RYK associated with EphB3, suggesting an essential role of the extracellular domain of RYK for this interaction. We also investigated the interaction between RYK and EphB2 (Fig.6). When both receptors were expressed transiently in HEK 293T cells and EphB2 was immunoprecipitated, only the 80-kDa form of RYK was detected (Fig. 6, A–C), although it is possible that the 45-kDa band was not detected because of unspecific bands. A phosphotyrosine blot (Fig. 6 D) showed that EphB2 was activated but did not phosphorylate RYK. This suggests that, similar to EphB3, the association between RYK and EphB2 is dependent on the extracellular domain of RYK and does not lead to the phosphorylation of RYK. To investigate further the association between RYK and EphB3 and assess whether the extracellular domain of RYK is required for the interaction to take place, we co-expressed EphB3 and a TrkA-RYK chimeric receptor or EphB3 and TrkA as a negative control. The TrkA-RYK chimeric receptor contains the extracellular domain of TrkA, the NGF receptor, and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of RYK (2Katso R.M. Russell R.B. Ganesan T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When expressed, TrkA is a 120-kDa protein, and TrkA-RYK is 140 or 120 kDa, depending on its state of glycosylation. The chimeric receptor, lacking the extracellular domain of RYK, did not associate with EphB3 (Fig.7). We then wanted to assess whether the extracellular domain of RYK on its own was able to bind EphB3. We constructed a GFP-tagged cDNA (RYKEC) containing the extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains of RYK and co-expressed it with EphB3 in HEK 293T cells (Fig.8). The predicted size of RYKEC protein, together with GFP (30 kDa), is 70 kDa. On transfection, the protein migrated at 85 kDa on SDS-PAGE, probably because of glycosylation. When EphB3 was immunoprecipitated, RYKEC did not associate with it, suggesting that the whole receptor is required for the interaction between RYK and EphB3. The C-terminal end of RYK possesses a consensus sequence for the binding of a PDZ domain (Fig.9). The C-terminal tyrosine and valine residues are completely conserved. Because RYK is devoid of catalytic activity and PDZ domains do not bind to phosphorylated amino acids (26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 27Kornau H. Schenker L. Kennedy M. Seeburg P. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 28Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), it is possible that RYK may signal via a PDZ domain-containing protein. Of several PDZ domain-containing proteins, only AF-6 has been shown to bind RTKs such as EphB2 and EphB3. In the light of previous results (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we wished to evaluate whether AF-6 bound to RYK. When the TrkA-RYK chimeric receptor, which contains the entire cytoplasmic domain of RYK, and AF-6 were co-expressed in HEK 293T cells, they did not associate, whether AF-6 (Fig.10, A and B) or the chimeric receptor (Fig. 10, C and D) was immunoprecipitated. EphB3, which was used as a positive control for the interaction, was immunoprecipitated with AF-6 (Fig. 10, Eand F). The possibility that AF-6 may bind to RYK when the latter is stimulated was excluded when no association was observed after stimulation of TrkA-RYK with NGF (data not shown). Transfection with full-length untagged RYK could not be used in these experiments because the 15.2 antibody has a low affinity for immunoprecipitation. To further verify whether there is direct interaction between the proteins, we used the purified His-tagged catalytic domain of RYK. AF-6 was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293T cells and mixed with RYK.cat under physiological conditions. Subsequently, after washing the agarose beads, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted. As shown (Fig. 11), AF-6 does not bind in the presence of excess amounts of the catalytic domain of RYK. RYK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to a small family of individually distinct receptors that are devoid of catalytic activity (29Kroiher M. Miller M.A. Steele R.E. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mechanism of signaling by these receptors is best understood for ErbB3 (30Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We have observed several forms of the RYK protein in transfected cells with different molecular masses: 45, 70, 75, and 80 kDa. The three high molecular mass bands are full-length receptors, because they are recognized by the V5 antibody and the RYK3 antibody specific to the extracellular domain. The three different sizes could be due to differences in the glycosylation status of the protein, although other post-translational modifications could occur because the 75- and 80-kDa bands are not detected by the 15.2 antibody. The epitope against which this antibody is directed is a 17-mer peptide located at positions 548–564 of the RYK protein. It contains a cysteine that could be converted to formylglycine; this modification occurs in sulfatases at a late stage of co-translational protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (31Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There are also two glutamate residues in the peptide that could be converted to carboxylglutamate by a carboxylase (32Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). If such post-translational modifications occur in the RYK protein, the modified forms of RYK may not be recognized by the 15.2 antibody. The 45-kDa band is not detected by the RYK3 antibody directed against the extracellular domain and must be a truncated form of the receptor, presumably resulting from the cleavage of the extracellular domain. This cleavage is very likely to take place at the tetrabasic protease cleavage site (KRRK). Ectodomain cleavage occurs frequently among cell surface transmembrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases such as ErbB4 (33Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It seems to be a general mechanism to modulate receptors by down-regulating ligand-induced signaling (39McCarthy M.J. Burrows R. Bell S.C. Christie G. Bell P.R. Brindle N.P. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar, 40O'Bryan J.P. Fridell Y.-W. Koski R. Varnum B. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 551-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because only the full-length RYK and not the 45-kDa form co-immunoprecipitates with EphB3 and EphB2, it seems likely that, like with other RTKs, the ectodomain cleavage of RYK regulates the receptor, either by preventing binding of the unknown ligand or the binding of other receptors. The heterodimerization of RTKs belonging to two different families is unusual, but it has been reported. The EGF and PDGF receptors have been shown to heterodimerize independently of receptor stimulation, and transactivation of EGFR was observed after stimulation with PDGF. EGFR transactivation by PDGF did not depend on PDGF receptor kinase activity, but phosphorylation of one of the receptors, or of a protein that links the receptors, by a Src kinase was required to maintain heterodimer formation (41Saito Y. Haendeler J. Hojo Y. Yamamoto K. Berk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6387-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The interaction between RYK and the Eph receptors is unusual because RYK does not get phosphorylated and therefore may have a role different from that of analogous interactions involving typical RTKs. RYK could act as an inhibitor of EphB2 and EphB3 by preventing homodimerization of these receptors, but data provided by knock out mice for these receptors seem to suggest that RYK and these two Eph receptors may co-operate in vivo. RYK is required in normal development and morphogenesis of craniofacial structures and the limbs (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Neonatal mice doubly deficient in EphB2 and EphB3 phenocopy RYK-deficient mice in terms of cleft palate but also show commissural axon defects (14Orioli D. Henkemeyer M. Lemke G. Klein R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6035-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that are reminiscent of theDrosophila drl phenotype (42Callahan C.A. Bonkovsky J.L. Scully A.L. Thomas J.B.

RYK could co-operate with the Eph receptors in several ways. EphB2 and EphB3 are able to bind to several ephrin B ligands, and RYK, when heterodimerized with these receptors, could modulate their affinity to a particular ligand. This has been observed in the EGFR family of RTKs where, for instance, neuregulin-α can bind to ErbB3 but does not activate the receptor when it is co-expressed with EGFR (46Pinkas-Kramarski R. Shelly M. Guarino B.C. Wang L.M. Lyass L. Alroy I. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Moyer J.D. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Bacus S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. Alamandi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6090-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). RYK could also modulate signaling downstream of the Eph receptors by recruiting specific cytoplasmic proteins. Our results indicate that both the intracellular and extracellular domains of RYK are required for the interaction with EphB3. It has been observed in the ErbB family of RTKs that stimulation of the isolated extracellular domains of the receptors leads to homo-oligomerization but not hetero-oligomerization (48Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggests that regions outside the extracellular domain are required for heteromeric interactions, as is the case for RYK and the Eph receptors. We have demonstrated in this study that the association between RYK and EphB2 or EphB3 does not result in the phosphorylation of RYK. However, a previous study (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed that, when the receptors are co-expressed, murine Ryk associates with and is phosphorylated by EphB2 and EphB3. In both studies, co-transfections were performed in HEK 293T cells with the same EphB3 cDNA construct, but we used a human RYK cDNA, whereas the authors used the murine homologue, Ryk. The ability of EphB3 to phosphorylate RYK could not be detected, either in vivo or in vitro. The identity between the human and murine cDNAs is very high (93%), but our results indicate that they do not signal in the same way. The species-dependent phosphorylation of a substrate by a kinase has been observed in the case of p53 (49Jardine L.J. Milne D.M. Dumaz N. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7602-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Murine p53 can be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas human p53 is not, suggesting species-specific differences in the modification and therefore possibly the regulation of the protein. Further, using a murine Ryk homologue, the authors of a previous study (13Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were able to show that AF-6, a PDZ domain-containing protein, could interact with the receptor via its PDZ domain and that the C-terminal valine of Ryk was essential for this interaction. AF-6 is a Ras effector located at sites of cell-cell junction (18Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Yamamoto D. Prasad R. Croce C. Canaani E. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind to EphB2 and EphB3 (20Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to show any interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of human RYK and AF-6. The co-transfection experiments, performed using the TrkA-RYK chimera to be able to immunoprecipitate RYK, did not correlate with the data obtained using murine Ryk, although only the extracellular domain of RYK was missing from the receptor. The observed differences in the data can only be explained as being due to species specificity. The C-terminal parts of the human and mouse receptors, which is the AF-6 binding peptide, are identical, but another motif, present only in the mouse homologue, could also be required for the interaction. AF-6 binds to EphB2 and EphB3 only if these receptors are activated and phosphorylated (20Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); the C-terminal motif of the receptors is therefore not the only feature needed for the interaction with AF-6. In summary, our results suggest that the human homologue of RYK, although it binds to EphB2 and EphB3, is not phosphorylated by these receptors. Further studies exploring the mechanism by which RYK may modulate signaling by EphB2 and EphB3 are required. We thank Dr. S. Stacker, Dr. K. Kaibuchi, Dr. T. Pawson, and Dr. U.

These subgroups compose the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (7Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar), and the p38/RK/CSBP kinases. ERKs are activated by a range of stimuli including growth factors, cell adhesion, tumor-promoting phorbol esters, and oncogenes (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar), whereas JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by proinflammatory cytokines, and a variety of environmental stresses such as UV and osmotic stress (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 3Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). For this reason, the latter are classified as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Activation of the MAPKs is achieved by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues within a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif located in the kinase subdomain VIII. This phosphorylation is mediated by a dual specificity protein kinase, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK is in turn activated by phosphorylation mediated by a serine/threonine protein kinase, MAPKK kinase (1Widmann C.

Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). In addition to these activating kinases, several types of protein phosphatases have been also shown to control MAPK pathways by dephosphorylating the MAPKs or their upstream kinases. These protein phosphatases include tyrosine-specific phosphatases (9Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Saxena M. Williams S.

Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) (13–30). Therefore, the activities of MAPKs can be regulated by upstream activating kinases and protein phosphatases (31Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 32Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 33Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). DSPs are one emerging subclass of the tyrosine-specific phosphatase family and dephosphorylate both phosphothreonine and an adjacent phosphotyrosine residue. Most of them inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating the critical phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues within a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif and therefore are termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) (31Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 32Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

Here we have identified and characterized a novel dual specificity MKP that is highly specific for JNK in vitro and negatively regulates the activation of the JNK pathway. We also found that the enzyme interacts physically with the MAPKK MKK7, a JNK activator, but not with JNK. Thus, these findings suggest that the enzyme interacts indirectly with its physiological target JNK through MKK7, consequently leading to the specific regulation of JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, we have termed this novel enzyme SKRP1, as (SAPK pathway-regulatingphosphatase 1. Unless otherwise noted, routine chemical materials were obtained from either Sigma or Wako (Osaka, Japan). Molecular standards and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). To identify novel DSPs, we employed degenerate PCR-based method and EST data base searching using consensus DSP phosphatase domain as a template, and we isolated several clones encoding a novel sequence. By concatenating overlapping EST clones, we readily obtained putative full-length cDNA sequences, including SKRP1. The full-length SKRP1 sequence was amplified from the mouse embryonic cDNA library with a sense primer 5′–GTGCTCTTCTCTGGAAGG–3′ and an antisense primer 5′–TCCGGATCCTTTAAAATGTATTAATTCAGG–3′, corresponding to the both ends of cDNA. The coding sequence of SKRP1 was amplified with a sense primer 5′–GAATTCGTCGACATGCATTCCCTGAACCAAAAAATC–3′ having aSalI site and an antisense primer 5′–GCGGCCGCTGCAGTCACAGACCATGGGTCGTGTC–3′ having a NotI site to bear an in-frame fusion to epitope-tagged expression vectors. To isolate the human homologue of SKRP1, we screened human EST data base using murine full-length SKRP1 cDNA as a probe, and we obtained overlapping clones that match the 5′– and 3′–ends of the SKRP1 sequence. Based on the sequences from these clones, we designed a sense primer 5′–TTCTCCAACGAAGTCTTATA–3′ and an antisense primer 5′–AGCATTTAATCACACATTAT–3′ and cloned putative full-length cDNA from 293 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR. GST and GST fusion proteins GST-SKRP1, GST-SKRP1 C149S, GST-SKRP1 A156S, GST-JSP-1, GST-JSP-1 C88S, GST-MKP-6, GST-MKP-6 C111S, GST-cJun-(1–79), or GST-MKK7 were expressed inEscherichia coli DH5α using the pGEX vector (AmershamBiosciences) and were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (35Moriguchi T.

His-tagged proteins His-SKRP1, His-JNK2, and His-MKK7 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using pET-32b vector (Novagen) and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-SKRP1, GST-SKRP1 C149S, GST-SKRP1 A156S, GST-JSP-1, GST-JSP-1 C88S, GST-MKP-6, and GST-MKP-6 C111S were incubated at the indicated concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH, and the pNPP hydrolysis was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. pSRα-HA1-ERK2 (Xenopus MAPK, MPK1) (36Gotoh Y. Moriyama K. Matsuda S. Okumura E.

HA-SKRP1 was also constructed in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Mouse MKK7 coding region was amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into pME-HA or pME-GST to generate pME-HA-MKK7 or pME-GST-MKK7, respectively. Various derivatives of mouse MKK7 were amplified with oligonucleotide primers having appropriate restriction sites such that they could generate in-frame insertion of the coding regions, and the resultant PCR products were subcloned into pME-HA. The nucleotide sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. SKRP1 C149S mutants were generated in a standard two-step megaprimer PCR with mutated oligonucleotides as primers and full-length SKRP1 complementary DNA as a template. The first step included two PCRs that span the mutation site. Final PCR products were cloned into appropriate vectors, and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 and 293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. NIH3T3 or BALB/3T3 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimum essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For transfection assays, cells were transfected with the appropriate combinations of expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector DNAs. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MAPKs or GST-MAPKs. After culture for 24 h, the cells were left untreated or treated with 250 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate after serum deprivation for 8 h (for ERK2) or 10 μg/ml anisomycin (for JNK2 and p38α) and then incubated for 20 min. Tagged MAPKs were precipitated from the cell lysates by incubation with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), or with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the indicated amounts of His-SKRP1, His-SKRP1 C149S, GST-SKRP1, GST-JSP-1, or GST-MKP-6 in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mmMgCl2. The reaction products were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies specific to dually phosphorylated MAPKs (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phosphothreonine antibody (PTR-8, Sigma), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (SC-508, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein concentration was assessed using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were loaded at 50 μg per well and separated by SDS-PAGE. After overnight transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocking for at least 5 h in Tris-buffered saline, 5% non-fat skim milk, and 0.1% Tween 20, blots were hybridized and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). A 1.1-kb fragment of mouse SKRP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime II DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled probe was hybridized to a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum to SKRP1 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide NH2-GCAHDLELLRKHKVTHILNV-COOH (the bold letters correspond to residues 80–97 of the mouse SKRP1 protein), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Cells were lysed on ice in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were clarified at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and either analyzed immediately or stored at −80 °C. Immunoprecipitations or glutathione-Sepharose precipitations from cell lysates were carried out using anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) together with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) or using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase assays were initiated by the addition of each substrate protein (3.0 μg) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were terminated after 20 min at 30 °C by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and the phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. NIH3T3 or BALB/3T3 cells were seeded in 8-well culture slides (BIOCOAT, BD PharMingen) overnight and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc. laboratories) for SKRP1 staining and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc. laboratories) for JNK2 staining, respectively, to detect bound primary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Permafluor (Lipshaw Immunon). Fluorescent images were Kalman-averaged and analyzed by using a MicroRadiance laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). GST or GST fusion proteins (1.0 μg) immobilized on 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with the indicated His-tagged proteins or cell lysates in lysis buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensively washing with the same buffer, glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were immunoblotted for the presence of His-tagged proteins or HA-tagged MKK7 derivatives using mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (Qiagen) or rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (MBL), respectively, followed by Coomassie staining. 1% of the proteins used in binding reactions was also loaded as a positive control (Input). Metabolic labeling of cells was performed in methionine-free medium supplemented with35S-EasyTag (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to 0.2 mCi/ml for 5 h. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer and precipitated with 1.0 μg of GST or GST-SKRP1 fusion proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate combinations of expression plasmids were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (38Whitmarsh A.J.

The glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were then washed five times with lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and examined by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. DSPs display a high degree of sequence similarity within an active site sequence motif. Therefore, to identify novel DSPs, we used both degenerate PCR-based methods and EST data bases for cDNA fragments containing this conserved motif. Several genes were isolated from a mouse embryo and human embryonic kidney (293) cells, includingJSP-1 (30Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and MKP-6 (26Marti F. Krause A. Post N.H. Lyddane C. Dupont B. Sadelain M. King P.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One clone encodes a novel protein, which we have termed SKRP1. The sequence of the mouse SKRP1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB051896) revealed an open reading frame of 220 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 25,000 (Fig.1 A). The human (GenBankTM accession number AB063186) SKRP1 cDNA has 83% sequence identity with full-length mouse SKRP1 cDNA (data not shown) and encodes protein of 217 amino acids that have 81% sequence identity with the mouse SKRP1 protein (Fig.1 B). The SKRP1 protein contains the extended active site sequence motif conserved in all DSPs, within which the cysteine residue is essential for catalytic activity (Fig. 1 C) and displayed 33–40% identity to the phosphatase catalytic domains of other members of the DSP family (Fig. 1 D). However, the predicted amino acid sequence of SKRP1 does not contain two N-terminal Cdc25 homology domains (CH2 domains), characteristic of almost other members of DSP family (Fig. 1 D). The radial dendrogram showed that SKRP1, JSP-1 (30Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) constitute a subfamily of DSPs (Fig. 1 E). To determine whether SKRP1 possesses intrinsic phosphatase activity, GST-SKRP1 fusion proteins were assayed for enzymatic activity towardp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), compared with JSP-1 (30Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and MKP-6 (26Marti F. Krause A. Post N.H. Lyddane C. Dupont B. Sadelain M. King P.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), two members of DSP family. These GST fusion proteins hydrolyzed pNPP in a dose-dependent manner, and sodium vanadate, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine-specific phosphatase, effectively inhibited this catalytic activity (Fig.2 A). A point mutation in the catalytic cysteine of SKRP1 (C149S) abolished the phosphatase activity as seen in JSP-1 and MKP-6 (Fig. 2 A), indicating that SKRP1 C149S is a catalytically inactive mutant of SKRP1. Similar phosphatase activities were obtained with His-tagged SKRP1 proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, these studies showed that SKRP1 was 10–fold less active toward pNPP compared with JSP-1 and MKP-6 (Fig.2 A). Three amino acids, Asp, Cys, and Ser, in the active site sequence motif (Fig. 1 A, shaded box) have been shown to contribute to the catalytic mechanism of DSPs (45Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 46Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E.

Therefore, to examine whether the natural replacement S156A of SKRP1 protein is responsible for its low phosphatase activity, we compared the catalytic activity of SKRP1 with that of SKRP1 A156S using in vitro phosphatase assay. However, these studies showed that both proteins exhibited the similar enzymatic activities in vitro(Fig. 2 B). Since each DSP has its own substrate specificity for MAP kinases (MAPKs) (31Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 32Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 33Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we tested the activity of SKRP1 toward different MAPKs in vitro. Dually phosphorylated HA-MAPKs were immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells that had been treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (for ERK2 activation), or anisomycin (for JNK2 and p38α activation). Each sample was incubated with His-SKRP1 or His-SKRP1 C149S in vitro, and the phosphorylation state of each MAPK was examined by immunoblotting using the indicated anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. The results showed that SKRP1 is highly specific for JNK2 in vitro, suggesting that SKRP1 is a novel member of MKP family (Fig.2, C and D). Furthermore, we investigated whether SKRP1 is a DSP that dephosphorylates both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues. As shown in Fig. 2 E, dually phosphorylated JNK was dephosphorylated on both residues by SKRP1. Thus, these findings suggested that SKRP1 is indeed a dual specificity MKP. A polyclonal antiserum to SKRP1 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide encompassing the residues 80–97 (Fig. 1 C,double underline) of the mouse SKRP1 protein, which are not homologous to other DSPs. Immunoblotting analysis of NIH3T3 cells revealed that antiserum to SKRP1 recognizes a protein of 27 kDa co-migrating with an in vitro translated35S-labeled SKRP1. In contrast, preimmune serum from the same rabbit did not react with this protein (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, SKRP1 protein was detected by immunoblotting using antiserum to SKRP1 in various cell lines, containing BALB/3T3, NRK, PC12, and 293 (data not shown). We next examined the tissue distribution of mouse SKRP1 by Northern blot analysis. This study revealed two transcripts of 4.0 and 1.0 kb, which were expressed at moderate levels in brain, placenta, lung, and small intestine, and highly expressed in heart, liver, kidney and testis, respectively (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). SKRP1 displayed a restricted substrate specificity in vitro, with preference for JNK2. Therefore, to investigate whether JNK can be a substrate for SKRP1 in mammalian cells, we examined the effect of SKRP1 on the JNK activation. In this experiment, GST-JNK2 was co-expressed in COS-7 cells with increasing amounts of Myc-SKRP1. Cells were then left untreated or treated with distinct stimuli, such as thapsigargin (50Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar), anisomycin, or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, known to activate the JNK pathway, and the activities of GST-JNK2 at 1 h after treatment were examined by in vitro kinase assays as described previously (50Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar).

The aim of the present study was to determine which enzyme activities are involved in exogenous LPA hydrolysis by preadipocytes and adipocytes. Using a quantitative method, we observed that extracellular LPA rapidly disappeared from the culture medium of 3T3F442A preadipocytes. This disappearance was strongly slowed down in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors, sodium vanadate and sodium pervanadate. By using [33P]LPA on intact 3T3F442A preadipocytes, we found that 90% of LPA hydrolysis resulted from LPA phosphatase activity biochemically related to previously described ectolipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs). Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that 3T3F442A preadipocytes expressed mRNAs of three known Lpp gene subtypes (1, 2, and 3), with a predominant expression of Lpp1 andLpp3. Differentiation of 3T3F442A preadipocytes into adipocytes led to an 80% reduction in ecto-LPA phosphatase activity, with a concomitant down-regulation in Lpp1,Lpp2, and Lpp3 mRNA expression. Despite this regulation, treatment of 3T3F442A adipocytes with sodium vanadate increased LPA production in the culture medium, suggesting the involvement of ecto-LPA phosphatase activity in the control of extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that hydrolysis of extracellular LPA by preadipocytes and adipocytes mainly results from a dephosphorylation activity.

Throughout life, preadipocytes are present in adipose tissue closely associated with adipocytes (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Adipogenesis can be regulated by circulating hormones and growth factors (insulin, catecholamines, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, etc.) as well as by paracrine/autocrine factors (tumor necrosis factor, angiotensinogen, leptin, fatty acids, monobutyrin, eicosanoids, lysophosphatidic acid, etc.) produced locally in the adipose tissue, particularly by adipocytes (2Ailhaud G. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our group has demonstrated that adipocytes are able to produce lysophosphatidic acid in their environment (culture media, extracellular fluid of adipose tissue) (3Valet P. Pages C. Jeanneton O.

This bioactive phospholipid is able to activate preadipocyte proliferation by interacting preferentially with a specific G-protein coupled receptor: the endothelial differentiation gene receptor-2 (EDG-2)1 (4Pages C.

Based upon these findings, LPA may participate, with other factors, in the paracrine/autocrine control of adipose tissue development. One way to test the physiological relevance of this hypothesis in vivo would be to act on the LPA concentration in adipose tissue and analyze the consequences on adipose tissue development. To achieve such a strategy, it is first necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of LPA bioavailability in adipose tissue. According to the literature, the origin of extracellular LPA remains controversial (5Pages C. Simon M.F. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 1: 1-10Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). LPA can be synthesized by secreted phospholipase A2 (6Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F.

Recent data from our group show that one important pathway of LPA synthesis by adipocytes is the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine by a lysophospholipase D secreted by adipocytes (33Gesta, S., Simon, M.

In parallel, extracellular LPA can be hydrolyzed by an ectolipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP), leading to the formation of monoacylglycerol, inactive on LPA receptors (11Waggoner D.W., Xu, J. Singh I. Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). LPP are integral membrane glycoproteins with six transmembrane domains, exhibiting a catalytic site on the extracellular face of the cells, and able to degrade exogenously added glycerol or sphingosyl phosphate lipids (12Kai M.

Conversely to another class of lipid phosphatase localized in intracellular compartments (class 1 phosphatidic acid phosphatases or PAP-1), LPPs do not require Mg2+ for full activity and are insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (13Kanoh H.

At least three genes encoding LPP isoenzymes (LPP1, -2, and -3) have been identified in humans and rodents (12Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol.

An overexpression of some LPP genes leads to attenuation of LPA-induced cell responses (19Hooks S.B. Santos W.L., Im, D.S. Heise C.E. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol.

The presence of NEM-insensitive lipid phosphatase has previously been reported in rat adipocyte membranes (22Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Hales P. Chang E. Russell J.C. Brindley D.N. Int. J.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of LPP in the catabolism of LPA (exogenous or produced by adipocytes) by intact preadipocytes or adipocytes of the mouse cell line 3T3F442A. Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum donor calf serum was from BioWhittaker. Solvents came from PROLABO, and [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was fromAmersham Biosciences. Diacylglycerol kinase was from Calbiochem. Oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid was from Cayman Chemical Co. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from ICN. Monooleoylglycerol and other chemicals were from Sigma. The mouse preadipose cell line 3T3F442A used in this study was initially derived from Swiss mouse fibroblast embryo and were selected for their ability to spontaneously differentiate into adipocytes (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a 24-well plate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2in the presence of DMEM supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. In some experiments, differentiation of preadipocyte into adipocyte was achieved by cultivating confluent preadipocytes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 nm insulin for 10 days as reported previously (25Betuing S. Valet P. Lapalu S. Peyroulan D. Hickson G. Daviaud D. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After 1-butanol extraction of LPA present in the medium, the concentration of remaining lipid was determined according to the radioenzymatic method described in Ref. 26Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A.

Oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid, and C8-ceramide phosphate used in this study were enzymatically synthesized from their respective monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, or C8-ceramide precursors. They were incubated in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase and [γ-33P]ATP. Sphingosine 1-phosphate was obtained by acidic hydrolysis of ceramide phosphate according to Ref.27Liliom K. Fischer D.J.

Radioactive compounds after chromatographic separation on chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (50:10:20:10:5, v/v/v/v/v), purification, and elution from silica using chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v/v) were solubilized in ethanol and then mixed with cold corresponding lipid in order to obtain a specific activity of 5000–20,000 cpm/nmol. Cells were grown for at least 24 h, deprived of serum for 18 h, and then washed with DMEM before measuring activity in Hepes buffer (118 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose, 1 mmCaCl2, 12.4 mm Hepes, 0.1% fatty acid–free BSA, pH 7.4). LPP activity in cell culture was determined by measuring33P production from 33P-labeled LPA dispersed in buffer containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. LPA concentration was adjusted to 5 μm, and incubation was stopped 10 min after substrate addition. Lipids present in the extracellular medium were extracted using 1 volume of n-butanol. After phase separation, radioactivity was measured in each layer. This was done according to Ref. 28Xie M. Low M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. Briefly, 100 μl of aqueous phase were mixed with 10 μl of concentrated HCl, 10 μl of PBS, 30 μl of 5% ammonium molybdate. Then 200 μl of isobutyl alcohol/toluene (1:1, v/v) were added, and the sample was mixed vigorously. The upper organic phase contains phosphomolybdate complex and lower phase glycerol 3-phosphate. Each phase was collected, and radioactivity was determined. Total RNA was isolated using Rneasy kit from Qiagen. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo(dT) primers. A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1.5 μl of reverse transcriptase reaction, 1 μl of dNTP (10 mm), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), 3 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), 1.5 μl of sense and antisense specific oligonucleotide primers (10 μm), and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Conditions for PCR were as follows: initial denaturation step at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 72 °C for 90 s. After a final extension at 72 °C for 6 min, PCR amplification products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Primers used for mouse Lpp1 were designed from the GenBankTM sequence D84376, positions 691–939 (249 bp): sense, 5′- CCCAGACTGGTCAAAAATCAA-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTCGAGAAAGGCCCACATA-3′. Primers used for mouse Lpp2 were designed from the GenBankTM sequence AF123611, positions 396–618 (249 bp): sense, 5′-GCTGCCATCTACAAGGTGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGCAATACATGCCAAAGG-3′. Primers used for mouse Lpp3 were designed from the GenBankTM sequence AK011276, positions 583–785 (202 bp): sense, 5′-TCATCTGCCTGGACCTCTTC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCTGTAATGATCGCCAGGAT-3′. A splice variant of the Lpp1 gene was described in humans (14Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). If such a splice variant exists in mouse, the designed primers do not discriminate between the two mRNAs. Total RNAs were isolated using Rneasy kit from Qiagen. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of random hexamer. A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Real time RT-PCR was performed starting with 25 ng of cDNA with a 300 nm (Lpp1) or 900 nm (Lpp2 and Lpp3) concentration of both sense and antisense primers in a final volume of 25 μl using the SYBR green TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was monitored and analyzed in a GeneAmp 5700 detection system instrument (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the 18 S ribosomal RNA was performed in parallel using the Ribosomal RNA control TaqMan Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems) in order to normalize gene expression. Standard curves were determined after amplification of gel purified PCR amplification products (5.5 × 10−5 to 5.5 × 10−7 ng/μl) generated from 3T3F442A cDNA by nonquantitative RT-PCR (see above). Each RT-PCR quantification experiment was performed twice using duplicate samples from two independently generated cDNA templates. The mRNA quantity present in each assay was determined by comparison with the standard curves. Oligonucleotide primers used to quantify Lpp1,Lpp2, and Lpp3 mRNAs by real time RT-PCR were designed within the sequence of the PCR amplification product generated by nonquantitative RT-PCR (see above). Primer design was optimized by using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligonucleotides used were as follows: Lpp1 sense 5′-GGGAGACTGGGCAAGACTCTT-3′; Lpp1 antisense, 5′-CACTCGAGAAAGGCCCACAT-3′; Lpp2 sense, 5′-CGCGATCCAACTTCAACAACT-3′; Lpp2 antisense, 5′-CAGCCCCGAACAGAAAGGT-3′; Lpp3 sense, 5′-CCATCCTGGCGATCATTACAG-3′, Lpp3 antisense, 5′-AAAGGAAGCATCCCACTTGCT-3′. After complete removal of incubation medium, total cell protein was solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH and quantified using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perigonadic mouse adipose tissue was carefully dissected out, and adipocytes were isolated using collagenase as previously described (29Mauriege P. Galitzky J. Berlan M. Lafontan M. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 17: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Floating cells were washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate, and RNA was isolated or enzyme activity was measured as previously described. To determine the ability of preadipocytes to hydrolyze exogenous LPA, 5 μm 1-oleoyl-LPA was added to intact serum-starved 3T3F442A preadipocytes, and the changes in LPA concentration in the culture medium were determined using a radioenzymatic assay (26Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, LPA progressively disappeared from the culture medium with an initial rate of disappearance of 22.7 ± 8.0 nmol/h/mg of protein; 50% of the initial concentration of LPA remained after 2–3 h of incubation. Similar kinetic of disappearance (half-life of 2 h) was observed when LPA was brought in serum (initial concentration of 0.3 μm) (not shown). These results showed that when exposed to intact preadipocytes exogenous LPA rapidly disappeared from the culture medium, suggesting the existence of an LPA catabolic pathway in these cells. To determine the metabolic pathways involved in the disappearance of exogenous LPA, intact serum-starved 3T3F442A preadipocytes were incubated with 5 μm LPA mixed with traces of [33P]LPA. At different incubation times, the culture medium was removed and extracted with 1-butanol in order to separate [33P]LPA (butanol phase) from water-soluble33P-labeled hydrolysis products (aqueous phase). As shown in the Fig. 2, a time-dependent decrease in [33P]LPA concentration paralleled with a proportional increase in water-soluble33P-labeled hydrolysis products was observed. After a 30-min incubation, [33P]LPA and water-soluble33P-labeled products represented 42 and 54% of the initial concentration of [33P]LPA, respectively. Moreover, only 5% of [33P]LPA was associated with the cells, strongly suggesting that most [33P]LPA hydrolysis occurred extracellularly (Table I). Based upon TLC analysis, 33P present in butanol phase was exclusively in the form of LPA (not shown).Table IAnalysis of radioactivity repartition after [ 33 P]LPA contact with 3T3F442A preadipocyteRadioactivity Repartition % %Butanol (LPA)41.8 ± 1.3Aqueous phase53.6 ± 1.4 Pi88.1 ± 1.2 Glycerol phosphate11.9 ± 1.2Cell4.6 ± 0.6Preadipocytes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μM [33P]LPA, and then radioactivity remaining on the cell surface or remaining in conditioned medium was analyzed. Water-soluble 33P compounds were separated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent means ± S.E. from three separated experiments. Open table in a new tab Preadipocytes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μM [33P]LPA, and then radioactivity remaining on the cell surface or remaining in conditioned medium was analyzed. Water-soluble 33P compounds were separated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent means ± S.E. from three separated experiments. To determine whether LPA hydrolysis was due to a membrane or a soluble bound enzyme, the culture medium was separated from the cells and subjected to centrifugation (20,000 × g) in order to discard cell debris. Whereas [33P]LPA hydrolysis was detected in the pellet (cell debris), no detectable hydrolysis of [32P]LPA was observed in the supernatant (not shown). This result showed that LPA phosphatase activity only results from a membrane-bound enzyme activity. Formation of water-soluble 33P-labeled products was inhibited by sodium vanadate or sodium pervanadate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3) (IC50 of 5 μm and maximal effect reached at 100 μm), suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase activity in this formation. This hypothesis was confirmed by analysis of the water-soluble33P-labeled products (see “Experimental Procedures”), which revealed that almost 90% corresponded to 33P-labeled inorganic phosphate and about 10% corresponded to [33P]glycerol phosphate (Table I). Finally, the initial rate of appearance of water-soluble 33P-labeled products (25.3 ± 2.4 nmol/h/mg of protein) was very close to the initial rate of disappearance of nonlabeled 1-oleoyl-LPA (22.7 ± 8.0 nmol/h/mg of protein). The above results showed that LPA phosphatase activity was predominantly (about 90% of total hydrolysis) involved in hydrolysis of exogenous LPA by 3T3F442A preadipocytes. According to the literature, LPA can be dephosphorylated by two classes of phosphatases called phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP)-1 and -2. PAP-1 is an intracellular enzyme sensitive to magnesium and sulfhydryl-reactive reagents such as NEM. PAP-2 enzymes, also called LPPs, are ectoenzymes that, conversely to PAP-1, are insensitive to magnesium and NEM (11Waggoner D.W., Xu, J. Singh I. Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Kanoh H. Kai M. Wada I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, 3T3F443A preadipocyte LPA phosphatase activity was insensitive to magnesium and NEM. In addition, preadipocyte LPA phosphatase was not sensitive to paranitrophenyl phosphate or glycerol phosphate, showing that it cannot correspond to an alkaline phosphatase (results not shown). These results suggested that preadipocyte LPA phosphatase activity could be classified in the PAP-2/LPP family. A previous report showed that LPP1 was sensitive to Ca2+ (21Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.X. Dewald J. Wang D.A. Fischer D.J. Tigyi G. Berthiaume L.G. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

In 3T3F442A preadipocytes, neither Ca2+ nor EDTA was able to significantly modify ecto-LPA phosphatase activity (Table II). In parallel to [33P]LPA, preadipocytes were also able to hydrolyze [33P]sphingosine 1-phosphate and, to a much lower extent, [33P]phosphatidic acid (Fig.4). This result was in agreement with previous reports showing that several phospholipids can be hydrolyzed by ectophosphatases (30Alderton F. Darroch P. Sambi B. McKie A. Ahmed I.S. Pyne N. Pyne S. J.

A mouse sequence exhibiting 88% identity with human LPP3 was found in GenBankTM (accession number AK011276), and we hypothesized that it corresponded to mouse Lpp3. This expression of Lpp isoenzyme mRNA in mouse 3T3F442A preadipocytes was successively evaluated by nonquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR. Nonquantitative RT-PCR analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) of total RNA extracted from 3T3F442A preadipocytes revealed the presence of Lpp1, -2, and -3 mRNAs (Fig. 5). To determine the relative proportion of each Lpp subtype mRNA, quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis revealed a predominant expression of Lpp1 and Lpp3 mRNAs and a weaker expression of Lpp2 mRNAs (see TableIII).Table IIIEctophosphatase mRNA expression in 3T3F442A preadipocytes and adipocytes and mouse perigonadic isolated adipocytesmRNA3T3F442APerigonadic mouse tissuePreadipocyteAdipocyte 10 −7 ng/2.5 ng RNA 10 −7 ng/2.5 ng RNALPP128 ± 512 ± 312 ± 1LPP28 ± 12 ± 10.5 ± 0.1LPP337 ± 810 ± 336 ± 4Cells and mRNA extract were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” mRNA levels of the known ectophosphatases were assessed by real time quantitative RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of each gene was quantified and normalized using simultaneous amplification of known quantities of the corresponding cDNA and determination of the concentration of 18 S in each sample.

Results represent means ± S.E. from four different RNA preparations. When cultured in appropriate conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), confluent 3T3F442A preadipocytes can differentiate into adipocytes. We tested whether ecto-LPA phosphatase activity and expression could be different between preadipocytes and adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 6 and TableIV, LPA phosphatase specific activity was 80% lower in 3T3F442A adipocytes as compared with 3T3F442A preadipocytes. Ecto-LPA phosphatase activity measured in 3T3F442A adipocytes was close to that measured in mature adipocytes isolated from mouse adipose tissue (Table IV). In parallel, the kinetic of disappearance of nonlabeled 1-oleoyl-LPA was much slower in adipocytes than in preadipocytes (Fig. 6), with a 88% reduction in the initial rate of disappearance. In parallel, the biochemical characteristics of adipocyte ecto-LPA phosphatase (sensitivity to vanadate, insensitivity to magnesium, NEM, EDTA, and Ca2+) were not significantly altered when comparing with preadipocytes (data not shown).Table IVEctophosphatase specific activity determined on intact 3T3F442A preadipocytes and adipocytes or mouse perigonadic isolated adipocytesSpecific activity nmol/min/mg protein3T3F442A Preadipocyte0.863 ± 0.161 Adipocyte0.178 ± 0.005Perigonadic adipose tissue0.263 ± 0.017Cells obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” were incubated in the presence of 5 μm [33P]LPA for 10 min, and then water-soluble 33P was measured, and enzyme specific activity was determined.

Results represent means ± S.E. from three separated experiments. By using quantitative real time RT-PCR, Lpp1,Lpp2, and Lpp3 mRNA appeared less abundant (57, 75, and 72%, respectively) in 3T3F442A adipocytes as compared with 3T3F442A preadipocytes. Lpp1 and Lpp2mRNA levels determined in 3T3F442A adipocytes were close to that determined in mature adipocytes isolated from mouse adipose tissue (Table III). Lpp3 mRNA level was higher in mature adipocytes isolated from mouse adipose tissue than in 3T3F442A adipocytes (Table III). These results revealed that differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes was associated with a strong down-regulation of both ecto-LPA phosphatase activity and LPP gene expression. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated the existence of an extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes (3Valet P. Pages C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite the lower ecto-LPA phosphatase activity in adipocytes compared with preadipocytes, the activity was still significant. We therefore tested the influence of adipocyte ecto-LPA phosphatase on LPA production. As shown in Fig. 7, an 18-h incubation of 3T3F442A adipocytes led to a significant release of LPA in the incubation medium (serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% fatty acid-free BSA). Treatment of the adipocytes with 100 μmsodium vanadate between the 17th and the 18th hours of incubation led to an 8-fold increase in LPA release. This result suggested that ecto-LPA phosphatase activity plays a crucial role in regulation of extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes. The present study shows that preadipocytes possess an ecto-LPA phosphatase activity belonging to the LPP family, which is predominantly involved in overall hydrolysis of exogenous LPA by preadipocytes. The present study also shows that LPP expression and activity are down-regulated after differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes and that its inhibition in adipocytes increases extracellular production of LPA by these cells. Our results show that most (about 90%) of exogenous [33P]LPA hydrolysis by intact preadipocytes leads to the formation of water-soluble [33P]inorganic phosphate. In addition, [33P]LPA hydrolysis by preadipocytes appears to result from a membrane-bound enzyme activity. These observations strongly suggested that the major part of exogenous LPA hydrolysis corresponds to its dephosphorylation and that this reaction takes place mainly at the extracellular face of plasma membrane by an ectophosphatase. It is noticeable that about 10% of [33P]LPA hydrolysis leads to [33P]glycerol phosphate. This result indicates that a minor proportion of LPA hydrolysis could result from lysophospholipase activity. Preadipocyte LPA phosphatase activity shares biochemical characteristics (insensitivity to magnesium and NEM) with the LPPs, which are ectophosphatases able to dephosphorylate exogenous LPA. LPPs are also able to hydrolyze other exogenous bioactive lipids such as LPA, sphingosine 1-phosphate, ceramide phosphate, and phosphatidic acid (30Alderton F. Darroch P. Sambi B. McKie A. Ahmed I.S.

(Tokyo). 2000; 127: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as we also observed in intact preadipocytes. The LPP family is composed of at least three members: LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3 (11Waggoner D.W., Xu, J. Singh I. Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Kanoh H. Kai M. Wada I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that Lpp1, -2, and -3 mRNA are present in preadipocytes. Since LPP protein levels were not determined in our study, we cannot draw conclusions about the relative involvement of each subtype in preadipocyte LPP activity. Nevertheless, we found that LPP activity in preadipocytes is not calcium-sensitive. Previous reports (20Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I., Xu, J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Xu J. Love L.M. Singh I. Zhang Q.X. Dewald J. Wang D.A. Fischer D.J. Tigyi G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27520-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that the LPP1 subtype is inhibited by calcium, so we propose that LPP1 is probably not involved in preadipocyte ecto-LPA phosphatase activity. Further investigations will be necessary to determine the relative contributions of LPP2 and LPP3. Based upon the literature, LPPs are present in numerous cell types (14Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but their relative contribution in overall hydrolysis of exogenous LPA has never clearly been evaluated. By using a quantitative radioenzymatic assay of LPA, we have observed that the rate of disappearance of exogenous nonlabeled LPA from preadipocyte culture medium was very close to the one measured with [33P]LPA. These data show that LPP activity is almost exclusively involved in overall hydrolysis of exogenous LPA by preadipocytes. What could be the functional consequences of the presence of the LPP activity in preadipocytes? We previously showed that LPA is able to activate preadipocyte proliferation, a biological response predominantly mediated by LPA-1/EDG-2 receptor (4Pages C. Daviaud D., An, S. Krief S. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11599-11605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since LPP activity is mainly involved in LPA hydrolysis by preadipocytes, it very likely exerts an inhibitory effect on the proliferative activity of exogenous LPA as the result of tonic inactivation of the bioactive phospholipid. This hypothesis is in complete agreement with previous reports showing that overexpression of LPP decreased LPA effects in different cell types (19Hooks S.B. Santos W.L., Im, D.S. Heise C.E.

Another important finding of the present study is the down-regulation of extracellular LPA phosphatase activity after differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. This down-regulation is paralleled by a down-regulation of Lpp1, -2, and -3mRNA levels, reinforcing the hypothesis that LPPs could be involved in extracellular LPA phosphatase activity. Adipocyte differentiation corresponds to the conversion of proliferating preadipocytes into quiescent adipocytes. This conversion is associated with the emergence of adipocyte-specific genes through a coordinate program of transcription. Further investigations will be necessary to identify the factors and the mechanisms (transcription or mRNA stability) involved in the differentiation-dependent down-regulation ofLPP gene expression. Despite its down-regulation, LPP activity is still present in adipocytes. Adipocytes are quiescent cells that have lost their capacity to proliferate in response to growth factors such as LPA. Moreover, adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by a strong down-regulation of LPA receptors (4Pages C. Daviaud D., An, S. Krief S. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11599-11605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that adipocytes are poor targets for LPA. In this condition, the role of LPP activity in adipocytes is questionable. Our group have demonstrated that the adipocyte is able to release LPA in its incubation medium (3Valet P. Pages C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), as the result of hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine by a secreted lysophospholipase D (33Gesta, S., Simon, M. F., Sibrac, D., Girard, A., Lafontan, M., Valet, P., and Saulnier-Blache, J. S. (2002) J. Lipid Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Here we observed that inhibition of LPP activity by sodium vanadate increases extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes. This suggests that LPP activity exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on the extracellular production of LPA by adipocytes. Taking into account the fact that sodium vanadate is not specific to LPP and could act on many other targets, our hypothesis needs to be tested by another approach such as LPP gene invalidation. Nevertheless, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the contribution of LPP in the control of extracellular production of LPA. In conclusion, hydrolysis of extracellular LPA by preadipocytes and adipocytes mainly results from an ecto-LPA phosphatase. This activity shares similar biochemical characteristics with the LPP and plays an important role in the control of both the biological activity and the extracellular production of LPA in adipose tissue. Ecto-LPA phosphatase activity therefore constitutes a potential suppression of pharmacological and/or pharmacogenic target to control the development of this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2051701098,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) preferentially replicates in CD4-expressing T cells bearing a “memory” (CD45RO+) rather than a “naive” (CD45RA+/CD62L+) phenotype. Yet the basis for the higher susceptibility of these cells to HIV-1 infection remains unclear. Because the nature of the CD45 isoform itself can affect biochemical events in T cells, we set out to determine whether these isoforms could differently modulate HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity and thereby replication. Through the use of CD4+ Jurkat T cells specifically expressing distinct CD45 isoforms (i.e. CD45RABC or CD45RO), we demonstrated that a difference in CD45 isoform expression conferred preferential replication of HIV-1 to CD45RO-expressing T cell clones following a physiological CD3/CD28 stimulation. Closer analysis indicated that higher HIV-1 LTR activation levels were consistently observed in CD45RO-positive cells, which was paralleled by more pronounced nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation in these same cells. Specific involvement of NFAT1 was revealed in studied Jurkat clones by mobility shift analyses. In addition, preferential activation of the LTR and viral replication in CD45RO T cells was FK506- and cyclosporin A-sensitive. These results underscore the importance of NFAT in HIV-1 regulation and for the first time identify the role of the CD45 isoform in limiting productive HIV-1 replication to the human CD4 memory T cell subset."

PPiis a by-product of various nucleoside triphosphate-dependent reactions, and its hydrolysis makes these reactions practically irreversible. Hydrolysis of PPiin the majority of living species is accomplished by soluble pyrophosphatase that dissipates released energy as heat. H+-PPase conserves part of this energy in the form of the proton electrochemical gradient. H+-PPases represent a distinct class of ion translocases with no sequence similarity to ubiquitous ATP-energized pumps such as F-, V-, or P-type ATPases or ABC transporters (4Rea P.A. Kim Y.

The interest in bacterial H+-PPases significantly increased in 1998, when the gene for R-PPase was cloned and sequenced (32Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This was followed by the identification of several bacterial H+-PPase genes as a result of genome sequencing projects. A putative bacterial H+-PPase gene (from the hyperthermophileThermotoga maritima) has been expressed in the yeast system, yielding a protein capable of PPi hydrolysis but not H+ transporting activity (33Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Lopez-Marques R.L. Losada M. Serrano A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, yeast appears to be an unsuitable host for the expression of other bacterial H+-PPases (including R-PPase) because of proteolytic degradation of the recombinant protein (33Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Lopez-Marques R.L. Losada M. Serrano A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we report the high yield expression of fully functional R-PPase inEscherichia coli and use this expression system in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis to identify the Cys residues responsible for R-PPase inactivation by mersalyl. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses performed in this study reveal a unique relationship between the mersalyl-reactive Cys residues and K+ dependence in H+-PPases.

The PCR product was digested with these restriction enzymes and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pET22b(+) (Novagen). The resulting construct was further manipulated by introducing a KpnI restriction site via a silent mutation, 0.5 kb upstream of the C terminus of the R-PPase gene. Mutagenesis was performed by an overlapping PCR technique with a Stratagene QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit or ordinary PCR in the case of C573A. The primers employed in our experiments are listed in TableI. R-PPase-encoding regions of the constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the required mutations and/or the absence of secondary substitutions.Table IPCR primers Open table in a new tab E. coli C43(DE3) cells (34Miroux B.

The cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A, and disrupted by sonication using a 100 W ultrasonic disintegrator (MSE Ltd., London, UK) with a microtip at an operating frequency of 20 kHz and a 9-μm amplitude for 2 min in an ice-water bath. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C.

Prior to electrophoresis, IMV (2.5 mg protein/ml) were solubilized by mixing with an equal volume of cold 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 mMgCl2, 50% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% Triton X-100. The mixture was allowed to stand on ice for 15 min and diluted 5-fold with 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20% glycerol, 300 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 5 μl (1.2 μg of protein)/lane was loaded onto the gel. For Western blot analyses, only 0.3 μg of protein was loaded per lane. The electrophoresed samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose HybondTM ECLTM membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in standard Towbin buffer (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar) containing 20% (v/v) methanol for 1 h at 100 V in a Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Transferred protein bands were stained with Ponceau S, and the R-PPase antiserum-reactive bands (32Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). PPihydrolysis was assayed by continuously recording Piliberation with an automatic Pi analyzer (40Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IMV suspensions (5–50 μl) were preincubated for 1 min with 25 ml of 0.12m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 μmgramicidin D and 40 μm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm PPi and 2 mm MgCl2. The liberation of Pi was monitored for about 3 min. In experiments measuring the inhibiting effect of mersalyl and the protective effects of MgCl2, these reagents were included in the preincubation medium. PPisynthesis was assayed continuously by a coupled enzyme procedure (41Nyrén P. Lundin A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,42Fabrichniy I.P. Kasho V.N. Hyytiä T. Salminen T. Halonen P. Dudarenkov V.Y. Heikinheimo P. Chernyak V.Y. Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7746-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using ATP-sulfurylase to convert PPi into ATP and luciferase to monitor ATP formation. The assay mixture (at a total volume of 0.2 ml) contained 5.2 mm potassium phosphate (2 mm MgPi complex), 7 mmMgCl2 (5 mm free Mg2+), 5 μl luciferin/luciferase solution reconstituted with 5 ml of water (Sigma ATP assay mix; catalog number FL-ASC), 0.7 unit/ml ATP-sulfurylase (Sigma), 10 μm adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.15m HEPES/KOH buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of IMV suspension, and the time course of luminescence was monitored with an LKB model 1250 luminometer. H+translocation across the IMV membrane was assayed fluorometrically in 2 ml of buffer B, using 50 μg of IMV and 3 μm acridine orange as a ΔpH indicator (43Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 495 and 540 nm, respectively. H+translocation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mmPPi, 0.1 mm ATP, or 15 mm dl-lactate (sodium salts) and measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MPF-2A fluorometer. All of the measurements were performed at 25 °C. The R-PPase gene was cloned into pET22b(+) vector under control of the T7/lac promoter. E. coli strain C43(DE3) (34Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) was transformed with either pET22b(+) only or the vector containing R-PPase gene. The resulting cell lines were cultivated in rich medium (2× YT) in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce recombinant protein production. IMV prepared from the C43(DE3) cells transformed with pET22b(+) containing the R-PPase gene (RPP-IMV) produced on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel an intense 60-kDa band that reacted with polyclonal antiserum raised against R-PPase (32Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This band was absent from pET-IMV prepared from C43(DE3) cells transformed with pET22b(+) only (Fig. 1). It should be noted that although the molecular mass of R-PPase calculated from the amino acid sequence is 71 kDa, it migrates as a 60-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis because of extreme hydrophobicity (13Nyrén P. Nore B.F. Strid Å. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2883-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RPP-IMV displayed salt wash-resistant PPase activity with the following characteristics distinctive of H + -PPase: hypersensitivity to the H+-PPase inhibitor, AMDP (>95% inhibition by 20 μm AMDP), and low sensitivity to soluble PPase inhibitor, fluoride (5% inhibition by 0.25 mm fluoride) (44Baykov A.A. Dubnova E.B. Bakuleva N.P. Evtushenko O.A. Zhen R.G. Rea P.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specific activity of IMV PPase was 1.7 μmol/min/mg protein, which is eight times greater than that in R. rubrum chromatophores (IMV prepared from R. rubrum cells) (13Nyrén P. Nore B.F. Strid Å. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2883-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PPase activity of IMV was not significantly affected by the monovalent cations, K + or Na+ (50 mm), but increased by 60% in the presence of 1 μm of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (gramicidin was omitted from the assay medium in this experiment), consistent with the formation of a proton concentration gradient. In contrast, the PPase activity of control pET-IMV was 20 times lower than that of RPP-IMV. This residual salt-washable and entirely fluoride-sensitive (>95% inhibition by 0.25 mm fluoride) activity was attributed to contaminating soluble E. coli pyrophosphatase. Addition of PPi to RPP-IMV resulted in significant intravesicular acidification, as monitored by acridine orange fluorescence quenching (Fig. 2). The sensitivity of H+ transport activity to AMDP and fluoride was comparable with that of PPi hydrolysis activity. Neither the initial rate nor the extent of the PPi-dependent intravesicular acidification was significantly affected by monovalent cations (K+ and Na+) or valinomycin plus K+ (data not shown). The pET-IMV exhibited no H+ transport activity (Fig. 2). However, both types of IMV maintained the [H+] gradient generated by the intrinsic E. coli membrane proteins, F1F0-ATPase and d-lactate dehydrogenase (observed upon the addition of ATP and lactate, respectively), indicating IMV integrity (data not shown). RPP-IMV exhibited appreciable PPi synthesizing activity (Fig. 3). Its absence from pET-IMV and sensitivity to AMDP clearly indicated that PPi synthesis is catalyzed by R-PPase. The observed rate of synthesis decreased with time, supposedly because of the action of intrinsic ATPase on ATP formed from PPi by the action of ATP sulfurylase. This explanation is supported by the decay of the signal generated by added PPi in Fig. 3. The activity calculated from the initial slope of curve 1 in Fig. 3 was 0.010 μmol/min/mg protein (representing 0.6% hydrolytic activity). This PPisynthesizing activity was evident in nonenergized vesicles and thus characterizes the approach to equilibrium in the Pi/PPi system. H+-PPases are highly sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, such as mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide (2Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Inactivation of R-PPase by mersalyl occurs biphasically (30Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of at least two Cys residues. From the seven Cys residues present in the R-PPase sequence (32Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), four (cysteines 87, 268, 335, and 395) are located within predicted membrane regions (18Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,32Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore can hardly react with charged, membrane-impermeable mersalyl. However, the remaining three Cys residues (cysteines 185, 222, and 573) occur within regions assigned to cytoplasmic loops and are thus potentially reactive. To determine the cytoplasmically oriented residues responsible for inactivation by sulfhydryl modifying reagents, each Cys was replaced with an aliphatic residue (Ala or Val), and the effects of these substitutions on PPi hydrolyzing and proton pumping activities and sensitivity to mersalyl were determined. None of the Cys substitutions affected the PPi hydrolyzing and H+ pumping activities to an extent significantly exceeding batch-to-batch scatter (25%), thus demonstrating dispensability of these residues for catalytic activity and the lack of gross structural changes in R-PPase upon substitution. However, all three substitutions slowed down R-PPase inactivation by the sulfhydryl modifying reagent, mersalyl, to some extent, with C185A exerting by far the largest effect (Fig.4). Two phases of inactivation were observed in most cases, including rapid inactivation (by 20–30%) and slower inactivation to nearly zero activity. In these experiments, IMV were always preincubated with mersalyl before the addition of PPi. If mersalyl was added after PPi and Mg2+, the hydrolysis rate rapidly dropped by ∼20%, with all of the R-PPase variants exhibiting the rapid inactivation phase in Fig. 4, and remained constant thereafter. These observations indicate that MgPPi has no effect on the rapid phase but abolishes the slower phase. No rapid phase was observed with the C222V variant, suggesting that this phase specifically corresponds to Cys222 modification. The effects of mersalyl on the H+ transport activity of the R-PPase variants were qualitatively similar to those presented in Fig. 4 (data not shown). Similar experiments conducted with Mg2+ omitted from preincubation conditions generated qualitatively similar inactivation curves but with much faster kinetics. The pseudo-first-order rate constants calculated from the initial slopes of the slower phase of the inactivation curves were approximately 10 times larger in the absence of Mg2+ than in its presence (TableII). A R-PPase mutant protein in which all three Cys residues were substituted was completely resistant to mersalyl.Table IIRate constants for IMV R-PPase inactivation by mersalylVariant k i− Mg+ Mg min −1Wild type202.5C185A0.11<0.01C222V5.10.54C573A111.1C185A/C222V/C573A<0.01<0.01Values were measured with 15 μm mersalyl.

Yeast was selected for heterologous expression, because it is a vacuolated host lacking endogenous vacuolar H+-PPase. Later, five more H+-PPases, including two plant vacuolar (one fromVigna radiata (19Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol.

However, problems were encountered in bacterial H+-PPase expression, including low yield of T. maritima H+-PPase and complete failure to express functional R-PPase (33Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Lopez-Marques R.L. Losada M. Serrano A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

These substitutions were combined with previously identified substitutions in another critical region of ecotin. One of these combinations (D70R/M84R/RRQL) is the tightest (K i = 50 pm) ecotin variant inhibitor of uPA.

These complexes may be permanent or transient, associating and dissociating as conditions require. Enzyme-protein inhibitor complexes and activator complexes are archetypal examples of transient complexes (1Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 2Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical study of numerous enzyme-inhibitor complexes has led to the assembly of structural and mechanistic data bases, providing further impetus for using these complexes as models to investigate fundamental biochemical and biophysical principles of protein-protein recognition. The interaction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)1 with the macromolecular serine protease inhibitor, ecotin, is the basis for an enzyme-inhibitor complex model system that is particularly amenable to genetic manipulation. uPA is a serine protease originally found to convert plasminogen to plasmin (3Gulba D.C. Bode C. Runge M.S. Huber K. Ann. Hematol. 1996; 73: 9-27PubMed Google Scholar), thereby playing an active role in extracellular proteolysis, cell migration, and tissue remodeling (4Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). As a result of its potential role in cancer metastasis and tumor invasion (5Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar), uPA has become an important target for anti-cancer drug development (6Fazioli F. Blasi F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 25-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ecotin is a macromolecular serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (7Lee H.R. Seo J.H. Kim O.M. Lee C.S. Suh S.W. Hong Y.M. Tanaka K. Ichihara A., Ha, D.B. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This highly malleable, dimeric, macromolecular serine protease inhibitor has been modified to enhance inhibition of selected proteases (8Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Wang C.I. Yang Q. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6819-6823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Ecotin has four surface loops that participate in tetramer formation through their interaction with two bound protease molecules. The interaction involves two binding sites on each ecotin monomer. The “primary binding site” composes the reactive loop of ecotin (also referred to as the 80s loop (residues 81–86)) and the supporting 50s loop (residues 52–54). These loops cooperate to bind the active site of target proteases. The “secondary binding site” includes two surface loops of ecotin: the 60s loop (residues 67–70) and the 100s loop (residues 108–113), which bind to the C-terminal region of the target protease (Fig.1). Whereas the conformation of the 80s loop is canonical, at least for the central six amino acids around the cleaved site, the conformation of the secondary binding site is less well characterized. The secondary binding site is unique to ecotin and has not been observed in other protease-inhibitor complexes. The combined buried surface area within an ecotin-protease tetramer is ∼2,800 Å2 (10Yang S.Q. Wang C.I. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (9Wang C.I. Yang Q. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12250-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that a high affinity inhibitor of uPA can be isolated from a library of phage-displayed ecotin variants harboring randomized amino acid residues at positions 84 and 85. These amino acid residues mimic the corresponding P1 and P1′ residues of an uPA substrate. We have further demonstrated that the side chain of the P1 residue has a cooperative rather than an independent role in determining the protease specificity of an ecotin variant. In addition, the loss of function associated with alanine substitutions in the 60s and 100s loops supports a model in which these loops provide the critical binding energy necessary for formation of the stable tetramer complex and the resulting protease inhibition. Experimental data have established the essential role of the secondary binding site for ecotin-protease complex stability and revealed a dynamic and interdependent relationship between the 60s and 100s loops (10Yang S.Q. Wang C.I. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several biochemical and genetic approaches have been used to detect and study protein-protein interactions, including library-based methods such as the yeast two-hybrid screen (12Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 13Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and the phage display method (14Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar, 15Cortese R. Felici F. Galfre G. Luzzago A. Monaci P. Nicosia A.

Phage display is a highly selective combinatorial methodology that has been successfully applied to evaluate the important interfacial amino acids for a wide range of peptides and proteins (17Adams G.P. Schier R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Hoogenboom H.R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 62-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Hoogenboom H.R. de Bruı̈ne A.P. Hufton S.E. Hoet R.M. Arends J.W. Roovers R.C. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because a variant polypeptide is expressed on the surface of the phage particle that harbors the library clone, isolation of phage particles based on physical properties (e.g.binding to an immobilized protease), followed by propagation in bacteria, leads to the rapid availability of phage DNA for sequence analysis. Phage display suffers from several notable limitations, including a physical size limitation for the polypeptide to be studied, the requirement for proteins to be secreted in order to bind the immobilized target molecule, and the use of a bacterial host that may preclude the correct folding or modification of some proteins (2Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From an experimental perspective, phage display suffers from an additional and potentially more profound constraint, the limited volume of conformational space that can be explored with a single library (20Clackson T. Wells J.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 173-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have investigated the use of a combinatorial computer-assisted library design (CALD) algorithm developed to predict amino acid substitutions in ecotin that would increase its affinity for uPA and thus reduce the complexity of a phage display library designed to study macromolecular recognition between uPA and ecotin. The role of specific amino acid substitutions in the 100s loop of ecotin in the inhibition of uPA was evaluated by comparing variants selected from a fully randomized four-position library to those selected from the focused library. The results indicate that, although the focused phage library was 34-fold smaller than the full library, the consensus sequences obtained from the two libraries were similar (although not identical) and that the K i values of the selected variants were within 2-fold. Moreover, our results confirm that interactions between the 60s, 80s, and 100s loops of ecotin are important for protease binding and inhibition. E. coli strain JM101 XL-1 Blue F′ and VCSM13 helper phage were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). E. coliecotin gene deletion strain IMΔecoJ was derived from strain JM101 and was a generous gift from Dr. Iain Murray. Low molecular mass uPA (LMuPA) and carbobenzoyl-l-γ-glutamyl(α-ortho-tert-butyl)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide monoacetate salt were obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Enzymes and other reagents for the manipulation of DNA were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and were used following the manufacturers' instructions. The Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA). Falcon polystyrene Petri dishes were from Fisher. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. Homology modeling of ecotin-uPA complexes was based on the published crystal structure of the trypsin-ecotin complex (Protein Data Bank code 1SLU) (21McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, uPA (Protein Data Bank code 1LMW) was aligned to the trypsin molecule with a root mean square standard deviation of 1.6 Å over 216 amino acids (22Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Steric clashes in the resulting uPA-ecotin model complex were relaxed with 100 steps of simulated annealing in the 60s, 80s, and 100s loop regions (defined below) using Sybyl (Tripos, Inc.). Prediction of the amino acid substitutions that would increase the affinity of ecotin for uPA was performed as follows. (i) Residues 108–113 in the 100s loop were changed to glycines. (ii) Force field scoring grids were defined for the 100s loop regions of both the uPA-ecotin complexes (i.e.bound ecotin) and ecotin in the absence of uPA (i.e. free ecotin) using the program CHEMGRID (23Meng E.C.

Free ecotin was used as a reference state when performing mutagenesis calculations, and each site was scored independently. (iii) Each glycine residue at the positions listed in (i) were systematically changed to each of 17 other amino acids (ADEFHIKLMNQRSTVWY) using DOCK 4.0 (24Ewing T.J.A. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1175-1189Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Initially, neighboring loop amino acids were maintained as glycines. In preparation for the docking calculation, energy scoring grids and sphere sets were generated, characterizing both the ecotin surface (in the absence of uPA) and the ecotin-uPA interface. (iv) For each amino acid substitution we calculated the estimated change in binding energy (ΔE = E X −E Gly) for each conformer in a rotamer library of side chains using the DOCK force field scoring function. The rotamer libraries were generated by systematically iterating through each rotatable bond in all side chains at 15° increments. (v) The estimated change in binding energy/amino acid was calculated for both the complexed and free ecotin structures. These binding energies were then used to calculate a ΔΔE, representing the net change in binding energy/amino acid upon uPA-ecotin complex formation (Fig. 2 A). For the purposes of these calculations, it was assumed that all sites are independent. This assumption is roughly correct for non-neighboring sites but not for spatially proximal sites. (vi) We addressed this latter issue by calculating pairwise interaction energies for overlapping sites. Pairs of sites that we predicted would interact with one another based on the ecotin-uPA homology model were selected. For site pairs 108–110, 110–112, and 112–113, the 1,000 conformers with the lowest individual ΔΔE scores at each site were rebuilt into the bound and free ecotin structures. Thus 1,000 × 1,000 = 106pairs were rescored in the same manner as the independent sites with the addition of a side chain-side chain interaction energy term (Fig.2 B). The top 289-amino acid pairs were evaluated, and the lowest (i.e. best) energy score for each amino acid in each position in the list was recorded. (vii) The five amino acids with the lowest predicted binding energies at each position, based on the pairwise energies (or individual energies if there were no neighboring loop residues), were finally selected for the design of a focused phage display library that would be smaller and easier to construct than an exhaustive library. Similar calculations were performed using the ecotin-trypsin complex as a control to determine whether the methodology was able to predict accurately the amino acids in the 60s and 100s loops that contributed to ecotin-trypsin binding. Degenerate ecotin loop sequences were designed that would encode the five top amino acid residues selected at each loop position. In some cases, codons for additional amino acid residues were also possible due to the nature of primer design. The vector pBSecogIIIΔ100, consisting of a combined deletion, frameshift, and stop codon mutation at amino acids 108–113, was the generous gift of Dr. C.-I. Wang. The M84R mutation was introduced using oligonucleotide RK84 (5′-GTTCCCCGGTTAGTACTA(GA)GATGGCCTGCC-3′). The resulting vector, pBSeco-gIII(M84RΔ100), was then used to construct a phage library comprising the codon for the M84R mutation and the randomized codons corresponding to the computer-predicted amino acid substitutions for positions 108, 110, 112, and 113 (Table III). Kunkel mutagenesis was employed using oligonucleotide QY/LIB-R10XC (5′-GTATCTGGGCGATGCTGGCATGCTGDDATACMDKAGCDRKRDKCCGATCGTGGTGTATACG-3′), where D = A, G, and T; M = A, C; K = G and T; and R = A and G. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Table IIIList of most probable candidates, combined results108110112113RKEEDRDMEMWKMHKNNNNR Open table in a new tab A complete library was designed to include all 20 natural amino acids at positions 108, 110, 112, and 113. Vector pBSeco-gIIIΔ(100-gIII), used as the vector for the insertion of the library, was constructed as follows. Plasmid pBSeco-gIII (M84R/N110R/K112W/L113S), which had the SphI site incorporated at the codon for amino acid 106, was digested withAatII and AflII, filled in using T4 DNA polymerase, and religated. Plasmid pBSeco-gIIIΔ100 was used in a PCR with 5 pmol of oligonucleotide SJ (5′-GATGCTGGCATGCTGNNSTACNNSAGCNNCNNCCCGATCGTGGTGTACACGCCAGACAATGTAGACGTC-3′) and 25 pmol of oligonucleotide ML21 (5′-GTATCGATAAGCTTAAGACTCCTTATTCCGGAGTATGTTAGCAAACGTAGAAAATA-3′) to generate a library of inserts. The amplified region was gel-purified to remove residual template, digested withSphI/HindIII, and ligated to theSphI/HindIII fragment of vector pBSeco-gIIIΔ(100-gIII). The ligation mix was cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to library construction by transformation (through electroporation) into F′ XL-1 Blue cells. To ensure the randomness of the resulting libraries, individual clones were isolated, and plasmid DNA was purified using standard procedures. An SphI/HindIII restriction digest of the sample DNA was used to monitor for the presence of a library member. Positive samples were sequenced to confirm the random incorporation of nucleotides. Ecotin library biopanning and plate amplification procedures were performed as described (8Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmids pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRWS) and pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRQL) were constructed by digesting the plasmids pBSeco-gIII(M84R/RRWS) and pBSeco-gIII(M84R/RRQL), respectively, withBamHI and AatII, gel-purifying the small fragment, and incubating it together with the largeBamHI/AatII fragment of the pTacTac-ecotin vector in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The plasmids pTacTac-ecotin(RRWS) and pTacTac-ecotin(RRQL) were constructed by amplifying a fragment from the plasmid pTacTac-ecotin by PCR using the oligonucleotides ML36 (5′-TCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCATCGATGC-3′) and ML49 (5′-CTGTTGTAACGCAGCATGCCAGCATCGCCCAGATAC-3′). The fragment was cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, digested with BamHI and SphI, and then incubated with the large BamHI/SphI fragment of the pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRWS or pTacTac-ecotin(RRQL) vector, respectively, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The plasmids pTacTac-ecotin(D70R/M84R/RRWS) and pTacTac-ecotin(D70R/M84R/RRQL) were constructed by amplifying a fragment from the plasmid pTacTac-ecotin(D70R/M84R) by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers ML36 and ML49. The fragment was cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, digested with BamHI and SphI, and incubated with the large BamHI/SphI fragment of the pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRWS) or pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRQL) vector, respectively, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The plasmids pTacTac-ecotin(D70R/RRWS) and pTacTac-ecotin(D70R/RRQL) were constructed by amplifying a fragment from the plasmid pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/D70R) or pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRQL), respectively, by PCR using the primers ML36 and ML50 (5′-GTCAGTTCCCCGGTTTCAACGATGATGGCCTGCCCGGATGGC-3′). A fragment from the plasmid pTacTac-ecotin was amplified by PCR using the primers ML51 (5′-GCCATCCGGGCAGGCCATCATCGTTGAAACCGGGGAACTGAC-3′) and ML49. In a second PCR, 0.5 μl of one of the ML36/ML50 PCR products and 0.5 μl of the ML51/ML49 PCR products were used along with the primers ML36 and ML49. The resulting fragments were cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, digested with BamHI and SphI, gel-purified, and incubated with the largeBamHI/SphI fragment of the pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRWS) or pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/RRQL) vector, respectively, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid pTacTac-ecotin(D70R) was constructed by amplifying a fragment from the plasmid pTacTac-ecotin(M84R/D70R) by PCR using the primers ML36 and ML50. A fragment from plasmid pTacTac-ecotin was amplified by PCR using the primers ML52 (5′-GGTACTTGACGTCTACATTGTCTGG-3′) and ML49. In a second PCR, 0.5 μl of the products from each PCR were used along with primers ML36 and ML52. The resulting fragment was cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, digested withBamHI and AatII, gel-purified, and incubated with the large BamHI/AatII fragment of the pTacTac-ecotin vector in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Wild type and variant ecotin proteins were expressed and purified as described (10Yang S.Q. Wang C.I. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). K i values of wild type and variant ecotin proteins against uPA were determined using methods described previously (9Wang C.I.

(i) The final concentration of ecotin in the reactions was 0–20 nmfor ecotin proteins containing the M84R mutation and 0–25 μm for ecotin proteins harboring M84. (ii) The final concentration of LMuPA was 8 nm. (iii) The total volume of the reaction was 990 μl of buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 0.01% Tween 20. The reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 5 min to allow them to reach equilibrium. To initiate the reaction, 10 μl of 10 mm(carbobenzoyl-l-γ-glutamyl(α-ortho-tert-butyl)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide monoacetate salt) was then added, and the rate ofp-nitroanilide formation was measured by monitoring the change of absorption at 410 nm during a 5-min period. The assays were repeated 3–6 times with varying inhibitor concentrations. Data for variants harboring M84 were fitted to the equation derived for traditional Michaelis-Menten inhibitors. Data for variants harboring the M84R mutation were fitted to the equation derived for kinetics of reversible tight binding inhibitors (25Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Positions 108, 110, 112, and 113 of the ecotin monomer protein were selected for study based on a structure-based approach adopted to dissect and isolate the relative contribution from the distinct binding sites (10Yang S.Q. Wang C.I. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, the role of the ecotin 100s loop in determining binding specificity was first examined using computer modeling. To predict the preferred substitutions, amino acids were analyzed independently and in pairwise combinations to determine their binding energies based on a homology model of the ecotin-uPA complex. The independent site calculation was performed by iterating through 17 amino acids at one position although keeping the other positions constant as glycines (Table I). The pairwise site calculation was performed for pairs of sites with possible side chain steric overlap. For ecotin, the pairs of sites that were evaluated were 108 and 110, 110 and 112, and 110 and 113 (TableII). The amino acids selected for each position are shown ranked by descending energy score, with the most probable candidates at the top of the list. Both sets of calculations resulted in the same favored amino acids for each position: Arg for 108, Lys for 110, Glu for 112, and Glu for 113; however, there was variation in the subsequent 4 amino acids selected for each position (Table III).Table IList of most probable candidates, independent site picks108110112113R (−4.48)1-aBest interaction energy for residue X at position Y assuming independence of sites (for example, in the indicated case X = R and Y = 108).

Open table in a new tab As expected, the amino acids chosen by the independent site calculation tended to have longer or more bulky side chains than those chosen through the pairwise site calculation. In the case of the independent site calculation, the removal of steric constraints imposed by neighboring sites favors the selection of bulky amino acids that maximize van der Waals interactions with the uPA interface. For example, tryptophan and tyrosine were selected through the independent site calculations as good candidates for position 108, whereas they were not selected in the corresponding pairwise site calculations. Results from the independent site calculations indicated that for positions 108 and 112, there was a strong preference for one amino acid, whereas for position 110, three amino acids (Lys, Met, and Arg) appeared to be equally favored. Position 113 showed the most gradual decent in score, indicating that this site was more permissive than others based on our scoring regime. Upon the inclusion of pairwise rotamer-rotamer interaction energies in the calculation, we observed that neighboring amino acids with complementary charges were favored. Charged amino acids were selected by both the individual and pairwise site calculations as promoting electrostatic interactions with uPA. However, the pairwise site calculation predicted an additional energy bonus resulting from rotamer-rotamer electrostatic interactions in ecotin. An example of this effect can be seen in Table II, row 2. D108, R110, and D112 were considered more promising candidates by the pairwise calculation due to their favorable inter-rotamer electrostatic interactions, whereas in the independent calculation, bulky hydrophobic residues were preferred over these amino acids. As was the case with the independent site calculations, the lowest variation in score is observed at position 113. Positions 110 and 112 exhibit clear preferences for 3 and 2 (Lys, Arg, Met, and Glu, Asp) amino acids, respectively. Unlike the independent site calculation, the pairwise calculation resulted in a weaker selectivity at position 108. This difference is most likely due to the additional energy resulting from rotamer-rotamer electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, which favored smaller, charged side chains. Positions 108 and 110 share a common side chain pocket that is large enough to accommodate amino acids such as tryptophan in the independent site calculation. However, having to share occupancy of this pocket with a side chain from residue 110 in the pairwise calculation restricted the selection of amino acids at 108 to those with less bulky side chains. Because both calculations resulted in the selection of the same 5 amino acids for positions 110, 112, and 113 with variations in the ranking of these residues, merging the results of the two sets of calculations for these three positions was therefore straightforward. To maximize potential side chain packing and minimize steric collisions, the amino acid ranking observed from the pairwise calculation was used for those positions"
https://openalex.org/W2044948576,"Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) is the small biotinylated subunit of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis. E. coli BCCP is a member of a large family of protein domains modified by covalent attachment of biotin. In most biotinylated proteins, the biotin moiety is attached to a lysine residue located about 35 residues from the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which lies in the center of a strongly conserved sequence that forms a tightly folded anti-parallel β-barrel structure. Located upstream of the conserved biotinoyl domain sequence are proline/alanine-rich sequences of varying lengths, which have been proposed to act as flexible linkers. In E. coli BCCP, this putative linker extends for about 42 residues with over half of the residues being proline or alanine. I report that deletion of the 30 linker residues located adjacent to the biotinoyl domain resulted in a BCCP species that was defective in function in vivo, although it was efficiently biotinylated. Expression of this BCCP species failed to restore normal growth and fatty acid synthesis to a temperature-sensitiveE. coli strain that lacks BCCP when grown at nonpermissive temperatures. In contrast, replacement of the deleted BCCP linker with a linker derived from E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase gave a chimeric BCCP species that had normal in vivo function. Expression of BCCPs having deletions of various segments of the linker region of the chimeric protein showed that some deletions of up to 24 residues had significant or full biological activity, whereas others had very weak or no activity. The inactive deletion proteins all lacked an APAAAAA sequence located adjacent to the tightly folded biotinyl domain, whereas deletions that removed only upstream linker sequences remained active. Deletions within the linker of the wild type BCCP protein also showed that the residues adjacent to the tightly folded domain play an essential role in protein function, although in this case some proteins with deletions within this region retained activity. Retention of activity was due to fusion of the domain to upstream sequences. These data provide new evidence for the functional and structural similarities of biotinylated and lipoylated proteins and strongly support a common evolutionary origin of these enzyme subunits.

Indeed, Reche and Perham (10Reche P. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have succeeded in altering the Escherichia coliacetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)1biotinoyl domain such that the normally absolutely specific lipoate protein ligase will attach lipoic acid to various mutant biotinoyl domains. Therefore, it seems clear that two enzyme families that catalyze very different reactions use a common structural domain to carry the essential coenzyme. Biotinylated enzymes catalyze carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions and play essential roles in fatty acid synthesis and amino acid degradation, whereas lipoylated enzymes catalyze acyl transfer and single carbon transfer reactions and are required for function of the citric acid and glycine cleavage cycles (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Both the biotinoyl and lipoyl domains are thought to act as swinging arms that convey covalently bound intermediates between different active sites of a multienzyme complex (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Swinging arm mobility has two different aspects. Mobility on a small scale is imparted by attachment of the carboxyl of the coenzyme to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue located at the tip of a protruding β-turn. As first proposed (see Ref. 11Reed L.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) this arrangement gives the “business ends” of the coenzymes a significant reach. Mobility on a much larger scale is imparted by the proline plus alanine-rich sequences adjacent to the lipoyl domains that act as flexible linkers (Fig. 1) (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In lipoyl enzymes having only a single domain, the domain forms the amino terminus of the protein, and the linker connects the domain to the catalytic domain of the protein. In proteins having multiple lipoyl domains, such as E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which has three lipoyl domains, the domains are arranged in tandem at the amino terminus with linkers separating the domains from one another and from the catalytic domain (Fig. 1 B). Biotinylated proteins are the mirror image of the single lipoyl domain proteins; the modified domain is located at the carboxyl terminus, and a proline plus alanine-rich sequence is found upstream of the domain (Fig.1 A). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis, the synthesis of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA (12Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 6. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar) (Fig.2). ACC is a biotin-dependent enzyme, and like all biotin enzymes, the cofactor must be covalently attached to ACC for enzyme activity. In E. coli and many other bacteria, the functional enzyme consists of two copies of each of four different subunits (13Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li S.J. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li S.J.

The biotin cofactor is attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit, the sole biotinylated protein of this organism (Fig. 2). In the first partial reaction, the heterocyclic ring of the attached biotin moiety is carboxylated by the biotin carboxylase subunit. The carboxyl group is then transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA by carboxyltransferase, a complex of two proteins called α and β. Similar ACCs (referred to as heteromeric ACCs) are found in the chloroplasts of many plants (16Ohlrogge J. Pollard M. Bao X. Focke M. Girke T. Ruuska S. Mekhedov S. Benning C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 567-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the biotinoyl domains of the E. coli acetyl-CoA subunit, BCCP (also called AccB) (2Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A.

Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), have been determined. In both cases, the structures of the protein segments located upstream of the biotinoyl domain could not be determined due to their high degree of mobility. No structures could be detected in these protein segments by either x-ray diffraction or multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Given the similarities between the biotinoyl and lipoyl domains, it seemed plausible that the putative biotinoyl domain linker regions might play roles similar to those of the lipoyl domain linkers. However, an argument against this notion is that the sequences of biotinoyl and lipoyl linkers cannot be aligned for more than a few residues (Fig. 1). Moreover, in the linkers of some biotinoyl proteins, other small residues (generally serine or glycine) have replaced alanine, and the linkers of lipoyl proteins are richer in charged residues than are the biotinoyl linkers. On the other hand, given the conserved domain structures, it seemed unlikely that the conserved proline/alanine-rich nature of the neighboring amino acid sequences could be accidental. The E. coli PDH linkers (Fig.2 A) have been extensively studied, and the available data indicate that the combination of proline and alanine results in an extended, but flexible, structure (1Perham R.N.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the E. coli PDH complex, the linker regions are known to be highly mobile and exposed to solvent. The mobility of these linker regions was first detected by NMR studies of the intact complex (20Perham R.N. Duckworth H.W. Roberts G.C. Nature. 1981; 292: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Radford S.E. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. Miles J.S. Guest J.R. Biochem.

Despite the very high molecular weight of the E. coli PDH complex (5–10 × 106), a set of sharp resonances are observed that disappear with loss of the lipoyl domains (from proteolytic cleavages within the linkers). Moreover, the spectra observed in the intact complex are essentially the same as those of synthetic linker peptides (17Green J.D. Perham R.N. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23484-23488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Radford S.E. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. Martin S.R. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 767-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, I report that a large deletion of the putative linker region of the E. coli BCCP subunit results in a protein of extremely compromised ACC activity in vivo. However, biological activity was restored upon insertion of a sequence derived from the first linker of the E. coli PDH E2 subunit, indicating that the lipoyl and biotinoyl linker regions have overlapping functions. Deletion and insertion analyses of this chimeric protein and of the native BCCP showed that only a restricted portion of the linker was required for biological activity and that many sequences fail to provide linker function. The synthetic 133-bp linker was constructed in three stages due to its length. First, a cassette encoding the N-terminal end of the linker was produced by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (TableI) and ligating this to pMTL22 (26Chambers S.P. Prior S.E. Barstow D.A. Minton N.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) digested with the HindIII and NgoMIV (the cassette was designed such that complementary ends would result upon annealing). Likewise, a cassette encoding the C-terminal end of the linker was produced by annealing oligonucleotides 3 and 4 and was ligated to pK19 (27Pridmore R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) digested with NgoMIV plus SmaI. Ligation to the SmaI end resulted in construction of a BsiWI site. The plasmids encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the linkers were then digested with NgoMIV andHindIII or BsiWI, respectively; the linker-encoding fragments were purified, mixed in equimolar ratios, and then ligated together with the accB plasmid pCY326 (28Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) digested with HindIII and BsiWI in a three partner ligation. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and found to contain a 179-bp vector-derived sequence inserted between the two linker-encoding fragments. This vector fragment insert (apparently due to a mutation at the NgoMIV end of the C-terminal cassette) was removed by digesting the plasmid with NgoMIV andBglII and inserting a cassette of annealed oligonucleotides 5 and 6 to give the desired linker sequence. Two other plasmids were also derived by cassette mutagenesis. A cassette encoding the sequence PAAAA was obtained by annealing oligonucleotides 7 and 8 and inserting this cassette into BglI-digested pCY326 (the cassette was designed with complementary ends and included a new BstZI site and retained the BglI site at one end of the inserted sequence). Finally, a cassette designed to delete the EAPAAA sequence adjacent to the biotinoyl domain of the wild type gene was obtained by annealing oligonucleotides 9 and 10 and ligating this product to pCY326 digested with NcoI and BsiWI. This cassette introduced a BglII site and inactivated the BsiWI site.Table IOligonucleotides used in this workOligonucleotideSequence15′-AGCTTACGACGGCGCAGCAGACGCTGCACCTGCGCAGGCAGAAGAGAAGAAAGAAGCAGCG25′-CCGGCGCTGCTTCTTTCTTCTCTTCTGCCTGCGCAGGTGCAGCGTCTGCTGCGCCGTCGTA35′-CCGGCTGCAGCACCAGCGGCTGCGGCGGCGGAGATCTCCGGTCACATCGTAC45′-GTACGATGTGACCGGAGATCTCCGCCGCCGCAGCCGCTGGTGCTGCAGCCGG55′-CCGGCTGCAGCACCAGCGGCTGCGGCGGCGGA65′-GATCTCCGCCGCCGCAGCCGCTGGTGCTGCAG75′-CGGCCGCTGCAGCTC85′-CTGCAGCGGCCGGAG95′-GAGATCTCCGGTCACATTGTAC105′-AATGTGACCGGAGATCTCCATG115′-CATGGAAGCGCCGGCAGCAGCGGAAATCAGTGGTCACATCGTAG125′-GCGCCTACGATGTGACCACTGATTTCCGCTGCTGCCGGCGCTTC Open table in a new tab A series of deletions within the region encoding the chimeric linker were made by restriction digestion followed by blunt end ligation done at low DNA concentrations to favor recircularization. In most cases, one or both of the ends resulting from digestion were either filled in or resected by treatment with either phage T4 DNA polymerase plus the four nucleoside triphosphates or by treatment with mung bean nuclease in order to give the proper reading frame. The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of the polymerase was used to remove 3′-extensions, whereas 5′-extensions were removed by mung bean nuclease. For brevity, the abbreviations T4 and MB following the restriction enzyme used to generate the extension will be used to signify these manipulations (the conditions used are given below). The constructions were as follows: Δ1, HindIII(T4) and PstI(T4); Δ2,FspI and NaeI; Δ4, FspI andBglII(T4); Δ5, BstAPI(T4); Δ6,HindIII(T4) and NgoMIV(T4); Δ8,BsgI(T4) and PstI(T4); Δ9,NgoMIV(MB) and BglII(MB); Δ10,NgoMIV(MB) and PstI(T4); Δ11,HindIII(MB) and FspI; Δ12,HindIII(MB) and NaeI; Δ13,HindIII(T4) and BglII(T4). The Δ15 plasmid resulted from the same manipulations as Δ10 but suffered a 27-bp deletion presumably via illicit recombination in vivo. A series of manipulations of the wild type BCCP linker region were also made. The construct encoding the Δ14 BCCP resulted from digestion of pCY326 with NcoI followed by MB treatment. The MB was inactivated, and the DNA was digested with HindIII, treated with T4, and ligated. The construct encoding the Δ17 BCCP resulted from annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 9 and 10 and ligating the cassette to pCY326 digested with NcoI plusBsiWI (the annealed cassette was designed such that complementary ends would result). The Δ18 and Δ19 BCCP constructs were made by insertion of antibiotic cassettes into the introducedBglII site of the Δ17 construct. The BamHI tetracycline resistance-encoding fragment of p34s-Tet (29Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated to the BglII-cut Δ17 plasmid followed by selection for resistance to both tetracycline and kanamycin. The tetracycline resistance determinant was then eliminated by SstI digestion and ligation. The construction of Δ19 followed a similar route except that the SstI tetracycline resistance fragment p34s-Tet was flanked by two copies of the BglII-SstI fragment of the multiple cloning site of pMTL25 (26Chambers S.P. Prior S.E. Barstow D.A. Minton N.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The tetracycline determinant was then eliminated by MluI digestion followed by ligation to give the construct encoding Δ19. Construction of the genes encoding the Δ20, Δ21, Δ22, and Δ23 BCCPs used a 12-bp cassette made by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 7 and 8 followed by treatment with MB and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase plus ATP. The blunt-ended cassette was then ligated to pCY326 digested withNcoI plus BsiWI and treated with T4. DNA sequencing showed three different products: insertion of one copy of the cassette in the two possible orientations (Δ22 and Δ22) and two copies inserted in a head to tail configuration (Δ21). The gene encoding Δ21 was then cut with PstI and religated to give Δ23. The genes encoding Δ24 and Δ27 were derived from that encoding Δ23 by insertion of the gentamycin resistance encoding thePstI fragment of p34s-Gm (29Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the PstI site of the Δ23 construct. The resistance gene was then removed by digestion with XbaI digestion to give Δ25 orSstI digestion to give Δ27. The gene encoding Δ26 resulted from insertion of the same oligonucleotide cassette as Δ17 except that the sticky ends were removed by T4 treatment, and the resulting blunt end cassette was ligated to pCY326 digested withNcoI plus BsiWI and then treated with T4. The resulting recombinant plasmids were then screened for products with the cassette inserted in the orientation opposite that of Δ17. The gene encoding the I28 insertion was constructed by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 7 and 8 and ligating the resulting cassette to pCY326 digested with BglI. The gene encoding the BCCP-P. shermanii 1.3 S chimeric protein was constructed from pCY325 (28Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and p1.3t (30Murtif V.L. Samols D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11813-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by ligating theSalI-BglII fragment of p1.3t into pMTL21 digested with SalI plus BamHI. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated to theEcoRI-BglII accB fragment of pCY325. This plasmid was digested with NcoI (which cuts withinaccB) and KasI (which cuts within the 1.3 S coding sequence), and a cassette made by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 11 and 12 was then inserted by ligation. The products of most of the deletion/insertion ligations were transformed into strain CY1478, which carries a chromosomal bioBFC-lacZ fusion and overproduceslacI repressor from an F′ episome. Strain CY1478 was constructed by conjugational mating of strain BM2661 (31Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 789-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with NovaBlue (Novagen) with selection for recombinants resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline to introduce the lacIQ episome. The transformants were tested on RB medium containing 80 nmbiotin and X-gal (40 μg/ml), ampicillin, and tetracycline. Colonies were patched onto two plates of this medium, one supplemented with glucose (0.4% final concentration) and the other lacking glucose. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies that were very dark blue on the plate lacking glucose but pale blue on the glucose-containing plates were in frame deletions, whereas colonies that were white on both plates were out of frame fusions (the rationale is explained under “Results”). The lacIQ episome was introduced to decrease expression from the vectorlac promoter, which is responsible for BCCP expression in pCY326 and its derivatives. Glucose addition was used to further decrease BCCP expression by decreasing cAMP-dependent expression from the lac promoter. Low level BCCP expression was desired, because high level expression of this protein is toxic toE. coli and also to allow colony scoring by use of X-gal. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing done by the Keck Genomics Center of the University of Illinois. Treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was done in the restriction enzyme digestion buffer supplemented with the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates each at 0.25 mm. One unit of polymerase was added, and the reaction was incubated at 16 °C for 15–30 min followed by phenol treatment to inactivate the polymerase. Treatment with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) was done in the restriction enzyme digestion buffer supplemented with 1 mmZnSO4. Ten units of nuclease were added, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h and then phenol extraction to inactive the nuclease. Each of the altered accBgenes was cloned together with the downstream kanamycin resistance gene into the regulated expression vector pCY465 (28Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as previously described. Measurement of protein biotinylation by labeling growing cultures with [8,9-3H]biotin, gel electrophoresis, fluorography, and bacterial media were as described previously. A sample of BCCP-87 mixed with the full-length BCCP was made by IPTG induction of strain TM126, a wild type strain carrying pTM52 (32Morris T.W. Lipoate-Protein and Biotin-Protein Ligases of Escherichia ColiPh.D. thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana, IL1994Google Scholar) in [3H]biotin-containing medium. Plasmid pTM52 was constructed by insertion of the BCCP-87 encodingNcoI-HindIII segment of pLS4 (15Li S.J. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into expression vector pKK233-2 (33Amann E. Brosius J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. The determined structures of the BCCP biotin domain begin at residues Gly77 and Ile78, although these residues and the next few residues (up to Ile82) are considerably more mobile than the residues of the tightly folded domain (2Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C.

In preliminary work, the accB gene was modified to introduce a BglII site that overlapped codons 77 and 78. The DNA segment lying between this new site and the naturally occurring HindIII site was then deleted by restriction digestion followed by treatment with phage T4 DNA polymerase plus the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates and phage T4 DNA ligase. These manipulations removed most of the putative linker region. It should be noted that this construct would not be expected to produce an active BCCP species, because the translation frame would be out-of-frame relative to the accB coding sequence. However, such in vitro filling and ligation reactions have a significant error rate such that rare in-frame constructs were expected (34Hasan N. Kur J. Szybalski W. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In-frame constructs were detected by use of the biotin operon regulatory system (35Chapman-Smith A. Cronan J.E., Jr. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol.

Overproduction of a biotin acceptor protein results in increased expression of the biotin biosynthetic operon due to consumption of biotinyl-AMP by protein biotinylation (37Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in transcription is readily detected by use of a host strain (strain CY1478) carrying a promoter fusion construct in which a biotin operon promoter drives expression of E. coliβ-galactosidase (31Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 789-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased biotin operon expression is detected b"

Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) or as part of a 1:1 complex with different actin-binding proteins has been determined (2Kabsch W.

Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To date, it has not been possible to crystallize F-actin. However, Holmes et al. (5Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) proposed an atomic model of F-actin by fitting the coordinates of rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin to 8-Å resolution x-ray fiber diffraction patterns of axially oriented F-actin gels. In this model, subdomains 1 and 2 lie on the outside of the filament and subdomains 3 and 4 lie close to the filament axis. In G-actin, a hydrophobic plug (residues 266–269) is at the tip of a loop (residues 262–272) between subdomains 3 and 4, and the loop is parked parallel to the actin monomer along subdomain 4. The model predicts that during polymerization, the loop undergoes a conformational change, which allows it to extend perpendicularly from the actin surface. The plug would now be in a position to interact with a hydrophobic pocket formed at the interface of two monomers on the opposing strand of the filament. This hydrophobic plug-pocket interaction, if it exists, would stabilize the filament by cross-strand contact. However, this presumed conformational change in the monomer lacks experimental verification. A number of additional modeling studies have addressed this aspect of the model with divergent results. This hypothesis was supported by a refinement of the F-actin model by Lorenz et al. (6Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Using normal mode analysis, Tirion et al. (7Tirion M.M. ben-Avraham D. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 5-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were unable to predict the occurrence of such a loop movement. Molecular dynamics simulations by Wriggers et al. (8Wriggers W. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 624-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that during the G to F transition, the closure of the nucleotide binding cleft destabilizes the binding contacts of the loop 262–272, leading to its detachment from the monomer surface, suggesting that the loop is capable of extending at least part way into the interstrand space. Schutt (4Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) has argued that a significant energetic barrier would have to be overcome to detach and restructure the loop as proposed by Holmes and considers such an event unlikely. He and co-workers have proposed an alternative model (4Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 9Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Myslik J. Strauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) based on the profilin·β-actin ribbon structure, in which subdomains 1 and 2 lie near the filament axis whereas subdomains 3 and 4 are distal from the filament axis. The loop between subdomains 3 and 4 remains attached to the actin monomer surface, contributing to the stability of the monomer within the filament. However, they have yet to publish the coordinates of this filament model. We had previously performed a series of experiments with mutant yeast actins designed to address Holmes' hypothesis. Yeast actin is 87% identical to rabbit skeletal muscle actin, and it can interact with most of the actin-binding proteins of higher eukaryotes (10Greer C. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Kron S.J. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4466-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yeast has a single copy actin gene, ACT1 (12Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and it is thus possible to replace the wild-type actin gene with a mutant one in order to test the importance of specific residues or regions on actin function. Earlier results from in vitro studies in our laboratory are consistent with Holmes' prediction of the “plug-pocket” interaction. The plug region in yeast actin consists of four residues, Val266-Leu267-Gly268-Leu269. Our results suggest that two of the three hydrophobic residues are required for filament formation. Insertion of a charged residue between two hydrophobic residues produced a cold-sensitive polymerization defect, whereas placement of a charged residue on either of the plug's end positions had little effect. The cold sensitivity is what would be expected for a disruption of a hydrophobic interaction (13Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Together, our results suggest that the plug-pocket interaction, if it exists, is flexible instead of the lock-and-key model proposed by Holmes. Simultaneous substitution of two hydrophobic residues, Val266 and Leu267, with glycines (GG-actin) prevented actin polymerization in vitro. However, phalloidin, BeFx, or equivalent amounts of wild-type actin restored the ability of GG-actin to polymerize, thereby suggesting the importance of the hydrophobicity of the plug for filament formation and stabilization. To attempt to visualize the behavior of the loop (residues 262–272) during polymerization, two mutants, S265C and S265C/C374A, were previously created to enable the attachment of a fluorescent probe,N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrene maleimide),1 to monitor conformational changes that might occur (14Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This position was chosen due to the similarities between the original Ser and the new residue, Cys. During polymerization, fluorescence of the probe at position 265 decreases, suggesting that the loop probe undergoes a conformational shift, placing it in a more hydrophilic or solvent-exposed environment. However, if Holmes' model for loop unfolding is correct, then Ser265 would move the least (only about 0.5 Å) compared with residues in the plug, functioning, instead, as a pivot around which the remainder of the loop would unfold. Thus, Ser265reports indirectly at best on loop movement. Four major questions therefore remain unanswered regarding the loop model. First, during polymerization, does the plug detach from the surface of the actin monomer? Second, if detachment can occur, is it necessary for polymerization? Third, if the loop detaches, can it extend to interact with a hydrophobic pocket on the opposing strand of the filament? And fourth, if this is possible, is it required for filament stabilization? In this paper, to examine more thoroughly the contribution of this hydrophobic loop to F-actin structure and stability, we have mutated residues Val266, Leu267, and Leu269 at the tip of the loop individually to Cys. This would potentially allow stoichiometric attachment of thiol-specific fluorophors if the resulting sulfhydryl groups were accessible. The other reactive thiol group in actin, Cys374, was mutated to Ala in a duplicate set of the loop mutants to allow us to monitor the behavior of the loop fluorophor alone. A model of the actin filament showing the position of Cys374 and of phenylalanine at position 266 in the subdomain 3/4 loop of the muscle actin is shown in Fig.1. The loop is depicted in both the extended and parked positions. We have used these mutant actins labeled with the fluorescent probes pyrene maleimide and 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (acrylodan) to reveal polymerization-induced environmental changes around the loop residues. Using steady-state fluorescence measurements of these probes and the ability of the pyrene maleimide-labeled actins to be quenched by acrylamide, we have assessed the behavior of the labeled loop residues in the G- to F-actin transition. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene Corp. Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis. Pyrene maleimide and ATP were purchased from Sigma. The Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Affi-Gel 10 active ester-agarose was purchased from Bio-Rad, and DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. Acrylodan, Alexa-phalloidin, and FM 4–64 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Yeast cakes for preparation of wild-type (WT) actin were obtained locally. All other chemicals used were reagent grade quality. Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was a generous gift from Dr. Larry Tobacman (University of Iowa). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a mutant actin sequence carried in a centromeric plasmid pRS314 (15Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) marked with the TRP1 gene. The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to generate the mutants we analyzed (in each case the mutant codon is underlined): V266C, 5′-CCATCCTTCTTGTTTGGGTTTGGAATC-3′; L267C, 5′-CATCCTTCTGTTTGTGGTTTGGAATC-3′; L269C, 5′-CCTTCTGTTTTGGGTTGTGAATCTGCCGG-3′; C374A, 5′-CGTTCACCACAAGGCTTTCTAATCTCTGC-3′. The DNA was sequenced in each case to verify the desired mutation with either the Sequenase kit or by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Iowa. pRS314 plasmids containing the mutant actin coding sequences were introduced into atrp1, ura3–52 Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid cell in which the chromosomal ACT1gene had been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with theLEU2 gene. Wild-type actin was expressed in these recipient cells from another centromeric plasmid containing the URA3gene. Following transformation with the mutant plasmid and selection on tryptophan-deficient medium, surviving cells were subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the plasmid carrying the WT actin gene. The mutant plasmid was rescued from surviving trp+, ura− cells and sequenced to ensure that the mutation was still intact. Viable cells were readily obtained for all mutants. The Ca2+ forms of the actins were prepared by a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography and DEAE-cellulose chromatography according to Cook et al. (16Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in Ca2+-G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mmCaCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. Prior to labeling, dithiothreitol was removed from the actin by centrifuging through Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with dithiothreitol-free buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP). The WT actin was labeled on Cys374 with pyrene-maleimide; V266C, L267C, and L269C actins were labeled on both loop positions as well as Cys374; and V266C/C374A, L267C/C374A, and L269C/C374A were labeled solely on the loop positions as described previously (14Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unreacted dye and denatured actin were removed by polymerization-depolymerization cycling. The extent of labeling was determined with the pyrene extinction coefficient, ε344 = 22,000 m−1 cm−1. The acrylodan labeling protocol was modified from Marriot et al. (17Marriott G. Zechel K. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6214-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as follows: V266C/C374A and L269C/C374A actins were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the G-form. The actin was then put through a cycle of polymerization and depolymerization to remove unbound dye and denatured actin. The extent of labeling was determined by using the acrylodan extinction coefficient, ε375 = 18,500 m−1 cm−1, and the actin extinction coefficient, ε290 = 26000m−1 cm−1. Corrections were made for the absorbance of acrylodan at 290 nm using the extinction coefficient ε290 = 18,500 m−1cm−1. The labeling efficiency was 100%. In all cases, actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 50 and 2 mm, respectively. The final sample volume was 120 μl. For spectral comparisons of G- versus F-actin, polymerization was allowed to proceed for 20 min, a period sufficient for complete polymerization. For kinetic experiments (Fig. 7), actin polymerization was followed by the increase in light scattering as a function of time. The fluorimeter, either an SLM model 4800 fluorimeter or a Spex Fluorolog III, was set at 360 nm for both the excitation and emission wavelengths. The change in pyrene fluorescence following actin polymerization was observed using a fluorimeter set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 386 nm for WT and V266C/C374A actins. The emission wavelength was 375 nm for L267C/C374A, and the emission wavelength for L269C/C374A was 396 nm. Emission spectra between 375 and 600 nm were obtained in a similar manner following excitation at 365 nm (18Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 19Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Acrylamide quenching studies were initiated to determine the degree of exposure of the loop residues to solvent in the monomeric and polymeric states of actin (20Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching studies were performed by adding small volumes of 3 m acrylamide to achieve final concentrations of 25–500 mm into a cuvette containing 0.4 mg/ml actin in a volume of 120 μl. All of the experiments were repeated with at least two independent actin preparations. The quenching data were initially analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation,F0F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 and F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher,K SV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the total quencher concentration. Most of the actin samples show significant heterogeneity that cannot be analyzed in this fashion. Therefore, we correlated fluorescence intensity as a function of quencher concentration in a two-fluorophore system. We resolved two component spectra through nonlinear least squares (NLLS) fitting of the quenching data using the following formula (modified from Ref. 21Lakowicz J. Priniciples of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 8Google Scholar),F(λ)F0(λ)=f1(λ)1+KSV,1[Q]+f2(λ)1+KSV,2[Q]Equation 2 where F(λ) and F 0(λ) are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher at a particular wavelength λ; f 1(λ) and f 2(λ) are the fractional contributions of the total fluorescence from fluorophores 1 and 2 in the absence of the quencher at wavelength λ; and K SV,1 andK SV,2 are the Stern-Volmer quenching constants of the fluorophores. Assuming that the K SVvalues are the same at all wavelengths for the two fluorophores, the fluorescence fractional contributions f 1 andf 2 of the two fluorophores could be derived at each wavelength through NLLS fitting. Fluorescence quenching data at all wavelengths were globally linked in the fitting. The component spectra were recovered through F i (λ) =F 0(λ)f i (λ). The goodness of the fit was evaluated by the χ2 and the randomness of the residual distribution. The χ2 was calculated from Equation 3,χ2=∑λ∑[Q]FF0m−FF0t2Equation 3 where the summation is over all of the quencher concentrations and all of the wavelengths (370–450 nm) in the measurement; the subscript m and t refer to measured and theoretical values from the two-component equation. For these determinations, the relative errors were 5% or less. The focus of this work was to examine the behavior of the subdomain 3/4 plug during polymerization by labeling each of the positions with a fluorescent probe and assessing the effects of polymerization on probe fluorescence. Cells carrying each of the desired mutant actins were viable, and active actin was successfully obtained in each case. However, to properly interpret the results of our experiments, it was first necessary to gauge the effects of the mutations in vivo and in vitro in terms of actin function. We observed no adverse effects of the mutations in vivo in terms of growth rate, temperature dependence, or utilization of glucose and glycerol as carbon sources. Cellular morphological parameters such as vacuole inheritance, cytoskeletal arrangement, and cell morphology appeared normal as well. UV absorption results indicated a pyrene maleimide molar labeling ratio for WT, V266C/C374A, L267C/C374A, and L269C/C374A of 1:1, whereas the labeling ratio for the single mutants was ∼2 mol of dye/mol of actin. The labeling efficiency ranged from 80 to 100%, suggesting that all of the newly introduced sulfhydryl residues were accessible. We previously demonstrated that elimination of Cys374 from WT actin prevented labeling by pyrene maleimide (14Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, attempts to label loop cysteines should not result in labeling at alternative sites. We monitored the polymerization of the calcium form of the labeled actins at 25 °C by light scattering (data not shown). Light scattering showed no consistent differences between the wild-type and mutant actins, although small quantitative differences were observed from preparation to preparation. Thus, surprisingly in the context of the Holmes' model, labeling did not significantly affect the polymerization of actin, although the probes were at or near the interstrand surface. Electron microscopy of negatively stained pyrene-labeled V266C/C374A, L267C/C374A, and L269C/C374A F-actins demonstrated the appearance of normal looking filaments (data not shown). At 4 °C, the extent of polymerization of V266C/C374A, pyrene-labeled or not, was 30% less than that of WT actin, whereas neither labeled nor unlabeled L269C/C374A actin polymerized at 4 °C. V266C, L267C/C374A, and WT actins were not cold-sensitive. This cold sensitivity, regardless of whether or not the actin was pyrene-labeled, suggested that this behavior did not arise from the presence of free sulfhydryls but from the absence of the original residues. The thermal stabilities of pyrene-labeled V266C/C374A, L267C/C374A, and L269C/C374A were determined using circular dichroism at 222 nm as a function of temperature (data not shown), and they were not significantly different from that of pyrene-labeled WT actin. This result suggested that despite the presence of an N-pyrenyl-succinimidyl group, the actin monomer structure was not grossly affected. We next examined the effects of polymerization on the fluorescence properties of the pyrene-labeled actins to determine whether polymerization caused a change in environment of the loop probe. The original hypothesis of Holmes involving movement of this loop predicted a change in environment for the three “plug” hydrophobic residues. We wished to determine whether this change occurred and, if so, to what extent the behavior of the probe would be uniform across the plug. The emission spectrum of pyrene at position 266 (Fig. 2 B) behaves similarly to that of the probe at 265 (Fig. 2 A), just outside the plug region. V266C/C374A G-actin shows the same two peaks as S265C/C374A at 385 and 405 nm and a shoulder at 429 nm when excited at 365 nm. Furthermore, like the case for 265 (Fig.2 A), the fluorescence intensities of the 266 peaks (Fig.2 B) decrease by 50% upon polymerization with no change in spectrum, suggesting that the probe is probably being pushed into a more polar or more solvent-exposed environment away from the “plug” so as not to disturb the hydrophobic “plug-pocket” interaction (14Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ca2+ with Mg2+ had no effect on the fluorescence of the fluorophor at position 266 (data not shown). To further assess the polymerization-related changes on the environment of the loop probes, we examined the effects of the small neutral collisional quencher acrylamide on pyrene fluorescence in both labeled G- and F-actin. Fluorescence quenching evaluates the degree of exposure of a fluorophore to the solvent and is characterized by the Stern-Volmer constant K SV. A change in the degree of protection against the quencher between the G- and F-actin states would indicate a change in exposure of the probe to solvent acrylamide (20Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). When pyrene is in a more protected environment, acrylamide will be prevented from colliding with the fluorophore, andK SV will be lower. In previous studies, acrylamide produced minimal perturbation of muscle actin, demonstrating that changes in acrylamide quenching did not result from acrylamide-dependent opening of the actin (22Tao T. Cho J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of the quencher to V266C/C374A actin, the Stern-Volmer plot curves downward in both G- and F-actin states, indicating the presence of different conformational states (Fig.3 B). In G-actin, there are two populations; 70% is very buried, since the K SVof that population is 0, and the other 30% is very exposed, as evidenced by a high K SV of 12.8 (TableI). Upon polymerization, the buried population becomes much smaller and becomes more exposed, since it now has a K SV of 1.1. The exposed population increases (64%) with a high K SV of 10.8. Thus, the decrease in fluorescence upon polymerization is reflected in increased quenching constants, supporting the idea that the pyrene is in a more solvent-exposed environment upon polymerization.Table IK SV values for the acrylamide quenching of the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actinsMultiple componentsMutant actinComponentBuriedExposedχ2Fraction K SVFraction K SV265G-actin0.830.580.179.80.45F-actin0.550.130.458.60.53266G-actin0.7200.2812.80.12F-actin0.361.10.6410.80.24269G-actin0.660.440.343.80.55F-actin0.840.750.165.10.56Single componentMutant actinComponent K SV r 2267G-actin0.260.99F-actin0.520.97All values except for those for the 267 probe were obtained from NLLS fitting of the quenching data.

The Stern-Volmer equation was used to obtain K SV values for 267. r is the correlation coefficient of the linear regression analysis of the data. The similarity in emission spectra of both V266C/C374A and S265C/C374A in both G- and F-actins suggested that the probes at 265 and 266 might be in similar environments. Therefore, we also investigated the quenching behavior of the probe at position 265. The Stern-Volmer plots curve downward again for both G- and F-actins (Fig.3 A), suggesting the presence of the fluorophore in heterogeneous environments in both states. NLLS fitting showed that in G-actin the exposed component, although small (17%), has a highK SV of 9.8, whereas 83% of the fluorescence is buried and has a small K SV (Table I). In G-actin, the probe at 267 shows a 9-nm blue shift of the 385 nm to 376 nm as well as the resolution of the 385-nm shoulder into a distinct peak at 385 nm (Fig 2 C). Polymerization results in a 30% decrease in fluorescence intensity when the probe is at position 267 (Fig. 2 C), suggesting again that the probe at 267, like that at 266, is moving into a more polar or more exposed environment. L267C/C374A actin (Fig3 C) exhibits linear Stern-Volmer plots in both G- and F-actin states consistent with a dynamic quenching mechanism for acrylamide. The quenching curves were easily fitted by a Stern-Volmer equation, suggesting that at position 267, the fluorophor resides in a predominantly uniform, although not necessarily identical, environment in both G- and F-actin. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant is very small, and it doubled after polymerization (from 0.26 to 0.52m−1) (Table I). The increase in accessibility correlates well with the decrease in emission upon polymerization. The relatively small quenching constants in both G- and F-actin states for the 267 probe suggest that in both states the probe at this particular residue is largely buried and shielded from the quencher. Pyrene-labeled L269C/C374A G-actin (Fig.2 D) shows fluorescence peaks at 375, 385, 395, and 405 nm at 25 °C. In the polymerized state, the fluorescence intensity of the 375- and 395-nm peaks are greatly enhanced (76 and 51%, respectively) over that of background fluorescence in G-actin, and the peaks at 385 and 405 nm are enhanced by 20%. Upon the addition of the quencher, the 385- and 405-nm peaks are more quenched than the 375- and 395-nm peaks. The K SV values are larger at 385/405 than at 375/395 nm. The Stern-Volmer plot shows a downward curvature (Fig3 D). This downward curvature can be explained in terms of heterogeneous populations of the fluorophor, which differ significantly in their individual exposure to the quencher. Assuming there are two major components and each of them has a unique emission spectrum andK SV, NLLS fitting for the 269 probe reveals that both G- and F-actin states show a more exposed component and a more buried component. The component spectra are similar going from G-actin (Fig. 4 A) to F-actin (Fig.4 C); however, the ratio of the two states changes during the transition. The more exposed component emits predominantly at 385 and 405, whereas the more buried component emits at 375 and 395 nm. TheK SV for the buried component is 0.44m−1 (G-actin) and 0.75m−1 (F-actin), whereas theK SV for the more exposed component is 3.8m−1 (G-actin) and 5.1m−1 (F-actin). The population size of the two components changes from G- to F-actin. The exposed component drops from 34 to 16%, whereas the"

E. coli ATCase, designated a class B enzyme, consists of six copies of two types of polypeptide chains, catalytic and regulatory. The 34-kDa catalytic chains associate to form catalytically active but unregulated trimers. The 17-kDa regulatory chains form dimeric subunits that bind the allosteric effectors CTP, ATP, and UTP but have no activity. Crystallographic studies (13Honzatko R.B. Crawford J.L. Monaco H.L.

Chem. 1972; 247: 2308-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the molecule was dimeric; however, it was subsequently shown (23Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,24Shepherdson M. McPhail D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 114: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) to be a dodecamer consisting of six copies of a 36-kDa catalytic chain and 45-kDa polypeptide of unknown function. When O'Donovan and associates (25Schurr M.J. Vickrey J.F. Kumar A.P. Campbell A.L. Cunin R. Benjamin R.C. Shanley M.S. O'Donovan G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vickrey J.F. Isolation and Characterization of the Operon Containing Aspartate Transcarbamoylase and Dihydroorotase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Ph.D. thesis. University of North Texas, Denton, TX1993Google Scholar) cloned and sequenced the genes encoding the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa, the surprising discovery was that, although the 36-kDa chains were clearly homologous to the catalytic chains of other well characterized ATCases, the sequence of the 45-kDa polypeptide closely resembled dihydroorotase, the enzyme that catalyzes the subsequent step in thede novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. However, the enzyme complex lacks dihydroorotase activity, so the 45-kDa polypeptide has been designated a pseudo-DHOase, analogous to the homologous inactive domain found (26Souciet J.-L. Nagy M. Legouar M. Lacroute F. Potier S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in the yeast multifunctional protein encoded by theura2 locus. The regulation of the Pseudomonas enzyme is also unusual. InE. coli the flux of metabolites through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is controlled by the allosteric regulation of ATCase. ATP activates the enzyme whereas CTP and UTP function as feedback inhibitors. The reciprocal regulation of the enzyme by these allosteric effectors is thought to prevent the accumulation of pyrimidines and to maintain a balance in the intracellular pools of purines and pyrimidines. In contrast,Pseudomonas ATCase (22Adair L.B. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2308-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is inhibited by low concentrations of all of the nucleotide triphosphates. Although there is precedent in that the enzymes from several other bacterial species are inhibited by a broad spectrum of pyrimidines and purines (27Wales M.E. Madison L.L. Glaser S.S. Wild J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1387-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the rationale for this type of allosteric control of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis has been elusive. Mechanistic and structural studies of Pseudomonadaceae aspartate transcarbamoylase have been hampered by the difficulty in isolating sufficient quantities of the protein and by its intrinsic instability. This report describes the overexpression, purification, and characterization of P. aeruginosa ATCase. The extreme sensitivity of the purified recombinant protein to nucleotide triphosphates was confirmed, but the regulation was found to be unusual in several respects. The plasmid, pA10, that encodes both the subunits of P. aeruginosa ATCase was obtained (45; GenBankTM accession number L19649) by inserting a 3.5-kbXhoI fragment of the cosmid 011125 that complemented ATCase-deficient E. coli strains into the SalI site of pUC18. The expression vector pRSETC was purchased from Invitrogen. Host E. coli cells were either EK1104 (F −, ara, thi, Δpro-lac, ΔpyrB, pyrF±,rpsL) (28Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BL21 (DE3) (F − dcm ompT hsdS(r B -m B -)gal λ(DE3)), or DH5α (F − (φ80dlacZΔM15) d(lacZYA-argF)U169 endA1 recA1 hsdR17(rK-mK+)deoRthi-1 supE44 gyrA96 relA1 λ−). Routine genetic manipulations were carried out using the strain DH5a. Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out on 12% polyacrylamide gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). In some instances, 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels were run, and the ATCase activity of the bands in the gel was determined as described previously (18Purcarea C. Herve G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartate transcarbamoylase assay was assayed by the method of Prescott and Jones (12Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) as modified by Pastra-Landiset al. (32Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Typically 50 ng of the purified protein was assayed at 37 °C for 20 min in a 1.0-ml assay mixture consisting of 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate and 20 mm aspartate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Alternatively, a radioactive assay described previously (33Perbal B. Herve G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 511-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that uses [14C]aspartate as a substrate was used to measure aspartate transcarbamoylase activity. Unless specifically noted, the reaction was initiated by the addition of carbamoyl phosphate to the otherwise complete assay mixture. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as μmol/h/mg. To determine whether inhibition by two nucleotides is additive, antagonistic, or synergistic, the extent of inhibition was determined in the presence of one and both effectors following the approach described by Webb (34Webb J. Enzyme and Metabolic Inhibitors. 1. Academic Press, New York1963: 507-510Google Scholar). The activity in the presence of an inhibitor 1 is given by the expression a 1 = (1 −i 1), where i is the fractional inhibition. In the presence of two inhibitors that function independently, inhibition should be additive, and the activity (a 12) would be the product of the activities ora 12 = (1 −i 1)(1 − i 2) =i 1 + i 2 −i 1 i 2. Smaller and larger values of a 12 would be indicative of antagonist or synergistic inhibition, respectively. Additive or synergistic inhibition is an indication that the inhibitors bind to different sites on the enzyme. For these experiments, one inhibitor was held constant at a concentration giving ∼50% inhibition, whereas the second was varied over it effective range. The pH activity profile was determined using a three-part buffer (35Leger D. Herve G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4293-4298Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) consisting of 0.05 m MES, 0.1 m diethanolamine, and 0.05 m N-ethylmorpholine. A least squares fit of the substrate saturation data to the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation was carried out using either Kaleidagraph 2.1 (Abelbeck software) or Scientist (Micromath). The concentration of free ATP was calculated from the total concentration of ATP and Mg2+ ion using published (36Perrin D.D. Sharma V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) stability constants. P. aeruginosa ATCase is expressed constitutively in EK1104 cells transformed with pA10 grown in M9 media supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids, 0.5 μg/ml ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 μg/ml FeSO4·7H2O, 1 mm MgSO47H2O, 5 μg/ml thiamin, 0.001% tryptophan. Alternatively, the recombinant protein was obtained from BL21(DE3) E. coli cells transformed with pJV34, a plasmid constructed as described under “Results.” The competent host cells were prepared using the method of Huff et al.(37Huff J.P. Grant B.J. Penning C.A. Sullivan K.F. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 570-577PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the enzyme in the pJV34 transformants was under control of the T7 promoter. A 1-ml culture of exponentially growing transformed cells obtained from a single colony was used to inoculate 100 ml of YT media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a rotary shaker (225 rpm) at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.4–0.6. The expression of the protein was then induced by the addition of IPTG to a concentration of 400 μm. The cells were then grown for an additional 2 h prior to harvesting. For purification of the recombinant protein from EK1104 cells transformed with pA10, 85 g of packed cells were suspended in 100 ml of sonication buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02 mm ZnCl2 at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated on ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 31,000 × g to remove the cellular debris. After clarifying the extract by centrifugation at 48,000 ×g for 90 min, the supernatant (128 ml) was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Protein precipitating between 30 and 45% ammonium sulfate saturation was resuspended in 6 ml of the sonication buffer and dialyzed exhaustively against the same buffer. The dialyzed protein was chromatographed on a 26 × 1.6-cm Sepharose Q fast-flow column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at a flow rate 1.0 ml/min. After washing the column overnight with 50 ml of 0.25m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25–0.6 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing ATCase activity were pooled, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. The preparation was concentrated using an Amicon Protein Concentrator under nitrogen to a final volume of 20 ml. The concentrated sample was chromatographed on a 1.9 × 90-cm Sephacryl 300HR column equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. The active fractions were then applied to a 6 × 1.2-cm hydroxylapatite column and eluted with a 0–0.2 m gradient of potassium phosphate in the same buffer. For purification of recombinant ATCase from pJV34 BL21(DE3) transformants, 500 mg of packed cells obtained from a 100-ml culture were washed once with 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol containing 200 mm NaCl and resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer. The cells were disrupted using a Branson sonifier. The sonication protocol consisted of four 20-s bursts with a microtip set at 50% duty cycle, output 5.5, with a 1-min cooling period on ice between each burst. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation 12,000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was immediately applied to 1 ml of ProBondTM nickel matrix (Invitrogen) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl. The column was successively washed with 2 ml of 25 mm imidazole, 2 ml of 50 mm imidazole, and 2 ml of 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The fractions containing ATCase were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol at 4 °C and then stored at −80 °C. Initially, recombinant P. aeruginosa ATCase was isolated from E. coli transformed with the plasmid pA10 following the five-step protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final yield (Table I) starting with 85 g of packed cells was 400 μg. The specific activity of 525 μmol/h/mg of the homogeneous protein was appreciably lower than the values observed for ATCase isolated from other bacterial sources.Table IPurification of recombinant P. aeruginosa ATCasePurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activity-Fold purification mg μmol/mg μmol/h/mgpA10 clone 1.

Open table in a new tab Because of the low specific enzymatic activity, the low yield of protein, and the laborious isolation procedure, the protein was recloned into a high expression system that appends a His tag affinity label to the amino end of the catalytic subunit to facilitate purification. The 2.4-kb PstI fragment of pA10 containing the entire P. aeruginosa ATCase coding sequence was inserted (Fig. 1) into the expression vector pRSETC. The resulting plasmid, pJV34, encodes the 45-kDa pDHO subunit and the 36-kDa catalytic subunit with a 3-kDa chain segment containing six histidines fused to the amino end. Following transformation intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3), expression of the recombinant protein was induced with IPTG. P. aeruginosa ATCase was produced at very high levels (Fig. 2,lane Ex), but approximately two-thirds of the protein was recovered in the pellet following low speed centrifugation. The ATCase in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2, lane Su) was purified in a single step by chromatography on a Ni2+ affinity column. After washing the column to remove non-specifically bound proteins, the ATCase was eluted with 200 mm imidazole as a homogeneous protein (Fig. 2, lane ATC) consisting of 45- and 36-kDa polypeptides. Electrophoresis on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels revealed a single species that migrated appreciably more slowly than E. coli ATCase (data not shown), a result consistent with the dodecameric structure (23Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of the Pseudomonasenzyme. A yield (Table I) of 3 mg of homogeneous protein was obtained from a 100-ml culture (0.5 g of packed cells). The final specific activity of the purified ATCase was 12,500 μmol/h/mg, comparable with that observed (28Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the E. coli enzyme. The histidine-rich segment at the amino end of the catalytic chain could be removed by enterokinase protease digestion. The cleaved catalytic chain was the same size as the wild type enzyme, but the first 8 residues at the amino end differed in sequence (Fig. 1) as a consequence of the cloning procedure. The specific activity of the ATCase isolated using the pJV34 expression system was 51-fold higher that the recombinant protein isolated from the pA10 transformants.Figure 2Expression and purification ofP. aeruginosa ATCase. A, the pJV34/E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants produced high levels of P. aeruginosa ATCase representing 70% of the total protein in the cell extract (Ex). The soluble fraction (Su), obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 4 min, was applied to a 1.0-ml Ni2+affinity column. The column was washed with 3 column volumes (E1, E2, and E3) of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, and 25 mm imidazole. The purified protein (ATC) was eluted with the same buffer except that the concentration of imidazole was increased to 200 mm. Molecular weight standards (St) are also shown, as is a more concentrated sample of the protein (ATC) on the adjacent gel. B, purified ATCase, at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, was crystallized by the hanging drop method in 0.1 m citrate, pH 5.0, 10% 6K polyethylene glycol. The crystals, thick trapezoidal plates, grew to 0.2-mm in the longest dimension within 1 week.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified protein was crystallized by the hanging drop method (38Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). Equal volumes (2 μl) of the purified protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, was mixed with the precipitin, 100 mm citrate, pH 5, and 10% 6K polyethylene glycol. The resulting crystals (Fig. 2 B), well formed half-hexagonal plates, 0.3-mm in the longest dimension, set the stage for future x-ray structure diffraction studies. The pseudo-DHO coding sequence was deleted from pJV34 by restriction withAspI and HindIII and religation. Transformation of the resulting construct, pJV30, into BL21 cells, resulted in the expression of high levels of the P. aeruginosa catalytic chain. However, all of the protein was present in insoluble inclusion bodies and exhibited no catalytic activity. The insoluble protein was dissolved in 8 m urea and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol. The protein remained in solution after removal of the denaturant, suggesting that it had refolded into a stable, soluble species, but the enzymatic activity was not recovered. In another series of experiments, the catalytic chain coding sequence in pJV34 was deleted by digestion with XhoI andHindIII. High levels of the isolated pDHO subunit were expressed when the truncated plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. 2N. Sahay, unpublished data. This species was completely soluble but, as expected, had no catalytic activity. In an attempt to reconstitute the native complex, 70 ng of the refolded catalytic subunit was titrated with increasing amounts (8–160 ng) of the soluble pDHO subunit (data not shown). Because only the catalytic chain carried the His tag affinity label, coelution of the 36- and 45-kDa subunits from the Ni2+ affinity column indicated that a stable complex was formed. However, the reconstituted complex also lacked catalytic activity. The holoenzyme was incubated in various concentrations of urea (0.2–2m), and the chromatographed on the Ni2+ column equilibrated with the same concentration of urea. The enzyme dissociated by 2 m urea, as indicated by the elution of the 45-kDa pDHO subunits and retention of the 36-kDa catalytic chains on the column, but the catalytic activity was lost. Collectively, these results suggest that the isolated catalytic subunit must be associated with pDHO subunits to be catalytically active. When ATCase was completely denatured in 8 m urea and then refolded by dialysis against a buffer lacking the denaturant, a complex consisting of stoichiometric amounts of the two ATCase subunits was recovered from the affinity column (Fig.3 A), but it was also inactive. Gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3 B) showed that the molecular mass of the reconstituted complex was similar to that of the native dodecamer (480 kDa), although the peak was broader, possibly an indication of the presence of higher and lower oligomers. Thus, although dissociated and denatured ATCase can be reconstituted into a complex resembling the native enzyme in size and subunit composition, it has not been possible to restore catalytic activity. The aspartate saturation curve ofP. aeruginosa ATCase (Fig.4 A) was hyperbolic. As observed for the isolated E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit, there was no indication of cooperative substrate binding, but high concentrations of aspartate partially inhibited the enzyme (not shown). A least squares fit of the data gave a K m for aspartate of 2.6 mm and a V max, of 12,500 μmol/h/mg (Table II). The carbamoyl phosphate saturation curve (Fig. 4 B) was also hyperbolic, but in this case there was no apparent substrate inhibition. The K m for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.49 mm. The pH optimum for catalysis was measured using saturating concentrations of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate. Catalytic activity increased steeply as the pH increased from pH 7 to 8.5 and then began to decrease. A fit of the plot of ln(V max) against pH (not shown) to the Dixon equation gave a pK a of 8.1 for the acidic limb of the curve. The pH-rate profile of the P. aeruginosa enzyme closely resembles that of the E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit but is very different from bimodal pH dependence of the allosteric E. coli holoenzyme (39Weitzman P.D.J.

TPA treatment has little or no effect on FGF receptor activation but specifically inhibits the activation of p38 MAPK but not other downstream signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation. p38 MAPK was recently shown to be required for the FGF-2-stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts. The effect of TPA on both p38 MAPK activation and cell proliferation can be reversed by treatment with the PKC inhibitor Go6983. The TPA-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK activation requires phosphatase activity and is at least partially mediated by ERKs since it is reduced by treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, the FGF-2-stimulated differentiation of PC12 cells, which express the same FGF receptor as Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, is not affected by TPA treatment, consistent with a lack of involvement of p38 MAPK activity in this process. These data indicate that the effects of TPA treatment on cellular function are not only cell type but also stimulus specific and are dependent upon the distinct pathways activated downstream of each stimulus."

In this work, the self-interaction ability of GA-1 SSB has been analyzed by visualization of the purified protein by electron microscopy, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and in vivo cross-linking of bacterial cultures infected with phage GA-1. GA-1 SSB contains an insert at its N-terminal region that is not present in the SSBs of φ29 and Nf. Three deletion mutant proteins have been characterized, ΔN19, ΔN26, and ΔN33, which lack the 19, 26 or 33 amino acids, respectively, that follow the initial methionine of GA-1 SSB. Mutant protein ΔN19 retains the structural and functional behavior of GA-1 SSB, whereas mutant proteins ΔN26 and ΔN33 no longer stimulate viral DNA replication or display helix-destabilizing activity. Analysis of the mutant proteins by ultracentrifugation in glycerol gradients and electron microscopy indicates that deletion of 26 or 33 but not of 19 amino acids of the N-terminal region of GA-1 SSB results in the loss of the oligomerization ability of this protein. Our data support the importance of the N-terminal region of GA-1 SSB for the differential self-interaction ability and functional behavior of this protein."

Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A distinct region of pre-U2 RNA lying near the 3′ end of mature RNA has been shown to be critical for accurate and efficient 3′-processing (16Jacobson M.R. Rhoadhouse M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was also found that sequences in the 5′-half of pre-U2 RNA play no role in the 3′-processing reaction (16Jacobson M.R. Rhoadhouse M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that in the folded structure of pre-U2 RNA, the 5′-half of the molecule is not interactive with the 3′ end, at least not in a way that influences the 3′-processing reaction. The 3′ end of pre-U2 RNA also has been implicated in the nucleocytoplasmic traffic of U2 RNA. Non-processed 3′ end variants of pre-U2 RNAs display impaired nuclear import in bothXenopus oocytes (18Konings D.A.M. Mattaj I.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and human cells (19Huang Q. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that cytoplasmic 3′-processing is a key step in the nuclear import pathway.The 3′ end of the precursor of human U2 RNA consists of an 11-nucleotide element (11Wieben E.D.

In this study, we have investigated the structure of the 3′ end of human pre-U2 RNA by chemical and enzymatic probing methods and find that it exists as a stably folded minihelix. Additional results suggest that this 3′ end minihelix of pre-U2 RNA may be more relevant to the initial cleavage of pre-U2 RNA from its primary transcript or its intracellular traffic rather than its 3′-processing reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFull-length wild-type human pre-U2 RNA was transcribed from plasmid pMRG3U2 (16Jacobson M.R. Rhoadhouse M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Human pre-U2 RNA with a wild-type 3′ tail and lacking nucleotides 1–104 (non-essential for 3′-processing) was transcribed from the plasmid pMRG3U2–54 (16Jacobson M.R. Rhoadhouse M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pre-U2 RNAs with mutant 3′ tails, U2–75 and U2–80, were transcribed from the plasmids described previously (17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The RNAs were labeled at their 5′ ends with g-[32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase or at their 3′ ends with [32P]pCp and RNA ligase. The RNA samples containing 10–100 ng/μl reaction (2 × 104 dpm/μl) were subjected to Pb2+-mediated cleavage in 50 mmpotassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 4 or 10 mmPbCl2. The reactions were carried out at 20 °C for 6 min. Nuclease VI and RNase T2 and T1 digestions were done in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 6 min at 20 °C. Nuclease VI was used at 5 or 10 units/ml, RNase T2 was used at 10 or 25 units/ml, and RNase T1 was used at 5 or 25 units/ml. In all of the experiments, the RNA was preincubated for 5 min at 70 °C followed by 15 min at 20 °C in the absence of PbCl2 or enzyme to renature the RNA. Yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was present at 200 mg/ml in all enzymatic digestions and chemical probing with the exception of RNase T1 digestions where it was present at 20 mg/ml. After chemical cleavage, the reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (20 mm), and the RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation. After enzymatic cleavages, the RNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction in the presence of EDTA (25 mm final concentration). In the case of RNase T1, the reactions were also stopped by the addition of an excess of tRNA (2 mg/ml). The RNAs were dissolved in deionized formamide containing 20 mmEDTA, 0.05% (w/v) cyanol blue, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue and were displayed by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea followed by autoradiography. Sequencing ladders were obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of labeled RNA (90 min at 96 °C in 20 ml of deionized H2O) followed by ethanol precipitation. RNase T1 sequencing was performed by the digestion of heat-denatured labeled RNA with 1000 units/ml RNase T1 in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml tRNA for 30 min at 55 °C in 7 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0. Diethylpyrocarbonate sequencing was performed for 9 min at 96 °C in 500 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 4.5, in the presence of tRNA (50 mg/ml) followed by ethanol precipitation and aniline treatment (33Donis-Keller H. Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 2527-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFig. 1 A shows both the full-length human pre-U2 RNA, and Fig. 1 B shows the miniature pre-U2–54 RNA used in this investigation. We have previously shown that the 3′-processing of pre-U2–54 RNA is identical to that of full-length pre-U2 RNA (17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine the structure of the 3′ end of both pre-U2 RNAs, the pre-U2 RNAs were labeled at their 3′ (both RNAs) or 5′ (pre-U2–54) ends with 32P and subjected to chemical (Pb2+) or enzymatic digestion methods that produce RNA structure-dependent phosphodiester bond cleavages (34Ehresman C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Ehresman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a representative RNA sequencing gel of the pre-U2–54 RNA cleavage products. Fig. 2,A and B, shows Pb2+ and enzymatic cleavages obtained with 5′ end-labeled pre-U2–54 RNA, and Fig.2 C shows the probing of 3′ end-labeled pre-U2–54 RNA. Fig.3 presents the RNA structure deduced from the experimental data. The results indicate that the 3′ extension of the pre-U2–54 RNA has a minihelix structure with an estimated stability (change in free energy upon its formation) of approximately −6.9 kcal/mol (35Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Google Scholar). In keeping with the Roman numeral-based nomenclature used for the previously determined secondary structures of mature spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs, we term the 3′ minihelix “stem-loop V.” We noted in particular that there was no indication in the structure probing results for the previously entertained pseudoknot interaction between stem-loop V and an internal region at the base of stem-loop IV (see Fig. 10 in Ref. 17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed, our results indicate that the internal sequence previously considered as the partner for the contemplated pseudoknot is actually a part of stem-loop III itself and thus is unavailable for pseudoknot formation.Figure 2Chemical and enzymatic probing of pre-U2–54 RNA. Electrophoresis of the RNA fragments obtained after chemical or enzymatic treatment is shown. In vitro transcripts of the plasmid pMRG3U2–54 were either 5′ end-labeled (panels A andB) or 3′ end-labeled (panel C) and subjected to Pb2+ or enzymatic cleavage under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lead (Pb) and enzymes RNase T1 (T1), RNase T2 (T2), and RNase V1 (V1) used are indicated at the top of the lanes. Adjacent lanes marked 1 and 2correspond to two concentrations of Pb2+ or the enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lanes marked 0refer to the reaction with neither Pb2+ nor enzyme. Sequencing lanes C, H, T, and D are control (C), alkaline hydrolysis ladder (H), T1-sequencing ladder (T), and diethylpyrocarbonate-sequencing ladder (D), respectively. The gel positions of RNA fragments corresponding to the stem-loops in pre-U2–54 RNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Schematic compilation of the data obtained from chemical and enzymatic probing of pre-U2–54 RNA.

The expected low yield of cleaved molecules in the present experiments is indicated by the large amounts of uncut RNA remaining at the origins of the sequencing gels (Fig. 2). The deliberate use of these low frequency cleavage conditions minimizes or eliminates intermolecular interference by fragments or cleavage-induced alterations of the intramolecular folded structure.To determine whether stem-loop V, as detected in pre-U2–54, is also present in wild-type full-length pre-U2 RNA, similar Pb2+and enzymatic-probing experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig.4, the results indicated a structure virtually identical to that obtained for pre-U2–54. In addition to demonstrating that stem-loop V is a feature of the normal cellular pre-U2 RNA, these results show that the overall secondary structure of the mature region of the molecule is congruent with the previously determined secondary structure of mature U2 small nuclear RNA itself (23Branlant C. Krol A. Ebel J. Lazar E. Haendler B. Jacob M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first experimentally based description of the secondary structure of the precursor form of any of the spliceosomal small RNAs.Figure 4Structure probing of the 3′ end of full-length human pre-U2 RNA.

Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). U2–75 has an altered 3′ end in which the previously contemplated pseudoknot would not form. As can be seen in Fig.5, even though U2–75 is not processed efficiently (17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), its 3′ end nevertheless has a minihelical structure. Based on this finding, we went on and determined the 3′ end of another mutant, pre-U2–80, which has a compensatory base-pairing mutation designed to restore the aforementioned hypothetical pseudoknot and which is processed nearly as efficiently as wild-type pre-U2 RNA (17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 6, the 3′ end of pre-U2–80 has a structure very different from the 3′ end of pre-U2–54. Instead of stem-loop V, the 3′ end forms a base-paired configuration with an internal region near the 5′ base of stem-loop III.Figure 5Schematic compilation of chemical and enzymatic probing of pre-U2–75 RNA.

The major conclusion is that the 3′-terminal nucleotides of human pre-U2 RNA form a stable minihelix. Such a structure had been suggested previously by computational RNA-folding algorithms 1M. R. Jacobson and T. Pederson, unpublished results. but could not be singularly considered because of a then-plausible alternative structure in which the pre-U2 RNA 3′ tail was potentially engaged in a pseudoknot with a single-stranded region lying just upstream from the 5′ edge of stem-loop III (see Fig. 10 in Ref. 17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The second conclusion from this study is that the stem-loop V minihelix is not essential for 3′-processing, because it is present in a processing-defective mutant,viz. pre-U2–75, and is absent from a mutant that does process well, viz. pre-U2–80. However, in the present study, the structures of the 3′ end of pre-U2 RNA were studied in the absence of cellular proteins including the processing activity itself, and it is possible that in vivo the 3′ ends of pre-U2–55 and pre-U2–80 would adopt different structures. This notwithstanding, the results of this study are compatible with the idea that the 3′ minihelix has some other function in U2 RNA biosynthesis of which the following examples are the two most plausible possibilities. One possibility is that this structure serves as a recognition element for the machinery that cleaves pre-U2 RNA from the initial U2 RNA primary transcript. It is known that the primary transcript of human U2 RNA extends 250 nucleotides or more beyond the 3′ end of the penultimate pre-U2 RNA molecule (36Cuello P. Boyd D.C. Dye M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Murphy S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2867-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the sequence that forms stem-loop V in the penultimate pre-U2 RNA has the same structure in the primary transcript as opposed to being single-stranded because of other dominant secondary structure or by being itself tied up in a longer range structure. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the stem-loop V sequence does adopt the same minihelical structure and thus potentially plays a role in the 3′ cleavage of the primary transcript to form pre-U2 RNA.A second and not mutually exclusive possibility is that the 3′ minihelix of pre-U2 RNA plays a role in its nuclear export. This idea is based on the indication in an earlier study that a mutant pre-U2 RNA, which could not have possibly formed the presently defined 3′ minihelix, was exported less efficiently from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (17Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent investigation has revealed that 3′ minihelix structures are essential for the nuclear export of other small RNAs (37Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.-C. Blanchard J.-M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and 3′ minihelix extensions built onto chimeric tRNA-ribozyme RNAs have also been shown to enhance export from the nucleus (38Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Koseki S. Sano M. Ohkawa J. Nakayama K. Taira K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2780-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The next step in understanding the structure of pre-U2 RNA will probably come from crystallography, because pre-U2 RNA (∼200 nucleotides) is considerably beyond the size of RNA that can be studied by NMR at present. Crystallization efforts using mature-length U-small nuclear RNAs have not yielded diffracting crystals so far, but such efforts should certainly be pursued and encouraged. Meanwhile, our present study reinforces the continuing important role of chemical and nuclease cleavage based methods for RNA structure determination (34Ehresman C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Ehresman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The major spliceosome that operates on most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs contains five small RNAs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Beyond their role in mRNA splicing, the biosynthesis of these small spliceosomal RNAs is itself an interesting process. U6 small nuclear is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (1Kunkel G.R. Maser R.L.

Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other four major spliceosomal RNAs, U1, U2, U4, and U5, are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in mammalian cells as precursor molecules extended at their 3′ ends that are then exported to the cytoplasm where they undergo cap hypermethylation and ribonucleoprotein assembly followed by 3′ end processing and nuclear import (4Eliceiri G.L.
