Many of these diapirs are similar to the Gulf of Mexico salt domes, and it is suggested that there is a continuous deep sea salt layer, off the continental margin, which is related to the early phase of rifting."

https://openalex.org/W2027977743,THE Bouger anomaly map of the continental shelf to the west of Orkney and Shetland recently published by Bott and Watts1 provides gratifying confirmation of the geology of this area which I proposed earlier2. My predictions were based on an interpretation of the aeromagnetic map of the area and include not only most of the deep sedimentary basins proposed by Bott and Watts but also the great NW–SE trending strip of Lewisian rocks labelled A by Bott and Watts.

https://openalex.org/W2088938216,"PHASE determination by direct methods is more difficult for non-centrosymmetric than for centrosymmetric crystals. The phase, α(h,k,l), can take any value for the former crystal between 0 and 2π while the choice for the latter crystal is limited to two values, 0 or π. If the structure is non-centrosymmetric and contains a small number of atoms which scatter anomalously, then α(h,k,l) can be determined from the Bijvoet difference, for example, ΔI= |F(h,k,l)|2−|F(h,k,l)|2, and the known phase αp′ of the anomalous scatterers1,2. From where αN′ is α(h,k,l), the phase of the reflexion, FN′, if there were no anomalous scattering. F″p is the contribution from the absorption term Δf″P. The indeterminacy in equation (1) arises because the cosine is an even function. In practice, the ambiguity has been resolved by choosing αNl′ to be the phase closest to αP′ (ref. 3) or by calculating a double phased synthesis2. An alternative, indeed the original method, is to calculate the Patterson sine function4."

https://openalex.org/W2014788584,"THE apparent four day rotation of the cytherean atmosphere was first pointed out by Boyer (private communication) in 1957 and the retrograde sense of the rotation was discovered by Boyer and Camichel1 from the cloud markings often visible on ultraviolet photographs. The presence of this rotation has been reported several times since (refs. 2–8 and unpublished work of Kuiper et al.). The periodicity shows itself in two ways: (a) any particular formation, if observed over a period of hours, demonstrates a retrograde rotation of period approximately four days, although the periods obtained in this way scatter about a mean value; (b) large scale markings with easily recognizable shapes reappear at intervals of four days or multiples of this value, and the appearance of particular formations can be predicted for long periods in advance. Fig. 1 shows the short term evolution for a type of cloud pattern often observed."
