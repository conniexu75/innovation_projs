https://openalex.org/W2010916267,"Cell differentiation is based almost certainly on the regulation of gene activity, so that for each state of differentiation a certain set of genes is active in transcription and other genes are inactive. The establishment of this concept (1) has depended on evidence
indicating that the cells of an organism generally contain identical genomes (2). Direct support for the idea that regulation of gene activity underlies cell differentiation
comes from evidence that much of the genome in higher cell
types is inactive (3) and that different ribonucleic acids (RNA) are synthesized in different cell types (4)."

https://openalex.org/W2074570859,"A specific protein is Present in serums of all of Leucophaea maderae that mature eggs but not in serums of males, nymphs of either sex, or females that are reproductively inactive. Ablations, microsurgery and remplantation showed that this protein is produced de novo under the influence of the corpus allatum hormone. This protein, essential for egg maturation, is synthesized in isolated abdimens of allatectomized females treated with 0.08 to 0.12 microgram of the t,t,t-isomer of the authentic juvenile hormone. The crops allatum hormone also stimulates toa similar degree the synthesis of other proteins which appear to be essential for egg maturation as well; these are not specific to females."

https://openalex.org/W2092276510,"The plant cytokinin isopentenyladenosine, a component of yeast and mammalian transfer ribonucleic acid, is both a potent inhibitor and stimulator of DNA synthesis, transformation, and mitosis of the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte. The stage of the cell cycle and the concentrations used are critical for these effects. The addition of isopentenyladenosine within the first 12 hours after phytohemagglutinin at a concentration above 10(-6) molar results in inhibition, while lower concentrations (between 10(-7) and 10(-6) molar), added at 24 hours or later, have a stimulatory effect."

https://openalex.org/W2004560935,"A model which predicts judgment of the temporal order of stimuli from simple reaction time is proposed. Visual data show covariation of the two measures with luminance changes, and suggest that (i) temporal order judgments reflect a biased response criterion and (ii) the motor component of reaction time has little variability relative to variance in receptor system latency."

https://openalex.org/W2007404952,"In patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is characterized by deficient aldolase activity toward fructose-1-phosphate, fructose induces a renal tubular dysfunction that implicates only the proximal convoluted tubule. Because normal metabolism of fructose by way of fructose-1-phosphate requires fructokinase, aldolase ""B,"" and triokinase, the exclusively cortical location of these enzymes indicates that the medulla is not involved in the metabolic abnormality presumably causal of the renal dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2009141428,This article rebuts points proposed by Judith Blake in Population Policy for Americans: Is the government being misled?. Contrary to Blakes opinions U.S. family planning programs have been advanced to improve health and reduce poverty rather than to control the population growth. Blake accuses family planners of misleading the public into the belief that extending family planning to the poor would bring population stability but family planners have not suggested this since they acknowledge that the high fertility of the poor is not the major reason for the U.S. population growth. Advocates of family planning do not assert that birth control was not extended to the poor because of political considerations. Blake overstates the differences in fertility between social classes and assumes the poor desire a larger family size basing her arguments on opinion polls rather than in depth studies. Data from the 1965 National Fertility Study shows that excessive fertility among lower socioeconomic groups is due to a lack of information and services and not due to higher desired fertility size. Family planners thus attempt to equalize access to effective methods of contraception by providing services to the poor. The estimate of 5 million women who need subsidized family planning is not an exaggeration but a reasonable approximation. It is concluded that the immediate objective of federal policy on family planning is the extension of effective fertility control measures to all women who want and need them.
