https://openalex.org/W2030886582,"Observations have shown that the hydrological cycle of the western United States changed significantly over the last half of the 20th century. We present a regional, multivariable climate change detection and attribution study, using a high-resolution hydrologic model forced by global climate models, focusing on the changes that have already affected this primarily arid region with a large and growing population. The results show that up to 60% of the climate-related trends of river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack between 1950 and 1999 are human-induced. These results are robust to perturbation of study variates and methods. They portend, in conjunction with previous work, a coming crisis in water supply for the western United States."
https://openalex.org/W2037831301,"The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope. The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins--a required process for unpacking of the viral genome. In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm. Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti-viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication. Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy-terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward-facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C-terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid-facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix-helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening."

In addition, cohesins appear to regulate gene expression and enhancer-promoter interactions. These noncanonical functions remained unexplained because knowledge of cohesin-binding sites and functional interactors in metazoans was lacking. We show that the distribution of cohesins on mammalian chromosome arms is not driven by transcriptional activity, in contrast to S. cerevisiae. Instead, mammalian cohesins occupy a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites, many of which contain sequence motifs resembling the consensus for CTCF, a DNA-binding protein with enhancer blocking function and boundary-element activity. We find cohesins at most CTCF sites and show that CTCF is required for cohesin localization to these sites. Recruitment by CTCF suggests a rationale for noncanonical cohesin functions and, because CTCF binding is sensitive to DNA methylation, allows cohesin positioning to integrate DNA sequence and epigenetic state."

https://openalex.org/W2044151926,"The motion of polymer chain segments cooled below the glass transition temperature slows markedly; with sufficient cooling, segmental motion becomes completely arrested. There is debate as to whether the chain segments near the free surface, or in thin films, are affected in the same way as the bulk material. By partially embedding and then removing gold nanospheres, we produced a high surface coverage of well-defined nanodeformations on a polystyrene surface; to probe the surface dynamics, we measured the time-dependent relaxation of these surface deformations as a function of temperature from 277 to 369 kelvin. Surface relaxation was observed at all temperatures, providing strong direct evidence for enhanced surface mobility relative to the bulk. The deviation from bulk α relaxation became more pronounced as the temperature was decreased below the bulk glass transition temperature. The temperature dependence of the relaxation time was much weaker than that of the bulk α relaxation of polystyrene, and the process exhibited no discernible temperature dependence between 277 and 307 kelvin."

https://openalex.org/W1980318325,"The M2 protein from influenza A virus is a pH-activated proton channel that mediates acidification of the interior of viral particles entrapped in endosomes. M2 is the target of the anti-influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine; recently, resistance to these drugs in humans, birds and pigs has reached more than 90% (ref. 1). Here we describe the crystal structure of the transmembrane-spanning region of the homotetrameric protein in the presence and absence of the channel-blocking drug amantadine. pH-dependent structural changes occur near a set of conserved His and Trp residues that are involved in proton gating. The drug-binding site is lined by residues that are mutated in amantadine-resistant viruses. Binding of amantadine physically occludes the pore, and might also perturb the pK(a) of the critical His residue. The structure provides a starting point for solving the problem of resistance to M2-channel blockers."

https://openalex.org/W2128389934,"The vitrification of pure water is compared with that of molecular solutions rich in water, and gross differences are noted. Thermodynamic reasoning and direct observations on noncrystallizing nanoconfined water indicate that the glass transition in ambient-pressure water is qualitatively distinct from that found in the usual molecular liquids. It belongs instead to the order-disorder class of transition seen in molecular and ionic crystalline materials. The distinctive “folding funnel” energy landscape for this type of system explains the extreme weakness of the glass transition of water as well as the consequent confusion that has characterized its scientific history; it also explains the very small excess entropy at the glass transition temperature. The relation of confined water behavior to that of bulk is discussed, and the “fragile-to-strong” transition for supercooled water is interpreted by adding a “critical point–free” scenario to the two competing scenarios for understanding supercooled bulk water."

https://openalex.org/W2078015793,"SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase critically involved in stress responses, cellular metabolism and, possibly, ageing. The tumour suppressor p53 represents the first non-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation; we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating p53 (refs 4-6). These results were further supported by the fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation-induced apoptosis were observed in Sirt1-deficient mice. Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase function is also implicated in p53-independent pathways under different cellular contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO family and PGC-1alpha directly modulate metabolic responses. These studies validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. DBC1-mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous DBC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) stimulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1. Our study demonstrates that DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1."

https://openalex.org/W2067706784,"Recombination plays a crucial role in meiosis, ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow “hotspots.” To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots."
https://openalex.org/W2040566267,"We introduce a method for the bottom-up assembly of biomolecular structures that combines the precision of the atomic force microscope (AFM) with the selectivity of DNA hybridization. Functional units coupled to DNA oligomers were picked up from a depot area by means of a complementary DNA strand bound to an AFM tip. These units were transferred to and deposited on a target area to create basic geometrical structures, assembled from units with different functions. Each of these cut-and-paste events was characterized by single-molecule force spectroscopy and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Transport and deposition of more than 5000 units were achieved, with less than 10% loss in transfer efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2022582268,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent regulation of voltage-gated CaV1–2 Ca2+ channels shows extraordinary modes of spatial Ca2+ decoding and channel modulation1,2,3,4,5,6, vital for many biological functions6,7,8,9. A single calmodulin (CaM) molecule associates constitutively with the channel’s carboxy-terminal tail3,10,11,12,13, and Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal and N-terminal lobes of CaM can each induce distinct channel regulations2,14. As expected from close channel proximity, the C-lobe responds to the roughly 100-μM Ca2+ pulses driven by the associated channel15,16, a behaviour defined as ‘local Ca2+ selectivity’. Conversely, all previous observations have indicated that the N-lobe somehow senses the far weaker signals from distant Ca2+ sources2,3,17,18. This ‘global Ca2+ selectivity’ satisfies a general signalling requirement, enabling a resident molecule to remotely sense cellular Ca2+ activity, which would otherwise be overshadowed by Ca2+ entry through the host channel5,6. Here we show that the spatial Ca2+ selectivity of N-lobe CaM regulation is not invariably global but can be switched by a novel Ca2+/CaM-binding site within the amino terminus of channels (NSCaTE, for N-terminal spatial Ca2+ transforming element). Native CaV2.2 channels lack this element and show N-lobe regulation with a global selectivity. On the introduction of NSCaTE into these channels, spatial Ca2+ selectivity transforms from a global to local profile. Given this effect, we examined CaV1.2/CaV1.3 channels, which naturally contain NSCaTE, and found that their N-lobe selectivity is indeed local. Disruption of this element produces a global selectivity, confirming the native function of NSCaTE. Thus, differences in spatial selectivity between advanced CaV1 and CaV2 channel isoforms are explained by the presence or absence of NSCaTE. Beyond functional effects, the position of NSCaTE on the channel’s amino terminus indicates that CaM can bridge the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of channels. Finally, the modularity of NSCaTE offers practical means for understanding the basis of global Ca2+ selectivity19."
https://openalex.org/W2021943859,"The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a major role in neuronal dysfunction and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease. However, the signal transduction mechanisms involved in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction remain to be fully elucidated. A major current unknown is the identity of the protein receptor(s) involved in neuronal Abeta binding. Using phage display of peptide libraries, we have identified a number of peptides that bind Abeta and are homologous to neuronal receptors putatively involved in Abeta interactions. We report here on a cysteine-linked cyclic heptapeptide (denominated cSP5) that binds Abeta with high affinity and is homologous to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of several members of the Frizzled (Fz) family of Wnt receptors. Based on this homology, we investigated the interaction between Abeta and Fz. The results show that Abeta binds to the Fz cysteine-rich domain at or in close proximity to the Wnt-binding site and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, the cSP5 peptide completely blocks Abeta binding to Fz and prevents inhibition of Wnt signaling. These results indicate that the Abeta-binding site in Fz is homologous to cSP5 and that this is a relevant target for Abeta-instigated neurotoxicity. Furthermore, they suggest that blocking the interaction of Abeta with Fz might lead to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease."

https://openalex.org/W2023703673,"Background Lens crystallines are special proteins in the eye lens. Because the epithelial basement membrane (lens capsule) completely encloses the lens, desquamation of aging cells is impossible, and due to the complete absence of blood vessels or transport of metabolites in this area, there is no subsequent remodelling of these fibers, nor removal of degraded lens fibers. Human tissue ultimately derives its 14C content from the atmospheric carbon dioxide. The 14C content of the lens proteins thus reflects the atmospheric content of 14C when the lens crystallines were formed. Precise radiocarbon dating is made possible by comparing the 14C content of the lens crystallines to the so-called bomb pulse, i.e. a plot of the atmospheric 14C content since the Second World War, when there was a significant increase due to nuclear-bomb testing. Since the change in concentration is significant even on a yearly basis this allows very accurate dating. Methodology/Principal Findings Our results allow us to conclude that the crystalline formation in the lens nucleus almost entirely takes place around the time of birth, with a very small, and decreasing, continuous formation throughout life. The close relationship may be further expressed as a mathematical model, which takes into account the timing of the crystalline formation. Conclusions/Significance Such a life-long permanence of human tissue has hitherto only been described for dental enamel. In confront to dental enamel it must be held in mind that the eye lens is a soft structure, subjected to almost continuous deformation, due to lens accommodation, yet its most important constituent, the lens crystalline, is never subject to turnover or remodelling once formed. The determination of the 14C content of various tissues may be used to assess turnover rates and degree of substitution (for example for brain cell DNA). Potential targets may be nervous tissues in terms of senile or pre-senile degradation, as well as other highly specialised structures of the eyes. The precision with which the year of birth may be calculated points to forensic uses of this technique."

https://openalex.org/W1994330097,"The transcription apparatus in Archaea can be described as a simplified version of its eukaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) II counterpart, comprising an RNAPII-like enzyme as well as two general transcription factors, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the eukaryotic TFIIB orthologue TFB. It has been widely understood that precise comparisons of cellular RNAP crystal structures could reveal structural elements common to all enzymes and that these insights would be useful in analysing components of each enzyme that enable it to perform domain-specific gene expression. However, the structure of archaeal RNAP has been limited to individual subunits. Here we report the first crystal structure of the archaeal RNAP from Sulfolobus solfataricus at 3.4 A resolution, completing the suite of multi-subunit RNAP structures from all three domains of life. We also report the high-resolution (at 1.76 A) crystal structure of the D/L subcomplex of archaeal RNAP and provide the first experimental evidence of any RNAP possessing an iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster, which may play a structural role in a key subunit of RNAP assembly. The striking structural similarity between archaeal RNAP and eukaryotic RNAPII highlights the simpler archaeal RNAP as an ideal model system for dissecting the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2072906889,"Core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are the explosions that announce the death of massive stars. Some CC-SNe are linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and are highly aspherical. One important question is to what extent asphericity is common to all CC-SNe. Here we present late-time spectra for a number of CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars and use them to explore any asphericity generated in the inner part of the exploding star, near the site of collapse. A range of oxygen emission-line profiles is observed, including a high incidence of double-peaked profiles, a distinct signature of an aspherical explosion. Our results suggest that all CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars are aspherical explosions and that SNe accompanied by GRBs exhibit the highest degree of asphericity."
https://openalex.org/W2005528634,"Linguists speculate that human languages often evolve in rapid or punctuational bursts, sometimes associated with their emergence from other languages, but this phenomenon has never been demonstrated. We used vocabulary data from three of the world's major language groups—Bantu, Indo-European, and Austronesian—to show that 10 to 33% of the overall vocabulary differences among these languages arose from rapid bursts of change associated with language-splitting events. Our findings identify a general tendency for increased rates of linguistic evolution in fledgling languages, perhaps arising from a linguistic founder effect or a desire to establish a distinct social identity."
https://openalex.org/W2089847071,"The genome-wide recombination rate varies between individuals, but the mechanism controlling this variation in humans has remained elusive. A genome-wide search identified sequence variants in the 4p16.3 region correlated with recombination rate in both males and females. These variants are located in the RNF212 gene, a putative ortholog of the ZHP-3 gene that is essential for recombinations and chiasma formation in Caenorhabditis elegans. It is noteworthy that the haplotype formed by two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the highest recombination rate in males is associated with a low recombination rate in females. Consequently, if the frequency of the haplotype changes, the average recombination rate will increase for one sex and decrease for the other, but the sex-averaged recombination rate of the population can stay relatively constant."
https://openalex.org/W2021989110,"With a combination of complementary experimental techniques, namely sedimentation assay, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we are able to determine the atomic structure around the metal-binding site in samples where amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are complexed with either Cu(II) or Zn(II). Exploiting information obtained on a selected set of fragments of the Aβ peptide, we identify along the sequence the histidine residues coordinated to the metal in the various peptides we have studied (Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>, Aβ<sub>1-16</sub>, Aβ<sub>1-28</sub>, Aβ<sub>5-23</sub>, and Aβ<sub>17-40</sub>). Our data can be consistently interpreted assuming that all of the peptides encompassing the minimal 1-16 amino acidic sequence display a copper coordination mode that involves three histidines (His<sup>6</sup>, His<sup>13</sup>, and His<sup>14</sup>). In zinc-Aβ complexes, despite the fact that the metal coordination appears to be more sensitive to solution condition and shows a less rigid geometry around the binding site, a four-histidine coordination mode is seen to be preferred. Lacking a fourth histidine along the Aβ peptide sequence, this geometrical arrangement hints at a Zn(II)-promoted interpeptide aggregation mode."

The mechanism of its translocation into the nucleus is not entirely elucidated. Here we have identified two novel nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs in murine Nrf2, one located near the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 42-53) and the other (residues 587-593) located near the C-terminal region. Imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Nrf2 revealed that mutation(s) in any of these sequences resulted in decreased nuclear fluorescence intensity compared with the wild-type Nrf2 when Nrf2 activation was induced with the electrophile tert-butylhydroquinone. The mutations also impaired Nrf2-induced transactivation of antioxidant response element-driven reporter gene expression to the same extent as the Nrf2 construct bearing mutation in a previously identified bipartite NLS that maps at residues 494-511. When linked to GFP or to GFP-PEPCK-C each of the novel NLS motifs was sufficient to drive nuclear translocation of the fusion proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that importins alpha5 and beta1 associate with Nrf2, an interaction that was blocked by the nuclear import inhibitor SN50. SN50 also blocked tert-butylhydroquinone-induced nuclear fluorescence of GFP-Nrf2 in cells transfected with wild-type GFP-Nrf2. Overall these results reveal that multiple NLS motifs in Nrf2 function in its nuclear translocation in response to pro-oxidant stimuli and that the importin alpha-beta heterodimer nuclear import receptor system plays a critical role in the import process."

Although epi-isozizaene had never previously been isolated from any natural source, the corresponding 5-keto derivative, albaflavenone (3, Fig. 1), which has been reported to have an earthy, camphor-like odor and to exhibit antibacterial activity, has previously been isolated from Streptomyces albidoflavus (14Gurtler H. Pedersen R. Anthoni U. Christophersen C. Nielsen P.H. Wellington E.M. Pedersen C. Bock K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Scholler C.E. Gurtler H. Pedersen R. Molin S. Wilkins K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 2615-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We now report that CYP170A1 catalyzes the two-step allylic oxidation of epiisozizaene to albaflavenone through the intermediacy of an epimeric mixture of albaflavenols (4a and 4b, Fig. 1) and that all four compounds can be detected in extracts of S. coelicolor. Expression and Purification of CYP170A1—CYP170A1 was expressed and purified as reported earlier (12Lamb D.C. Fowler K. Kieser T. Manning N. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To improve protein expression, CYP170A1 was coexpressed with molecular chaperones GroES/GroEL (16Nishihara K. Kanemori M. Kitagawa M. Yanagi H. Yura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells cotransformed with the plasmids CYP170A1pET17b and pGro12 were cultured overnight in Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After inoculation (1:100) in 1.5 liters of Terrific Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, growth was carried out at 37 °C and 240 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm reached ∼1.0. After the addition of 1 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid for heme synthesis and induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, chaperone expression was induced by addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml. Cell growth was continued for an additional 20 h at 27 °C and 190 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.7, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm NaCl). Cells were broken by freeze-thawing and the cytosol containing CYP170A1 isolated following centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The soluble CYP170A1 was purified by metal (Ni2+) affinity chromatography (Qiagen) by washing with 20 mm imidazole followed by 50 mm imidazole and elution with 100 mm histidine. UV-visible Spectra and Substrate Binding Assay—All absorbance spectra were recorded using a double beam Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. A reduced CO difference spectrum was carried out as described previously (12Lamb D.C. Fowler K. Kieser T. Manning N. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The interaction of epi-isozizaene with CYP170A1 was examined by perturbation of the heme Soret spectrum. CYP170A1 (2.5 μm) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (2.0 ml, pH 7.7) was divided between two tandem cuvettes. After thermal equilibration at 25 °C a baseline was established between 350 and 450 nm and sequential portions (1–5 μl) of concentrated epiisozizaene (1 mm in Me2SO) were added to the CYP170A1 chamber of the sample cuvette and the buffer chamber of the reference cuvette to give a final ligand concentration in the range of 0–30 μm. An equal volume of Me2SO was added to the CYP170A1 chamber of the reference cuvette and the difference spectrum recorded after each titration. Kd values were estimated by fitting plots of ΔA390–420 versus [epi-isozizaene]. Disruption of CYP170A1 Gene in S. coelicolor—The CYP170A1 knock-out strain was isolated from a library of 1 × 105 independent mutants generated by in vivo transposition in S. coelicolor, as described previously (12Lamb D.C. Fowler K. Kieser T. Manning N. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CYP170A1 Activity Assay in Vitro—CYP170A1 (1 nmol), Escherichia coli flavodoxin (10 nmol), and E. coli flavodoxin reductase (2 nmol) were reconstituted in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and epiisozizaene (20 nmol) plus 1% Me2SO. Following incubation of this mixture for 5 min on ice, the reconstituted enzyme solution was placed in a shaking bath at 35 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 1 mm and 60 μl of an NADPH-regenerating system (glucose-6-phosphate (60 mm), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3 mm), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.2 unit)). The reaction was carried out for 1.5 h in a 10-ml test tube, at which time it was quenched with 4 μl of concentrated HCl and extracted three times with 400 μl of pentane:methylene chloride (4:1). The extracts were concentrated under a stream of N2, and 2 μl of extract was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The turnover rate for the epi-isozizaene oxidation was determined by carrying out a series of 30-min incubations with the concentration of 5–90 μm substrate. The mixtures were extracted and analyzed by GC/MS. The turnover number was calculated by a nonlinear regression fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Isolation and Identification of Terpenoids Produced by S. coelicolor—S. coelicolor A3(2) M145 and the CYP170A1 knockout strain were cultured side by side at 30 °C in yeast extract-malt extract medium (17Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000: 405-418Google Scholar) for 2–5 days at 280 rpm. 500-ml fermentation cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 rpm (3500 × g), which was extracted three times with 10 ml of pentane :methylene chloride (4:1) at pH 5 for 2 h. The extracts were dried over Na2SO4 for 20 min on ice, concentrated under a stream of N2 to 200 μl, and 2 μl of extract was analyzed by GC/MS. GC/MS Analysis of in Vitro and in Vivo Products—For GC/MS analysis, electron impact (EI) mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan DSQ Quantum mass spectrometer in the EI positive ion full-scan mode with ion source at 250 °C. GC separations were achieved using a fused silica HP5 (25-m, 0.32-mm inside diameter) capillary column, with energy of ionization 70 electron volts and temperature program (70 °C hold for 4 min, to 300 °C at 10 °C/min, 300 °C hold for 2 min). Enzymatic Synthesis of Epi-isozizaene and Synthesis of Albaflavenols/Albaflavenone—Farnesyl diphosphate (12.0 mg) was incubated overnight at 30 °C with epi-isozizaene synthase (0.6 μmol), isolated, and purified as previously described (13Lin X. Hopson R. Cane D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6022-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A mixture of epi-isozizaene (2 mg) and selenium dioxide (20 mg) was stirred in 3 ml of methylene chloride overnight at room temperature. The resulting suspension was applied to a 1-cm silica gel column and eluted with methylene chloride, collecting fractions of 0.5 ml. Fractions containing pure albaflavenol (Rf 0.15, methylene chloride, SiO2 TLC) were combined and concentrated under vacuum. GC/MS analysis indicated the formation of a 1.4:1 mixture of epimeric alcohols, m/z 220, 4a (tR 11.4 min) and 4b (tR 11.6 min) high resolution mass spectrum (4a/4b): m/z 220.1830 observed (calculated for C15H24O: 220.1827). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on the mixture of 4a and 4b and the individual signals assigned based on the 1.4:1 ratio of the two components, using a combination of one- and two-dimensional NMR, including 13C DEPT135, 1H1H COSY, HMBC, and HSQC spectra (Table 1).TABLE 11H and 13C NMR assignments of albaflavenols (4a and 4b) and albaflavenone (3Quaderer R.

A mixture of 0.5 mg of albaflavenols (4a and 4b), 20 mg of celite, and 10.0 mg of CrO3 in 2 ml of ether:methylene chloride (3:1) was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. After removal of the solids by filtration, the solvent was evaporated and the resulting product 3 analyzed directly by GC/MS (m/z 218, tR 12.3 min) and NMR, including 1H and 13C NMR, 13C DEPT135, and HSQC NMR (Table 1). Unique Reduced CO Difference Spectra—To investigate the possible biochemical function of CYP170A1, we tested whether epi-isozizaene could be the substrate of CYP170A1 because the CYP170A1 gene (sco5223) is directly downstream of that encoding the sesquiterpene cyclase (sco5222) (13Lin X. Hopson R. Cane D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6022-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We purified a histidine-tagged CYP170A1 protein (supplemental Fig. S1). The oxidized absolute spectrum of CYP170A1 shows Soret bands at 393 and 417 nm that indicate a mixture of high spin and low spin states (Fig. 2A), the ratios between the spin states varying somewhat between different preparations. It could be that some very hydrophobic ligand from E. coli bound into the heme pocket and leads to the partial high spin state of CYP170A1. The position of these Soret bands are typical for high and low spin P450s. Surprisingly, the purified CYP170A1 displays a unique reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum, with a maximum ∼440 nm instead of the typical P450 difference absorption maximum at ∼450 nm (Fig. 2B). Lamb et al. (12Lamb D.C. Fowler K. Kieser T. Manning N. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported previously that this monooxygenase could have a reduced carbon monoxide difference spectral maximum at or below 447 nm in assays. Under our experimental conditions, we have examined more than 10 preparations of purified enzyme and the Soret maximum reproducibly seen at 440 nm. All other P450s reported to date show the Soret maximum of the reduced CO difference spectra at or about 450 nm, from which the name of these monooxygenases arises (18Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 10-nm hypsochromic shift of the absorbance maximum was the same whether the reduction was carried out chemically (Na2S2O4) or with biological redox proteins (E. coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase). The molecular basis for the observed Soret maximum at 440 nm in the reduced CO difference spectrum of CYP170A1 remains unknown at present. It is also an open question whether there is any biological significance for this unusual shift to shorter wavelength. In Vitro Activity of CYP170A1—Titration of CYP170A1 with epi-isozizaene produced a typical type I P450 binding spectrum in which the low spin heme Soret peak at 420 nm is shifted to a high spin peak at 390 nm (Fig. 2C). The dissociation constant for epiisozizaene (Kd) was calculated to be 1.3 ± 0.2μm, strongly suggesting that epi-isozizaene can specifically bind to the active site of CYP170A1 and supporting the proposed role of epi-isozizaene as a substrate. Analysis of the CYP170A1-catalyzed reaction by GC/MS revealed the time-dependent formation of two isomeric products with m/z 220 (tR 11.4 min; tR 11.6 min) in a ratio of ∼1:1.2 and a third product with m/z 218 (tR 12.3 min) (Fig. 3). Negative control incubations lacking CYP170A1, flavodoxins, or NADPH did not generate any products. Synthesis of Albaflavenols and Albaflavenone—To identify these metabolites produced by CYP170A1, we synthesized reference standards of the epimeric albaflavenols and albaflavenone. Allylic oxidation of epi-isozizaene with SeO2 gave a 1.4:1 mixture of two albaflavenol epimers for which the structures were readily assigned based on the appearance of the characteristic 1H NMR signals atδ 4.56 (doublet, J = 5.40 Hz) and 4.61 (triplet, J = 7.82 Hz) for the H-5, allylic CHOH protons in the major and minor isomers, respectively, as well as the observation of the corresponding C-5 carbinyl 13C signals at 70.80 and 71.85 ppm. Comparison with the spectra of epi-isozizaene confirmed the disappearance of the H-5 allylic methylene proton signals at δ 2.2 (doublet of doublet of quartets) and 2.06 (doublet of doublet of doublet of quartets) and the C-5 methylene at 27.3 ppm. Full assignments, based on a combination of standard one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments are given in Table 1. Although we did not attempt to separate the individual epimers, we have provisionally assigned the configuration of the two alcohols, using Hyperchem 7.5 and MM+ to predict the coupling constants for the H-5 carbinyl protons, based on the calculated ground state conformation of each epimer. In this manner 4a was assigned the (5S)-configuration (doublet, J = 5.40 Hz; predicted: doublet, J = 6.2 Hz) and epimer 4b the (5R)-configuration (triplet, J = 7.82 Hz; predicted: doublet of doublets, J = 5.5, 7.2 Hz). Oxidation of the mixture of 4a and 4b with CrO3 on celite gave a single product, albaflavenone, whose 1H and 13C NMR spectra as well as electron impact mass spectrum were in complete agreement with those reported for the antibiotic albaflavenone previously isolated from S. albidoflavus (14Gurtler H. Pedersen R. Anthoni U. Christophersen C. Nielsen P.H. Wellington E.M. Pedersen C. Bock K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Scholler C.E. Gurtler H. Pedersen R. Molin S. Wilkins K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 2615-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The m/z 220 components of the CYP170A1-catalyzed oxidation of epi-isozizaene were identified as albaflavenol epimers 4a and 4b by direct comparisons of their retention time and their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with the authentic albaflavenols (supplemental Fig. S2), whereas the m/z 218 product was identical to synthetic albaflavenone in GC retention time and mass spectrum (supplemental Fig. S3). These results clearly demonstrate that CYP170A1 catalyzes the two-step oxidation of epi-isozizaene to the antibiotic albaflavenone. CYP170A1 first carries out a non-stereo-specific oxidation of epi-isozizaene to give a mixture of the albaflavenol epimers 4a and 4b, each of which can serve as substrate for the second oxidation to yield albaflavenone 3 (Fig. 1). This is quite different from most other P450s which catalyze regio- and stereospecific oxidation. For example, Hyoscyamus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (CYP71D55) has very high stereospecificity to produce the single alcohol solavetivol intermediate for solavetivone (19Takahashi S. Yeo Y.S. Zhao Y. O'Maille P.E. Greenhagen B.T. Noel J.P. Coates R.M. Chappell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31744-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, incubation of the mixture of epimeric albaflavenols 4a and 4b with CYP170A1 in the presence of flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase and the NADPH regenerating system led to formation of albaflavenone, confirming that both epimers can serve as substrates for this P450 (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note, when comparing the amount of albaflavenone produced by epiisozizaene or albaflavenols as substrate, that CYP170A1 can generate ∼3-fold more albaflavenone from epi-isozizaene than from the mixture of albaflavenols as substrate even when the alcohol concentration is 10-fold higher than that of epi-isozizaene. This could indicate that release of the alcohols into the medium followed by rebinding to CYP170A1 is inefficient and is not important in the catalytic activity. This could also indicate that the mechanism of the oxidation of the allylic alcohols to albaflavenone by CYP170A1 involves abstraction of two hydrogen atoms (Fig. 5). It would seem less likely that the alcohol intermediates could flip in the active site without dissociation to form the geminal 5,5-diol followed by loss of a water to produce albaflavenone. However, it is very possible that the alcohol intermediates may re-enter the active site via different orientations to form the unstable gem-diol intermediate because this enzyme generates the epimeric albaflavenols nonstereoselectively. The two mechanisms might be distinguished by analyzing albaflavenone obtained from CYP170A1-catalyzed oxidation of 18O-labeled albaflavenols (20Wood A.W. Swinney D.C. Thomas P.E. Ryan D.E. Hall P.F.

Toxicol. 1996; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At this stage we cannot exclude any of the possible mechanisms discussed here or that this enzyme may proceed through a combination of gem-diol and double hydrogen abstraction mechanism. None of the proposed CYP170A1 reaction mechanisms is without precedent. Nevertheless, only a small number of CYPs have been shown to catalyze two sequential oxidation steps (3Quaderer R. Omura S. Ikeda H. Cane D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 13036-13037Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi S. Yeo Y.S. Zhao Y. O'Maille P.E. Greenhagen B.T. Noel J.P. Coates R.M. Chappell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31744-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine in detail the CYP170A1 active site that can bind epi-isozizaene in two orientations, producing two alcohol epimers, and then convert both to the same ketone. X-ray crystallography studies are underway to permit this analysis. Using the flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase couple, the turnover number is ∼0.32 min–1 for conversion of epiisozizaene to albaflavenone. The natural ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase electron transport couple for CYP170A1 from among the 24 possible combinations in S. coelicolor is unknown, and therefore the rate of conversion of epi-isozizaene will probably be increased with the endogenous reductase system. However, as noted above, the binding constant of epi-isozizaene to CYP170A1 clearly predicts it to be an endogenous substrate.FIGURE 5Proposed mechanism of biosynthesis of albaflavenone catalyzed by CYP170A1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Involvement of CYP170A1 in Albaflavenone Biosynthesis—The oxidation of epi-isozizaene to albaflavenols (4a and 4b) and albaflavenone by CYP170A1 led us to focus on the hydrophobic secondary metabolites produced by the parent S. coelicolor strain. Culture extracts from both wild type and the CYP170A1 knock-out strain were analyzed by GC/MS. Both epimers of albaflavenol as well as albaflavenone were produced by the wild-type strain, whereas none of these three metabolites could be detected in the extracts of the CYP170A1 knock-out stain (Fig. 6). Epi-isozizaene was detected in the extracts of the wild-type culture, with the titer gradually decreasing during 5 days of fermentation. 1 was found in the CYP170A1 knock-out culture as well as at levels 7-fold lower than in wild type (Fig. 6). A possible explanation is that the transcript of epi-isozizaene synthase gene (sco5222) may be unstable or at low levels when the transposon is present in the CYP170A1 gene (sco5223), which is translationally coupled to sco5222 by a 4-nucleotide 3′-5′-ATGA overlap. In addition, we found germacradienol (5, a precursor of geosmin, Fig. 6) had accumulated in the CYP170A1 knock-out extract. Because there are only two sesquiterpene cyclases in S. coelicolor, epi-isozizaene synthase and geosmin synthase, the germacradienol accumulation would be expected when epi-isozizaene synthase was affected due to the competition of the common substrate, farnesyl diphosphate. Another major component (6, tR 12 min, m/z 218, Fig. 6) that is present in the extracts of the wild type, but absent in the CYP170A1 knock-out, has not been characterized yet. At present it is not clear whether this unknown compound is related to the biological function of CYP170A1 or to some other biological process, and this requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the in vivo observation is that epi-isozizaene is still produced, whereas all the derived albaflavenol and albaflavenone oxidation products are absent in the mutant, fully consistent with the results of the in vitro experiments and thereby confirming the deduced biochemical role of CYP170A1 in the two-step oxidative conversion of epi-isozizaene to the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone. S. avermitilis, the industrially important producer of the potent anthelminthic agent avermectin, harbors a two-gene cluster homologous to the sco5222-sco5223 pair of S. coelicolor (23Ikeda H. Ishikawa J. Hanamoto A. Shinose M. Kikuchi H. Shiba T. Sakaki Y. Hattori M. Omura S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). We have recently established that the sav3032 gene of S. avermitilis encodes a terpene synthase of 363 amino acids with 76% identity to S. coelicolor epi-isozizaene synthase that catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to epi-isozizaene. 5X. Lin, H. Ikeda, and D. Cane, unpublished observations. Notably, sav3032 is transcriptionally coupled with a four-nucleotide ATGA overlap to the downstream sav3031 gene encoding an apparent P450 (UniProt Q82IV2) of 456 amino acids with 76% identity to CYP170A1 of S. coelicolor (sco5223p) (24Lamb D.C.

It is therefore very likely that Streptomyces avermitilis will also produce albaflavenone and that the biochemical pathway is identical to that uncovered here in S. coelicolor. We have determined the endogenous biological function of the sco5222–sco5223 operon and the gene product (sco5223) CYP170A1 from S. coelicolor. Both in vitro and in vivo results firmly establish that CYP170A1 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone. Although there are multiple examples of three-step oxidations of methyl groups to carboxylic acids that are catalyzed by a single P450 (25Helliwell C.A. Chandler P.M. Poole A. Dennis E.S.

https://openalex.org/W1987233412,"AGPAT6 is a member of the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT) family that appears to be important in triglyceride biosynthesis in several tissues, but the precise biochemical function of the enzyme is unknown. In the current study, we show that AGPAT6 is a microsomal glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). Membranes from HEK293 cells overexpressing human AGPAT6 had higher levels of GPAT activity. Substrate specificity studies suggested that AGPAT6 was active against both saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Both glycerol 3-phosphate and fatty acyl-CoA increased the GPAT activity, and the activity was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent. Purified AGPAT6 protein possessed GPAT activity but not AGPAT activity. Using [13C7]oleic acid labeling and mass spectrometry, we found that overexpression of AGPAT6 increased both lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid levels in cells. In these studies, total triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine levels were not significantly altered, although there were significant changes in the abundance of specific phosphatidylcholine species. Human AGPAT6 is localized to endoplasmic reticulum and is broadly distributed in tissues. Membranes of mammary epithelial cells from Agpat6-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced GPAT activity compared with membranes from wild-type mice. Reducing AGPAT6 expression in HEK293 cells through small interfering RNA knockdown suggested that AGPAT6 significantly contributed to HEK293 cellular GPAT activity. Our data indicate that AGPAT6 is a microsomal GPAT, and we propose renaming this enzyme GPAT4.

Both glycerol 3-phosphate and fatty acyl-CoA increased the GPAT activity, and the activity was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent. Purified AGPAT6 protein possessed GPAT activity but not AGPAT activity. Using [13C7]oleic acid labeling and mass spectrometry, we found that overexpression of AGPAT6 increased both lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid levels in cells. In these studies, total triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine levels were not significantly altered, although there were significant changes in the abundance of specific phosphatidylcholine species. Human AGPAT6 is localized to endoplasmic reticulum and is broadly distributed in tissues. Membranes of mammary epithelial cells from Agpat6-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced GPAT activity compared with membranes from wild-type mice. Reducing AGPAT6 expression in HEK293 cells through small interfering RNA knockdown suggested that AGPAT6 significantly contributed to HEK293 cellular GPAT activity. Our data indicate that AGPAT6 is a microsomal GPAT, and we propose renaming this enzyme GPAT4. The main glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway uses glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) 2The abbreviations used are:G3Pglycerol-3-phosphateAGPAT1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferaseGPATglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferasePAphosphatidic acidLPAlysophosphatidic acidTGtriglyceridePCphosphatidylcholinePLphospholipidLC/MSliquid chromatography/mass spectroscopyDGdiacylglycerolNEMN-ethylmaleimidePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyESIelectrospray ionizationSMsphingomyelin.2The abbreviations used are:G3Pglycerol-3-phosphateAGPAT1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferaseGPATglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferasePAphosphatidic acidLPAlysophosphatidic acidTGtriglyceridePCphosphatidylcholinePLphospholipidLC/MSliquid chromatography/mass spectroscopyDGdiacylglycerolNEMN-ethylmaleimidePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyESIelectrospray ionizationSMsphingomyelin. and fatty acyl-CoA as substrates to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). This reaction is catalyzed by G3P acyltransferases (GPATs). LPA is then converted to phosphatidic acid (PA), which is catalyzed by 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT; also named LPAAT, for LPA acyl-CoA acyltransferase). Dephosphorylation of PA by PA phosphatase generates diacylglycerol (DG), which serves as the substrate for diacylglycerol acyltransferase in the formation of triglycerides (TGs). PA and DG can also enter the phospholipid (PL) biosynthetic pathways, leading to the formation of a variety of PL species. glycerol-3-phosphate 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase phosphatidic acid lysophosphatidic acid triglyceride phosphatidylcholine phospholipid liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy diacylglycerol N-ethylmaleimide phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin small interfering RNA high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization sphingomyelin. glycerol-3-phosphate 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase phosphatidic acid lysophosphatidic acid triglyceride phosphatidylcholine phospholipid liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy diacylglycerol N-ethylmaleimide phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin small interfering RNA high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization sphingomyelin. GPAT is regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme for the G3P biosynthetic pathway (1Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, two genes (GAT1 and GAT2) encode two separate GPAT proteins that share amino acid sequence homology with mammalian mitochondria GPAT (2Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Plants have three GPATs, one membrane-bound and the other two located within cytosol and chloroplasts (3Murata N. Tasaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two GPAT activities exist in most mammalian cells and tissues. One resides in the microsomal fraction, and the other is located within mitochondria (4Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for mitochondrial GPAT activity was purified, and the cDNA was cloned (5Shin D.H. Paulauskis J.D. Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23834-23839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yet S.F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mitochondria GPAT (named GPAT1) contains two transmembrane helices and is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria (7Gonzalez-Baro M.R. Granger D.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43182-43188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GPAT1 appears to prefer saturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, and its enzymatic activity is resistant to sulfhydryl-modifying agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (4Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GPAT1 in primary hepatocytes or in the liver leads to increased TG synthesis and reduced fatty acid oxidation (8Linden D. William-Olsson L. Ahnmark A. Ekroos K. Hallberg C.

Conversely, mice deficient in GPAT1 exhibit reduced fat mass, lower body weight, reduced hepatic TG content, and improved insulin sensitivity (10Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S.

Because residual GPAT activities were observed in mitochondria of Gpat1-deficient mice, it was hypothesized that a second mitochondrial GPAT enzyme must exist (12Lewin T.M. Schwerbrock N.M. Lee D.P. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13488-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). That enzyme was recently identified and designated GPAT2 (13Wang S. Lee D.P. Gong N. Schwerbrock N.M. Mashek D.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. Stapleton C. Li L.O. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mitochondria GPAT activity comprises only 30-50% of total GPAT activity in the liver and about 10% of GPAT activity in most other tissues, suggesting that microsomal GPAT is a major contributor to total GPAT activity (4Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The identity of the microsomal GPAT has been elusive, primarily due to the difficulty in purifying the enzyme. Recently, Cao et al. (14Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a microsomal GPAT (named GPAT3) that is induced during adipocyte differentiation. The expression of GPAT3, although high in adipose tissue, is fairly low in other tissues, suggesting the existence of other GPATs (14Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Two AGPAT enzymes have been identified in recent years, followed by the identification of an entire family of putative AGPAT proteins that share amino acid sequence similarities (15Eberhardt C. Gray P.W. Tjoelker L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20299-20305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Aguado B. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The biochemical roles for most of these proteins, however, are not clear. AGPAT8 was recently identified as GPAT3 (14Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several recent reports indicated that AGPAT9 was a lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT1) (17Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J.

AGPAT6 is one member of this “AGPAT family,” and its potential physiological role was recently studied using Agpat6-deficient mice (19Li D. Yu L. Wu H. Shan Y. Guo J. Dang Y. Wei Y. Zhao S. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Beigneux A.P. Vergnes L. Qiao X. Quatela S. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Coleman R.A. Walzem R.L. Philips M. Reue K. Young S.G. J.

A deficiency of AGPAT6 in mice results in resistance to dietinduced and genetic forms of obesity. Brown fat mass was significantly reduced, and DG and TG levels in milk and subdermal fat were reduced by nearly 90% (20Beigneux A.P. Vergnes L. Qiao X. Quatela S. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Coleman R.A.

However, the precise biochemical function of AGPAT6 remains unknown. In this study, we identified AGPAT6 as a novel microsomal GPAT and renamed it GPAT4. Cloning and Expression of AGPAT6—Full-length human AGPAT6 coding sequence (NCBI accession number NM_178819) was amplified by PCR amplification from human Ovary Marathon Ready cDNA (BD Bioscience and Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and the sequence was subsequently confirmed. A FLAG epitope was inserted in frame at the carboxyl terminus of the protein by PCR-based cloning. The cDNA was digested at HindIII and XbaI sites and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma). The human GPAT1 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from a human full-length cDNA clone TC106982 (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD). A FLAG epitope was inserted in frame at the carboxyl terminus of the protein by PCR-based cloning. The PCR-amplified segment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI sites and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV-14. The human GPAT3 was obtained similarly by PCR amplification of a human Heart Marathon Ready cDNA library (Clontech) followed by restriction digestion with HindIII and BamHI sites and subcloning into the mammalian expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV-14. A FLAG epitope was inserted in-frame at the carboxyl terminus of the protein by PCR-based cloning. The human DGAT1 clone was generated as described (22Cao J. Liu Y. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31727-31734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected by using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were washed with PBS and homogenized with three short 10-s pulses from a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA and a Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Total membrane fractions (100,000 × g pellet) were resuspended in a homogenization buffer and frozen at -80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined with a Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Expression of FLAG-tagged AGPAT6, GPAT1, and GPAT3 was verified by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Purification of AGPAT6—Two liters of HEK293E suspension cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a FLAG-tagged human AGPAT6. The cells were harvested at 42 h post-transfection and homogenized with five short 30-s pulses from a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer in 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove large debris and nuclei. Mitochondria fraction was removed by centrifuging the supernatant at 10,300 × g for 10 min. The microsomal fraction was acquired by centrifuging the supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g and solubilized in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) on ice for 1 h. AGPAT6 in the soluble fraction was purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography and eluted with buffer B containing 0.3 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by anti-FLAG M2 immunoblot analysis and peptide sequencing. siRNA Transfection—200 pmol of human GPAM siRNA (siRNA ID number 112114; Ambion, Austin, TX), human GPAT4 siRNA (siRNA ID number J-010300-11; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), and control siRNA (silencer negative control 1; Ambion) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNAs of the transfected cells were prepared for reverse transcription and real time PCR 2 days after the siRNA transfection. 5 μg of membrane proteins from the transfected cells were used for the in vitro GPAT activity assay. In Vitro Acyltransferase Assay—GPAT activity was determined in a final volume of 100 μl as previously described with some modifications (12Lewin T.M. Schwerbrock N.M. Lee D.P. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13488-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The assay was conducted in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm NaF, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA with 80 μm [14C]G3P (55 mCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and 20 μm fatty acyl-CoA (lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), oleoyl-CoA (C18:1), linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2), and arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4) (Sigma)) or 20 μm [14C]fatty acyl-CoA ([14C]lauroyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol)) and 200 μm G3P as substrates. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μg of membrane proteins. All assays were performed for 20 min at room temperature unless indicated. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), dried, and separated by TLC with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) followed by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. Where indicated, membrane proteins were incubated with or without 0.1, 0.5, or 50 μm NEM for 15 min on ice before the initiation of the reaction. Acyltransferase activity with LPA, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and DAG substrates was assayed with 20 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) and 200 μm acyl acceptors as described (14Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times. Metabolic Labeling Studies—HEK293 cells (40 h after transfection) were incubated with 2 μm [14C]oleic acid (54 mCi/mmol) in medium supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA for 6 or 20 h. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1). Lipids were resolved by TLC with chloroform/methanol/water (65: 25:4, polar lipids) or hexane/ethyl ethanol/acetic acid (80:20:1, neutral lipids) and visualized with a PhosphorImager. For metabolic labeling followed by LC/MS studies, 40 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were incubated with 30 μm [1,2,3,7,8,9,10-13C7]oleic acid (Sigma) in medium supplemented with 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 3 or 6 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, and total lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC. LPA and PA Measurement by LC/MS—LPAs (LPA C14:0, LPA C16:0, LPA C17:0, LPA C18:1, and LPA C18:0) and diacylphosphatidic acids (PA C16:0, C16:0, PA C17:0, C17:0, PA C18:0, C18:0, PA C16:0, C18:1, PA C18:0, C18:1, and PA C18:1, C18:1) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Stock standard solutions of each of the LPAs, PAs, and internal standards (LPA C17:0 and PA C17:0, C17:0, 50 ng/ml) were prepared in MeOH/water (80:20) containing 0.1% diethyl amine. Calibration standard solutions were prepared at concentrations ranging from 5 to 250 ng/ml. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of an Agilent 1100 binary pump (Palo Alto, CA), a CTC Leap Technologies HTS PAL Autosampler (Carrboro, NC) equipped with a 100-μl syringe, a Valco C6WK injector (Houston, TX), and a 10-μl sample loop. The analytical column was an Xbridge C8 (2.1 × 30 mm, 3.5 μm; Waters). The injection volume was 10 μl. The HPLC mobile phases consisted of methanol/chloroform/water (55:5:40) with 0.1% diethyl amine (A) and methanol/chloroform (50:50) with 0.1% diethyl amine (B). A gradient program was set for the separation at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The initial mobile phase was 100% and then linearly changed to 80% B at 0.5 min and then slowly changed to 100% of B at 0.2 min and maintained for 0.8 min, followed by re-equilibration to initial conditions for 0.5 min. Each run time was 2 min. The HPLC system was coupled on-line to a TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). Electrospray ionization (ESI) was performed in the negative mode with an ion spray voltage of 3.3 kV. Cone gas flow and desolvation gas flow were 37 and 697 liters/h, respectively. The heated nebulizer temperature was set at 300 °C, and the source temperature was 130 °C. The mass spectrometer operated with LM1, HM1, LM2, and HM2 resolution at 13.5. Multiple reaction monitoring detection for LPA and PA was used for quantitation with a dwell time of 20 ms for each transition. PC Measurement by LC/MS—Cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of methanol, and 200 μl was removed for ceramide analysis. The remaining 800 μl was added to 5 nmol of C14:0, C14:0PC, 5 nmol of C21:0, C21:0PC, 5 nmol of C17:0SM, 10 nmol of d5-tripalmitin, and 10 nmol of d5-tristearin internal standards prior to extraction. 1.0 ml of chloroform was added to the 800-μl aliquot of cell pellets, and the sample was vortexed prior to transferring to a 4-ml screw cap vial. Water (400 μl) was added to the extract, and the sample was vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The lower layer was carefully removed. 50 μl of 5 n HCl and 1 ml of chloroform were added to the remaining aqueous layer, and the extraction process was repeated. The lower chloroform layers from both extractions were combined and evaporated in a second 4-ml vial. The lipids were reconstituted in 1.0 ml of methanol/chloroform (1:1). A 500-μl aliquot was evaporated and reconstituted in 500 μl of methanol/chloroform (3:1) with 10 mm ammonium acetate. 10 μl of the sample was analyzed in duplicate for PC/SM. After the PC/SM analysis, the sample was evaporated and reconstituted in 200 μl of methanol/chloroform (3:1) with 10 mm ammonium acetate for TG analysis. PC levels were measured via a flow injection ESI-MS/MS method, adapted from the method of Schmitz and co-workers (23Liebisch G. Lieser B. Rathenberg J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suitable for rapid monitoring of PC and SM at μmol/liter to mmol/liter levels. Protonated molecular ions of PC/SM species were selected by precursor ion scans of m/z 184, the fragment ion containing the charged phosphatidylcholine head group. The ion intensities across the flow injection profile were summed, and after isotope correction, the quantities of each PC/SM species were calculated relative to PC and SM internal standards. TG Analysis by LC/MS—TG species containing C18:0, C18:1, and 13C7-C18:1 fatty acids were identified by flow injection ESI and MS/MS scans for ions as results of neutral loss of fatty acid and ammonia from the (M + NH4)+ molecular ions (24Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 25Murphy R.C. James P.F. McAnoy A.M. Krank J. Duchoslav E. Barkley R.M. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The amount of each TG was calculated from analyte to internal standard ratios and the concentration of d5-(C18:0)3 TG internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids). For TG analysis, aliquots of the various cell extracts were diluted into the spray solvent (5 μm ammonium acetate in isopropyl alcohol/methanol/chloroform: 4:2:1). The sample was vortexed and centrifuged and then transferred to the nanoinfusion device. Cells were extracted in the presence of isotopically labeled internal standards of TG. Data were acquired on an LTQ FT equipped with a 7-tesla magnet (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). ESI was accomplished with the Advion (Ithaca, NY) Triversa Nanomate nanoinfusion device. The 4.2-μm chip was held at 1.3 kV with 0.2 p.s.i. back-pressure of nitrogen. Product ion scans were acquired with a collision value of 28% with no ramping of the values. The heated capillary was held at about 150 °C. Xcalibur version 2.0 for the LTQ FT was used to generate the scan functions in these experiments. Data were acquired with the LTQ portion of the hybrid. The scan function was accomplished with the inclusion list feature, which commanded the mass spectrometer to generate product ions in a sequential fashion, starting at m/z 250 through m/z 1000. Each product ion event consists of two scans, each scan consisting of two separate scan events. Thus, in the roughly 1.2 s of acquisition, four scans were acquired for each precursor mass. A single acquisition results in 750 individual product ion events. This approach allowed the use of native quantitation software to produce ratios with the internal standards. This was accomplished using peak heights. Thus, for this study, the product ion of d5 C16 TG internal standard was chosen as the reference peak (m/z 556.7). This ion was used to normalize the TG product ions that contained either the [13C7]oleic acid side chain or the normal unlabeled product ions. Human AGPAT6 Subcellular Localization—COS-7 cells were grown and transfected with FLAG-tagged human AGPAT6 on glass bottom culture dishes (P35GC; MetTek Corp., Ashland, MA). To achieve mitochondrial staining, cells were incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde prewarmed for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were rinsed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (5.0 μg/ml; Sigma) or rabbit anti-calnexin N-terminal polyclonal antibody (1.0 μg/ml; StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada) in PBS with 1% BSA. After briefly washing with PBS, the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse SFX or Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit SFX (Invitrogen). The cells were counterstained with propidium iodide nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) in PBS. The samples were analyzed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61; Nashua, NH). Quantitative PCR Analysis of Human AGPAT6—Human normal tissue cDNA panels were obtained from BioChain (Hayward, CA) and PrimGen (Bothell, WA). TaqMan real time quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. Gene-specific primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The relative expression of the genes was determined by the Ct method (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of Tissue GPAT Activity—Total membranes from mammary epithelial cells were prepared as follows. The mammary glands were dissected from 2-day lactating female mice under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Mammary glands were pooled, minced with a razor blade, and digested in 0.2% trypsin/collagenase for 30 min in a 37 °C shaker. Adipocytes were eliminated by two rounds of low speed centrifugation (1500 rpm for 10 min), and the remaining pellet containing epithelial cells was treated with AKC buffer (8.3 mg/ml NH4Cl, 1 mg/ml KHCO3, 36 μg/ml EDTA, pH 7.4) to lyse red blood cells. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 250-μm nylon mesh. Epithelial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm and resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Total membrane fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation (90,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C) and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 5 μg of membrane proteins from wild-type or Agpat6-deficient mice were used for GPAT activity analyses as described above. Identification of GPAT Activity for AGPAT6—To identify potential microsomal GPATs, we searched the data bases for proteins containing acyl-CoA glycerolipid acyltransferase motifs. Candidate clones were overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. After transfection, membranes were prepared, and GPAT activity was assessed with TLC. Membranes from AGPAT6-expressing cells yielded substantial GPAT activity, and this enzyme was chosen for further analysis. Human AGPAT6 is 456 amino acids in length and is predicted to contain multiple transmembrane helices (19Li D. Yu L. Wu H. Shan Y. Guo J. Dang Y. Wei Y. Zhao S. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western blots of HEK293 cells transfected with a tagged AGPAT6 expressed a 48-kDa AGPAT protein (Fig. 1A), consistent with the size of mouse AGPAT6 (20Beigneux A.P. Vergnes L. Qiao X. Quatela S.

Aside from the 48-kDa protein, a smaller protein was visible in transfected cells, presumably a breakdown product. In labeling experiments involving membranes from transfected cells and either radiolabeled lauroyl-CoA or G3P, we found that AGPAT6 expression yielded GPAT activity (Fig. 1B)"
https://openalex.org/W1966714841,"Background Studies of perceptual learning have largely focused on unisensory stimuli. However, multisensory interactions are ubiquitous in perception, even at early processing stages, and thus can potentially play a role in learning. Here, we examine the effect of auditory-visual congruency on visual learning. Methodology/Principle Findings Subjects were trained over five days on a visual motion coherence detection task with either congruent audiovisual, or incongruent audiovisual stimuli. Comparing performance on visual-only trials, we find that training with congruent audiovisual stimuli produces significantly better learning than training with incongruent audiovisual stimuli or with only visual stimuli. Conclusions/Significance This advantage from stimulus congruency during training suggests that the benefits of multisensory training may result from audiovisual interactions at a perceptual rather than cognitive level."

In renal podocytes, we found that Nef induced loss of stress fibers and increased lamellipodia, pathological changes leading to proteinuria in HIV-associated nephropathy. These morphological changes were mediated by Nef-induced Rac1 activation and RhoA inhibition. We identified a new interaction between Nef and diaphanous interacting protein (DIP), a recently described regulator of Rho and Rac signaling. We found that the Src homology 3 binding domain of DIP and the Nef PXXP motif were required for this interaction. Nef also interacts with Vav2 in podocytes. DIP and Vav2 both interact directly with Nef in a competitive manner. DIP interacts with p190RhoGAP, and intact DIP was required for Nef-induced phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP. DIP also interacts with Vav2, and although DIP enhanced baseline phosphorylation of Vav2, it was not required for Nef-induced Vav2 activation. In Nef-infected podocytes, Src kinase induces phosphorylation of DIP, p190RhoGAP, and Vav2, leading to RhoA inhibition and Rac1 activation. Inhibition of the Nef-induced signaling pathway by using a dominant negative of either Src or DIP or siRNA for DIP or p190RhoAGAP restored RhoA activity and stress fiber formation in Nef-infected podocytes, whereas siRNA for Vav2 reduced Rac1 activity and formation of lamellipodia. We conclude that in HIV-infected podocytes, Nef, through the recruitment of DIP and p190RhoAGAP to Nef-Src complex, activates p190RhoAGAP and down-regulates RhoA activity.

Friedman E.A. Nicastri A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Pathologically, HIVAN is characterized by the collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, microcystic tubular dilatations, and tubulointerstitial nephritis (15D'Agati V. Suh J.I.

Pathol. 1987; 126: 513-526PubMed Google Scholar). Podocytes, the specialized epithelial cells that form the final filtration barrier of the glomerulus, are one of the primary cell types infected by HIV-1 (17Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Winston J.A. Bruggeman L.A. Ross M.D. Jacobson J. Ross L. D'Agati V.D. Klotman P.E. Klotman M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1979-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The importance of podocyte involvement in HIVAN pathogenesis is supported by the recent finding that mice expressing HIV-1 genes in podocytes alone develop all the pathologic findings of HIVAN, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis as well as tubular disease (19Zhong J. Zuo Y. Ma J. Fogo A.B. Jolicoeur P. Ichikawa I. Matsusaka T. Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 1048-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nef has been shown to be a major determinant of the HIVAN podocyte phenotype in vitro (20Husain M. Gusella G.L. Klotman M.E. Gelman I.H. Ross M.D. Schwartz E.J. Cara A. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc.

Nef induces podocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation by activating the Ras-Raf-MAPK1/2 and Src-Stat3 pathways (22He J.C. Husain M. Sunamoto M. D'Agati V.D. Klotman M.E. Iyengar R. Klotman P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A critical role for Nef was also identified in vivo, where podocyte-specific expression of Nef and Vpr induced glomerulosclerosis in a mouse model (23Zuo Y. Matsusaka T. Zhong J. Ma J. Ma L.J. Hanna Z. Jolicoeur P. Fogo A.B. Ichikawa I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The role of Nef or HIV in inducing podocyte morphologic change or effacement has yet to be explored. Podocytes are quiescent and highly differentiated cells with interdigitating foot processes that wrap around the glomerular capillary tuft to form a filtration barrier (24Mundel P. Shankland S.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the supporting the structure and function of the podocytes (25Ichimura K. Kurihara H. Sakai T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In HIVAN, podocytes have been shown both in vivo and in vitro to lose differentiation markers and proliferate (17Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Barisoni L. Bruggeman L.A. Mundel P. D'Agati V.D. Klotman P.E.

Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1677-1684PubMed Google Scholar). They also exhibit structural changes with loss of the characteristic foot processes. Unlike in other glomerular diseases associated with podocyte effacement, the actin cytoskeleton gradually disappears on electron microscopy in human HIVAN biopsies rather than being rearranged into a continuous cytoskeletal mat (17Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton in the podocyte is affected in HIVAN has not been delineated. The Rho family of small GTPases regulates the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells in response to extracellular signals (28Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E64-E66Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rho activation primarily causes formation of actin stress fibers, whereas Rac activation results in lamellipodia and membrane ruffling (29Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Nef may play a direct role in mediating the morphologic changes in podocytes, given its known ability to interact with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that in podocytes, Nef inhibits RhoA activity and stress fiber formation while activating Rac1 and lamellipodia formation. It has been shown that Nef can interact with Vav2 via its SH3 domain, leading to Rac1 activation (9Quaranta M.G. Mattioli B. Spadaro F. Straface E. Giordani L. Ramoni C. Malorni W. Viora M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, Nef regulation of RhoA activity has never been reported in any cell type. Further, it was not clear how Nef coordinately regulates the activity of RhoA and Rac1. p190RhoGAP is a GTPase-activating protein specific for RhoA that is regulated by Src phosphorylation in response to various extracellular signals (31Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 32Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) but does not have a domain known to interact with those of Nef (31Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which Nef regulates RhoA activity is not known. To delineate the overall mechanisms by which Nef regulates actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, we studied the role of diaphanous interacting protein (DIP) in signaling from Nef to RhoA and Rac1. DIP has an SH3 binding domain and has been shown to mediate Src-induced phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and Vav2 probably by localizing components of the signaling complex to the plasma membrane (33Meng W. Numazaki M. Takeuchi K. Uchibori Y. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tominaga M. Tominaga T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We show here that DIP plays a critical role in Nef-induced changes on the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes through inhibition of RhoA activity. Podocyte Culture and Infection with HIV or Nef Constructs—Conditionally immortalized murine podocytes were isolated from control mice that express the SV40 T antigen (immortal mouse) as previously described (20Husain M. Gusella G.L. Klotman M.E. Gelman I.H. Ross M.D. Schwartz E.J. Cara A. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Schwartz E.J. Cara A.

These cells proliferate under permissive conditions (IFN-γ at 33 °C) but differentiate under nonpermissive conditions (37 °C). Under nonpermissive conditions, the cells lose the expression of T antigen. HIV-1 and Nef constructs were made as described (22He J.C. Husain M. Sunamoto M. D'Agati V.D. Klotman M.E. Iyengar R. Klotman P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment containing the EGFP reporter gene (from pEGFP-C1; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was inserted in place of the gag/pol deletion in HIV-1 proviral construct, pNL4-3: d1443. The resulting construct (pNL4-3:ΔG/P-EGFP) was used for HIV-1 infection and to monitor the efficiency of infection in podocytes. To delineate the contribution of the nef gene, the nef gene was deleted from pNL4-3 by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A retroviral expression vector (pBabepuro) was used to clone nef into the BamHI-SalI site. The constructs with mutations in the PXXP (SH3) motif in Nef were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits. The PXXP-binding domain was mutated by changing the proline residues to alanines. Moloney murine leukemia virus gag/pol genes and VSV.G envelope were provided in trans to generate pseudotyped virus particles. Podocytes at passage 10 were infected with either control vector or Nef-containing vector as described previously (20Husain M. Gusella G.L. Klotman M.E. Gelman I.H. Ross M.D. Schwartz E.J. Cara A. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The expression of Nef in podocytes was confirmed by Western blot analysis (20Husain M. Gusella G.L. Klotman M.E. Gelman I.H. Ross M.D. Schwartz E.J. Cara A. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Podocytes were maintained in RPMI medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to all experiments, cells were kept at 37 °C on type I collagen-coated dishes for 10 days to inactivate the temperature-sensitive T antigen and to allow for differentiation. Western blot was used to confirm the absence of T antigen. Nucleofection and siRNA—Transfections of differentiated podocytes were performed using the Amaxa nucleofection kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). Several protocols were tested based on the manufacturer's instructions. Podocytes were plated at a density of ∼50% on the day prior to transfection. After optimization, a transfection efficiency of 80–90% was achieved based on green fluorescent protein expression. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine at 37 °C. Transfections were performed using Fugene (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's protocol. A transfection efficiency of >90% was achieved. All experiments were performed between 1 and 3 days after transfection. For siRNA transfection, we use a technique combining the Ambion siRNA synthesis kit for DIP, Vav2, and p190RhoAGAP combined with the Amaxa RNAi nucleofection kit to successfully introduce siRNA into podocytes. Two siRNA duplexes were made by the Ambion siRNA synthesis kit for each molecule with the following target sequences: DIP, 5′-ACCUUGUCUCGAAGAGGCAdU-3′ and 5′-UGCCUCUUCGAGACAAGGU-3′; Vav2, 5′-AAGAAACAGUGAGCUGUUUGA-3′ and 5′-AAGGAGAUGACAUUUAUGAGG-3′; p190RhoAGAP, 5′-AAGACAAAGGAAACUGUGGAG-3′ and 5′-AAUGGUGAAGATGGUGUAGAA-3. Dharmacon On TargetPlus SMARTpool siRNA reagents for Vav2 were also used as another control. We were able to knock down target genes by 60–70% based on Western blot analysis (35Chuang P.Y. Yu Q.

Kidney Int. 2007; 72: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). miRIDIAN micro-RNA mimic negative control sequences are based on Caenorhabditis elegans miRNA for use as negative experimental controls in mammalian cells. siRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also used as the control sequence. Efficiency of siRNA is confirmed by real time PCR for mRNA levels and Western blot for protein levels. RhoA and Rac1 Activation Assays—Rho and Rac activation assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used to measure GTP-bound Rho and Rac, respectively. The manufacturer's instructions were followed; briefly, cells were lysed using a GST-Fish buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin. Cell lysates were then incubated with rhotekin glutathione S-transferase fusion protein bound to glutathione beads to precipitate Rho-GTP- or PAK1-PBD-agarose beads to precipitate Rac-GTP overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated Rho-GTP and total Rho (from cell lysates) were detected by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-Rho (Upstate Biotechnology). Precipitated Rac-GTP and total Rac (from cell lysates) were detected by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-Rac (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoblot Analysis of Signaling Proteins—Control and Nef-infected podocytes were serum-starved for 24 h prior to lysis with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, a protease inhibitor mixture, and tyrosine and serine-threonine phosphorylation inhibitors. After determination of protein concentration, cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using the following specific antibodies: polyclonal anti-rabbit p-Vav2, polyclonal anti-goat Vav2, anti-DIP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p190RhoGAP (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Nef (FIT Biotech), anti-Myc (Sigma), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. Determination of Protein-Protein Interactions—293T cells were transfected with the following cDNAs: DIP/pcDNA3, DIPΔSH3/pcDNA3, and DIPΔPro/pcDNA3 (all provided by Dr. Tominaga). Transfected 293T cells as well as differentiated podocytes were lysed using GST-Fish buffer. Cell lysates were precleared by incubating with purified GST and glutathione beads for 1 h at 4°C. Unbound proteins were then incubated with either Nef-GST fusion protein bound to glutathione beads or GST bound to glutathione beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, precipitated proteins were dissociated from the beads using 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and Western blotting was performed with polyclonal anti-DIP or anti-Vav2. For co-immunoprecipitation, wild-type and Nef-infected podocytes were lysed using a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaFl, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin. Cell lysates were incubated with either monoclonal anti-Nef (amino acids 191–205) (Advanced Biotechnologies) or control mouse myeloma IgG (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added, and samples were allowed to rotate for an additional 90 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, precipitated proteins were dissociated using 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal anti-DIP. Where indicated, 10 μm pp2 was added to cell media for 1 h prior to lysis. For co-immunoprecipitation with purified proteins, Nef was subcloned into pGEX vector for generating recombinant GST-Nef. HA-tagged Vav2 and Myc-tagged DIP were produced in HEK293 cells. Vav2-HA and DIP-Myc (constructs were gifts from Dr. Tomoko Fukumi-Tominaga) were precipitated using anti-HA or anti-Myc beads and eluted using HA or Myc peptide (Sigma). GST-Nef (1 μg) was immobilized on glutathione beads. After washing, 1 μg of purified Vav2-HA or DIP-Myc in 500 μl of PBS was added to the beads. Reactions were incubated under rotation for 2 h at 4°C. After washing, proteins were eluted in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody. Determination of Signaling Protein Activation—Control and Nef cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to lysis with a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF. Lysates were incubated with recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing, precipitated proteins dissociated from the beads using 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed with monoclonal anti-p190RhoGAP (BD Bioscience); polyclonal anti-DIP was made by Dr. Tominaga as previously described (36Satoh S. Tominaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39290-39294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Differentiated podocytes were used as the control. Nef-infected podocytes were treated with pp2 (10 μm) or U0126 (10 μm) or transfected with the following plasmids: control pcDNA3, DIPΔPro/pcDNA3 (provided by Dr. Tominaga), dominant negative Src and Stat3 (previously described (22He J.C.

After transfection, cells were directly cultured onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 48–72 h to allow transgene expression. Podocytes were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After washing with PBS, cells were mounted onto glass slides with Slowfade Anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes) and visualized using an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus Optical Co.) with a digital camera. Nef Expression Induces Actin Cytoskeleton Rearrangement in Podocytes in Vitro—HIVAN is associated with podocyte effacement and loss of cytoskeletal structure on electron microscopy (17Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In order to visualize the effects of HIV-1 Nef on the actin cytoskeleton in vitro, differentiated podocytes expressing either a control vector, a replication-incompetent gag-pol-deleted HIV-1 proviral construct (pNL4-3Δgag-pol), a gag-pol-nef-deleted HIV-1 proviral construct (HIV-1ΔNef), nef-expressing vector, or a nef vector with mutation of the PXXP motif (NefPXXP) were stained with fluorescently labeled phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Control podocytes displayed prominent actin stress fibers throughout the cell cytoplasm, consistent with previous findings (37Mundel P. Reiser J. Zuniga Mejia Borja A. Pavenstadt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In contrast, HIV-1-infected podocytes lacked stress fiber formation and had increased lamellipodia formation (Fig. 1A). Podocytes expressing the nef gene alone had a phenotype indistinguishable from HIV-1 podocytes, whereas those expressing HIV-1ΔNef or NefPXXP exhibited normal actin stress fiber-like control cells (Fig. 1A). These studies suggest that Nef is responsible for HIV-1-induced changes of actin cytoskeleton in podocytes and that an intact PXXP motif is required. Nef Induces RhoA Inactivation and Rac1 Activation in Podocytes—The Rho family GTPases regulate eukaryotic cytoskeleton dynamics with RhoA primarily mediating stress fiber formation, Rac1 mediating lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 causing filopodia formation (29Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the activity level of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in podocytes infected with control vector, Nef, or NefPXXP. We found that RhoA activity was significantly suppressed in podocytes expressing Nef compared with podocytes infected with control vector or NefPXXP (Fig. 1, B and C). Rac1 activity was significantly higher in Nef cells than control or NefPXXP cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Cdc42 activity was unchanged in the setting of Nef expression (data not shown). These findings suggest that Nef-induced changes of actin structure are mediated by alterations in Rac1 and RhoA activities. To confirm that alteration of RhoA and Rac1 activity can induce a podocyte phenotype comparable with that of HIVAN, we examined actin cytoskeleton in podocytes transfected with constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1G14V) and treated with C3 transferase, an inhibitor of RhoA activity. These cells exhibited similar changes of actin cytoskeleton as Nef-infected podocytes (Fig. 1A). Vav2 Interacts with Nef in Podocytes—An interaction between Vav2 and Nef has been previously shown in T cells (30Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In order to verify this interaction in podocytes, cells were transfected with Nef or NefPXXP and lysed for immunoprecipitation with a Nef antibody specific to both Nef and NefPXXP. Vav2 co-precipitated with Nef but not NefPXXP (Fig. 2A). As a control, nonspecific IgG did not co-precipitate with Vav2. This was confirmed by reverse co-immunoprecipitation (IP with anti-Vav2 and IB with anti-Nef antibodies) in cells transfected with Nef or NefPXXP (Fig. 2B). Our results indicate that Vav2 interacts with the PXXP domain of Nef in podocytes. As controls, Vav2 and Nef expression were determined by Western blot in total cell lysates (Fig. 2, A and B). DIP Interacts with Nef via Its SH3 Binding Domain—Although interaction between Nef and Vav2 has been reported previously in T cells and can mediate Rac1 activation, the mechanism by which Nef inhibits RhoA activation is not known. We therefore searched the data base of molecules containing the SH3 binding domain for adaptor proteins that could interact with Nef and mediate its effect on RhoA activity. One of the candidates in our search was DIP, which has a distinct SH3 binding domain and is able to regulate RhoA activity through interaction with p190RhoGAP (33Meng W. Numazaki M. Takeuchi K. Uchibori Y. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tominaga M. Tominaga T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We first determined in vitro if DIP interacts with Nef. Cell lysates from 293T cells overexpressing DIP were incubated with Nef-GST fusion protein for a pull-down assay. We found a strong interaction between DIP and Nef (Fig. 3A). In addition to its SH3 domain, DIP also possesses a proline-rich domain (Pro) and a leucine-rich domain. We transfected 293T cells with DIP construct containing either a deletion in the proline-rich region (DIPΔPro) or the SH3 region (DIPΔSH3). Although full-length DIP and DIPΔPro were pulled down by Nef-GST, a significantly reduced interaction (>60% reduction based on densitometric analysis) was observed with DIPΔSH3, suggesting that the SH3 region of DIP mediates the interaction with Nef (Fig. 3A). As controls, expression of total input GST, GST-Nef, and DIP isoforms was determined by Western blot (Fig. 3A). Next, we tested whether the PXXP region of Nef was required for interaction. 293T cells were transfected with full-length DIP along with either Nef or Nef with a mutation in the PXXP region (NefPXXP) (pro"
https://openalex.org/W2027680546,"Structural studies of cell wall components of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans have demonstrated the presence of β-1,2-linked oligomannosides in phosphopeptidomannan and phospholipomannan. During C. albicans infection, β-1,2-oligomannosides play an important role in host/pathogen interactions by acting as adhesins and by interfering with the host immune response. Despite the importance of β-1,2-oligomannosides, the genes responsible for their synthesis have not been identified. The main reason is that the reference species Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not synthesize β-linked mannoses. On the other hand, the presence of β-1,2-oligomannosides has been reported in the cell wall of the more genetically tractable C. albicans relative, P. pastoris. Here we present the identification, cloning, and characterization of a novel family of fungal genes involved in β-mannose transfer. Employing in silico analysis, we identified a family of four related new genes in P. pastoris and subsequently nine homologs in C. albicans. Biochemical, immunological, and structural analyses following deletion of four genes in P. pastoris and deletion of four genes acting specifically on C. albicans mannan demonstrated the involvement of these new genes in β-1,2-oligomannoside synthesis. Phenotypic characterization of the strains deleted in β-mannosyltransferase genes (BMTs) allowed us to describe the stepwise activity of Bmtps and acceptor specificity. For C. albicans, despite structural similarities between mannan and phospholipomannan, phospholipomannan β-mannosylation was not affected by any of the CaBMT1–4 deletions. Surprisingly, depletion in mannan major β-1,2-oligomannoside epitopes had little impact on cell wall surface β-1,2-oligomannoside antigenic expression.

A number of yeast species have adapted to colonize human tissue, and the adverse effects caused by these pathogenic yeasts have gained importance over recent decades. In particular, the endosaprophytic yeast Candida albicans is able to invade human tissues in immunosuppressed patients leading to frequent nosocomial systemic infections with a high mortality rate (1Sims C.R. Ostrosky-Zeichner L. Rex J.H. Arch. Med. Res. 2005; 36: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Current research has shown that successful pathogenic adaptation requires the ability to utilize elaborate sensing and regulation pathways, impacting expression of a wide range of virulence factors (2Calderone R.A. Fonzi W.A. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 327-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Among these virulence attributes critical for survival under changing environmental conditions is the yeast cell wall containing large amounts of carbohydrates and carbohydrates covalently linked to a noncarbohydrate moiety classified as glycoconjugates, either glycoproteins or glycolipids. In yeasts and other eukaryotes, glycoproteins typically contain N- and/or O-linked glycans (3Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Glycans serve diverse and important functions, such as intracellular trafficking of glycoproteins or glycolipids, protein folding, anchoring of macromolecules to the cell membrane, signal transduction, cell/cell interactions, as well as determination of glycoprotein half-life (5Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). In pathogenic microbes, glycans trigger host innate and/or adaptive immunity responses. Despite similarities in the early steps of processing, the mature structure of glycans differs substantially between yeasts and mammals. For example, mammalian N-linked glycans are typically of the complex type, whereas typical fungal N-glycans are categorized as high mannose (3Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Depending on the species, fungal high mannose glycans contain distinctive modifications, such as the addition of mannosyl phosphate (6Jigami Y. Odani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and β-linked mannose. Suzuki and co-workers (7Shibata N. Ichikawa T. Tojo M. Takahashi M. Ito N. Okubo Y. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was the first to demonstrate and confirm that C. albicans, in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, harbors β-1,2-linked oligomannosides (β-Mans) 3The abbreviations used are:β-Manβ-1,2-linked oligomannosidePPMphosphopeptidomannanPLMphospholipomannanmAbmonoclonal antibodyORFopen reading frameANTS8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMSmass spectrometryHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceROESYrotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopyFACEfluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis.. The expression pattern of β-Mans in C. albicans is quite complex. β-Mans have been found to be associated with the acid-labile and acid-stable part of the cell wall phosphopeptidomannan (PPM) (8Kobayashi H. Shibata N. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2106-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where they correspond, respectively, to antigenic factors 5 and 6 (Fig. 1B). They are also associated with phospholipomannan (PLM), a surface cell wall glycolipid derived from the mannose-inositol-phosphoceramide biosynthetic pathway (9Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Although not yet confirmed by chemical/structural studies, association of β-Mans with several cell wall non-mannan mannoproteins has been suggested repeatedly by the use of anti-β-Man-specific antibodies (10Mille C. Janbon G. Delplace F. Ibata-Ombetta S. Gaillardin C. Strecker G. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Biol.

Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian immune system specifically reacts with synthetic β-Mans that display a unique spatial conformation (12Nitz M. Ling C.C. Otter A. Cutler J.E. Bundle D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). β-Mans have been established to be potent antigens for the adaptive immune response and to elicit specific infection-protective antibodies (13Han Y. Kanbe T. Cherniak R. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to α-linked oligomannosides, which interact with C-type lectins, β-Mans specifically bind to galectin-3 (14Fradin C. Poulain D. Jouault T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Kohatsu L. Hsu D.K. Jegalian A.G. Liu F.T. Baum L.G. J.

Finally, it has been demonstrated that oral administration of synthetic β-Mans inhibited C. albicans colonization of the intestinal track in newborn mice, whereas synthetic α-Man did not (18Dromer F.

This experimental evidence strongly suggests that β-Mans contribute in a very specific manner to the virulence of C. albicans. β-1,2-linked oligomannoside phosphopeptidomannan phospholipomannan monoclonal antibody open reading frame 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry heteronuclear single quantum coherence rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. To further analyze the importance of β-Man residues in C. albicans virulence, the construction of mutants partially or fully depleted of these residues is necessary. However, the genes encoding C. albicans β-mannosyltransferases (BMTs) have not been identified. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae lacks β-Man residues and thus is a poor model organism to elucidate mechanisms of β-Man transfer. To date, attempts to decipher the role of β-Mans in virulence and cell wall structure of C. albicans have relied on the deletion of genes homologous to S. cerevisiae genes involved in PLM and PPM biosynthesis pathways upstream of actual β-mannose transfer (10Mille C.

Res. 1988; 174: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Leishmania (23Ralton J.E. Naderer T. Piraino H.L. Bashtannyk T.A. Callaghan J.M. McConville M.J. J. Biol.

Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 325: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel family of genes involved in the transfer of β-Mans in P. pastoris and the pathogenic yeast C. albicans. Based on the available genomic sequence of P. pastoris and C. albicans, we identified four novel genes in P. pastoris and nine previously uncharacterized family members in C. albicans. Interestingly, homologs of these genes are not present in S. cerevisiae. A series of deletion strains of P. pastoris and C. albicans revealed different immunochemical phenotypes allowing us to gain insights into the function of these genes, including the impact of deletion on the global cell wall surface expression of β-Man epitopes. Moreover, systematic biochemical and structural analyses of these mutants have allowed us to define their role in different aspects of glycosylation, specifically core mannosylation of N-linked glycans in P. pastoris and β-mannose transfer onto mannan in P. pastoris and C. albicans. Strains and Culture Conditions—Escherichia coli strains TOP10 or DH5α were used for recombinant DNA work. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Protein expression in P. pastoris cells was carried out as reported previously (26Choi B.K. Bobrowicz P. Davidson R.C. Hamilton S.R. Kung D.H. Li H. Miele R.G. Nett J.H. Wildt S. Gerngross T.U. Proc.

In the first PCR 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the PpBMT genes (500–1000 bp in size) and the NAT or G418 resistance marker (31Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 32Goldstein A.L. Pan X. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were amplified. Then, in a second reaction all three first round templates were used to generate an overlap product that contained all three fragments as a single linear allele. The final PCR product was then directly employed for transformation. Transformants were selected on YPD medium containing 200 μg/ml of G418 or 100 μg/ml of nourseothricin. In each case the proper integration of the mutant allele was confirmed by PCR. Each C. albicans gene, listed in Table 2, was deleted sequentially from strain BWP17 by PCR-based gene targeting (33Gola S. Martin R. Walther A. Dunkler A. Wendland J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two plasmids were used to release two selectable markers, CaARG4 or CaHIS1, by NotI digest. Each marker was amplified by PCR using primers, including the first and the last 100 bp of gene-specific sequences. The generated disruption cassettes were used to transform BWP17 by the lithium acetate method as described previously (34Sanglard D. Ischer F. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the selectable marker ARG4 was used to generate independent heterozygous strains on synthetic dextrose plates supplemented with 20 mg/liter histidine and 20 mg/liter uridine. Correct insertion of the marker was verified by PCR. A second round of transformation was performed to delete the second allele with the HIS1 marker by the same method. Homologous integration was verified by PCR.TABLE 2Identification of C. albicans genesAccession no.Gene nameGene name (Candida data base)Protein lengthDescriptionRefs.orf19.6782BMT1IFQ2685Unknown functionThis studyorf19.54BMT2IFQ3655Unknown functionThis studyorf19.3282BMT3IPF300550Unknown functionThis studyorf19.5612BMT4IPF15015790Unknown functionThis studyorf19.1464BMT5IFQ4613Unknown functionMille et al., unpublishedorf19.5602BMT6IPF19772647Unknown functionMille et al., unpublishedorf19.342BMT7IPF1520652Unknown functionMille et al., unpublishedorf19.860BMT8IPF7647695Unknown functionMille et al., unpublishedorf19.4673BMT9IFQ1783Unknown functionMille et al., unpublished Open table in a new tab Reintroduction of CaBMTs into the Null Strains—Each CaBMT open reading frame with ∼500-bp upstream and downstream nucleotides was amplified by PCR using AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The amplified fragment was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Then the CaBMT gene was excised by digestion with SacI and NotI and ligated into SacI- and NotI-digested CIp10 (35Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the reintegration vector. The CabmtΔ null strains were transformed with StuI- or NcoI-digested reintegration vector. Transformants were screened by PCR to check the reintroduction of the CaBMT gene at the RPS10 locus. Whole Cell Protein Extraction and Western Analyses—P. pastoris cells were grown for 1 day in YPD medium at room temperature, and whole cell proteins were extracted using Y-PER (yeast protein extraction reagent, Pierce). Extracts were adjusted to the same protein concentration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5–20% acrylamide gels. Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5B2 diluted 1:2000 (11Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter Protein Purification and Release of N-Linked Glycans—The Kringle 3 domain was used as a model protein and was purified using His6 tag as reported previously (26Choi B.K. Bobrowicz P. Davidson R.C. Hamilton S.R. Kung D.H. Li H. Miele R.G. Nett J.H. Wildt S. Gerngross T.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5022-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The glycans were released and separated from glycoproteins by modification of a method reported previously (36Papac D.I. Briggs J.B. Chin E.T. Jones A.J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After the proteins were reduced and carboxymethylated, and the membranes blocked, the wells were washed three times with water. The protein was deglycosylated by the addition of 30 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, containing 1 milliunit of N-glycanase (Glyko). After 16 h at 37 °C, the solution containing the glycans was removed by centrifugation and evaporated to dryness. Complementation of P. pastoris OCH1 Gene—A 2.86-kb portion of the P. pastoris OCH1 locus was amplified by PCR using primers PB198 5′-GAAGGATCCTGATATAGACCTGCGACACCATC-3′ and PB199 5′-ATTCGGATCCTGTCAATGGGAAGAGATGTCTTGTGCACA-3′. The resulting amplified fragment was subcloned into the P. pastoris/E. coli shuttle vector, pRCD252, constructed in our laboratory, which contains the HPH gene obtained from plasmid pAG32 (31Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), encoding for hygromycin resistance and the P. pastoris TRP2 gene (integration locus). The resulting plasmid, pPB294, was linearized with a unique XbaI site located in the TRP2 gene and transformed into P. pastoris by electroporation. Transformants were selected on YPD medium containing 300 mg/ml hygromycin. Phenotypic Characterization of C. albicans Strains—To determine the growth rate, strains were grown in YPD-Arg-His-Urd medium at 37 °C for 9 h. Every 2 h, absorbance at 620 nm was measured. Hyphae formation was induced in 5% horse serum at 37 °C for 3 h. Chlamydospore formation was analyzed in medium containing 17 g/liter corn meal agar (Difco), 0.33% Tween 80, and 2% agar. Cultures were grown at 28 or 37 °C for 2–5 days. To determine the sensitivity to chemical agents, 5 μl of serial 1:10 dilutions of an overnight culture were spotted onto YPD-Arg-His-Urd agar plates containing 25 or 50 mm CaCl2; 10, 20, or 50 μg/ml calcofluor white; 1 or 1.5 m NaCl; 0.001, 0.01, or 0.05% SDS. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 day. For sensitivity assays to antifungal agents, including amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin, strains were grown in Sabouraud's dextrose broth at 37 °C for 24 h. Two hundred microliters of 1:10 dilution in Shadomy medium were inoculated onto antifungigram plates and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm. Phosphopeptidomannan Extraction and Western Analyses—PPM from cells grown in YPD-Arg-His-Urd medium was extracted as described previously (37Faille C. Wieruszeski J.M. Michalski J.C. Poulain D. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in 0.02 m citrate buffer and autoclaved at 125 °C for 90 min. Suspensions were harvested, and Fehling's solution was added to the supernatant to precipitate PPM. The PPM was then washed in methanol:acetic acid (8:1) and dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator. Sugar concentrations were estimated by the sulfuric phenol colorimetric method (38Dubois M. Gilles K. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Nature. 1951; 168: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). PPM was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Membranes were probed with mAbs 5B2 diluted 1:1000 (11Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B6.1 diluted 1:1000 (13Han Y. Kanbe T. Cherniak R. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or B9E diluted 1:750 (39Ponton J. Marot-Leblond A. Ezkurra P.A. Barturen B. Robert R. Senet J.M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4842-4847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction of Sphingolipids—Cells grown at 37 °C in YPD-Arg-His-Urd medium were broken with a French press (Aminco) at 20,000 psi, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Extraction was carried out as described previously (9Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using chloroform: methanol:water extractions, butanol:water partitions, and chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. Analysis of the β-Mans Released from PPM and PLM—Previously extracted PPM or PLM were hydrolyzed in 0.1 n HCl for 1 h at 100 °C to release their β-Man-containing acid-labile moiety and neutralized with 0.2 n NaOH. Hydrolysates were then dried directly for PLM fractions or after an ultrafiltration step on Centricon YM-30 filters (Amicon) for PPM fractions and tagged with 0.15 m 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) and 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride for 16 h at 37 °C as described previously (40Goins T.L. Cutler J.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dried samples were resuspended in glycerol:water (1:4) buffer. Electrophoresis of ANTS-labeled oligomannosides was performed on 25 or 35% (w/v) acrylamide separating gels, depending on the degree of polymerization of the oligomannosides, and a 5% acrylamide stacking gel at 600 V. Electrophoresis buffers were the same as for SDS-PAGE except that they did not contain SDS. Acid-hydrolyzed dextran and oligosaccharides were also tagged with ANTS and used as carbohydrate standards. Gels were dried, and images were acquired with the Gel Doc 2000 image analysis apparatus from Bio-Rad equipped with a 365 nm UV transilluminator. NMR Analyses—For a better selectivity of mutant analyses, NMR experiments were performed separately on acid-resistant domains and on total mixtures of acid-labile oligomannosides isolated from PPM from mutant and wild-type strains. After mild acid hydrolysis, acid-labile and acid-resistant domains of mannans were separated by gel filtration and analyzed separately. All anomeric 1H NMR signals were then readily attributed to α- and β-linked mannose residues according to published data (37Faille C. Wieruszeski J.M. Michalski J.C. Poulain D. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Shibata N. Hisamichi K. Kikuchi T. Kobayashi H. Okawa Y. Suzuki S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5680-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 400-MHz 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance® spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TXI probehead (1H resonating at 400.33 and 13Cat 100.25 MHz) (Centre Commun de Resonance Magnétique Nucléaire of USTL, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France). Samples were exchanged three times with 2H2O (99.97% deuterium atoms, Euriso-Top, Saclay, France) and intermediate lyophilization and then dissolved in 250 μl of 2H2O. All experiments are performed with 5-mm Shigemi® tubes matched for 2H2O. Experiments were recorded at 300 K for acid-labile fractions and 318 K for acid-stable fractions. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of the methyl group of acetone (1H resonating at 2.225 ppm and 13C at 31.55 ppm for all fractions). For one-dimensional spectra, a spectral width of 4006 Hz was collected as 16,000 complex data points. Sine-shifted bell was used prior to Fourier transformation. Spectra were base-line corrected with a fourth order polynomial function. Two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear (HSQC) spectra were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment method. ROESY experiment was acquired using 400-ms mixing time and acquired in States mode according to Bax and Davis (42Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar). All parameters (90 hard pulses, soft pulses, delays, and pulse powers) were optimized for each experiment. Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of β-Mans was determined as described previously (43Martinez-Esparza M. Sarazin A. Jouy N. Poulain D. Jouault T. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 314: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on YPD-Arg-His-Urd medium at 37 °C for 16 h were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with factor 5 and 6 sera (Iatron), diluted 1:200. After washing, cells were incubated with specific secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody,"
https://openalex.org/W2066418632,"In a number of cases, the function of membrane proteins appears to require the presence of specific lipid species in the bilayer. We have shown that the secondary multidrug transporter LmrP requires the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as its replacement by phosphatidylcholine (PC) inhibits transport activity and directly affects its structure, although the underlying mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that the effect of PE on the structure and the function of LmrP is mediated by interactions between the lipid headgroup and the protein. We used methyl-PE and dimethyl-PE analogs of PE to show that only replacement of the three hydrogens by methyl moieties leads to changes in the biochemical and biophysical properties of the reconstituted protein. This suggests that LmrP does not depend on the bulk properties of the phospholipids tested but solely on the hydrogen bonding ability of the headgroup. We then show that a single point mutation in LmrP, D68C, is sufficient to recapitulate precisely every biochemical and biophysical effect observed when PE is replaced by PC, including energy transfer between the protein tryptophan residues and the lipid headgroups. We conclude that the negatively charged Asp-68 is likely to participate in the interaction with PE and that such interaction is required for proton gradient sensing, substrate binding, and transport. Because Asp-68 belongs to a highly conserved motif in the Major Facilitator Superfamily (which includes LacY and EmrD), this interaction might be a general feature of these transporters that is involved in proton gradient sensing and lipid dependence.

This family regroups a very large number of transporters, ubiquitously found in all classes of organisms, that rely on chemosmotic ion gradients to transport their cognate substrates across the cell membrane (3Lemieux M.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the substrates vary greatly from one sub-family to the next, MFS transporters share a common architecture, composed of 12 transmembrane α-helices connected by extramembrane loops, as confirmed by the crystal structures of LacY (4Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), GlpT (5Lemieux M.J. Huang Y. Wang D.N. J. Electron Microsc.

In addition to their biological and physiological relevance, MFS transporters have proven to be very useful models to study the fundamental features of membrane proteins, and in particular how they interact with the membrane. Several studies on various MFS transporters have shown that their function depends on the lipid composition of their environment. For instance, LacY (7Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), GabP (8Zhang W. Campbell H.A. King S.C. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26032-26038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and PheP (9Zhang W. Bogdanov M. Pi J. Pittard A.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50128-50135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) require the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the bilayer for proper structure and activity. Such studies illustrate that the membrane not only provides a hydrophobic environment to the embedded proteins, but that, in addition, specific lipidic species must interact with these proteins to achieve biological function (10Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 62-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie such partnership remain often unclear. Is the protein function depending on bulk properties of the bilayer or are specific interactions between the lipids and the protein necessary? In several crystal structures, lipids known to be important for function remained specifically associated to the protein, such as for yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (11Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) or Rhodobacter sphaeroides photoreaction center (12McAuley K.E. Fyfe P.K. Ridge J.P. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J.

However, in other cases, the bulk properties of the membrane bilayer such as fluidity were shown to be important. For instance, a clear correlation between membrane protein activity and membrane fluidity was described for calcium-dependent ATPase (14Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9178-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ABC transporter cdr1p (15Smriti Krishnamurthy S.S. Prasad R. FEMS Microbiol.

In the case of LmrP, PE is essential as its replacement by PC, although another zwitterionic lipid led to a serious alteration of structure and function (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P. Vandenbussche G. Ruysschaert J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We wanted to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this behavior and determine whether the bulk properties of PE provide the adequate environment to LmrP or whether interactions between the lipid headgroup and the protein are required to achieve biological function. We assess here the role of PE over the protein function and conformation by using PE-methylated species. We show that PE-methylated species, where one or two headgroup proton(s) are replaced with methyl moieties (methyl-PE and dimethyl-PE), can substitute for PE without loss of LmrP activity, whereas replacement of the third proton abolishes all activity. Biophysical measurements show that the structural changes associated with the replacement of PE by PC are not present when we use the methyl and dimethyl intermediates, which suggests a role of the lipid headgroup and a possible interaction between PE- and LmrP-specific amino acids. We propose here that these residues include Asp-68, a highly conserved residue in the MFS, and that this protein-lipid interaction is a global mechanism of PE dependence in MFS and is involved in ΔpH sensing. Cell Culture and Protein Purification—The growth of L. lactis NZ9000 in M17 medium (from Difco), the overexpression using the NICE (nisin-controlled gene expression) system, and the purification of the His-tagged LmrP wt and mutants were performed as previously described (2Putman M. van Veen H.W.

LmrP Reconstitution—We have previously shown that L. lactis membrane contains a significant amount of PE (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P. Vandenbussche G. Ruysschaert J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the exact fraction is not established, we have used the lipid composition found in another bacterium, Escherichia coli (70% of PE). As a control, we tested that such a proportion was not limiting for LmrP activity (see supplemental materials). Therefore, the respective lipid composition of the various liposomes were: (i) PE proteoliposomes: 70% dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 20% E. coli phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 10% E. coli cardiolipin (CL); (ii) methyl PE proteoliposomes: 70% N-methyl-DOPE, 20% E. coli PG, 10% E. coli CL; (iii) dimethyl PE proteoliposomes: 70% N,N-dimethyl-DOPE, 20% E. coli PG, 10% E. coli CL; and (iv) PC proteoliposomes: 70% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 20% E. coli PG, 10% E. coli CL. Protein reconstitution and imposition of an artificial proton gradient (ΔpH) were performed as previously described (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P. Vandenbussche G. Ruysschaert J.M. Cell Mol.

Hoechst 33342 Transport in Proteoliposomes—Hoechst 33342 transport carried out with proteoliposomes containing 10 μg of wt and mutated LmrP was driven by an imposed ΔpH, as explained previously (16Gbaguidi B.

Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was monitored on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively. Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out with hydrophilic (acrylamide) quencher as described elsewhere (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P.

FRET—5% of dansyl-PE with respect to the total lipid mass was incorporated into proteoliposomes during the reconstitution process described above. The tryptophan-dansyl FRET was monitored on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorometer. ATR-FTIR—ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 2 cm-1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air dried on an FTIR purge gas generator 75-62 Balston (Maidstone, UK) at a flow rate of 5.8 liters/min. The internal reflection element was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J.

Briefly, spectra were recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized incident light with respect to the normal to the ATR plate. Polarization was expressed as function of the dichroic ratio, RATR = A∥/A⊥. Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Kinetics—A sample of reconstituted LmrP was deposited on a germanium plate as described elsewhere (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J.

Sample treatment with D2O-saturated N2 flux, spectra acquisition, and data analysis were performed as described in previous studies (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P. Vandenbussche G. Ruysschaert J.M.

Site-directed Labeling of LmrP—The substituted cysteine mutants (E3C and E255C) of LmrP reconstituted in PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes as well as the D68C mutant reconstituted in PE proteoliposomes were biotinylated according to the protocol used on proteoliposomes by the Dowhan group (7Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteoliposomes were incubated 20 min at room temperature with 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB, Molecular Probes) added to a final concentration of 200 μm from freshly prepared stock solution to biotinylate LmrP. Where indicated, proteoliposomes were incubated 10 min with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS, Molecular Probes) to block external cysteine, added from a freshly prepared stock solution and to a final concentration of 200 μm. To inactivate the excess of maleimides, β-mercaptoethanol was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. Where indicated, proteoliposomes were disrupted with β-d-octylglucoside (OG, Sigma) at 1.5% w/v. Removal of the excess of labeling reagents as well as replacing the buffer surrounding proteoliposomes were performed by centrifuging the treated samples through Bio-spin columns (Bio-Rad). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot followed by incubation with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to visualize biotinylated proteins. The effect of PE polar head over LmrP function was investigated in PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes (see “Experimental Procedures” for the detailed lipid composition of the liposomes). The positively charged Hoechst 33342 is a substrate for LmrP (21Gbaguidi B. Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Ruysschaert J.M. Vigano C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2646-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which becomes highly fluorescent when inserted into lipid membranes but shows almost no fluorescence in aqueous medium. LmrP transport activity was assayed in PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes, by measuring the variation in Hoechst 33342 fluorescence as a function of time (Fig. 1). When a ΔpH is imposed, the fluorescence of membrane-bound Hoechst 33342 decreases at the same rate in PE, methyl-PE, and dimethyl-PE proteoliposomes indicating that Hoechst 33342 was actively being extruded out of the membrane. These data suggest that at least one free proton on PE polar head is required to sustain a normal transport activity of LmrP. As previously observed (16Gbaguidi B. Hakizimana P. Vandenbussche G. Ruysschaert J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the third methylation (PC) entirely abolished the Hoechst 33342 active extrusion from the membrane. To assess whether the inhibition of transport activity observed in PC proteoliposomes was due to structural defects, we compared the structural profiles of LmrP in various lipid environments. FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine and compare the secondary structure of LmrP in the various proteoliposomes. As shown in Fig. 2, the amide I absorption peak is identical in all four liposomes. Student's t test on the spectra revealed no significant difference (at either p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the amide I region, indicating that the secondary structure of LmrP is identical in either PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, or PC proteoliposomes. This secondary structure was estimated after deconvolution to be composed of 69% α, 7% β, and 24% coiled, which is in good agreement with the secondary structures seen in the crystal structures of LacY, GlpT, and EmrD. Using polarized ATR-FTIR spectroscopy we compared the average helix orientation in the bilayer for PE- and PC-containing proteoliposomes. Quantitative evaluation of the helix mean tilt requires the evaluation of the dichroic ratio, RATR = A∥/A⊥ for amide ν(C = O) and Riso, which is the dichroic ratio measured for a transition dipole either spatially disordered or oriented at the magic angle (30Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The derived dichroic ratio can detect orientation changes as small as 8% (24Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As described elsewhere (30Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), lipid ester ν(C = O) was used to determine Riso. Dichroism analysis yielded Riso = 1.6 for wt LmrP in PE and PC proteoliposomes (Table 1). Furthermore, RATR measured for wt in PE proteoliposomes was identical to that of wt in PC proteoliposomes. To analyze solely the orientation of the transmembrane bundle, this ratio was calculated on the helical contribution obtained from the deconvolution of the FTIR spectra (maximum intensity at 1652 cm-1). Finally the topology of LmrP insertion (inside-out versus right side-out) was measured in the different proteoliposomes using the substituted cysteine accessibility method to determine whether a cysteine residue is entrapped inside or located on the outside of the proteoliposome. Two LmrP single cysteine mutants that display wt-like activities (18Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Poelarends G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26081-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were used: E3C, located in the N-terminal tail on the cytoplasmic side, and E255C, located in the fourth extramembrane loop (ECL4) on the extracellular side (Fig. 3). These single cysteine mutants were each reconstituted into PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes. The orientation of the N-terminal tail and ECL4 in proteoliposomes was studied by analyzing the accessibility of each single cysteine residue in these domains to MPB, a thiol-specific reagent as described by Dowhan and co-workers (7Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the cysteine in N-terminal tail (E3C) and ECL4 (E255C) in proteoliposomes is shown in Fig. 4. In the four proteoliposomes (PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC) E3C mutant was labeled by MPB, suggesting that the N-terminal tail is located on the outside of proteoliposomes. To ensure that no cysteines were trapped inside the proteoliposomes, samples were pretreated with the membrane-impermeable blocking reagent AMS to saturate all the cysteines on the outside, and then permeabilized with OG and treated with MBP. For the E3C mutant, no MBP labeling was observed (Fig. 4), suggesting that no LmrP molecule was reconstituted with the N terminus inside the proteoliposomes. In contrast, mutant E255C was not labeled after MPB treatment and was only labeled when the proteoliposomes were solubilized with OG, supporting that the cysteine is only located on the inside of the proteoliposomes. The results indicate that, in the four proteoliposomes, LmrP is inserted with the N-terminal tail on the outside and ECL4 on the inside, suggesting an inside-out orientation of LmrP relative to the situation in the bacterial cell. Inside-out orientation in PE and PC proteoliposomes has also been demonstrated for LacY (7Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Dichroic ratio RATR on the α helix band of LmrP wt reconstituted in PE or PC proteoliposomes and D68C in PE proteoliposomesRisoRATRWT-PE1.64 ± 0.051.82 ± 0.02WT-PC1.59 ± 0.051.82 ± 0.02D68-PE1.61 ± 0.041.83 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Helical net representation of LmrP.

Single cysteines in the N-terminal tail, ECL4, or ICL2 were treated with MPB directly, after pre-treatment with AMS or after solubilization with OG. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Biotinylation with MPB was detected after transfer to nitrocellulose sheet using avidin-horseradish peroxidase. The results shown are typical of three independent experiments. Note that a minor degradation product is sometimes observed below the full-length LmrP band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From these experiments we conclude that the lack of transport in PC proteoliposomes is not a consequence of inadequate LmrP topology or insertion in the bilayer. Fluorescence Quenching—Conformational diversity can be probed using tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Five out of seven LmrP tryptophan residues are predicted to be located in the extramembrane domains (21Gbaguidi B. Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Ruysschaert J.M. Vigano C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2646-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because LmrP is inserted in inside-out fashion, the Trp residues of LmrP whose fluorescence will be quenched by acrylamide are Trp-5 and Trp-285, located in the N-terminal tail and the intracellular loop 4 (ICL4), respectively (Fig. 3). The accessibility of the two Trp residues to the aqueous medium would reflect the accessibility of these two cytosolic domains. The solvent exposure of the Trp side chains was determined by monitoring the fluorescence intensity in the presence of increasing concentrations (0-100 mm) of the hydrophilic quencher acrylamide (31Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 32Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the Stern-Volmer plots of Trp fluorescence quenching by acrylamide for LmrP reconstituted in PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes. After a proton gradient was imposed on PE proteoliposomes, the Trp accessibility was increased, indicating a reorganization of the cytosolic domains upon ΔpH imposition. As shown in Fig. 5, a similar behavior was observed in PE, methyl-PE, and dimethyl-PE proteoliposomes. Surprisingly, imposing a proton gradient on PC proteoliposomes did not lead to any LmrP conformational change in the cytosolic region. Therefore, the partial modification of the PE headgroup does not appear to modify the structural properties of LmrP while removing the last headgroup hydrogen strongly affects Trp exposure. This suggests that the PE headgroup and LmrP interact directly. IR Spectroscopy—At constant pH and temperature, the rate at which hydrogen and deuterium (H/D) exchange reflects the solvent accessibility of the NH amide groups of the protein, which in turn is related to the tertiary structure of the protein and to the stability of secondary structure elements (33Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 262-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). H/D exchange was monitored on LmrP reconstituted in PE, methyl-PE, dimethyl-PE, and PC proteoliposomes. LmrP amide proton exchange was followed by monitoring the amide II absorption peak (δ(N-H), maximum at 1544 cm-1) decrease as function of time of exposure to a D2O-saturated N2 flow (see “Experimental Procedures”). H/D exchange rate was quantified by monitoring the evolution of the amide II area for each sample between 0 and 100% and reported in Fig. 6. After a 2-h deuteration, 55% of LmrP N-H had been exchanged in PE proteoliposomes. That rate was identical to that of methyl-PE and dimethyl-PE proteoliposomes. The rate of H/D exchange was higher in PC proteoliposomes as 70% of the amide N-H had been exchanged, suggesting that PC favors a lower stability state of LmrP. With 60% of LmrP included in the transmembrane bundle (21Gbaguidi B. Mazurkiewicz P. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Ruysschaert J.M. Vig"

In Escherichia coli, the biogenesis of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: IMPinner membrane proteinTMtransmembranePEGpolyethylene glycol. 2The abbreviations used are: IMPinner membrane proteinTMtransmembranePEGpolyethylene glycol. is predominantly accomplished in a co-translational manner and involves three distinct steps (2Luirink J. von Heijne G.

Unique regions at the N and C termini reflect specific requirements for the interaction with other targeting and insertion factors as well as for the topology of the protein substrates. Oxa1 contains a C-terminal domain for the interaction with the ribosome (27Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A.

YidC from Gram-negative bacteria contains an additional N-terminal TM helix and a periplasmic domain (P1) between TM1 and TM2 (29Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

Taken together, the role of YidC in membrane protein insertion and, specifically, the role of the P1 domain is still not well understood. To date, E. coli YidC is the best characterized member of the Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family. Only a projection structure at low resolution is available from cryo-electron microscopy that suggests that the YidC monomer is a membrane pore that might be able to associate with itself (forming homodimers) or with the Sec translocon, depending on the protein substrate (32Lotz M. Haase W. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structural arrangement of YidC and specifically of the P1 domain is, however, not resolved.Here we report the crystal structure of the P1 domain of YidC from E. coli at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure provides insights into the role of the P1 domain for YidC function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStructure Determination and Refinement—The cloning, overexpression, purification, and crystallization of P1D (residues 56-329 of E. coli YidC) and its selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative were performed as described (73Ravaud S. Wild K. Sinning I. Acta Cryst. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2008; 64: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The structure of P1D was determined using single wavelength anomalous diffraction data collected on a SeMet crystal at the peak wavelength (λ = 0.9790 Å) and the PHENIX (Python-based Hierarchical Environment for Integrated Xtallography) program suite (33Adams P.D.

Comm. 2008; 64: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The eight selenium sites (4 selenium/molecule; 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit) present in the asymmetric unit and the non-crystallographic symmetry relations were identified and the phases were calculated. Density modification, phase extension, and automatic model building were carried out using a remote data set collected at 1.8 Å resolution and previously scaled to the peak wavelength data using SCALEIT (35Collaborative Computational Project, N. 4 (1994) Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 50, 760-763Google Scholar). The AUTOBUILD routine from PHENIX was able to build 473 residues (and the Cα traces of 16 additional amino acids) for the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. The model was completed using iterative cycles of model building in Coot (36Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar), and refinement was done with REFMAC5 (35Collaborative Computational Project, N. 4 (1994) Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 50, 760-763Google Scholar, 37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). The two protein chains were refined independently. The model quality was analyzed with PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 1.Structure Analysis—The secondary structure was analyzed with DSSP (39Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12108) Google Scholar); the multiple sequence alignments were prepared with ClustalW (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) with sequences retrieved from a PSI BLAST search and rendered with ESPript (41Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Surface potentials were calculated with GRASP (42Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar). Conservation scores were determined using the ConSurf server on the basis of 40 sequences of P1 domains from Gram-negative bacteria. Residues interacting with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule are according to LIGPLOT analysis (43Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar). The PEG/protein and protein/protein interactions within the crystal packing were analyzed with the PISA server (44Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6604) Google Scholar). Figures were generated with PyMOL.Characterization of P1D in Solution—The apparent molecular mass was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl (buffer A) with ± 10 mm Cacl2. The absolute molecular mass was determined by static light scattering (mini Dawn Tristar; Wyatt Technologies) and refractive index analysis (WGE Dr. Bures Δn1000, Dallgow, Germany). The oligomeric state of P1D in solution was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Sedimentation velocity studies were carried out at 35,000 rpm at 20 °C in three different buffers (buffer A, buffer A + 1 mm CaCl2, and buffer A + 50 mm CaCl2).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of P1D—E. coli YidC has a molecular mass of 61 kDa and consists of six transmembrane helices. The P1 domain comprises residues 24-342 and is inserted in the periplasmic loop between TM1 and TM2 (29Sääf A. Monne M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Primary structure analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of the P1 domain (residues 26-55) contains a low complexity region predicted to be unstructured according to multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions. The C-terminal region of the P1 domain could not be assigned unambiguously (see below). Therefore, two constructs of the P1 domain were expressed and purified, representing residues 56-329 and 56-342, respectively (73Ravaud S. Wild K. Sinning I. Acta Cryst. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2008; 64: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although the longer one suffered from aggregation problems, the shorter construct (P1D, residues 56-329) yielded soluble protein and diffraction quality crystals (73Ravaud S. Wild K. Sinning I. Acta Cryst. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2008; 64: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was determined at 1.8 Å resolution using single wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined using standard procedures. The refinement statistics are given in the online supplemental Table S1.The P1D structure is well ordered (overall B-factor of 17.2 Å2) with the exception of residues 204-216, which are part of a flexible loop. P1D has an overall globular shape with approximate dimensions of 60 × 50 × 40 Å (Fig. 1, B and C). The major part (residues 56-310) consists of two twisted anti-parallel β-sheets, S1 and S2. S1 (11-stranded β-sheet, major) and S2 (8-stranded β-sheet, minor) pack against each other and form a β-supersandwich fold (Structural Classification of Proteins data base) (45Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The curvature of the two β-sheets creates a concave surface on the S1 side and a convex surface on the S2 side. A number of irregular loops as well as a 310 helix (η1) between β5 and β6 and one α helix (α1) between β12 to β13 connect the β-strands. Sequence analysis using different bioinformatic tools did not allow prediction of this fold. The C terminus of the P1D structure (residues 311-329) consists of the helices α2 and α3, which are packed against the S2 layer of the β-supersandwich by hydrophobic interactions (see below, Fig. 6B). The helix α3 is truncated and forms a 310 helix in P1D, but it is predicted to extend to residue 338 toward TM2 in full-length YidC (see below, Fig. 6A). Therefore, we refer to the C-terminal, helical part of P1D as the linker region. P1D is conserved in YidC of Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 1D). More than 40 homologous sequences were identified by PSI-BLAST analysis, with sequence identities varying from 20 to 99%. Structure-based sequence alignments suggest that they all share the topology of the P1D structure with a protein core adopting a β-supersandwich fold and a helical linker region at the C terminus.FIGURE 6Analysis of the C-terminal linker region. A, sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction for the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family (E. coli YidC for Gram-negative bacteria, Bacillus subtilis SpoIIIJ for Gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Oxa1 for mitochondria, and Arabidopsis thaliana Alb3 for chloroplast).

Xie K. Jiang F. Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). P1D is monomeric in solution according to size exclusion chromatography, static light scattering, and sedimentation velocity experiments (data not shown). However, two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (molecules A and B), related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. They have very similar structures with a root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å and interact by the following regions: α2, β19, the loop between β6 and β7, and the loop between β16 and β17 (Fig. 2A). P1D interactions between adjacent asymmetric units involve different regions and are favored by calcium ions (Fig. 2). Two calcium ions are bound between the η1 helix of chain A and the η1 helix of chain B of an adjacent asymmetric unit (Fig. 2B). The three other calcium ions were observed at the interfaces between the β11-β12 loops of two molecules, A and B, from two adjacent asymmetric units (Fig. 2C). Because crystals were only obtained (or stable) in the presence of calcium ions, they are likely to promote crystallization by tightening the interaction between two P1D molecules. However, calcium ions are unable to promote dimerization in solution as tested by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (data not shown). The interfaces between molecules A and B in the crystal bury around 1000 Å2, which is in the lower range of values described for oligomeric proteins. However, the analysis of the structural and chemical properties and of the probable dissociation pattern of the different assemblies revealed that one of them is energetically favorable. In this case, the concave sides of two A and B molecules are facing each other, forming a large central cavity (Fig. 2A). The biological relevance of such an interaction needs to be investigated.FIGURE 2Crystal packing of P1D. A, ribbon representation of part of the crystal-packing contacts.

Sander C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 653-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a number of proteins from the galactose mutarotase-like family as structural relatives (supplemental Table S2). Comparison of the three-dimensional structures and topologies shows that P1D is similar to the lectin-like domains found in calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone involved in quality control of protein folding (48Schrag J.D.

Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Number and length of the β-strands and/or of the connectivities differ between P1D and these structures as reflected in the high root mean square deviation of ∼3.5-4 Å, and the sequence identities are very low (<12%). However, the main characteristics of the fold are maintained: a pair of antiparallel β-sheets curved to form a concave and convex side (Fig. 3). The β-sandwich motif was reported to have two putative functions. First, in maltose or chitobiose phosphorylases, rhamnogalacturonase, glucoamylase, and galactosidase (supplemental Table S2), it participates in intramolecular interactions and was related to transglycosylation, thermostability, or fold correction (51Aleshin A.E.

Second, it is involved in sugar recognition (lectin-like domains) and plays a role in catalysis (galactose mutarotase, aldose epimerase, OpgG). Carbohydrate recognition occurs on the concave side of the domain, in a large open cleft in the lectin family, whereas in enzymes like galactose mutarotase or OpgG the cleft is narrower and more shielded by loops. The carbohydrate binding residues are not strictly conserved among the different families but typically involve a highly negatively charged surface (Fig. 3C). Acidic residues are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the substrate whereas aromatic residues participate in stacking interactions with the carbohydrate ring.FIGURE 3Structural comparison of P1D (middle) with galactose mutarotase (left) and the carbohydrate recognition domain of the animal lectin p58/ERGIC-53 (right).

These studies identified two separate, independent DNA-binding modules in DNA ligase III that each bind specifically to nicked DNA over intact duplex DNA. One of these modules comprises the zinc finger domain and DNA-binding domain, which function together as a single DNA binding unit. The catalytic core of ligase III is the second DNA nick-binding module. Both binding modules are required for ligation of blunt ended DNA substrates. Although the zinc finger increases the catalytic efficiency of nick ligation, it appears to occupy the same binding site as the DNA ligase III catalytic core.

LigIII functions in a variety of DNA repair pathways, including single-stranded break repair, base excision repair, and nucleotide excision repair. A recent report indicates that LigIII also functions in a back-up pathway for nonhomologous end joining when the major NHEJ pathway is compromised (6Moser J. Kool H. Giakzidis I. Caldecott K.

LigIII and its partner protein XRCC1 interact with aprataxin, a phosphodiesterase that removes the 5′-adenylate group from abortive ligation intermediates arising from unsuccessful attempts at joining DNA strands with damaged termini (13Ahel I.

Left unrepaired, these abortive ligation intermediates are cytotoxic and especially dangerous in irreplaceable, post-mitotic cells such as neurons. Mutation of aprataxin causes ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1, a neurodegenerative disease (14Date H. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Iwabuchi K. Uekawa K. Igarashi S. Koike R. Hiroi T. Yuasa T. Awaya Y. Sakai T.

Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (Reviews): 3005.1-3005.7Crossref Google Scholar). Together, the DBD and CC enable mammalian ligases to fully encircle a DNA substrate, stabilizing a highly distorted, partially underwound structure that positions the DNA termini within the active site (18Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).

The CC of DNA ligases contains five conserved sequence motifs that include the catalytic lysine and residues surrounding the ATP-binding pocket (18Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E.

The mammalian ligases contain additional domains that mediate protein-protein interactions targeting these enzymes to specific pathways (26Dulic A. Bates P.A. Zhang X. Martin S.R. Freemont P.S.

LigIII is distinguished from other DNA ligases by the presence of a unique zinc finger domain that improves ligation efficiency by an unknown mechanism (32Kulczyk A.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. J. Mol.

The sequence and structure of the LigIII zinc finger (ZnF) identify it as a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of zinc fingers (32Kulczyk A.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The two N-terminal zinc fingers of PARP1 bind to DNA breaks, particularly single-stranded breaks (36Menissier-de Murcia J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and two enzymes with PARP-like zinc fingers have been shown to bend DNA 73-102° upon binding (39Le Cam E. Fack F.

The LigIII ZnF reportedly binds specifically to nicks, and deletion of the ZnF reduces affinity for DNA secondary structures, including nicks, flaps, gaps, and Holliday junctions (32Kulczyk A.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the ZnF is not required for enzymatic activity in vitro or to complement an E. coli ligA mutant (33Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Murcia J.M. Leppard J. Au K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although a recent NMR structure of the LigIII ZnF identified several residues with resonance peaks that shift in the presence of DNA, the mode of nick recognition by the zinc finger and its biological significance have not been established (32Kulczyk A.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In LigIII, the ZnF is immediately adjacent to the DBD of the catalytic core. Notably, the potential influence of the DBD was not considered during the initial studies characterizing the LigIII ZnF. Here we report a quantitative analysis of the DNA binding and nick recognition functions of the constituent domains of LigIII. We demonstrate that LigIII has two independent DNA-binding modules participating in two different modes of nick recognition. The ZnF alone fails to bind tightly or specifically to nicked DNA. Instead, the ZnF functions in a cooperative manner with the DBD to promote DNA end joining by LigIII. Furthermore, we show that the ZnF is essential for double-stranded break ligation activity in vitro, consistent with the reported role of LigIII in a backup pathway of NHEJ (8Wang H. Rosidi B.

Expression and Purification of LigIIIβ—The pQE-32 vector containing full-length LigIIIβ (herein referred to as LigIII; Fig. 2) with an N-terminal histidine tag has been described previously (33Mackey Z.B.

Expression of full-length LigIII followed the published protocol, with two modifications. At the time of induction, 10 μm ZnCl2 was added to the LB medium, and following induction, the cultures were incubated at 16 °C for 16 h before bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation. Full-length LigIII was purified using a protocol similar to that previously reported (33Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Murcia J.M. Leppard J. Au K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40 substitute, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The cells were lysed by two passages through a high pressure cell disrupter, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was passed through a 0.45-μm filter prior to loading on a P-11 phosphocellulose column. The P11 column was blocked with bovine serum albumin and then pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) prior to loading the cell lysate. After washing with Buffer A, LigIII was eluted with a gradient from 50 mm to 2 m NaCl. Fractions containing LigIII were pooled and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap nickel Chelating column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl). LigIII was eluted stepwise with Buffer B containing 100, 300, and 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing LigIII were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Sephadex S200 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA). Purified protein was concentrated to 30-40 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl using the calculated extinction coefficients. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of LigIII Domains—LigIII domains (Fig. 2) were cloned into pET-28a with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37 °C. The cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside and supplemented with 1 μm ZnCl2 if the LigIII domain being expressed contained the zinc finger domain. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Bacterial cell pellets were stored at -20 °C. Thawed bacterial cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) and lysed by two passages through a high pressure cell disruptor. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and passed through a DE52 column. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap nickel chelating column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm PMSF). Following a wash with Buffer A, the LigIII domains were eluted stepwise with Buffer A plus 100, 300, and 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the LigIII domain were pooled, and the salt was diluted to 80 mm NaCl by the addition of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT). This was loaded onto a HiTrap S-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer B plus 100 mm NaCl and eluted with a gradient up to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the LigIII domain were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Sephadex S200 gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA). Purified protein was concentrated to 30-40 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl using the calculated extinction coefficients. DNA Binding Assays—The change in fluorescence polarization of a DNA duplex containing a 5′-labeled strand was measured to determine the DNA binding affinity of LigIII and its domains. A 28-nucleotide oligomer (GTGCTGATGCGTCGTCGGACTGATTCGG) with a 5′ 6-carboxyfluorescein label was annealed at equimolar concentrations to a complementary 28-mer to make an intact duplex DNA or to two complementary strands, 13-mer (GTGCTGATGCGTC), and a 15-mer (GTCGGACTGATTCGG) to make a nicked DNA substrate for ligation (Fig. 2B). Duplex DNA oligomers (25 nm) were mixed with protein at concentrations ranging from 50 nm to 30 μm, reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm EDTA), and NaCl at the listed concentration in a total reaction volume of 150 μl. ATP and divalent cations were omitted to prevent ligation of the substrates. A 2-mm cuvette was used. The data were collected at 22 °C with a C-60 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International), using excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 520 nm, respectively. Apparent Kd values for the DNA (KDNA) were calculated by fitting the data to the equation (18Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar): r = r0 + (rmax - r0)*f where r is the fluorescence anisotropy determined experimentally and f = p*d/([DNA] + Kd) with p = [Protein]/(1 + d/Kd), and d = (-[Protein]/Kd + [DNA]/Kd - 1 + sqrt[([Protein]/Kd - [DNA]/Kd + 1)2 + (4 * [DNA]/Kd)])/(2/Kd). DNA Ligation Activity of LigIII and ΔZnF—The single-stranded DNA nick ligation activities of LigIII and ΔZnF were measured in a single turnover reaction at 4 °C to retard the reaction to a measurable rate. The nicked DNA substrate was identical to the one used in the DNA binding experiments, but without the 5′ 6-carboxyfluorescein label. The 15-mer was 5′-radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase. 15-mer (0.5 μm), [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μm), 1× polynucleotide kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT), and 0.5 unit/μl polynucleotide kinase were mixed in a 20-μl reaction and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C. The reaction was arrested by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min and 95 °C for 5 min. Labeled DNA was annealed in equimolar concentrations to the template 28-mer and the upstream 13-mer. 0.25 nm DNA duplex was mixed with an excess of protein in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP) in a 55-μl reaction. To evaluate the extent of ligation as a function of time, the aliquots were removed and quenched periodically over the course of the reaction. The reaction was quenched by the addition of EDTA-formamide and incubation at 95 °C for 5-10 min. The 15-mer substrate was separated from the 28-mer ligated product by denaturing PAGE. Both substrate and product bands were quantified by a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS1000). Catalytic Core Complementation with DBD or ZnF-DBD—Ligation activity of the CC was measured in a single turnover reaction at 25 °C. A higher temperature was used for the CC than for LigIII and ΔZnF to increase its ligation rate. The nicked DNA substrate and labeling reaction were identical to the one described above. 4 nm DNA duplex was mixed with 100 nm CC and various concentrations of DBD or ZnF-DBD in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP) in a 46-μl reaction. As described above, the aliquots were removed and quenched periodically over the course of the reaction. The separation and quantitation of substrates and products are also described above. Ligation of Substrates with Blunt Ends or Short Overhangs—Ligation activity on DNA substrates with blunt or sticky ends (complementary 2-bp 5′ overhangs) was measured in a multiple turnover reaction at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, the substrates contained only one 5′-phosphate and one 3′-hydroxyl to allow ligation in only one orientation. The top strand of the blunt substrate had the sequence 5′-GTCGGACTGATTCGGGCTGGAGGAC; the bottom strand had the sequence (5′-GTCCTCCAGCCCGAATCAGTCCGAC. The sticky end substrate was constructed by annealing the top strand of the blunt substrate to a bottom strand with a two-nucleotide overhang on the 3′-terminus (5′-GTCCTCCAGCCCGAATCAGTCCGACAT). A diagram of the substrates with blunt ends or short overhangs is shown in Fig. 7A. 4 nm blunt or sticky end substrate was mixed with 100-1000 nm LigIII or ΔZnF in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP) in a 20-μl reaction. Quenching of the reactions and separation of substrate and products are described above. Comparison of DNA Ligation Activity of LigIII and ΔZnF—Although the ZnF of LigIII is not required for enzymatic activity in vitro (33Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Murcia J.M. Leppard J. Au K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine how the ZnF contributes to the mechanism of ligation, we examined the kinetics of DNA nick joining in vitro using a single-turnover ligation assay. This assay reports on the kinetics of the DNA-dependent steps of the end joining process (i.e. DNA binding, adenylation, and nick joining) independent of enzyme adenylation or product release. As previously reported, the ZnF is not required for ligation of a single-stranded nick (Fig. 3, A and B). Deletion of the ZnF actually increases the kcat 10-fold, from 0.0020 ± 0.0001 s-1 for LigIII to 0.020 ± 0.001 s-1 for ΔZnF (Fig. 3, C and D). However, the Km for DNA is enhanced 50-fold for LigIII (Km = 0.9 ± 0.3 nm) in comparison with the ΔZnF protein (Km = 50 ± 10 nm). These differences are reflected in a 5-fold higher catalytic efficiency of LigIII (kcat/Km = 2 × 106 m-1 s-1) compared with ΔZnF (kcat/Km = 4 × 105 m-1 s-1). The 50-fold increase in Km for DNA caused by deletion of the LigIII ZnF suggested that the ZnF may help stabilize the DNA in the active site of LigIII. We therefore measured the DNA binding affinities of LigIII and ΔZnF for nicked and intact DNA duplexes. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements with labeled DNA duplexes were performed in the absence of divalent cations to prevent ligation. We confirmed that Step 2 transfer of AMP to the DNA 5′PO4 does not occur under these conditions (data not shown). In 80 mm NaCl, LigIII binds nonspecifically to DNA, showing equal affinity for nicked and intact DNA (KDNA = 0.23 ± 0.06 μm and 0.24 ± 0.05 μm, respectively; Table 1). Because 80 mm NaCl is well below the optimal salt concentration for ligation by LigIII (33Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Murcia J.M. Leppard J. Au K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), binding measurements were repeated at 250 mm NaCl. Under these conditions, LigIII binds specifically to nicked DNA (KDNA = 0.3 ± 0.08 μm) and does not bind measurably to duplex DNA (>20 μm; Fig. 4 and Table 2). This is in contrast to LigI, which is strongly inhibited by elevated salt concentrations (18Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T.

The ΔZnF binds to nicked DNA with an affinity of 0.63 ± 0.24 μm and to intact duplex with an affinity of >30 μm in 250 mm NaCl. This indicates that the nick binding activity of LigIII is not solely dependent upon the ZnF domain. In contrast, LigI, which lacks a ZnF, fails to bind selectively to nicked DNAs (18Pascal J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2128390257,"Background In 1996, Brazil became the first developing country to provide free and universal access to HAART. Although a decrease in overall mortality has been documented, there are no published data on the impact of HAART on causes of death among HIV-infected individuals in Brazil. We assessed temporal trends of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and other conditions generally not associated with HIV-infection among persons with and without HIV infection in Brazil between 1999 and 2004. Methodology/Principal Findings Odds ratios were used to compare causes of death in individuals who had HIV/AIDS listed on any field of the death certificate with those who did not. Logistic regression models were fitted with generalized estimating equations to account for spatial correlation; co-variables were added to the models to control for potential confounding. Of 5,856,056 deaths reported in Brazil between 1999 and 2004 67,249 (1.15%) had HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate and non-HIV-related conditions were listed on 16.3% in 1999, increasing to 24.1% by 2004 (p<0.001). The adjusted average yearly increases were 8% and 0.8% for CVD (p<0.001), and 12% and 2.8% for DM (p<0.001), for those who had and did not have HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate, respectively. Similar results were found for these conditions as underlying causes of death. Conclusions/Significance In Brazil between 1999 and 2004 conditions usually considered not to be related to HIV-infection appeared to become more likely causes of death over time than reported causes of death among individuals who had HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate than in those who did not. This observation has important programmatic implications for developing countries that are scaling-up access to antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2152506366,"The hypothetical <i>Escherichia coli</i> protein YfhD has been identified as the archetype for the family 1B lytic transglycosylases despite a complete lack of experimental characterization. The <i>yfhD</i> gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of <i>E. coli</i> W3110 and cloned to encode a fusion protein with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> sequence. The enzyme was found to be localized to the outer membrane of <i>E. coli</i>, as would be expected for a lytic transglycosylase. Its gene was engineered for the production of a truncated soluble enzyme derivative lacking an N-terminal signal sequence and membrane anchor. The soluble YfhD derivative was purified to apparent homogeneity, and three separate <i>in vitro</i> assays involving high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate the YfhD-catalyzed release of 1,6-anhydromuro-peptides from insoluble peptidoglycan. In addition, an <i>in vivo</i> bioassay developed using the bacteriophage λ lysis system confirmed that the enzyme functions as an autolysin. Based on these data, the enzyme was renamed membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase F. The modular structure of MltF was investigated through genetic engineering for the separate production of identified N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The ability to bind peptidoglycan and lytic activity were only associated with the isolated C-terminal domain. The enzymatic properties of this lytic transglycosylase domain were found to be very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The one notable exception was that the N-terminal domain appears to modulate the lytic behavior of the C-terminal domain to permit continued lysis of insoluble peptidoglycan, a unique feature of MltF compared with other characterized lytic transglycosylases."
https://openalex.org/W2006412287,"Abnormal aggregation of human α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Studies have shown that oxidation and nitration of α-synuclein lead to the formation of stable dimers and oligomers through dityrosine cross-linking. Previously we have reported that tyrosine-to-cysteine mutations, particularly at the tyrosine 39 residue (Y39C), significantly enhanced α-synuclein fibril formation and neurotoxicity. In the current study, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the Y39C mutant human α-synuclein gene controlled by the mouse Thy1 promoter. Mutant human α-synuclein was widely expressed in transgenic mouse brain, resulting in 150% overexpression relative to endogenous mouse α-synuclein. At age 9–12 months, transgenic mice began to display motor dysfunction in rotarod testing. Older animals aged 15–18 months showed progressive accumulation of human α-synuclein oligomers, associated with worse motor function and cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze. By age 21–24 months, α-synuclein aggregates were further increased, accompanied by severe behavioral deficits. At this age, transgenic mice developed neuropathology, such as Lewy body-like α-synuclein and ubiquitin-positive inclusions, phosphorylation at Ser129 of human α-synuclein, and increased apoptotic cell death. In summary, Y39C human α-synuclein transgenic mice show age-dependent, progressive neuronal degeneration with motor and cognitive deficits similar to diffuse Lewy body disease. The time course of α-synuclein oligomer accumulation coincided with behavioral and pathological changes, indicating that these oligomers may initiate protein aggregation, disrupt cellular function, and eventually lead to neuronal death. Abnormal aggregation of human α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Studies have shown that oxidation and nitration of α-synuclein lead to the formation of stable dimers and oligomers through dityrosine cross-linking. Previously we have reported that tyrosine-to-cysteine mutations, particularly at the tyrosine 39 residue (Y39C), significantly enhanced α-synuclein fibril formation and neurotoxicity. In the current study, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the Y39C mutant human α-synuclein gene controlled by the mouse Thy1 promoter.

The accumulation of α-synuclein causes neuronal death when the protein aggregates into protofibrils and fibrils. However, the cellular mechanisms by which the soluble α-synuclein monomer forms oligomers and fibrils remain unclear. In vitro studies have shown that human α-synuclein proteins are prone to aggregate by increasing concentration, temperature, oxidative stress, and heavy metals (18Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S.

Wild type α-synuclein has four tyrosine residues at positions 39, 125, 133, and 136 and lacks cysteine. Because cysteine can be easily oxidized to form stable cross-linked disulfide dimers, we have systemically substituted cysteine for tyrosine and analyzed the effect on tyrosine-to-cysteine mutant protein aggregation and neurotoxicity (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have found that cysteine substitution in the Y39C and Y125C positions but not the Y133C and Y136C positions significantly enhanced α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J.

In this study, we have created transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human α-synuclein with Y39C mutations under control of the mouse Thy1 promoter (Tg-Y39C). We report here that the Tg-Y39C mice developed α-synuclein pathology and progressive motor and cognitive deficits. Generation of Y39C Human α-Synuclein Tg Mice—We have generated Tg mice expressing Y39C mutant human α-synuclein under the murine Thy1 promoter (33van der Putten H. Wiederhold K.H. Probst A.

The Y39C human α-synuclein fragment was isolated from pcDNA3.1-Y39C-hsyn by the restriction enzyme XhoI (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ligated into the XhoI site of the mThy1 cassette (Fig. 1A). The constructs were linearized by NotI and gel-purified. Microinjection of DNA into one-cell embryos (FVB/N) was done by the University of Colorado Transgenic Core according to standard procedures. Founder mice were identified by PCR using tail genomic DNA. The PCR was performed with the P1 (5′-TCTGAGTGGCAAAGGACCTTAG-3′) and P2 (5′-CCCTTCCTCAGAAGGCATTTCAT-3′) primers and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, resulting in a 440-bp fragment. The founder mice were confirmed by Southern blotting following standard procedures, using a 360-bp DNA probe corresponding to human α-synuclein cDNA sequence (Fig. 1A). A transgenic line with the highest expression of human α-synuclein was selected for subsequent analysis. For all experiments, heterozygous human α-synuclein Tg mice were crossed with wild type FVB/N mice to generate Tg and nontransgenic (nTg) littermates. Mice were genotyped by PCR using primers P1 and P2. Western Blotting Analysis—Fresh brain tissues were dissected and quickly frozen in dry ice. Tissues were thawed on ice and homogenized in dissociation buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were separated into Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Triton-insoluble fraction was further dissociated in 1% SDS, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were recovered as SDS-soluble fractions. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). Fifty μg of protein was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated with mouse anti-human α-synuclein-specific antibody LB509 (1:5000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), mouse anti-α-synuclein antibody (1:5000; synuclein-1;Transduction Laboratories), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:4000; Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as the secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescent detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (32Zhou W.

Immunohistochemistry Analysis—For histological analysis, mice that received lethal doses of anesthetic were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were postfixed for 2 h and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose. Free floating sections (40 μm) were blocked in 5% normal serum, 0.25% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, followed by incubation with the following primary antibodies overnight: LB509 (1:500), synuclein-1 (1:500), rabbit anti-α-synuclein phospho-Ser129 antibody (1:500; Chemicon), rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:200; PelFreez), and mouse anti-ubiquitin (1:400; Chemicon). The sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (35Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S.

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated Biotinylated UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The apoptotic cell nuclei in brain sections were analyzed by TUNEL (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit; Roche Applied Science). Sections were treated for 10 min with proteinase K (5 mg/ml) at 37 °C and then stained according to the kit (35Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Zhou W. Schaack J. Zawada W.M. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Open Field Activity Test—Mice were tested in 50 × 50-cm square boxes with clear Plexiglas walls and floors, evenly illuminated by white overhead fluorescent lighting. Mice were individually placed in the center of the open field and left to freely explore for 30 min. Activity was measured by a computer-assisted Photobeam Activity System with Flexfield (San Diego Instruments). The total distance traveled and the total movement times were recorded in 5-min intervals. Rotarod Test—Mice were tested for their ability to maintain balance on a rotating rod (rotarod) at a selected speed ranging from 3 to 33 rpm. The protocol consisted of two phases: habituation (day 1) and rotarod training/testing (days 2–7). On day 1, the mice were trained to remain on a 3-cm diameter rod at 3 rpm. During training and testing, mice had to run on the rod as it rotated at a constant speed of 7, 10, 14, 20, 26, or 33 rpm from day 2 to day 7, respectively. Each mouse received three 1-min trials, with a 5-min interval between trials. The time the mice spent on the rod without falling was recorded for each trial. Morris Water Maze Testing—Spatial learning was assessed using the Morris water maze (37Zhou W. Jiang D. Raisman G. Zhou C. Brain Res. 1998; 792: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The maze included a circular tank (120 cm in diameter) filled to 5 cm below the edge of the tank with 27 °C water that was made opaque by the addition of nontoxic black ink. A circular escape platform (10 cm in diameter) was located 1 cm below the surface of the water in a constant location in the northwest quadrant of the tank. On day 1, mice were first acclimated to the maze during a three-trial habituation session. On day 2, mice were tested for their ability to find the visible platform, which was located 4 cm above the water levels. Each mouse had four trials with a 5-min interval between trials. From day 3 to day 6, mice were trained to find the hidden platform for four consecutive days. Each mouse received four trials per day, with a 5-min interval between trials. The mice were allowed to swim for up to 60 s before being returned to the home cage. The times required to find the platform (latency) were recorded for each trial. Statistics—Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and the Fisher least significant difference post hoc test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Values are shown as mean ± S.E. Characterization of Y39C Mutant Human α-Synuclein Tg Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by standard pro-nuclear injection procedures, and four founders were identified by PCR (Fig. 1B). Southern blotting using a human α-synuclein-specific probe showed two lines (B5365 and B5366) with a strong band at 6 kb as expected (Fig. 1C); two other lines (B5464 and B5368) had very low expression of the desired gene fragment (data not shown). Western blotting using the human α-synuclein-specific antibody LB509 confirmed that human α-synuclein was expressed in both B5365 and B5366 lines (Fig. 1D). The Western blot was stripped and reprobed with synuclein-1 antibody, which detects both mouse and human α-synuclein. Results showed a 150 and 115% overexpression of human α-synuclein relative to endogenous mouse α-synuclein in line B5365 and B5366, respectively. Because line B5365 had higher human α-synuclein levels than line B5366, we used line B5365 for the subsequent experiments. The Tg mice were healthy and fertile. The body weights of Tg and nTg littermates were similar (data not shown). The Tg mice showed significantly lower survival rates beginning at age 24 months compared with nTg littermates (*, p < 0.05; Fig. 1E). Tg Mice Develop α-Synuclein Neuropathology in Aging Brain—We characterized human α-synuclein distribution in mouse brain using immunohistochemistry. Brain sections from 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old Tg mice were immunostained with LB509 antibody. We found that human α-synuclein was widely expressed in mouse brain, with highest expression in the cortex (Fig. 2A). Expression of human α-synuclein was also seen in hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and substantia nigra (Fig. 2, B–E) as well as in spinal cord (data not shown). Human α-synuclein staining was present in the cytoplasm and extended to the proximal neurites. In aged animals (24 months old), α-synuclein inclusions similar to Lewy bodies were found, particularly in cortex (arrow in Fig. 2F). Since phosphorylation at Ser129 is a pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies, we stained sections with phospho-Ser129 antibody. The phospho-Ser129-positive inclusions were only found in 24-month Tg brain (arrow in Fig. 2H) and not in 12-month Tg brain (Fig. 2G). In age-matched non-Tg controls, there was no phospho-Ser129 staining (24 months shown in Fig. 2I). We also performed ubiquitin staining, another marker for neurodegeneration. In 24-month Tg mice, ubiquitin-positive aggregations were observed in cell bodies and neurites (arrows and arrowheads in Fig. 2K). There were no ubiquitin inclusions in 12-month Tg mice (Fig. 2J). In age-matched non-Tg controls, the ubiquitin staining was all negative (24 months shown in Fig. 2L). To assess whether accelerated cell death occurred in aging Tg mouse brain, TUNEL assays were performed on tissue sections from 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old mice. There was a 100% increase in apoptotic cell death in 24-month-old Tg mouse brain (Fig. 2N) compared with nTg control mice (Fig. 2, M and O; **, p < 0.01). By contrast, the 18-month-old Tg brain had TUNEL staining similar to nTg brain (Fig. 2O), suggesting that Y39c Tg animals have age-dependent neuronal degeneration. The increased apoptosis rate in aged Tg mice compared with nTg littermates may be the cause of significantly lower survival seen at 24 months (Fig. 1E). Tg Mice Accumulate Human α-Synuclein Oligomers in an Age-dependent Manner—We analyzed α-synuclein protein from different brain regions by Western blotting. The proteins were separated into Triton X-100-soluble and SDS-soluble fractions for comparison. Protein samples from 3–6-month, 10–12-month, 15–18-month, and 21–24-month Tg and nTg brain were analyzed. Sample blots from 15-month-old Tg and nTg are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, sequentially probed with LB509 (Fig. 3A) and synuclein-1 (Fig. 3B). In the 15–18-month age group, we found that human α-synuclein formed ladder-like oligomers with molecular masses of 50–150 kDa in Triton-soluble fractions in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and spinal cord (Fig. 3A). In SDS-soluble fractions, we found only a single human α-synuclein oligomer of 120 kDa in all four brain areas (Fig. 3A). However, when these same SDS-soluble fractions were probed with synuclein-1 antibody, a ladder of oligomers was seen similar to that observed in Triton-soluble samples, suggesting that synuclein-1 antibody may be more sensitive than LB509. Nontransgenic mice showed no oligomers in Triton or SDS fractions. In older Tg animals (21–24 months), oligomer bands were more intense than in younger Tg mice (15–18 months) (Fig. 3C). Quantifying oligomer to monomer revealed that there were significant age-dependent increases in oligomer aggregation in both Triton and SDS fractions (**, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). Tg Mice Develop Progressive Motor Function Deficits—We performed rotarod tests comparing Tg and nTg mice at four different age groups: 3–6, 9–12, 15–18, and 21–24 months (Fig. 4, A–D). Over the 6-day testing period, most animals learned to stay on the rod. Tg mice started to display motor deficits at age 9–12 months compared with nTg littermates (*, p < 0.05; Fig. 4B). Motor performance became progressively worse with age, as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. By 21–24 months, the Tg mice had severe motor impairment, staying on the rotarod only half as long as nTg littermates (**, p < 0.01; Fig. 4D). Tg Mice Display an Age-dependent Decline in Cognitive Function—We used a Morris water maze to test cognitive function in Tg and nTg mice in four age groups: 3–6, 9–12, 15–18, and 21–24 months (Fig. 5, A–D). To rule out potential visual impairments in Tg mice, animals were tested for their ability to find the platform positioned above the water level. In this visible platform test, the latencies for each group were as follows: 3–6 months, 24.1 ± 2.9 and 22.5 ± 2.6 s (Tg and control mice, respectively; same order for other groups, p > 0.1); 9–12 months, 25.7 ± 2.4 and 23.5 ± 1.8 s (p > 0.1); 15–18 months, 27.7 ± 2.1 and 26.9 ± 3.2 s (p > 0.1); 21–24 months, 31.8 ± 2.5 and 29.2 ± 3.6 s (p > 0.1). The results indicated that transgenic mice had similar visual and locomotor function as age-matched controls. After 4 days of training, nTg control mice were able to quickly locate the hidden platform in the water maze. In 3–6- and 9–12-month groups, there were no significant differences in the latency between Tg and nTg mice (Fig. 5, A and B). However, Tg mice at 15–18 months of age took significantly longer to find the platform compared with nTg littermates (*, p < 0.05; Fig. 5C). In the oldest group, 21–24 months, the difference in the latency between Tg and nTg mice was even larger; Tg mice took twice as long to find the platform (**, p < 0.01; Fig. 5D). The data indicate that Tg mice had age-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits. Tg Mice had Open Field Activity Similar to That of nTg Mice—To demonstrate that the motor and cognitive deficits observed in Tg mice were not caused by muscle weakness or some other restriction on general locomotor ability, we compared the open field exploratory activity in Tg and nTg mice in four age groups. With increasing age, both Tg and nTg animals showed progressive reduction in open field activity. Measurements of total distance traveled (Fig. 6A) and total movement time (Fig. 6B) showed no differences between age-matched Tg and nTg animals (p > 0.1). The results indicate that Tg mice had open field activity similar to that of nTg mice. Midbrain Dopamine Neurons Are Not Affected in Tg Mice—Although there was some expression of human α-synuclein in midbrain neurons, the protein rarely colocalized with TH-positive dopamine neurons (data not shown). There were no significant losses of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra or dopamine nerve terminals in striatum, even in aged Tg mouse brain (Fig. 7, A–D). The Time Course of Human α-Synuclein Oligomer Accumulation Correlates with Behavioral Deficits and Neuropathology—We summarize the biochemical, behavioral, and pathological data according to age groups in Table 1. At age 9–12 months, Tg mice had minimal oligomer accumulation (2% of oligomer relative to monomer). Behaviorally, Tg mice showed deficits in rotarod testing but not in water maze performance. As α-synuclein oligomers accumulated at 15–18 and 21–24 months of age, Tg mice displayed progressively worse performance in both rotarod and water maze tests. Obvious changes in histopathology were seen in the oldest Tg mice as noted above. From the table, it can be noted that the time course of α-synuclein oligomer accumulation was highly correlated with motor and cognitive decline.TABLE 1Summary of biochemical, behavioral, and pathological changes in Y39C human α-synuclein transgenic mice for different age groups m, month; –, none/not detectable; +, ++, and +++, present and graded for increasing severity.9–12 m15–18 m21–24 mBiochemical changes Triton-soluble oligomersMinimal+++ SDS-soluble oligomersMinimal+++Behavioral changes Rotarod deficits++++++ Morris water maze deficits–+++Neuropathology Lewy body-like inclusions––++ Phospho-Ser129/ubiquitin inclusions––++ Increase in apoptosis rate––++ Open table in a new tab In our previous work, we have found that tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution, particularly at the tyrosine 39 residue, significantly enhances aggregation of human α-synuclein through accelerated formation of oligomers, particularly after oxidative stress (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have generated and characterized a transgenic mouse overexpressing the Y39C mutant human α-synuclein (Y39C) under control of the mouse Thy1 promoter. These transgenic mice have age-dependent, progressive motor and cognitive deficits that correlate with widespread deposition of oligomers in the brain, leading to cellular neuropathology in the older animals. In other human α-synuclein Tg mouse studies, oligomers only appeared in detergent-insoluble fractions (33van der Putten H. Wiederhold K.H. Probst A. Barbieri S. Mistl C. Danner S. Kauffmann S.

J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). By contrast, in our Tg mice, oligomers were recovered in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction as well as in the detergent-insoluble fraction. The difference was probably due to the tyrosine-to-cysteine modification of human α-synuclein in our Tg model. We have previously shown that Y39C human α-synuclein, but not wild-type or A53T human α-synuclein, is able to form dimers and oligomers under very mild oxidative stress in vitro (32Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our Tg mice displayed motor dysfunction at an earlier age than their decline in cognitive function. Because the Thy1 promoter leads to gene expression in all brain neurons, we cannot say which brain structure contributed most to the behavioral effects observed. Although Tg animals showed behavioral deficits beginning at age 9–12 months, α-synuclein inclusions and apoptotic cell death first appeared at age 21–24 months. It is possible that oligomer accumulation causes cellular dysfunction. Eventually, oligomer aggregation leads to inclusion formation and finally to cell death. A recent study has demonstrated that α-synuclein accumulation can block vesicular trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, resulting in functional impairment and cell death (7Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K. Xu K. Strathearn K.E. Liu F. Cao S. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Marsischky G. Kolodner R.D. Labaer J. Rochet J.C. Bonini N.M. Lindquist S. Science. 2006; 313: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Our Tg mouse model suggests that the α-synuclein fibrilization process is linked to neuropathology. In our Tg mouse model, the panneuronal Thy1 promoter induced human α-synuclein expression equivalent to 150% of endogenous α-synuclein levels for a total α-synuclein content that was 250% of normal. A number of human α-synuclein transgenic mouse models have been developed with different promoters (33van der Putten H. Wiederhold K.H. Probst A. Barbieri S. Mistl C. Danner S. Kauffmann S. Hofele K.

In some Thy1 and prion promoter α-synuclein Tg mice, the overexpression is about 10-fold higher than normal and is observed throughout the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra (38Giasson B.I.

The relatively lower overexpression of human α-synuclein in our Tg mouse model may explain the age-dependent, progressive behavioral phenotype. Our animals should make it possible to test novel agents for their ability to prevent progression of the α-synucleinopathy and to possibly reverse neuropathologic changes. Most remarkable about all of the transgenic animals generated to date is the lack of severe pathology in midbrain dopamine neurons (33van der Putten H. Wiederhold K.H. Probst A. Barbieri S. Mistl C. Danner S. Kauffmann S. Hofele K. Spooren W.P. Ruegg M.A. Lin S. Caroni P. Sommer B. Tolnay M. Bilbe G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6021-6029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gispert S. Del Turco D.

Unlike in humans, mouse midbrain dopamine neurons are not selectively damaged by genetic overexpression of mutant α-synuclein. Explanations for this phenomenon remain conjectural. In summary, Y39C human α-synuclein transgenic mice develop age-dependent progressive motor and cognitive deficits and α-synuclein neuropathology. Motor and cognitive testing indicates that these animals are a useful model of human diffuse Lewy body disease. Further study of these mice should help in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and may identify drugs to treat diffuse Lewy body disease in humans.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphatases are up-regulated, and the level of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is drastically decreased under phosphate-starved conditions. The reduction in the LPA level is attributed to PHM8, a gene of unknown function. phm8Δ yeast showed a decreased LPA-hydrolyzing activity under phosphate-limiting conditions. Overexpression of PHM8 in yeast resulted in an increase in the LPA phosphatase activity in vivo. In vitro assays of the purified recombinant Phm8p revealed magnesium-dependent LPA phosphatase activity, with maximal activity at pH 6.5. The purified Phm8p did not hydrolyze any lipid phosphates other than LPA. In silico analysis suggest that Phm8p is a soluble protein with no transmembrane domain. Site-directed mutational studies revealed that aspartate residues in a DXDXT motif are important for the catalysis. These findings indicated that LPA plays a direct role in phosphate starvation.

This is the first report of the identification and characterization of magnesium-dependent soluble LPA phosphatase. Phosphate is an essential macronutrient required for the growth of all organisms. It is indispensable for the synthesis of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and high energy molecules, such as ATP and GTP. Therefore, it is necessary for the organisms to have evolved ways of sensing extracellular phosphate, scavenging it from the environment, and transporting it into the cell under phosphate-deprived conditions. Such activities are carried out by the gene products that are up-regulated during the phosphate starvation (1Tamai Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 964-968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate is the most common functional group present in the metabolome. Under phosphate-limiting conditions, the phospholipids may act as phosphate source. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the amount of membrane phospholipids is decreased due to the up-regulation of a phosphatidylcholine (PC) 3The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineLPAlysophosphatidic acidSMsynthetic mediumHADhaloacid dehalogenasePAphosphatidic acidNTAnitrilotriacetic acidMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidESI-MSelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometryIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. -specific phospholipase C, and a nonphosphorous digalactosyldiacylglycerol level is increased under phosphate-limiting conditions (2Hartel H.

In Monodus subterraneus, an increase in accumulation of triacylglycerol and a concomitant decrease in the level of phospholipids was observed (4Khozin-Goldberg I. Cohen Z. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, a photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides accumulated betaine lipid, diacylglycerol N-trimethylhomoserine, and sulfolipid, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol by replacing PC and phosphatidylglycerol (5Benning C.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was observed that ∼550 genes are up-regulated under phosphate-deprived conditions (7Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Among these, phosphatases represent a small fraction. Understanding the role of these enzymes during phosphate starvation is important because of the direct involvement of phosphatases in phosphate acquisition. The present study was aimed at deciphering the role of unknown phosphatase(s) in phospholipid metabolism under phosphate-deprived conditions. We have found that the level of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was reduced under phosphate-deprived conditions in S. cerevisiae. It has been shown earlier that LPA is the important intermediate for the biosynthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids (8Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 579-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The decrease in LPA concentration in our study is attributed to PHM8 (phosphate metabolism gene 8), which is induced during phosphate starvation. Phm8p has a phosphatase motif within the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like domain. The HAD superfamily includes enzymes that catalyze carbon or phosphoryl group transfer reaction on a diverse range of substrates. The majority of enzymes in this superfamily are involved in phosphate transfer (10Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Lu Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8684-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling of Phm8p-expressing Escherichia coli and yeast cells and in vitro assays with the purified recombinant Phm8p suggest that the PHM8 encodes a soluble protein that dephosphorylates LPA in a magnesium-dependent manner. However, magnesium-independent soluble LPA phosphatases were reported from Arachis hypogaea (12Shekar S. Tumaney A.W. Rao T.J. Rajasekharan R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and bovine brain (13Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane-bound, magnesium-independent lipid phosphatases LPP1 (14Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Here, we report the identification of the magnesium-dependent soluble LPA phosphatase that is up-regulated under phosphate-limiting conditions. Materials—S. cerevisiae (BY4741) and PHM8 knock-out (phmΔ mutant) in BY4741 strains were obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). [32P]Orthophosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) was from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Mumbai, India). [1-oleoyl-9,10-3H]LPA (47 Ci/mmol), [glycerol-U-14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (100–200 mCi/mmol), and l-[U-14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (120 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Protein assay reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. Thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck. Oligonucleotides and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Gene Expression Analysis—The expression connection available on the Saccharomyces Genome data base (available on the World Wide Web) was used to retrieve microarray expression data. We have chosen PHO-regulated genes that are up-regulated more than 2-fold. Media and Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium (pH 7.0) supplemented with 2% glucose with aeration at 30 °C. Cell density was obtained by measuring absorbance at A600. Synthetic complete medium (SM + Pi) was prepared as described earlier (16Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate-free medium (SM – Pi) was prepared by replacing KH2PO4 (1 g/liter) in synthetic complete medium with KCl (1 g/liter). The medium was sterilized by autoclaving, and 20% dextrose was added prior to use to a final concentration of 2%. The absence of free inorganic phosphate was confirmed by phosphate estimation (17Fiske C.H. Subba Row Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Preparation of the Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions from S. cerevisiae—Yeast cells grown in the presence or in the absence of phosphate were suspended in 50 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed using glass beads, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The cell-free extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to obtain cytosolic and membrane fractions. Membrane fraction was suspended in the same buffer that was used for lysis. Protein amount was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Determination of Turnover of Phospholipids—S. cerevisiae cells were grown for more than three generations in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid until the growth reached midlog phase. Culture was pelleted at 3000 rpm for 5 min, washed with sterile water, and resuspended in SM + Pi or SM – Pi. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 6 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. To this, a chloroform, methanol, 2% phosphoric acid mixture was added in a ratio of 1:2:2 (v/v/v) (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42871) Google Scholar). Chloroform extract containing total lipids was subjected to two-dimensional silica TLC. The solvent for the first dimension was chloroform/methanol/ammonia (65:25:5, v/v/v); the second dimension was chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (50:10:20:15:5, v/v/v/v/v). Lipids were identified by their relative migration with standards. Radioactive lipids were analyzed by a PhosphorImager and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) Analysis—Yeast cells were grown in the synthetic complete medium until the OD reached 2.8–3.0, and the cells were pelleted, washed with sterile water, and transferred to either synthetic complete medium or phosphate-deprived synthetic medium for different times. Lipids were extracted under acidic conditions using chloroform/methanol in a ratio of 1:2. The chloroform-soluble fraction was dried, suspended in HPLC grade methanol, and subjected to ESI-MS (Bruker Esquire 3000 Plus electrospray ion trap instrument). The sample (10 μl) was directly delivered into the ESI source through the polytetrafluoroethylene line at a rate of 4 μl/min. The ESI-MS settings used were as follows. The turboelectrospray ionization source was maintained at 260 °C, and data were collected in the negative ion mode from 420 to 450 m/z. Due to the lack of a proper internal standard with us, we added [3H]LPA to an equal amount of yeast cells; lipids were extracted in a similar way as that from samples subjected to ESI-MS; the efficiency of extraction was calculated to be 83–87%; and the procedure was monitored in every experiment. The efficiency of ionization was also almost the same every time. The experiments were repeated four times, and similar spectra were obtained in all of the cases. In Vivo Labeling of E. coli Expressing the PHM8 Gene—E. coli cells were grown for more than three generations in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate until the A600 reached 0.6. Culture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in fresh Luria-Bertani medium, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 h. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol in a ratio of 1:2 (v/v), separated by two-dimensional silica TLC, and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. E. coli expressing repressible acid phosphatase, Pho12p, was used as a control. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Phm8p—Yeast genomic DNA was prepared as mentioned previously (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.55-6.56Google Scholar). The gene corresponding to PHM8 (YER037W) was amplified from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae using 5′-ATATCTGCAGATGACTATCGCTAAAGATTACAGAAC-3′ and 5′-ATATGGTA CCTCATGATGACTGAACATTGATCTG-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR mixture consisted of 100 ng of template, 10 pmol of sense and antisense primers, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of XT-5 DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei, India), and 1× reaction buffer. Amplification was carried out under the following conditions: initial denaturation of the template at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min (denaturation), 55 °C for 1 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 1 min (extension). The final extension was done at 72 °C for 20 min. The amplified product was cloned into pRSET C vector (Invitrogen) at KpnI and PstI restriction sites. The resultant plasmids containing the gene were confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli Origami (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) by inducing with 0.5 mm IPTG followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of mutant enzymes, induction was carried out at 15 °C for 10 h after the addition of 0.5 mm IPTG. Before induction, the culture was maintained on ice for 30 min. Protein amounts were determined by using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Purified fractions containing eluted protein were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Mutant proteins were purified in a similar manner as described for wild type. LPA Phosphatase Assay—LPA phosphatase assays were performed as described earlier (12Shekar S. Tumaney A.W. Rao T.J.

[1-oleoyl-9,10-3H]LPA (47 Ci/mmol) was suspended in 10 mm Triton X-100 and sonicated for 5 min in a sonic bath. The substrate stock solution was diluted 100-fold in the assay. The LPA phosphatase assay mixture consisted of 50 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 50 μm [3H]LPA (220,000 dpm/reaction), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Triton X-100, and 1 μgof recombinant enzyme or 50 μg of yeast cytosol in a total volume of 100 μl. The incubation was carried out at 30 °C for the indicated time and stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 2% phosphoric acid followed by 600 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Following lipid extraction, the lower chloroform-soluble fraction was separated by TLC on 250-μm silica gel G plates using chloroform/methanol/water (98:2:0.5, v/v/v) as the solvent system. The lipids were visualized by staining with iodine vapor, and spots of monoacylglycerol were scraped off for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Boiled enzyme and buffer were used as controls, and the control values were subtracted from the values measured in the presence of an active enzyme source. Other Enzyme Assays—50 μm diacylglycerol pyrophosphate or sphingosine 1-phosphate was incubated with the purified recombinant Phm8p, and the release of phosphate was monitored in the aqueous phase by using the malachite green method (20Mahuren J.D. Coburn S.P. Slominski A. Wortsman J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assay components and conditions are the same as described for the LPA phosphatase assay. [glycerol-U-14C]Dipalmitoyl PA (50 μm, 165,000 dpm/assay) was incubated with the purified recombinant Phm8p for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2% phosphoric acid followed by lipid extraction using chloroform/methanol in a ratio of 1:2 (v/v). The lower chloroform phase was spotted on TLC, and we estimated the formation of diacylglycerol in chloroform/methanol/water (98:2:0.5, v/v/v) as the solvent system. The glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase assay was carried out with the purified recombinant Phm8p by incubating with 50 μm [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate (110,000 dpm/reaction) for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2% phosphoric acid. To this, an equal volume of chloroform was added to precipitate the protein, vortexed, and centrifuged for 2 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was spotted on a TLC. The TLC was developed in 0.1 m ammonium acetate in 67% ethanol (21Veldhuizen R.A. Thompson W. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and quantified using liquid scintillation counter. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as reported previously (22Reddy M.M. Rajasekharan R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 455: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as forward primers to amplify D58N, D60N, D58E, and D60E: 5′-CTTTAATATCGATAACACTTTGTACAGAAAGTCGACGAAGG-3′,5′-CTTTGATATCAATAACACTTTGTACAGAAAGTCGACGAAGG-3′,5′-CTTTGAAACGATAACACTTTGTACAGAAAGTCGACGAAGG-3′, and 5′-CTTTGATATCGAAAACACTTTGTACAGAAAGTCGACGAAGG-3′, respectively. An oligonucleotide sequence with reverse complementary sequence of the forward primer was used as the reverse primer for the respective mutants. The italicized three bases represent the site of mutation, and the underlined sequence indicates the restriction enzyme site created by silent mutagenesis for the purpose of rapid screening of mutants. Amplification was carried out under the following conditions: initial denaturation of template at 98 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles at 98 °C for 1 min (denaturation), 53 °C for 1 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 1 min 15 s (extension). The final extension was done for 20 min at 72 °C. The PCR-amplified mixture was treated with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h to digest methylated parent template and transformed into E. coli DH5α-competent cells. For rapid screening of the mutants, plasmids prepared from the colonies were screened for the presence of restriction sites created in the oligonucleotides by silent mutagenesis. The resultant mutations were confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA. Yeast Transformation and Northern Blotting—Full-length PHM8 cDNA was reamplified using 5′-ATACGGTACCAGCATGGCTATCGCTAAAGATTAC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTCATGATGACTGAACATTGATC-3′ as the reverse primer. The amplified PCR fragment was cloned into yeast expression vector pYES2 at XhoI and KpnI restriction sites. The plasmid containing PHM8 was transformed into yeast cells by the lithium chloride transformation method (23Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on plates containing SC–U (synthetic medium devoid of uracil) minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and complete supplement mixture lacking uracil). To confirm the presence of plasmid, colony PCR was performed using the T7 promoter sequence as forward primer and PHM8 specific reverse primer. The transformed yeast was grown to the late log phase in the SC–U medium containing 2% glucose. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and inoculated at a concentration of A600 = 0.4 in an induction medium (SC–U medium containing 2% galactose). The induction was allowed to proceed for 20 h and was confirmed by Northern blotting. RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit from Qiagen as mentioned by the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (20 μg) was transferred to the nylon membrane and blotted using labeled PHM8 probe. Expression Analysis of Genes That Are Up-regulated as a Result of the PHO Regulatory Pathway—The expression connection available on the Saccharomyces Genome data base (available on the World Wide Web) was used to retrieve microarray expression data. A total of 550 PHO-regulated genes were obtained when the search was limited to genes that are up-regulated 2-fold or more (data not shown). Of these 550 proteins, we identified 27 genes as phosphatases based on their reported functions or the corresponding domains present (supplemental Table 1). Of 27 phosphatases, the functions of three phosphatases have not been characterized so far. First is YBL112C that has a p-loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase domain; second is YNL217W that has a metallodependent phosphoesterase domain that is commonly found in protein phosphatases or polyphosphatases of yeast; and third is YER037W (PHM8), which contains a HAD-like hydrolase domain. It has a DXDXT motif within the HAD-like domain, and the motif is characteristic of Mg2+-dependent phosphatases. Recently discovered lipid phosphate phosphatases (24Newman J.W. Morisseau C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) also contain a HAD-like hydrolase domain. Our interest was to study the role of lipid phosphate phosphatases under phosphate-deprived conditions. Therefore, we have initiated the study to decipher the role of Phm8p in S. cerevisiae under phosphate-deprived conditions. PHM8 gene is located on chromosome V of the yeast genome, and it does not contain any introns. This gene encodes for a protein product consisting of 321 amino acids. A Kyte-Doolittle plot with a window size of 19 amino acids (available on the World Wide Web) suggested that it has no possible transmembrane region and that it has no signal peptide sequence (data not shown). Phosphate Deprivation Affects Phospholipid Turnover—To study whether the phosphatases that are up-regulated during phosphate starvation could play a role in phospholipid metabolism, we performed labeling studies to determine the turnover of phospholipids. Yeast cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for more than three generations and chased for 6 h either in SM + Pi or in SM – Pi medium. Lipids in two-dimensional TLC were identified as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine, PA, and LPA, and a few spots remained unknown. The identification of each phospholipid was based on the comparison of their Rf values with that of the known standards. PC and phosphatidylethanolamine were detected as the major phospholipids, followed by PS, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin (Fig. 1, A and B). Under phosphate-deprived conditions, there was no significant change in the major phospholipids (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a drastic decrease in LPA was observed when the cells were chased in phosphate-deprived medium (Fig. 1C, inset). These results indicated that the LPA is hydrolyzed in response to phosphate deprivation in wild type strain. The spot corresponding to LPA was confirmed by ESI-MS (Fig. 1D). To study the effect of phosphate starvation on LPA levels, we grew the yeast cells overnight and reinoculated into fresh SM + Pi or SM – Pi medium for different times as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected them to ESI-MS analysis. The amount of LPA isolated from cells grown in SM + Pi medium is shown in Fig. 2, A and C. When yeast cells were grown in SM-Pi medium for 2 h, it resulted in a drastic reduction of 18:1 LPA but not in 18:0 LPA (Fig. 2B). However, when the cells were grown for 6 h, both 18:1 and 18:0 LPAs were found to be reduced (Fig. 2D). A 3-fold reduction of LPA levels was observed under phosphate-deprived conditions.FIGURE 2ESI-MS scan of chloroform-soluble fraction from yeast. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete medium until the OD reached 2.8–3.0. Cells (50 A600) were pelleted, washed with sterile water, and suspended either in fresh SM + Pi or SM – Pi medium and grown at 30 °C for different times. Shown is an ESI-MS scan of lipids isolated from wild type yeast cells grown in SM + Pi (A) or SM-Pi (B) for 2 h and an ESI-MS scan of lipids isolated from wild type yeast cells grown in SM + Pi (C) or SM – Pi (D) for 6 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of LPA Phosphatase—[3H]LPA hydrolysis was carried out in vitro using the cytosol of yeast grown in SM + Pi and SM – Pi as the enzyme source, and we found that there was a 2.07-fold increase in LPA-hydrolyzing activity in cytosol from yeast grown in phosphate-deprived synthetic medium. When magnesium was omitted from the assay mixture, there was a 50% reduction in the specific activity (Table 1). We detected a drastic increase in specific activity when cytosol was used and magnesium was included in the assay. From Table 1, it is obvious that magnesium-independent lipid phosphatases contribute to 58% of the total LPA phosphatase activity of the cell. LPP1 and DPP1 are membrane-bound lipid phosphatases that are known to dephosphorylate LPA in a magnesium-independent manner (14Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Dillon D.A. Wu W.I. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Dowhan W. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30548-30553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phm8p contributes to 22% of the total LPA phosphatase activity in the cytosol under normal growth conditions, whereas, under phosphate-starved conditions, it contributes to more than 55% of the total LPA phosphatase activity in the cytosol. Phm8p is responsible for 75% of the magnesium-dependent LPA phosphatase activity in the cytosol.TABLE 1Effect of phm8Δ mutation on LPA phosphatase activity of S. cerevisiaeStrain typePhosphate in synthetic mediumSpecific activityWith Mg2+Without Mg2+nmol/min/mgWild type Cytosol+0.27 ± 0.0180.15 ± 0.01 Membranes+0.16 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.01 Cytosol-0.56 ± 0.0460.24 ± 0.016 Membranes-0.13 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.008phm8Δ Cytosol+0.17 ± 0.0090.14 ± 0.01 Membranes+0.14 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.006 Cytosol-0.25 ± 0.0180.23 ± 0.012 Membranes-0.11 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.008 Open table in a new tab In addition, we assayed for LPA-hydrolyzing ability of both wild type and phm8Δ cells, grown in normal SM + Pi and phosphate-deprived synthetic medium (Table 1). The LPA phosphatase activity in the presence of magnesium was drastically reduced in phm8Δ mutant when compared with the wild type BY4741 cells, suggesting that PHM8 is responsible for the increased magnesium-dependent LPA phosphatase activity under phosphate-deprived conditions. To authenticate the involvement of PHM8 in dephosphorylation of LPA during phosphate starvation, we have extracted lipids from the phm8Δ mutant yeast cells grown in complete synthetic medium and phosphate-deprived medium that were subjected to ESI-MS analyses (Fig. 3, A and B). It was observed under phosphate-deprived conditions that there was a 1.4-fold reduction in LPA levels. To discover the function of PHM8 up-regulation during phosphate starvation, we have overexpressed it in E. coli and performed in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate followed by IPTG induction. We found a decrease in LPA concentration upon induction of Phm8p; E. coli cells harboring PHO12, a repressible acid phosphatase, were used as a control. There was no significant change in the amount of other phospholipids upon induction with IPTG (Fig. 4). Characterization of Recombinant Phm8p—Phm8p was overexpressed in E. coli by inducing with IPTG (Fig. 5A). Recombinant Phm8p was purified using Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 5B), and it was confirmed by probing with anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5C). The purified protein showed Mg2+-dependent LPA phosphatase activity. We observed the time-dependent formation of [3H]monoacylglycerol when the recombinant enzyme was incubated in the presence of [3H]LPA (Fig. 6A). The activity was greatly enhanced by the addition of magnesium, whereas cobalt and manganese showed 76 and 48% activity as compared with magnesium-dependent activity, respectively (Table 2). It exhibited a dose-dependent requirement for MgCl2 with maximum activity at a final concentration of 2 mm (Fig. 6B). We did not observe LPA phosphatase activity in the absence of Mg2+ ions or in the presence of EDTA, Ca2+, or Zn2+. The enzyme reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 34 ± 2.07 μm (data not shown). The addition of Triton X-100 to the assay mixture resulted in an apparent inhibition of enzyme activity, characteristic of surface dilut"

Using cultivated mouse astrocytes, we show here that C3bot increases both uptake and secretion of glutamate. The enhanced glutamate uptake is initiated by an NFκB-dependent up-regulation of the glial glutamate transporter 1 that is efficaciously sorted to the plasma membrane. The increase in cytosolic glutamate concentration promotes vesicular glutamate storage in astrocytes treated with C3bot. Parallel to the increased storage, C3-induced impairment of Rho-dependent pathways strongly enhances Ca2+-dependent secretion of glutamate. This is accompanied by higher levels of the SNARE protein synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin inactivation by botulinum neurotoxin D almost completely inhibits Ca2+-dependent glutamate secretion triggered by C3bot, indicating that the enhanced release of glutamate mainly originates from exocytosis. In addition, C3bot increases the exocytosis/endocytosis turnover, as analyzed by the stimulated accumulation of the fluorescent dye AM1-43. The release of glutamine, the main metabolite of glutamate, is only moderately affected by C3bot. In conclusion, inhibition of Rho-dependent pathways shifts astrocytes to a secretory active stage in which they may modulate neuronal excitability.

In conclusion, inhibition of Rho-dependent pathways shifts astrocytes to a secretory active stage in which they may modulate neuronal excitability. Brain function is based on communication between neurons as well as on the interaction of neurons and their collaborating glial cells. Glutamatergic synapses, for example, are ensheathed by glial processes isolating individual synapses from one another (1Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8751-8757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ventura R. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of the ubiquitous amino acid glutamate both as a metabolite and, even more importantly, as the principal excitatory transmitter of the central nervous system requires efficient mechanisms to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio and to prevent neuronal damage caused by high excitotoxic extracellular glutamate concentrations (3Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 8: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (4165) Google Scholar). Crucial elements for limiting the action of glutamate as a neurotransmitter and to maintain low concentrations in the extracellular space of the brain are the high affinity glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 expressed at the plasma membrane of astrocytes and Bergmann glia cells (4Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Kuncl R.W. Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Wang Y. Schielke J.P. Welty D.F.

In recent years evidence has accumulated that astrocytes, besides their capacity to take up glutamate at the plasma membrane, also contain a vesicular compartment equipped with glutamate transporter subtypes for vesicular storage (VGLUTs) 2The abbreviations used are: VGLUTglutamate transporter subtype for vesicular storageC3botC. botulinum C3 transferasePDCl-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acidDHKdihydrokainic acidPDTCammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamateBoNt/Dbotulinum neurotoxin DGFAPglial fibrillary acidic protein. 2The abbreviations used are: VGLUTglutamate transporter subtype for vesicular storageC3botC. botulinum C3 transferasePDCl-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acidDHKdihydrokainic acidPDTCammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamateBoNt/Dbotulinum neurotoxin DGFAPglial fibrillary acidic protein. (6Montana V. Ni Y. Sunjara V. Hua X. Parpura V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 11: 2633-2642Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Since then, many groups have shown that glutamate can be transported into and released from these vesicles by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (7Bezzi P. Gundersen V. Galbete J.L. Seifert G. Steinhauser C. Pilati E. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 6: 613-620Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 8Chen X. Wang L. Zhou Y. Zheng L.H. Zhou Z. J.

Other, nonvesicular mechanisms of glutamate release from astrocytes like efflux through volume-sensitive channels have also been described (10Takano T. Kang J. Jaiswal J.K. Simon S.M. Lin J.H. Yu Y.

Besides their role in responding to and modulating synaptic transmission by glutamate uptake and release (11Iino M. Goto K. Kakegawa W. Okado H. Sudo M. Ishiuchi S. Miwa A. Takayasu Y. Saito I.

Uptake of glutamate is linked to conversion into glutamine by astroglial glutamine synthetase, followed by the efflux into the extracellular space. Glutamine can be then taken up by neurons and can be reconverted into glutamate to replenish neuronal glutamate and GABA pools (15Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Hyder F. Shulman R.G. Annu. Rev.

Expression and function of high affinity glutamate transporters have been reported to be highly variable. Various substances and conditions result in altered gene expression, protein levels, and activity of GLAST and GLT-1 (for a review, see Refs. 16Gegelashvili G. Schousboe A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 1: 6-15Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar and 17Sattler R. Rothstein J.D. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2006; 175: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Largely unexplored, however, is the regulation of glutamate transport and subsequent release by small GTPases, such as the Rho family proteins. Well established, on the other hand, is the important role of Rho proteins during fundamental morphological changes astrocytes can undergo. After inhibition of Rho-dependent pathways, cultivated astrocytes acquire a stellate morphology (18Ramakers G.J. Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 2: 252-262Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Abe K. Misawa M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 1: 99-104Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Höltje M. Hoffmann A. Hofmann F. Mucke C. Grosse G. Van Rooijen N. Kettenmann H. Just I. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 5: 1237-1248Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was tempting to investigate whether these distinct morphological changes are accompanied by alterations of major astrocytic functional tasks, such as glutamate storage and glutamate/glutamine release. In order to gain insights into the impact of Rho signaling on glutamate transporter regulation, we used Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (C3bot), which specifically ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates small GTPases of the Rho subfamily (RhoA, -B, and -C; see Refs. 21Boquet P. Munro P. Fiorentini C. Just I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Aktories K. Just I. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Since inhibition of RhoA by C3 proteins has proven to be beneficial for axon outgrowth during development or regeneration (24Fischer D. Petkova V. Thanos S. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 40: 8726-8740Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Bertrand J. Di Polo A. McKerracher L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 1: 65-72Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we were particularly interested to investigate possible effects of C3bot on astrocyte functions that are known to be associated with neurodegenerating diseases when malfunctioning. This is in fact the case for astrocytic glutamate transport systems in, for example, Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (5Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 1: 1-105Crossref Scopus (3672) Google Scholar). Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from NMRI mice brains between postnatal days 2 and 3. After removal of meninges, brains were mechanically dissociated in Hanks' buffered salt solution by fire-polished Pasteur pipettes and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min. Cells were redissociated in Hanks' buffered salt solution, and the procedure was repeated two times using smaller pipette tip diameters. Cells were first seeded onto 6-well plates (3.5-cm diameter/well) pretreated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Astrocytes were incubated at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Microglial cells were repeatedly detached from the astrocyte monolayer by shaking off. After 5 days in culture with a change of medium two times, cells were harvested and recultured in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well with or without glass coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine. Cultures treated either with or without C. botulinum C3 protein (80 nm final concentration) were kept under serum-free conditions for the indicated time periods. C3bot was expressed as recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichiacoli TG1 harboring the respective DNA fragment in the plasmid pGEX-2T (see Ref. 20Höltje M. Hoffmann A.

A monoclonal antibody against RhoA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). α-Tubulin was detected using a monoclonal antibody obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 as well as a polyclonal anti-serum against VGLUT3 were obtained from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany).

Cells were fixed with 4% formaline for 15 min and subsequently permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature using 0.3% Triton X-100 dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Astrocytes were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized using goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 488 IgG for green fluorescence. Goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was applied for red fluorescence. Fluorescence was visualized either by using an upright Leica DMLB epifluorescence equipment or by using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (see below). For acquisition of images, a Leica TCS SL confocal laser-scanning microscope using a ×40 oil immersion objective was used. Fluorescent dyes were excited at a wavelength of 488 nm (green fluorescence) and 543 nm (red fluorescence), respectively. Fluorescence from green and red channels was collected sequentially using two filters at 498-535 and 587-666 nm, respectively. Images were captured at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. Astrocyte homogenates were loaded onto 10 or 12% gels (40 μg/lane) for SDS-PAGE. Protein was immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, including 5% low fat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed overnight at 4 °C. After washing with blocking solution, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit, anti-guinea pig, or anti-mouse IgG; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Visualization was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). After 10 days in culture, astrocytes grown on coverslips were transfected with RhoA wild type, RhoA V14, RhoA N19, Rac1 wild type, Rac1 V12, or Rac1 N17 DNA cloned into pEGFP-C1 expression vector using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression time was kept at 24 h. Cells were fixed and counterstained for NFκB or GLT-1 expression. Transfection efficiency was between 10 and 15%. Effects on NFκB translocation as well as GLT-1 expression were quantified by counting transfected cells within individual fields of view using a ×20 objective. Typically, cells from 10 fields of view (representing a total of 80-120 cells) per condition were analyzed for the respective phenotype within single experiments. Uptake—Usually, for glutamate uptake, astrocytes grown in 24-well plates were incubated with 50 μm glutamate (applied as a combination of both tritiated and unlabeled glutamic acid) for 1 h with or without additives, as indicated, at 37 °C in serum-free culture medium. For kinetic analysis of transport activity, the uptake time was shortened to 10 min. Graph Pad Prism software (San Diego, CA) was used for nonlinear regression and transformation of data. After removal of the medium and repeated washing (three times) with ice-cold Krebs-Hepes buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 15 mm Hepes, and 1.2 mm MgSO4 adjusted to pH 7.4, cells were lysed with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 42 °C. Astrocyte lysates were subjected to liquid scintillation counting for determination of radioactivity. Values were adjusted to protein content. Secretion—Astrocytes were loaded as described for 1 h with 50 μm glutamate. After removal of the medium and repeated washing, cultures were incubated with Krebs-Hepes buffer containing either no additives, the calcium-ionophore ionomycin (1.3 μm), or ATP (2 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Supernatants were collected, subjected to liquid scintillation counting, and adjusted to protein content of the lysed cells. Radioactive glutamine and glutamate released in culture supernatants were separated by ion exchange chromatography, using small (5 × 50-mm) columns with a strong anion exchanger (Q Sepharose® Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (sample buffer). Columns were loaded with 500 μl (2 × 250 μl) of culture supernatant samples, diluted in sample buffer containing 10 mm unlabeled glutamine and glutamate as carrier substances. After six washes with sample buffer (500 μl each), the columns were eluted with six 500-μl volumes of 200 mm acetate buffer, pH 3.7 (elution buffer). 500-μl fractions were collected, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Complete separation of glutamine from glutamate was verified in control experiments, using two columns loaded with either 20 mm glutamine or glutamate, respectively. Fractions were collected, and amine groups were determined photometrically at 420 nm using the TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) method (26Fields R. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). AM1-43 represents a fixable version of the cationic styryl dye FM1-43 (27Renger J.J. Egles C. Liu G. Neuron. 2001; 2: 469-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cultivated astrocytes were loaded for 1 min with 4 μm of AM1-43 dissolved in Krebs-Hepes buffer containing no additives or 1.3 μm ionomycin to stimulate Ca2+-dependent release at room temperature. After a single washing step, astrocytes were incubated for 4 min with a 0.5 μm concentration of the quencher agent SCAS to remove background staining. Following quenching, cells were fixed as described above, followed by an additional 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining procedure. For quantification of fluorescent spots, AM1-43 puncta of 50-250 pixels (0.57-2.86 μm2) detected within individual view fields of 136 × 108 μm were counted by using Scion Image software. Counts were adjusted to cell numbers as revealed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. In a single experiment, between 400 and 500 cells were analyzed per condition. Experiments were run at least three times. Uptake and secretion assays were determined in triplicates for a single condition. In general, values are expressed as means ± S.D. from one representative experiment if not stated otherwise. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test, and p values below 0.05% were considered significant. The effect of C3bot on the glutamate uptake was studied by incubation of astrocytes pretreated with 80 nm C3bot for 6, 12, 24, or 72 h with 50 μm [3H]glutamate. The specificity of glutamate uptake was confirmed by inhibition of the plasma membrane glutamate transporter activity by PDC or threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid. C3bot enhanced glutamate uptake by a factor of 1.7 after 24 h compared with control conditions (Fig. 1A). After 72 h of C3bot treatment, glutamate uptake was increased by more than 2-fold compared with control conditions. Kinetic analysis of glutamate uptake revealed a higher maximal transport velocity Vmax and an increased substrate affinity indicated by a lower Km value in C3bot-treated cultures (Fig. 1B). Next we looked for the expression of GLAST and GLT-1, the two high affinity transporter subtypes mediating astrocytic glutamate transport at the plasma membrane. By using confocal laser-scanning microscopy, it became evident that GLAST was expressed at high levels at the plasma membrane of virtually all GFAP-positive control cells (Fig. 2A). Conversely, GLT-1 expression was hardly detectable. Upon incubation with 80 nm C3bot, astrocytes changed their morphology toward a stellate shape, as described before (20Höltje M. Hoffmann A. Hofmann F. Mucke C. Grosse G. Van Rooijen N. Kettenmann H. Just I. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 5: 1237-1248Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After C3bot treatment for 72 h, GLAST expression was still observable, but GLT-1 expression was strongly up-regulated (Fig. 2B). Both transporters were detectable also at the fine elongated processes extending from the cell body. To verify whether the C3bot-induced increased glutamate uptake was mainly mediated by GLT-1, astrocytes were preincubated with DHK, a selective GLT-1 inhibitor. Preincubation with 250 or 500 μm DHK for 30 min had no effect on the subsequent glutamate uptake, whereas the enhanced C3bot-induced uptake was exactly reduced to control levels (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Enhanced C3bot-induced glutamate uptake is mediated by GLT-1. A, astrocytes cultivated under control conditions were fixed and double-stained for GFAP and GLAST or GLT-1. Photomicrographs were taken by confocal imaging. Strong GLAST immunoreactivity was detected mainly at the plasma membrane in virtually all GFAP-positive cells. In contrast, GLT-1 immunoreactivity was hardly detectable in astrocytes. B, astrocytes incubated for 3 days with 80 nm of C3bot were fixed and stained for the same antigens. Astrocyte morphology had changed to a stellate appearance. Under these conditions, both GLAST and GLT-1 were detectable in GFAP-positive cells and also localized to very thin processes. C, incubation with DHK prevents C3bot-mediated enhanced [3H]glutamate uptake. Prior to the uptake procedure, astrocytes were preincubated for 30 min with two concentrations of DHK. In control cultures, DHK had no effect on glutamate uptake. Conversely, higher glutamate uptake in C3bot-treated cultures was reduced to control levels by DHK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcription of the glt-1 gene is under the control of the NFκB transcription factor (28Rodriguez-Kern A. Gegelashvili M. Schousboe A. Zhang J. Sung L. Gegelashvili G. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 4: 363-370Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To check for a possible effect of C3bot on NFκB activity, we studied the cellular distribution of NFκB in astrocytes. In control cultures, NFκB was mainly in the cytoplasm, detected by immunolabeling using an antibody against the p65 subunit and confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A). In astrocytes treated with C3bot for 72 h, a clear shift of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus took place. The C3bot-induced shift was prevented by PDTC (10 μm), an inhibitor of NFκB signaling. Noteworthy, PDTC did not affect C3bot-induced shape changes. To further check whether impairment of Rho activity results in NFκB translocation into the nucleus, we transfected astrocyte cultures with plasmids encoding RhoA proteins. No alterations of the cytoplasmatic localization of NFκB were detected when astrocytes were transfected with either wild type RhoA (not shown) or constitutively active RhoA V14 (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, 80% of astrocytes that expressed dominant negative RhoA N19 exhibited the nuclear shift of NFκB. As expected, RhoA N19-expressing cells tended toward development of cellular processes. In sum, the inactivation of Rho by C3bot treatment and the transfection studies clearly indicated a negative regulation of NFκB activity by RhoA in astrocytes. To address the question of whether enhanced GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake is based on the Rho-NFκB signaling or is a mere cytoskeletal response, glutamate uptake was performed in C3bot-treated cells in the presence of the NFκB inhibitor PDTC. Cultures that were treated with this combination still exhibited a clear stellate morphology but showed only a moderately increased glutamate uptake that did not reach C3bot levels (Fig. 4A). In parallel, we applied the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 μm) to our cultures to study whether this RhoA downstream effector that mainly regulates actin dynamics is involved. Besides changes toward a stellate morphology, glutamate uptake itself, however, only reached slightly enhanced levels. Additionally, we used the sponge toxin latrunculin B, an F-actin depolymerizing agent that acts independently from Rho pathways (29Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 3: 127-144Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Astrocytes incubated with 1 μm latrunculin B developed the expected stellate morphology but failed to show any significantly enhanced glutamate uptake (Fig. 4A). To check whether the effects of PDTC on C3bot-enhanced glutamate uptake levels were due to an inhibition of glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-1 expression were compared in control cells, cells treated with C3bot alone or in combination with PDTC (Fig. 4B). Under control conditions, GLT-1 was detectable at very low amounts but was found to be strongly up-regulated (2.7-fold) by C3bot. The addition of PDTC prevented the C3bot-triggered up-regulation to a large extent. GLAST levels were only moderately lowered by C3bot. To further support the up-regulation of GLT-1 by a Rho-dependent mechanism, we transfected astrocytes with RhoA constructs (Fig. 4C). In line with the results shown for NFκB (Fig. 3, B and C), only expression of dominant negative RhoA N19 was able to induce GLT-1 up-regulation in the majority (74%) of transfected cells. Again, many astrocytes transfected with RhoA N19 showed a branched morphology. In addition, we performed transfection studies with wild type, constitutively active and dominant negative Rac1 (not shown). No pronounced effects on GLT-1 expression were detected, confirming the specificity of RhoA effects (Fig. 4C). Besides their high affinity plasma membrane glutamate transporters, astrocytes harbor vesicular compartments capable of glutamate storage mediated by the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 to -3. To check the C3bot effect on the vesicular transport systems we examined VGLUT expression. VGLUT1, -2, and -3 were detectable in a punctate distribution in a large proportion of GFAP-positive astrocytes, as shown by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5A). VGLUT-immunoreactive puncta were found all over the cells, including the processes in cells treated with C3bot. In parallel, VGLUT expression was analyzed by Western blotting. No alterations in total protein levels of VGLUT1, -2, and -3 by C3bot were detectable (Fig. 5B). These findings, however, do not exclude possible changes in VGLUT activity by regulatory mechanisms apart from an altered protein synthesis. To investigate the contribution of vesicular uptake to the overall glutamate uptake, astrocytes were incubated with bafilomycin A1 prior to the uptake procedure. Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the vacuolar ATPase activity and therefore prevents acidification of storage vesicles. In control cultures, a treatment with 1 μm bafilomycin A1 for 1 h inhibited glutamate uptake by 25% (Fig. 5C). Remarkably, the C3bot-induced enhanced glutamate uptake was reduced by 40%, indicating a higher vesicular transport. Glutamate taken up by astrocytes can be converted to glutamine by the astroglial glutamine synthetase or may also be secreted again into the extracellular space. To test whether inhibition of Rho pathways by C3bot affects glutamate release and the putative co-release of glutamine, we applied the following stimulation paradigm. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin raises intracellular Ca2+ levels, thereby stimulating release mechanisms. In a first attempt, release of radioactivity from control cells as well as from C3bot-treated cells (with or without the addition of PDTC) was analyzed irrespective of the nature of the released substances. In control cultures incubated with [3H]glutamate for 1 h, ionomycin (1.3 μm) raised basal release from 4 to 4.9 nmol/mg protein (Fig. 6A). After C3bot treatment (72 h, 80 nm), release following stimulation was enhanced by a factor of 1.8 from 7.9 nmol/mg protein (control) to 14.3 nmol/mg protein (ionomycin). The addition of PDTC during incubation with C3bot reduced the enhanced ionomycin-stimulated release almost completely to control levels. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of C3bot on ATP-stimulated release, a physiological compound that is well known to stimulate glutamate release from astrocytes. Comparable with the data for ionomycin, incubation with C3bot also enhanced both basal and especially ATP-stimulated release (Fig. 6B). To address the question of whether a reverse transport by plasma membrane transporters might contribute to the enhanced release, we incubated our cultures with PDC (1 mm) for 30 min"

Activation of the ERK signaling pathway prevented the up-regulation of GFAP expression. Incubation of cells with retinoic acid in the absence of mitogens enhanced basal neuronal differentiation that was accompanied by an up-regulation of neuronal gene expression and a down-regulation of GFAP and nestin expression. Retinoic acid treatment changed the histone code of neuronal genes encoding synapsin I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmins II, IV, and VII from a transcriptionally inactive (methylation of lysine residue 9 of histone 3) to a transcriptionally active state (methylation of lysine residue 4 of histone 3). In contrast, the chromatin structure of the GFAP gene is transformed from a transcriptionally active state in unstimulated neural stem cells to a transcriptionally inactive state in retinoic acid-stimulated cells. Additionally, retinoic acid treatment reduced the binding of histone deacetylase-1 and REST to neuronal genes. The inhibition of histone deacetylase activity induced expression of genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins in unstimulated neural stem cells. Similarly, neuronal gene transcription was enhanced following expression of a mutant of REST that contained a transcriptional activation domain. These data indicate that in undifferentiated human neural stem cells, neuronal genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins are accessible for the REST mutant and are sensitive to enhanced histone acetylation.

Neural stem cells are characterized by their self-renewal ability and their capacity to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the major cell types of the central nervous system. Neural stem cells have been isolated from murine brain tissue, in particular from the subventricular zone or the subgranular layer of the hippocampus, i.e. brain regions exhibiting neurogenesis in the adult. Following dissection of the tissue, the dissociated cells are cultured in the presence of the mitogens epidermal growth factor (EGF) 2The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseERestrogen receptorGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinNRSEneural-restrictive silencer element4OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenRESTRE-1 silencing transcription factorTSAtrichostatin AbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorRTreverse transcriptase. and bFGF, giving rise to a mixed population of neural progenitor and stem cells (1Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). The use of neural stem cells as a cellular model to analyze differentiation processes requires the generation of a pure population of neural stem cells in a large enough quantity. This is, in particular for human neural stem cells, no easy task. It is in general difficult to get a reasonable number of human stem cells that maintain a stable phenotype during growth. Therefore, immortalized neural stem cell lines have been established that provide cells that can be cultured for the long term in a proliferative and undifferentiated state (2Kitchens D.L. Snyder E.Y. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Sah D.W.Y. Ray J. Gage F.H. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 574-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used HNSC.100 neural stem cells that have been generated by infection of human neural progenitor cells, derived from the diencephalic and telencephalic region of a 10-10.5-week gestational age aborted human fetus, with a v-Myc-encoding retrovirus (4Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martínez-Serrano A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Like primary neural stem cells, HNSC.100 neural stem cells require mitogens (EGF, bFGF) in the growth medium. Grafting experiments into adult rat brain revealed that the stem cells integrated in a nondisruptive manner into the surrounding tissue (5Rubio F.J. Bueno C. Villa A. Navarro B. Martínez-Serrano A.

The fact that neural stem cells retain their potential to differentiate into the major cell types of the central nervous system lets them be considered as a useful cellular model system for studying the underlying cellular differentiation process. This includes the identification of transcription factors required for differentiation into a particular neural cell type as well as the analysis of the epigenetic changes that occur during differentiation. Chromatin remodeling, including differentiation-dependent changes in the histone methylation pattern, is known to occur during development and induces cell type-specific gene transcription. Using undifferentiated and differentiated human neural stem cells, we have investigated the regulation of a group of neuronal genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins. Synaptic vesicles are the key organelle for neurotransmission and neuronal function. Thus, expression of synaptic vesicle proteins mirrors a gain of neuronal character of a particular cellular population. From the genetic point of view, we analyzed the role of the transcription factor REST (6Thiel G. Hohl M. Thiel G. Hohl M. Transcription Factors in the Nervous System - Development, Brain Function and Disease. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006: 113-128Google Scholar, 7Ooi L. Wood I.C. Nat. Rev.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that induces transcriptional repression via recruitment of histone deacetylases and via gene silencing involving the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2, hetero-chromatin protein-1 (HP-1), G9a histone methyltransferase, and C-terminal-binding proteins CtBP1 and CtBP2 (6Thiel G. Hohl M. Thiel G. Hohl M. Transcription Factors in the Nervous System - Development, Brain Function and Disease. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006: 113-128Google Scholar, 7Ooi L. Wood I.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Ballas N. Mandel G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 15: 1-7Google Scholar). Both the cellular concentration of REST and the cell type-specific structure of the chromatin are key factors in determining whether neuronal genes are transcribed. Most interestingly, REST has recently been shown to regulate the transition from pluripotent to neural stem/progenitor cells and from progenitor cells to mature neurons (10Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G. Cell. 2005; 121: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Here, we show that HNSC.100 neural stem cells differentiate along the astrocytic lineage when the mitogens EGF and bFGF are withdrawn from the culture medium. The down-regulation of the ERK signaling pathway is crucial for the differentiation into astrocytes. HNSC.100 neural stem cells differentiate along the neuronal lineage when the mitogens are removed from the culture medium and retinoic acid is added. The differentiation is accompanied by a change of the histone code of neuronal genes. While neuronal genes are embedded in a chromatin structure characterized by methylated lysine residue 9 of histone 3 in undifferentiated stem cells, retinoic acid treatment triggers the methylation of lysine residue 4 of histone 3, a mark for open, actively transcribed genes. Accordingly, neuronal genes are expressed. Moreover, retinoic acid treatment leads to a reduced binding of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and REST to neuronal genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins. We finally show that a dominant-positive mutant of REST is able to bind to neuronal genes in undifferentiated neural stem cells, indicating that these genes are accessible for transcription factors, despite the nucleosomal microenvironment characterized by the methylated lysine residue 9 of histone 3. Materials—EGF and bFGF were purchased from Chemicon, Hampshire, UK (cat. no. GF001 and GF003). Trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma T8552) was used at a concentration of 25 ng/ml dissolved in Me2SO. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT, Sigma H7904) was dissolved in ethanol and used at a concentration of 1 μm.

For differentiation, one million HNSC.100 neural stem cells were seeded in 100-mm plates for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in culture medium lacking EGF and bFGF to initiate differentiation. To enhance neuronal differentiation, we added retinoic acid (1 μm) to the culture medium. The medium was changed every 2 days. Quantification of Neurite Outgrowth—Neurite outgrowth of retinoic acid-stimulated HNSC.100 neural stem cells was quantified using the LUCIA 4.21 program (Laboratory Imaging Ltd). At least 100 cells were analyzed for each condition. The data are depicted using GraphPad Prism 3.02 (Prism). The Student's t test was used to determine the p value. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—The synapsin I promoter/luciferase reporter genes pSyIuc and pSyIlucΔNRSE have been described (14Lietz M. Bach K. Thiel G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription units present in these plasmids contain synapsin I promoter sequence from -422 to +47 either with or without the REST-binding site termed neural-restrictive silencing elements (NRSE). The reporter plasmid pSyINRSE2luc contains the luciferase gene under control of a minimal promoter that consists of two copies of the NRSE, derived from the human synapsin I promoter, a TATA box derived from the HIV long terminal repeat, and the initiator element from the adenovirus major late promoter. HNSC.100 cells were transfected using the calcium coprecipitation procedure. Each experiment included four separate transfections for each experimental setting, and the experiments have been repeated at least twice giving consistent results. Retroviral Gene Transfer—The retroviral vector encoding a positive-dominant mutant of REST, fused to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor, has been described (15Hohl M. Thiel G. Eur. J.

To detect in vivo binding of DP-REST:ER to DNA, we used M2-agarose (Sigma, A2220) that interacts with the FLAG epitope of the REST mutant as described (15Hohl M. Thiel G. Eur. J.

Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope (Sigma, F3165), at 1:3000 dilution in TBS. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Marker Genes in Human HNSC.100 Neural Stem Cells—We compared the expression of tissue-specific marker genes in undifferentiated HNSC.100 neural stem cells, human 293T embryonic kidney cells, and dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. HNSC.100 stem cells express nestin, as previously described (4Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martínez-Serrano A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), a marker of neuroepithelial progenitors and stem cells (Fig. 1). Low levels of nestin were also detected in 293T and SH-SY5Y cells. Expression of GFAP, a marker of astrocytes, was observed in HNSC.100 cells. A trace amount of GFAP mRNA was also seen in SH-SY5Y cells, and none was found in 293T cells. The neuronal genes encoding synapsin I and synaptophysin were only expressed in neuroblastoma cells. Similar results were obtained for the genes encoding synaptotagmins II, IV, and VII (data not shown). We also measured the mRNA levels of REST, a transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes. As expected, highest levels of REST were observed in non-neuronal 293T cells. Considerable amounts of REST were also detected in undifferentiated HNSC.100 neural stem cells, and may therefore explain why synapsin I, synaptophysin, and other neuronal genes are not expressed. Trace levels of REST were seen in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which already express neuronal genes constitutively. These data show that undifferentiated HNSC.100 stem cells express stem/progenitor cell and glia markers and are not yet differentiated into neurons. Differentiation Potential of HNSC.100 Neural Stem Cells—The simplest method for induction of neural stem cell differentiation is mitogen withdrawal (1Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). HNSC.100 neural stem cells require EGF and bFGF in the growth medium. Removal of the mitogens stops the cell cycle and induces differentiation (4Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martínez-Serrano A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It has been reported that markers of astrocytic and neuronal linages such as GFAP, MAP2, and β-tubulin III are up-regulated 12 days after removal of EGF and bFGF. In addition, the cells dramatically change their morphology (4Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martínez-Serrano A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We cultured HNSC.100 stem cells for 12 days in medium lacking EGF and bFGF, isolated the RNA and analyzed marker gene expression via RT-PCR. Fig. 2, A and B reveal that GFAP expression is up-regulated in differentiated HNSC.100 neural stem cells. Nestin expression is reduced accordingly. Previous studies have shown that mitogen withdrawal is sufficient enough to generate functional (possibly immature) neurons from immortalized hNSCs, as evaluated by means of protein markers, gene expression data, neurotransmitter production, and functional studies, like neurotransmitter release upon depolarization (21Liste I. García-García E. Martínez-Serrano A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10786-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Liste I. García-García E. Bueno C. Martínez-Serrano A. Cell Death Diff. 2007; 14: 1880-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the differentiation induction by mitogen withdrawal did not activate expression of mature neuronal marker genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins (Fig. 2, E and F), even though the expression of the transcription factor REST was reduced (data not shown). Retinoic Acid Triggers Transcription of Genes Encoding Synaptic Vesicle Proteins in Human Neural Stem Cells—Treatment of neural stem cells with retinoic acid enhances neuronal differentiation (23Hsieh J. Aimone J.B. Kaspar B.K. Kuwabara T. Nakashima K. Gage F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Shi Y. Lie D.C. Taupin P. Nakashima K. Ray J. Yu R.T. Gage F.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We therefore removed the mitogens EGF and bFGF from the growth medium and added retinoic acid for 12 days. The cells changed their morphology and neurite outgrowth occurred as depicted in Fig. 2C. The quantification of neurite length is shown in Fig. 2D. Furthermore, we detected expression of neuronal genes encoding the synaptic vesicle proteins synapsin I, synaptophysin, synaptoporin, synaptobrevin 2, and synaptotagmins I, II, IV, and VII (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast, expression of nestin and GFAP was shut-off in retinoic acid-treated human stem cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Together, these data indicate that retinoic acid enhances neuronal differentiation of human HNSC.100 neural stem cells leading to the expression of synaptic vesicle proteins. Activation of the ERK Signaling Pathway Blocks the Differentiation of Neural Stem Cells into the Astrocytic Lineage—The experiment depicted in Fig. 2, A and B revealed that withdrawal of EGF and bFGF induced the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP in HNSC.100 neural stem cells. EGF and bFGF are ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases. Stimulation of these receptors induces the ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase C signaling pathways. We tested the impact of the ERK signaling pathway in gliogenesis using HNSC.100 cells expressing an inducible mutant of Raf-1, termed ΔRaf-1:ER. The characterization of the HNSC.100ΔRaf-1:ER cell line will be described elsewhere. 3M. Ekici, A. Martínez-Serrano, and G. Thiel, manuscript in preparation. The cells were cultured in medium with or without EGF and bFGF. In addition, the ΔRaf-1/estrogen receptor fusion protein was activated by 4OHT. Fig. 3, A and B show that activation of the ERK signaling pathway, via 4OHT-triggered activation of ΔRaf-1:ER, blocked the differentiation into glia cells as a result of mitogen withdrawal. In 4OHT-treated cells, the withdrawal of mitogens did not enhance GFAP expression. Similarly, expression of nestin was not reduced. We conclude that a down-regulation of the ERK signaling pathway is essential for neural stem cells to differentiate along the astrocytic/GFAP+ lineage. Epigenetic Configuration of Genes Encoding Synaptic Vesicle Proteins in Undifferentiated and Retinoic Acid-treated Neural Stem Cells—The fact that treatment of HNSC.100 neural stem cells with retinoic acid induced the expression of synaptic proteins suggests that genetic and/or epigenetic changes occurred in the environment of these genes leading to neuronal gene transcription. We first analyzed the epigenetic configuration of a group of neuronal genes in HNSC.100 human neural stem cells that encode synaptic vesicle proteins and have been described to be regulated by the transcription factor REST (10Ballas N.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We analyzed epigenetic markers that differentiate between actively transcribed or silenced genes. An epigenetic marker for actively transcribed genes is methylation of lysine residue 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) while methylation of lysine residue 9 of histone 3 (H3K9) functions as an epigenetic marker for silenced genes (30Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The histone 3 methylation status of neuronal genes encoding synapsin I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin II, IV, and VII was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies directed either against the trimethylated form of histone H3K4 or against the dimethylated form of histone H3K9. The precipitated DNA was analyzed with primers that amplified the region of synaptic vesicle-encoding genes, encompassing the REST-binding site (NRSE). The results show that in undifferentiated neural stem cells the REST-binding sites of the synapsin I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin II, IV, and VII genes are embedded into a nucleosomal context having histone H3 molecules carrying methylated lysine residue 9, a marker that is linked to a condensed form of chromatin and gene silencing. Treatment of the cells with retinoic acid in the absence of mitogens in the culture medium triggered the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine residue 4 (Fig. 4A), a methylation mark linked to open chromatin and actively transcribed genes. We also observed enhanced dimethylation of H3K4 (data not shown). Additionally, methylation on lysine residue 9 of histone 3 (H3K9) was still observed. As a control, we analyzed the epigenetic profile of the GFAP gene. GFAP is expressed in undifferentiated human neural stem cells and retinoic acid treatment blocked GFAP gene transcription (Fig. 2, A and B). Accordingly, we observed that the proximal region of the GFAP 5′-upstream region is embedded into a chromosomal context with histone H3 molecules methylated on lysine residue 4. Retinoic acid treatment shifted the methylation pattern to methylation of lysine residue 9 of histone H3. We conclude that treatment of neural stem cells with retinoic acid induced a chromatin environment for genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins that is connected with an open configuration and active gene transcription. In contrast, in retinoic acid-treated human neural stem cells the chromatin environment of the GFAP gene is indicative of gene silencing. These data indicate that gliogenesis and neurogenesis are mutually opposing pathways. We compared the epigenetic profiles of genes encoding synaptic vesicle proteins obtained in undifferentiated and retinoic acid differentiated neural stem cells with those in keratinocytes and neuroblastoma cells. Keratinocytes do not express synaptic vesicle proteins. Accordingly, the genes encoding synapsin I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmins II, IV, and VII are located in a chromatin environment characterized by histone 3 molecules carrying methylated lysine 9 residues. In contrast, these genes are found in neuroblastoma cells in nucleosomes carrying both methylated H3K4 and H3K9 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the methylation pattern observed in keratinocytes resembles that found in undifferentiated neural stem cells. Similarly, the chromatin architecture seen in neuroblastoma cells is similar to the one found in retinoic acid differentiated neural stem cells. Transcription of Genes Encoding Synaptic Vesicle Proteins as a Result of Histone Deacetylase Inhibition—The acetylation state of histones is regulated by the coordinate activity of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Deacetylation of histones by histone deacetylases removes the acetyl group from the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues of histones allowing ionic interactions between the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone and the positively charged N termini of the core histones. This results in a more compact chromatin structure that is not easily accessible for the transcriptional machinery. Histone deacetylation is thus connected with repres"

Despite recent progress on the molecular details that govern interactions between CRF family neuropeptides and their cognate receptors, little is known concerning the mechanisms that allow CRF-BP to bind CRF and Ucn 1 with picomolar affinity. We conducted a comprehensive alanine scan of 76 evolutionarily conserved residues of CRF-BP and identified several residues that differentially affected the affinity for CRF over Ucn 1. We determined that both neuropeptides derive their similarly high affinity from distinct binding surfaces on CRF-BP. Alanine substitutions of arginine 56 (R56A) and aspartic acid 62 (D62A) reduce the affinity for CRF by ∼100-fold, while only marginally affecting the affinity for Ucn 1. The selective reduction in affinity for CRF depends on glutamic acid 25 in the CRF peptide, as substitution of Glu25 reduces the affinity for CRF-BP by approximately 2 orders of magnitude, but only in the presence of both Arg56 and Asp62 in human CRF-BP. We show that CRF-BPR56A and CRF-BPD62A have lost the ability to inhibit CRFR1-mediated responses to CRF that activate luciferase induction in HEK293T cells and ACTH release from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. In contrast, both CRF-BP mutants retain the ability to inhibit Ucn 1-induced CRFR1 activation. Collectively our findings demonstrate that CRF-BP has distinct and separable binding surfaces for CRF and Ucn 1, opening new avenues for the design of ligand-specific antagonists based on CRF-BP.

CRF and Ucn 1 activate both receptors, whereas Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 are selective agonists for CRFR2. Considerable progress has been made in recent years to unravel the molecular interactions that dictate the binding of CRF family peptides to their cognate receptors. The extracellular domain of CRFRs primarily interacts with the C-terminal residues of CRF (9Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. Gulyas J. Digruccio M.R. Cantle J.P. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Corticotropin releasing factor-binding protein (CRF-BP) is a 37-kDa glycoprotein that was originally found to circulate in high concentrations in late gestational maternal plasma where it likely prevents inappropriate release of ACTH from the pituitary gland by placental-derived CRF (13Orth D.N.

Lowry P.J. Vale W.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), but it also binds to other members of the CRF family of neuropeptides. Human CRF-BP has high (pm) affinity for rat Ucn 1 (rUcn 1) and rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) and intermediate (nm) affinity for mouse Ucn 2. CRF-BP does not appreciably bind Ucn 3. The fact that CRF-BP displays no significant sequence similarity to any other known protein facilitated its characterization in early vertebrates and insects (17Huising M.O. Metz J.R. van Schooten C.

Among the conserved structural features of CRF-BP are 10 cysteine residues that form five consecutive disulfide bridges (22Fischer W.H. Behan D.P. Park M. Potter E. Lowry P.J. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4313-4316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a single asparagine (Asn)-linked glycosylation site at position 204 reported to be required for CRF binding (23Suda T. Sumitomo T. Tozawa F. Ushiyama T. Demura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As the affinity of CRF and Ucn 1 for CRF-BP is severalfold higher than that for either CRFR, CRF-BP is generally considered an antagonist of CRFRs by virtue of its potential to sequester ligands. Despite our increasing understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie high potency activation of CRFRs, we know little about the interactions that facilitate binding between CRF-BP and its high affinity endogenous peptide ligands CRF and Ucn 1. Early work on a panel of truncated CRF-derived compounds revealed that CRF-(6–33) retained most of the binding affinity for CRF-BP and therefore contained the key residues for interaction with CRF-BP (13Orth D.N.

Scrutiny of the large difference in affinity between ovine CRF (oCRF) and r/hCRF for human CRF-BP subsequently pinpointed the four amino acid ARAE (alanine-arginine-alanine-glutamic acid) motif at positions 22–25 of r/hCRF as crucial for the high affinity interaction with CRF-BP (24Sutton S.W.

By contrast, insight into the regions and residues of CRF-BP that are responsible for ligand binding is scant and the CRF-BP structure is not known. Because CRF-BP has no known paralogous genes, we cannot derive structural information from similar folds in related proteins. On the basis of photoaffinity labeling experiments with r/hCRF-(6–33), a pair of arginines in CRF-BP, Arg46 and Arg59, was identified as part of the ligand binding site of rat CRF-BP for CRF (26Jahn O. Eckart K. Brauns O. Tezval H. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12055-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding interface of CRF-BP was proposed to consist of a linear conformation of a stretch of N-terminal amino acids in CRF-BP that interacts with the α-helical CRF peptide in antiparallel fashion: Arg46 interacting with the C terminus and Arg59 with the N terminus of the peptide (26Jahn O. Eckart K. Brauns O. Tezval H. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12055-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this model awaits experimental verification. In addition to our fragmented understanding of the mode of interaction between CRF-BP and CRF, little is known about the mechanism that allows Ucn 1 to bind CRF-BP with high affinity. In the present study we have adopted an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to identify key residues on CRF-BP that mediate binding to r/hCRF and rUcn 1. Interestingly, this approach allowed us to identify several amino acid residues on CRF-BP that selectively mediate binding of CRF but not Ucn 1. The selectively disrupted affinity for r/hCRF of these CRF-BP mutants abrogates the ability to block CRF-induced activation of CRFR1, whereas the inhibition of rUcn 1 is unaffected. Mutagenesis Approach—Human CRF-BP was cloned into the EcoRV and NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) with a FLAG tag (DYKDDDK) at the N terminus. Single amino acid mutations were introduced by site-specific primers in a PCR-based mutagenesis strategy using high fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Bio-X-act, Bioline USA Inc., Randolph, MA). Vector from individual clones was purified (miniprep, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and verified by automated sequencing of both strands. Clones that carried the desired mutation only were grown in a larger volume. Vector DNA was isolated using a maxiprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and verified once more by automated sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The pcDNA3.1 expression vector containing CRF-BP was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells by transient transfection with polyethylenimine (Sigma) as the precipitating agent. Briefly, 14.4 μg of DNA was premixed with 36 μg of polyethylenimine in 1 ml of serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine (Invitrogen). DNA was allowed to precipitate for 10 min before dispersal over the surface of a 40–60% confluent 15-cm Petri dish containing serum-free media. The following morning media was replaced by serum-free expression media without phenol red (Freestyle 293 expression media; Invitrogen). Expression media was harvested after 48 h and cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. CRF-BP was purified by overnight incubation with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) and eluted from the resin using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0. The pH was neutralized by the addition of 20% (v/v) 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot using a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal (1:2000 Sigma) and rabbit anti-human CRF-BP antiserum (number 5144; 1:2000) (27Potter E. Behan D.P. Linton E.A. Lowry P.J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4192-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We initially constructed a series of truncated CRF-BP mutants to identify regions of CRF-BP involved in ligand binding, but none of these truncated CRF-BP mutants was detectable in the culture media following transient transfection (data not shown). All but eight of the CRF-BP alanine mutants were secreted following transient transfection in levels detectable by Western blot (data not shown). Whereas alanine mutations of aspartic acids at positions 98 and 114 interfered with expression or secretion of CRF-BP (supplemental Table 1), CRF-BPD98N and CRF-BPD114N were expressed and did not display gross abnormalities in the affinity for r/hCRF and rUcn 1 (data not shown). CRF-BP was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, using dialysis tubes with 4 kDa of MWCO (GBioscience, St. Louis, MO) and stored at –20 °C. Controls transfected with vector DNA alone were included in all experiments and were consistently negative for the presence of FLAG-tagged protein or peptide binding activity. CRF-BP Ligand Immunoradiometric Assay—CRF-BP mutants were quantified by ligand immunoradiometric assay as previously described (24Sutton S.W. Behan D.P. Lahrichi S.L. Kaiser R. Corrigan A. Lowry P. Potter E. Perrin M.H. Rivier J. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of each mutant were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 25 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% crystalline bovine serum albumin (ImmunO grade, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and 0.01% Triton X-100 (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA)) with 50,000 cpm of radiolabeled tracer in the presence of rabbit anti-human CRF-BP antiserum (number 5144; 1:1000) (27Potter E. Behan D.P. Linton E.A. Lowry P.J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4192-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For all experiments 125I-[d-Tyr0]r/hCRF was used as tracer, except for CRF-BP with mutations at positions 56 or 62 that interfere with r/hCRF binding, where 125I-[d-Tyr0]rUcn 1 was used instead. We verified that the choice of tracer, 125I-[d-Tyr0]r/hCRF versus 125I-[d-Tyr0]rUcn 1, has no significant effect on Ki values (data not shown). Also, r/hCRF was capable of completely displacing 125I-[d-Tyr0]rUcn 1 and rUcn 1 completely displaced 125I-[d-Tyr0]r/hCRF (data not shown). Iodination was carried out as previously described (28Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Total counts bound were measured by precipitation for 2 h with sheep anti-rabbit γ-globulin (1:20), normal rabbit serum (1:100), and 4% polyethylene glycol (average Mr 8,000; Sigma). For every mutant an appropriate working dilution was determined in the linear range of the assay, where an increase in CRF-BP was accompanied by linear increase in tracer binding. At that dilution, the affinities of CRF-BP mutants for CRF and Ucn 1 were determined by competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled peptide. Binding curves and IC50 values including 95% confidence intervals were obtained using Prism 4.0c for Macintosh (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Curves were fitted by non-linear regression assuming one-site binding. All peptides were synthesized in-house using a tert-butyl-oxy-carbonyl strategy on an automated peptide sequencer (CS536 peptide synthesizer; C. S. Bio Co., San Carlos, CA) and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. In Vitro Reporter Assay—HEK293T cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish at 1.5 × 106 cells per dish the day prior to transfection. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with 600 ng of human CRFR1 in pcDNA3.1, 5 μg of pXP2 reporter construct (luciferase driven by a cAMP responsive element), and 1 μgof β-galactosidase driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (29Bilezikjian L.M. Corrigan A.Z. Blount A.L. Chen Y. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA was precipitated for 10 min by incubation with 9.9 μg of polyethylenimine and added to the cells under serum-free conditions. The following day, cells were trypsinized and seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated wells of a 48-well plate at 100,000 cells/well in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After an overnight rest, cells were stimulated for 3 h followed by a single wash with ice-cold Hepes dissociation buffer (28Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 100 μl of luciferase buffer (10 mm MgSO4, 25 mm glycylclycine, 4 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was determined in 50 μl of cell lysate using a Lumimark plus microplate reader (Bio-Rad) following addition of 100 μl of luciferin substrate buffer (luciferase buffer supplemented with 0.3 mm luciferin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was normalized for the β-galactosidase activity measured in 20 μl of cell lysate by addition of 100 μl of β-galactosidase substrate buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercapthoethanol, 1.5 mg/ml ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Sigma). Rat Anterior Pituitary Assay—Purified CRF-BP mutants were tested on cultured primary rat anterior pituitary cells isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and dispersed into single cells with collagenase as previously described (28Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 6.2 × 104 cells per well in poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cultures were maintained in 0.1 ml/well β-Pit-julep (28Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) media containing 2% fetal bovine serum. On day 4 in culture, cells were washed three times with β-Pit-julep media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The media was replaced by treatment compounds diluted in β-Pitjulep media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Media was harvested after 3 h and stored at –20 °C until analysis for ACTH content. The procedure for ACTH radioimmunoassay was similar to that previously described for melanin-concentrating hormone (30Vaughan J.M. Fischer W.H. Hoeger C. Rivier J. Vale W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), except that all buffers contained 0.05% Triton X-100. Rabbit anti-rat ACTH serum (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA; T-4002) was used at 1:30,000 final dilution. [3-[125I]Iodotyrosyl2]ACTH(1–39), purchased from Amersham Biosciences (IM216) was used as tracer with about 20,000 cpm added per tube. Rat ACTH(1–39), synthesized in our laboratory, was used as standard at doses ranging from 2 to 1000 pg/tube. The EC50 for rat ACTH(1–39) was 65–70 pg/tube; the assay displays minimal cross-reactivity with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and ACTH(1–24). An Alanine Scan Identifies Residues That Selectively Affect Binding of CRF or Ucn 1—We specifically disrupted the disulfide bridges of CRF-BP by mutating both cysteines of each pair to alanine. Only the CRF-BP mutants lacking the fourth or fifth disulfide bridge were expressed in detectable quantities, and their affinities for r/hCRF and rUcn 1 were unaffected (supplemental Fig. 1). This suggests that the key determinants for ligand binding are located toward the N-terminal part of CRF-BP. Based on this observation we initiated a comprehensive alanine scan of the N-terminal domain of hCRF-BP (31Woods R.J. Kemp C.F. David J. Sumner I.G. Lowry P.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 2788-2794PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with the argument that evolutionarily conserved residues are more likely to be involved in protein function, we targeted a panel of 76 residues that are conserved or conservatively substituted in CRF-BP of early vertebrate and insect species (supplemental Fig. 2). We determined the ability of all mutants to bind 125I-labeled r/hCRF and 125I-labeled rUcn 1 and compared each mutant to the binding capacity of wild-type (WT) CRF-BP (Fig. 1A). Mutation of several amino acids, notably Trp116 and Tyr211, completely abolished the ability of CRF-BP to bind CRF and Ucn 1, although mutant proteins were readily detectable by Western immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. 3). As alanine substitutions of Trp116 and Tyr211 interfered with bioactivity in general, rather than specifically affecting affinity for r/hCRF or rUcn 1, it is possible that these mutations cause CRF-BP to misfold, resulting in loss of function. Similarly, mutants, such as L61A, E121A, F123A, and Q188A, that have lost partial affinity for both r/hCRF and rUcn 1 may have done so because these mutations result in partial misfolding rather than specifically affecting the binding surface for the peptide ligands. We subsequently determined the relative potency of all CRF-BP mutants for binding to r/hCRF and rUcn 1 using competitive binding assays. For r/hCRF and rUcn 1 we identified 13 and 14 alanine mutants, respectively, that had reduced affinity for the ligand by 2-fold or more (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table 1). Interestingly, we identified several amino acids that, when mutated, selectively affected the Ki for r/hCRF, but not rUcn 1, and vice versa. Residues that selectively affected the Ki for r/hCRF when substituted by alanine include Arg56 and Asp62 and, to a lesser extent, Tyr54, Leu58, Leu64, and Phe70. Residues that selectively or more potently interfered with high affinity binding to rUcn 1 when mutated include Leu61, Met63, Phe84, Glu88, Glu91, Gln188, and Thr189 (Fig. 1B). Generally, mutants that selectively altered r/hCRF affinity were concentrated toward the N terminus, whereas mutations that disproportionately affected the binding of rUcn 1 were distributed more evenly throughout the linear sequence of the N-terminal domain of CRF-BP. CRF-BP Does Not Require Arg46 and Arg59 to Bind CRF or Ucn 1—Based on photocross-linking experiments, a pair of N-terminal arginines of CRF-BP, Arg46 and Arg59, were suggested to contact r/hCRF (26Jahn O. Eckart K. Brauns O. Tezval H. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12055-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As the involvement of Arg46 and Arg59 in ligand binding had not been experimentally confirmed, we verified their contribution to the affinity for r/hCRF and rUcn 1. As shown in Fig. 2, WT recombinant C-terminal FLAG-tagged CRF-BP bound CRF and Ucn 1 with high affinity (Ki values for CRF and Ucn 1 were 217 and 77.2 pm, respectively), consistent with previously published values for non-tagged recombinant human CRF-BP (2Vaughan J. Donaldson C. Bittencourt J. Perrin M.H. Lewis K. Sutton S. Chan R. Turnbull A.V. Lovejoy D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, substitution of Arg46 with alanine did not affect Ki values for r/hCRF or rUcn 1, whereas CRF-BPR59A displayed a modestly (<2-fold) reduced Ki value for r/hCRF (Fig. 2). Simultaneous alanine substitution of Arg46 and Arg59 resulted in a CRF-BP protein that was indistinguishable from hCRF-BP in its Ki for CRF and had slightly increased affinity for rUcn 1 (Fig. 2). Collectively, these data indicate that neither Arg46 nor Arg59 are key for binding to r/hCRF or rUcn 1. N-Linked Glycosylation at Position 204 Is Not Required for Ligand Binding—Alanine replacement of the asparagine comprising the single N-linked glycosylation site of CRF-BP (N204A) results in a reduction in molecular weight compared with WT CRF-BP, demonstrating that the N-linked glycosylation in transfected HEK293T cells is abrogated by the N204A mutation (Fig. 2E). In contradiction to an early report that N-linked glycosylation is required for CRF binding (23Suda T. Sumitomo T. Tozawa F. Ushiyama T. Demura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the affinities of the N204A mutant for r/hCRF and rUcn 1 were indistinguishable from those of WT CRF-BP (Fig. 2, C and D). Alanine Substitution of Arg56 and Asp62 Selectively Abrogates CRF Binding—We focused in more detail on the profound and specific loss in affinity for CRF, but not Ucn 1, observed for CRF-BPR56A and CRF-BPD62A. Replacing either Arg56 or Asp62 with alanine reduced the affinity for r/hCRF by more than 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. 3A). Both mutations significantly affected CRF binding, whereas affinity for rUcn 1 was only 2-fold reduced (Fig. 3B). The selectivity of the R56A mutation was further illustrated by substituting the adjacent arginine at position 55 (Arg55) with alanine, which had no effect on CRF binding (Fig. 3A). Substitution of Arg56 for a Lys only minimally improved the affinity for r/hCRF compared with CRF-BPR56A, whereas the introduction of an acidic amino acid side chain at this position failed to substantially alter the affinity for r/hCRF when further compared with CRF-BPR56A (Fig. 3C). Substitution of Asp62 for Glu resulted in a 10-fold loss of the affinity for r/hCRF, compared with the 100-fold loss in affinity for CRF-BPR56A (Fig. 3D). CRF-BP mutants with a basic amino acid side chain in place of Asp62 did not express in detectable levels (data not shown). As alanine substitutions of Arg56 and Asp62 resulted in remarkably similar and ∼100-fold reductions in the affinity for r/hCRF, whereas only marginally affecting the affinity for rUcn 1, we expressed CRF-BP with an R56A/D62A double mutation to test if the effects of the single mutations were additive.

https://openalex.org/W1980640745,"Paired Ig-like type 2 receptors (PILRs) are one of the paired receptor families, which consist of two functionally opposite members, inhibitory (PILRα) and activating (PILRβ) receptors. PILRs are widely expressed in immune cells and recognize the sialylated O-glycosylated ligand CD99, which is expressed on activated T cells, to regulate immune responses. To date, their biophysical properties have not yet been examined. Here we report the affinity, kinetic, and thermodynamic analyses of PILR-CD99 interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) together with site-directed mutagenesis. The SPR analysis clearly demonstrated that inhibitory PILRα can bind to CD99 with low affinity (Kd ∼ 2.2 μm), but activating PILRβ binds with ∼40 times lower affinity (Kd ∼ 85 μm). In addition to our previous mutagenesis study (Wang, J., Shiratori, I., Saito, T., Lanier, L. L., and Arase, H. (2008) J. Immunol. 180, 1686–1693), the SPR analysis showed that PILRα can bind to each Ala mutant of the two CD99 O-glycosylated sites (Thr-45 and Thr-50) with similar binding affinity to wild-type CD99. This indicated that both residues act as independent and equivalent PILRα binding sites, consistent with the highly flexible structure of CD99. On the other hand, it is further confirmed that PILRβ can bind the T50A mutant, but not the T45A mutant, indicating a recognition difference between PILRα and PILRβ. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the PILR-CD99 interactions show fast dissociation rates, typical of cell-cell recognition receptors. Thermodynamic analyses revealed that the PILRα-CD99 interaction is enthalpically driven with a large entropy loss (–TΔS = 8.9 kcal·mol–1), suggesting the reduction of flexibility upon complex formation. This is in contrast to the entropically driven binding of selectins to sugar-modified ligands involved in leukocyte rolling and infiltration, which may reflect their functional differences.

Immune cell surface receptors are involved in both activating and inhibitory signaling, and their balance determines the functional responses of immune cells (1Lanier L.L. Nat.

Some of these receptor families have members with very similar extracellular regions responsible for ligand recognition but with different functions, activation and inhibition, due to the amino acid sequences of the transmembrane and intracellular regions. These receptor families are called “paired receptor families” and include human killer cell immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIRs/CD158), human Leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs/LIRs/ILTs/CD85), CD94/NKG2, and mouse Ly49.

Cellular-based assays revealed that PILRβ can induce the activation of natural killer cells and dendritic cells (7Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp.

Our previous work identified the heavily O-linked glycosylated CD99 as a physiological PILR ligand (7Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CD99 is a cell surface ligand on all leukocyte lineages, and it is especially highly expressed on activated T cells, where it may regulate the functional communication between PILR-expressing dendritic cell and CD99-expressing T cells. A recent report demonstrated that PILRs recognize two sialylated core1-type O-glycosylation sites of CD99 but both the core 2 branching and desialylation disturbed the PILR recognition (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of PILR has one Ig-like domain (residue numbers 40–156) with the C-terminal stalk region. A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis revealed that sialoadhesin (9May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), one of Siglec (sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectins) receptors, which have an Ig fold and recognize sialic acid (Fig. 1), exhibits weak homology (∼22% identity) with the Ig-like domain of PILRs, suggesting the possibility of a similar sugar binding mode between PILRs and Siglecs. On the other hand, the extracellular domains between PILRα and β are highly conserved (amino acid identity ∼90% in the Ig-like domains). An immunoprecipitation experiment showed that the inhibitory PILRα can bind to CD99 more strongly than the activating PILRβ (7Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting the functional dominance of inhibitory PILRα, as in other paired receptor families, such as KIRs and CD94/NKG2. A biophysical characterization of the properties of the PILR-CD99 interactions would yield important insights for understanding their physiological relevance. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the interactions by surface plasmon resonance and site-directed mutagenesis. We also compared the molecular mechanisms for the recognition of sugar-modified ligands by PILRs and selectins. Production of Soluble V-set Domains of PILRα and PILRβ—The DNAs encoding the V-set domains of the extracellular regions (residues 40–156) of PILRα and PILRβ were amplified from the cDNAs obtained as described previously (7Shiratori I.

The resultant fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and were ligated into pGMT7, creating the plasmids pGMPILRα and pGMPILRβ encoding PILRα and PILRβ, respectively. With regards to PILRβ, the C48S mutation was additionally introduced by QuikChange (Stratagene), to avoid the formation of the disulfide-linked dimer. The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/RIL, and the cells were cultured in a 1 liter of 2YT medium (1.6 % Bacto-Tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5 % NaCl) with 100 mg/lliter ampicillin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) at 310 K. When the A600 reached 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added for induction at a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were induced for 6 h, and were harvested by centrifugation. The recombinant proteins accumulated as insoluble aggregates in inclusion bodies. The cell pellet was suspended in resuspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and was centrifuged. The pellet was washed with Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and was centrifuged twice. The pellet was then suspended in resuspension buffer and was centrifuged to remove unnecessary detergent. The purified inclusion bodies were finally dissolved in guanidine buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm MES, NaOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA). To refold the proteins, 20 mg of solubilized inclusion bodies was gradually diluted by the addition of refolding buffer (1 m l-arginine-HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) at 277 K. The resultant solution was stirred for 2 days and was concentrated to 5–10 ml by a VIVA FLOW system. The proteins were purified by gel filtration (HiLoad26/60 Superdex 75 pg, GE Healthcare). Production of Soluble CD99s—The DNA fragments encoding the extracellular portions of CD99 and its mutants (CD99-T45A (Thr-45 → Ala), -T50A(Thr-50 → Ala), and -FM (full Ala mutations of all potential O-glycan sites)) were each cloned into the XhoI site of a modified pME18S expression vector, containing a mouse CD150 leader sequence at the N-terminal site and the Fc fragment of human IgG at the C-terminal one (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The vector DNAs were transfected into 293T cells using polyethyleneimine, for transient expression. The supernatants were collected 96 h after the transfection, and the Fc-fused CD99s were purified with a protein A affinity column. Binding Analysis Using SPR—PILRα and PILRβ were each dissolved in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20) (BIAcore AB). SPR experiments were performed with a BIAcore2000 (Biacore AB). All of the proteins were covalently immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip by amine-coupling using the standard amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB). For coupling the samples were injected at 50–100 μg/ml for 1–10 min in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control protein. All PILR injections were for 30 s, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The data were analyzed using BIAevaluation version 4.1 (Biacore AB) and ORIGIN version 7 (MicroCal Inc.) software. Equilibrium analyses determined Kd values by nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm. For kinetics, all PILR injections were at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The global fitting analysis using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was simultaneously performed with the raw data for the association and dissociation phases at different concentrations of PILRα. Fitting was performed using BIAevaluation version 4.1. Equilibrium analyses of PILRα were performed at five temperature points (10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C). The standard state Gibbs energy change upon binding was obtained from Equation 1: ΔG=RTlnKd(Eq. 1) where Kd is dissociation constant expressed in units of mol.l–1, and R is the gas constant. The ΔG values of each data set were plotted against the temperatures, and were fitted with the nonlinear van't Hoff equation (Equation 2), ΔG=ΔH-TΔS+ΔCp(T-298.15)-ΔCpTln(T/298.15)(Eq. 2) where ΔH and ΔS are the binding enthalpy and entropy at 298.15 K, respectively, and ΔCp is the heat capacity, which is assumed to be temperature-independent. Glycan Array Binding Screening—The Fc-fused proteins of PILRα and PILRβ were prepared as previously reported in Wang et al. (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were produced in COS-7 cells by transient expression, similarly to the preparation of CD99s. The supernatants were collected 72 h after the transfection, and the purification was performed by a protein A affinity column. The glycan array screening was supported by the international established group, The Consortium for Functional Glycomics (detailed on the their website). A huge library of natural and synthetic glycans with amino linkers is covalently attached onto glass microscope slides via amide linkages, resulting in a printed glycan array. The Fc-fused PILRs (200 μg/ml) were incubated with the glycan microarray (version 3.0), including >300 sugars (see supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Then the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) was used for the detection of the fluorescence if the proper binding occurred. Expression and Purification of PILRs and CD99—The V-set Ig domains (residues numbers 40–156) of mouse PILRα and PILRβ were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and were refolded in vitro by a dilution method (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). The refolded proteins migrated as monomers and were purified on size-exclusion columns (Fig. 2), and the final products showed high purity. According to Wang et al. (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the ectodomain of mouse CD99 fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG at the C-terminal site was expressed by a transient expression system, using 293T cells. The CD99 fusion protein was purified by chromatography on a protein-A column. It migrated as a 47-kDa species under reduced SDS-PAGE, and was used without further purification for binding studies (data not shown). Differential Binding Activity Mediates CD99 Recognition by PILRs—The CD99 binding activity of the PILR ectodomains was analyzed by SPR. Each PILR was simultaneously injected (Fig. 3, solid bar) onto four flow cells containing sensor surfaces to which wild-type CD99 (CD99-WT) or BSA (negative control) had been immobilized by direct amine coupling. A greater response was observed with the injection of the inhibitory PILRα onto CD99-WT in comparison with that onto BSA, indicating specific binding to CD99-WT (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the activating PILRβ showed much lower binding responses to CD99-WT (Fig. 3B). Previous cellular-based assays revealed that the activating PILRβ regulates the CD99-transfected cells much less efficiently than the inhibitory PILRα (7Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present binding study supports the differential binding affinities of PILRα and PILRβ. The affinities of PILR binding to CD99 were determined by an equilibrium binding analysis. A range of concentrations of PILRα or PILRβ were injected through flow cells with immobilized CD99-WT or BSA as a control. The binding response was calculated by subtracting the equilibrium response in the control flow cell from the response in each flow cell. Conventional (Fig. 4) and Scatchard (Fig. 4, inset) plots of these binding data indicated that the interaction conforms to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the PILRα-CD99 interaction was 2.2 μm at 25 °C (298.15 K), whereas that for the PILRβ-CD99 interaction was much lower, 85 μm. The results are summarized in Table 1. The PILRα-CD99 interaction showed low affinity within the range of typical cell-cell recognition events, but the PILRβ-CD99 interaction was at the lowest edge of the range (Table 2).TABLE 1Binding affinities of the interactions between PILRs and CD99s at 25 °CAnalyteImmobilizedKdμmPILRαCD99-WT2.2 ± 0.03CD99-FMNBaNB, no detectable binding.CD99-T45A3.3 ± 0.2CD99-T50A2.8 ± 0.02PILRβCD99-WT85 ± 15CD99-FMNBCD99-T45ANBCD99-T50A154 ± 37a NB, no detectable binding.

Open table in a new tab Two Equivalent PILRα Binding O-Glycan Sites—As described above, the previous cellular-based binding study using CD99 mutants (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PILRα and PILRβ recognize CD99 modified with sialylated O-linked sugar. Here, we further performed the glycan array screening provided by The Consortium for Functional Glycomics (detailed on their website). The Fc-fused PILRα and PILRβ did not show significant binding to any sugar molecules on the glycan microarray (version 3.0), including >300 sugars, although PILRα showed subtle binding to α-Neu5Ac and Neu5Gcα (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2). Especially, sialylated sugars such as Neu5Acα2→3Gal1→3GalNAc and Neu5Acα2→6Gal1→3GalNAc were not recognized by PILRs. In addition, the cellular-based competition assay indicated that neither Neu5Ac, NeuAcα2→3Gal, or NeuAcα2→6Gal competes with the PILR-CD99 interaction. 4J. Wang and H. Arase, unpublished observation. These results suggest that PILRs recognize more complicated structure rather than simple sugar molecules, which are sialylated O-linked sugars presumably together with a certain sugar modification and/or the peptide sequence specific to CD99. Furthermore, Wang et al. (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the two mutations, Thr-45 and Thr-50, of CD99 reduced the molecular weight to be essentially the same as the mutant whose potential O-glycosylation sites were all mutated to alanine, indicating that the two sites are only O-glycosylated. These two O-glycosylation sites, Thr-45 and Thr-50, are relevant for PILR recognition; however, the extent of the roles of these sites in the binding activity has been unclear. Therefore, we performed SPR binding studies of the inhibitory PILRα to the CD99 mutants. As expected, no specific responses were observed in the flow cell of the CD99 mutant with Ala replacements at all potential O-glycosylation sites (full mutations, CD99-FM) upon the injection of either PILRα or PILRβ (Fig. 3), confirming the previous result (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the O-glycosylation is necessary for PILR recognition. On the other hand, the single Ala mutation at two O-glycosylation sites (T45A and T50A) did not cause any reduction of PILRα binding in comparison with that of the CD99-WT (Fig. 4, A–C, and Table 1). This indicated that the two O-glycan sites are independent and equivalent for the PILRα recognition. In contrast, the PILRβ bound the T50A mutant with similar affinity as the CD99-WT (Fig. 4, D and E), but did not bind to the T45A mutant (data not shown), supporting the previous observation (8Wang J. Shiratori I. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that these binding sites are not equivalent for PILRβ recognition. Binding Kinetics—The equilibrium binding data for both PILR-CD99-WT interactions indicated very fast kinetics (Fig. 3). The PILRβ-CD99-WT interaction shows quite low affinity with much faster kinetics, making it difficult to obtain the precise association and dissociation rates. Therefore, the detailed kinetic parameters of the PILRα-CD99-WT interaction were determined, by global fitting of the mono-exponential rate equations derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the SPR data. Fig. 5 illustrates the reasonable fitting to the data for PILRα binding to CD99-WT, which yielded the association and dissociation rate constants, summarized in Table 2. PILRα bound CD99 with typical association (kon = 3.9 × 105 m–1·s–1) and fast dissociation (koff = 1.2 s–1) kinetics similar to those of the interactions of other cell-cell recognition receptors (Table 2). The amount of immobilized CD99-WT did not affect the kinetic parameters significantly (Table 2), indicating that mass transport and rebinding artifacts were not factors in this experiment. The good consistency between the kinetically derived Kd (Table 2) and the Kd determined by equilibrium binding (Table 1) provided further evidence that these kinetic parameters are correct. Thermodynamic Properties of the PILRα-CD99 Interaction—Using the non-linear van't Hoff analysis (Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures”), a series of binding experiments at a range of temperatures can simultaneously provide the following thermodynamic parameters: the enthalpy change (ΔH), the entropic change (TΔS) and the heat capacity (ΔCp). Therefore, we determined the binding affinities of the PILRα-CD99-WT interaction at five temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C). The reasonable fitting of the non-linear van't Hoff equation to the data produced the thermodynamic parameters (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The quite favorable enthalpic changes (ΔH ∼–16.6 kcal· mol–1), beyond the entropic loss (TΔS ∼–8.9 kcal· mol–1), contribute to the binding energy (ΔG ∼ 7.7 kcal· mol–1) at 25 °C, and thus the PILRα-CD99-WT interaction is completely enthalpic-driven. On the other hand, ΔCp is within the range of values measured for other protein-protein interactions (–0.44 ± 0.07 kcal·mol–1·K–1) (Table 3).TABLE 3Thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between PILRα and CD99s at 25 °CAnalyteImmobilizedReferencesΔGΔH-TΔSΔCpkcal·mol-1kcal·mol-1·K-1PILRαCD99-WTaThe values are means ± range derived from two experiments.This study-7.7 ± 0.03-16.6 ± 0.28.9 ± 0.2-0.44 ± 0.07CD99-T45AaThe values are means ± range derived from two experiments.This study-7.5 ± 0.00-15.3 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.2-0.28 ± 0.03CD99-T50AaThe values are means ± range derived from two experiments.This study-7.6 ± 0.00-16.0 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.1-0.37 ± 0.02E-selectinESL-1(17Wild M.K.

Replacement of the amino acid residue at position 94 of a chimeric MMP mutant affected its interaction with the C-terminal Pro10 of APP-IP, whereas that of residues 145-148 affected the interaction with Tyr3 of the inhibitor, suggesting that the N to C direction of APP-IP relative to the substrate-binding cleft of MMP is analogous to that of propeptide in proMMP, and opposite to that of substrate. When the APP-IP sequence was added to the N terminus of the catalytic domain of MMP-2, the activity of the protease was intramolecularly inhibited.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). The association of MMPs with cancer cell invasion and metastasis has suggested that these proteases represent attractive targets for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies. However, to date, no MMP inhibitor has been developed successfully as anti-tumor drugs mainly because of deleterious side effects. Recently, inhibition of some MMPs is considered to have protumorigenic effects (3Overall C.M. Kleifeld O. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These effects may also partially account for the failure of the inhibitors in clinical trials. In both cases, the broad specificity of the MMP inhibitors must be a stiff obstacle for developing safe and effective drugs. Most MMPs are secreted as proMMP, an inactive zymogen that has an autoinhibitory propeptide in its N terminus and is proteolytically activated by serine proteases or some activated MMPs. The activities of activated MMPs are regulated by a family of inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). These physiological inhibitors also have broad specificity against MMPs; the activities of almost all MMPs are susceptible to TIMP (TIMP-1 to TIMP-4) inhibition, and some members of a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase family are also inhibited by these inhibitors (4Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G.

To develop drugs for the treatment of diseases in which MMPs are involved, many hydroxamate-based inhibitors or other synthetic MMP inhibitors have been designed (7Betz M. Huxley P. Davies S.J.

Among the MMP family, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) are critical in the invasion of tumor cells across basement membranes, because of their strong activity against type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes (11Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 12Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Although they have a common substrate, MMP-2 is categorized as a good target for anticancer drugs, whereas MMP-9 is considered not to be a safe target for the drugs (3Overall C.M. Kleifeld O. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Unlike other zymogens of MMPs, activation of proMMP-2 is catalyzed specifically by a novel type of MMP that has a transmembrane domain and is thus localized on the cell surface (14Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). So far, six members of the membrane-type MMP have been identified, and membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP)-catalyzed proMMP-2 activation has been well characterized (15Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Yana I. Seiki M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Upon the activation of proMMP-2, the protease zymogen is first recruited on the cell surface via the MT1-MMP complexed with TIMP-2, and then a TIMP-2-free, non-inhibited form of MT1-MMP (also present on the cell surface) cleaves the propeptide of proMMP-2 to initiate the activation (14Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 18Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10497-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is thought that both the cell-associated active MMP-2 and MT1-MMP are recruited into invadopodia, thus limiting proteolysis to the site of cell invasion (20Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, the exertion of MMP-2 activity is strictly regulated on its zymogen activation level. Recently, we further proposed that the ECM-degrading activity of MMP-2 is regulated by β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) that contains its selective inhibitor (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Higashi S. Miyazaki K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6514-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). APP is a type I integral membrane protein that was initially identified as a precursor of β-amyloid peptide, the principal component of extracellular deposits in senile plaques observed in the brain of Alzheimer disease patients (23Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, APP synthesized and maturated through the constitutive secretory pathway is proteolytically cleaved at the cell surface within the β-amyloid sequence, and the extracellular domain of APP is released as a soluble APP into the culture medium (24Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 25Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T.

Because the extracellular domain of APP has the abilities both to interact with components of ECM (26Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Moir R. Michaelson S. Monard D. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J.

Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), this molecule is assumed to protect ECM from MMP-2-catalyzed degradation. Our previous study (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inhibitor is localized within the ISYGNDALMP sequence corresponding to residues 586-595 of APP770, and a synthetic decapeptide containing this sequence (named APP-derived inhibitory peptide, APP-IP) selectively inhibits the activity of MMP-2. Although we have determined the residues of APP-IP essential for the inhibitory activity (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the region of interaction that correlates with the selective inhibition has not been identified. The mechanism of the APP-IP inhibition of the activity of MMP-2 remains to be clarified. In this study, we constructed various mutants of MMP-2 and identified amino acid residues of the protease essential for the selective inhibition by APP-IP. We also provide evidence that the N to C direction of APP-IP relative to the substrate-binding cleft of MMP-2 is analogous to that of propeptide in proMMP-2, and is opposite to that of substrate. Clarification of the mode of interaction between MMP-2 and APP-IP provides the potential to develop specific inhibitors for individual MMPs.

Proteins—The TIMP-2-free form of proMMP-2 was purified from the conditioned medium of the human glioblastoma cell line T98G, as described previously (32Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7758-7764PubMed Google Scholar). ProMMP-3 (pro-stromelysin) was purified from the conditioned medium of the Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat liver cell line (RSV, Invitrogen) as described previously (33Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Ashida Y. Yamauti J. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vector for MMP Mutants—Gene constructions carried out in this study are described under supplemental data. Expression and Purification of MMP Mutants—The expression vectors of various MMP mutants were transfected separately into the Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The transformants were cultured in 2× YT medium (0.08% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.25% (w/v) NaCl) at 37 °C, and the GST fusion proteins of MMP mutants or other MMP-2 mutants were induced by the addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 5-h induction, E. coli cells were broken in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA with a sonicator, and the resultant inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation. Solubilization of the inclusion bodies with guanidine-HCl followed by refolding by rapid dilution method was performed as described previously (35Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Oneda H. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of GST fusion proteins, the refolded proteins were incubated with thrombin to remove the N-terminal GST region. The resultant pro-form of MMP mutants or the MMP-2 catalytic domain N-terminally fused with APP-IP-containing peptide was purified, using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose column. The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by the Bradford dye method with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Assay of Inhibitory Activity of APP-IP or Its Variants toward MMP Mutants—The TIMP-2-free form of MMP-2 (1 μm) or pro-forms of the MMP mutants (1 μm) were activated by incubation with 1 mm APMA and rat proMMP-3 (0.2 μm) at 37 °C for 2 h as described previously (31Miyazaki K. Hasegawa M. Funahashi K. Umeda M. Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Activated MMP-2 and the MMP mutants were first measured for their activities toward a synthetic substrate 3163v as described previously (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The peptidolytic activities of the mutants are listed in supplemental Table SII. As MMP-3 used for the activation had almost no activity toward 3163v, this protease did not interfere with the activity assay. MMP-2 (0.61 nm) and the mutants, of which concentrations were adjusted to give the activity equivalent to that of 0.61 nm MMP-2, were each incubated with various concentrations of APP-IP or its variants in 190 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij 35, and 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, 10 μl of 1 mm 3163v were added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5. The amounts of the synthetic substrate hydrolyzed by MMPs were measured fluorometrically with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The amount of the substrate hydrolyzed without enzyme was subtracted from the total amount of the hydrolyzed substrate. Gelatin Zymography—Zymography was carried out on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin, as described previously (32Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7758-7764PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin Digestion of the Catalytic Domain of MMP-2 N-terminally Fused with APP-IP-containing Peptide—150 μl of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 N-terminally fused with the APP-IP-containing peptide, named N-APP-IP-MMP-2-cat-FLAG (8.7 μm), was incubated with trypsin (0.67 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min. After incubation, 20 μl of each sample taken from the reaction mixture were mixed with 5 μl of 5 mm APMSF and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to inactivate trypsin. The resultant digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE or were measured for their peptidolytic activity using 3163v as a substrate. The Effect of Deletion of the Hemopexin-like Domain and Three Fibronectin-like Type II Domains of MMP-2 on Its Affinity for APP-IP—It has been reported that APP-IP is likely an active site-directed inhibitor that has high selectivity toward MMP-2 (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine whether the catalytic domain of MMP-2 is sufficient for its selective interaction with APP-IP, we constructed an MMP-2 mutant, named MMP-2-cat-FLAG, that had the hemopexin-like domain and three fibronectin-like type II domains of MMP-2 deleted (Fig. 1A), and susceptibilities of the activities of the mutant, native MMP-2, and MMP-7 to APP-IP inhibition were compared. As shown in Fig. 1B, the peptidolytic activities of native MMP-2 (IC50 = 32 nm) and MMP-2-cat-FLAG (IC50 = 65 nm) were inhibited by APP-IP with similar IC50 values, whereas the activity of MMP-7 (IC50 = 20 μm) was inhibited with a much higher IC50 value. Therefore, only the catalytic domain of MMP-2 is likely sufficient for the selective interaction with APP-IP. APP-IP Inhibition of Peptidolytic Activities of Chimeric MMP Mutants Consisting of Various Parts of MMP-2 and Those of MMP-7—The data shown in Fig. 1 strongly suggest that the structural difference between the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and that of MMP-7 correlates with about a 300-fold difference in their affinities for APP-IP. To explore the regions of the catalytic domain that correlate with the affinity difference, we constructed chimeric MMP mutants that consist of various N-terminal parts of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and the remaining C-terminal parts of MMP-7 (Fig. 2A), and susceptibilities of their activities to APP-IP inhibition were compared. To facilitate understanding, we use active MMP-7 numbering for the amino acid residue numbers of the catalytic domain of MMPs and the chimeric mutants. As shown in Fig. 2B, the activities of the mutants, named M2n-57-M7c, M2n-84-M7c, and M2n-110-M7c, which, respectively, consist of residues 1-56, 1-83, and 1-109 of MMP-2 and residues 57-174, 84-174, and 110-174 of MMP-7, were inhibited by APP-IP with similar IC50 values (7.3, 9.0, and 15 μm, respectively). These IC50 values were also close to the values for APP-IP inhibition of the MMP-7 activity. As compared with M2n-110-M7c, M2n-122-M7c showed 25-fold higher affinity for APP-IP (IC50 = 610 nm), suggesting that the region corresponding to residues 110-122 of MMP-2 contributes partially to the selective interaction between MMP-2 and APP-IP. As compared with M2n-122-M7c, M2n-137-M7c showed slightly reduced affinity for APP-IP (IC50 = 1.5 μm), whereas M2n-153-M7c showed much higher affinity (IC50 = 100 nm) that was comparable to the affinity between MMP-2-cat-FLAG and APP-IP (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is likely that the region corresponding to residues 137-153 of MMP-2 also contributes to the selective interaction. To explore the amino acid residues responsible for the selective interaction, the residues 110-122 of M2n-122-M7c were further replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-7 as shown in Fig. 3A. We found that the replacement of residues 110-114 or that of the individual residue Phe116, Leu117, or Ala120 did not significantly affect the affinity for APP-IP, whereas replacement of Leu115 and Val118 led to an 8.0- and 2.5-fold increase in the IC50 values, respectively (Fig. 3A). We also replaced the residues 137-153 of M2n-137-M7c with the corresponding residues of MMP-2 as shown in Fig. 3B, and found that the replacement of residues 137-144, that of residues Tyr145 and Thr146, and deletion of two extra residues Asp147 and Pro148 led to 2.6-, 4.1-, and 1.9-fold reductions in the IC50 values, respectively. Collectively, the difference of amino acid residues at positions 115 and 145-148 between the catalytic domains of MMP-2 and MMP-7 mainly correlated with the difference in their affinities for APP-IP.FIGURE 3The effects of replacements of amino acid residues at positions 110-122 or 137-152 of chimeric MMP mutants on their affinities for APP-IP. Two series of chimeric mutants were constructed. One of the series consisted of residues 1-109 of MMP-2, 122-174 of MMP-7, and various sequences between residues 110 and 121 (A). The other series consisted of residues 1-136 of MMP-2, 153-162 of MMP-7, and various sequences between residues 137 and 152 (B). The sequences of MMP-2, MMP-7, and the chimeric mutants corresponding to residues 110-121 or 137-152 are shown on the left. The bold letters in the sequence represent the residues that are different between MMP-2 and MMP-7, and the non-bold letters represent the common residues. Among the different residues, the residues identical to those of MMP-2 and MMP-7 are shown in black and gray letters, respectively. Active forms of the chimeric mutants indicated on the left were incubated with 50 μm 3163v at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of APP-IP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of 3163v hydrolyzed by each enzyme in the absence of APP-IP was taken as 100%. The enzyme activity on the ordinate is shown as the relative amount of 3163v hydrolyzed by the enzyme (right). The broken and gray lines represent the corresponding activities of MMP-2-cat-FLAG and MMP-7, respectively, which were obtained from the results in Fig. 1. The arrows represent the change in IC50 values for inhibition upon replacement of the indicated amino acid residues (star) in the chimeric mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) APP-IP Inhibition of Peptidolytic Activities of Chimeric MMP Mutants Consisting of Various Parts of MMP-2 and Those of MMP-9—Our previous study (21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrated that APP-IP is a poor inhibitor for MMP-9, although MMP-2 and MMP-9 have similarity in their structures and substrate specificities. To examine whether the low-affinity interaction between MMP-9 and APP-IP is caused by the structural elements in the catalytic domain of MMP-9, we constructed an MMP-9 mutant, named MMP-9-cat-FLAG, that had the hemopexin-like domain and three fibronectin-like type II domains of MMP-9 deleted (Fig. 4A), and susceptibility of the activity of the mutant to APP-IP inhibition was tested. As shown in Fig. 4B, the activity of MMP-9-cat-FLAG was inhibited by APP-IP with a very high IC50 value (250 μm), suggesting that the catalytic domain contains structural elements unfavorable for its interaction with APP-IP. To explore the region that contains the unfavorable elements, we constructed chimeric mutants that consisted of various N-terminal parts of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and the remaining C-terminal parts of that of MMP-9 (Fig. 4A), and susceptibilities of their activities to APP-IP inhibition were compared. As shown in Fig. 4B, the activities of the mutants, named M2n-57-M9c and M2n-84-M9c, which, respectively, consist of residues 1-56 and 1-83 of MMP-2, and residues 57-162 and 84-162 of MMP-9, were inhibited by APP-IP with almost the same IC50 value as that for the inhibition of MMP-9-cat-FLAG. Compared with these mutants, M2n-95-M9c showed about a 660-fold greater affinity for APP-IP (IC50 = 380 nm), suggesting that the region corresponding to residues 84-95 of the catalytic domain of MMP-9 contains the unfavorable elements. In this region, only four amino acid residues at positions 88, 91, 93, and 94 are different between MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 5A). To examine which residues are responsible for the unfavorable elements, we replaced these residues of MMP-9-cat-FLAG with the corresponding residues of MMP-2 as shown in Fig. 5A. When these four residues of MMP-2 were grafted into MMP-9-cat-FLAG, the resultant mutant, named MMP-9-cat(84-95M2), showed 195-fold enhanced affinity for APP-IP (IC50 = 1.3 μm) compared with that of MMP-9-cat-FLAG (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, replacement of the individual residue Pro88 with Ala or Gln94 with Gly led to an 8.9- or 22-fold reduction in the IC50 value, respectively, whereas replacement of Pro91 with Thr did not affect the affinity. When both the Pro88 and Gln94 of MMP-9-cat-FLAG were replaced with Ala and Gly, respectively, the resultant mutant named MMP-9-cat(P88A/Q94G) and MMP-9-cat(84-95M2) showed almost the same affinity for APP-IP (Fig. 5B). Therefore, among the four residues, only Pro88 and Gln94 of the catalytic domain of MMP-9 are likely responsible for the unfavorable elements.FIGURE 5The effects of replacements of amino acid residues at positions 84-95 of chimeric mutants on their affinities for APP-IP.

Therefore, there is a need for novel modalities that will selectively target cancer cells while preserving neural function. Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) have a natural trophism for peripheral nerves. We hypothesized that oncolytic therapy using HSV engineered to minimize neurotoxicity would be appropriate for this clinical setting. Attenuated HSV (NV1023) injected to sciatic nerves of nude mice had no toxic effect on nerve function (n=30). NV1023 had significant oncolytic effect on prostate carcinoma cells (PC3, DU145, and LNCap) in vitro. An in vivo model of NI was established by implanting prostate carcinoma cells in the sciatic nerves of nude mice. Mice were treated with NV1023 or saline 7 days after establishment of tumors. Significant reduction in tumor size and inhibition of NI was found 6-8 wk after treatment (P<0.005). All animals treated with saline developed complete paralysis <5 wk post-treatment, whereas most NV1023-treated animals had preserved nerve function >12 wk after treatment (P<0.0001). We conclude that oncolytic therapy effectively treats prostate carcinomas with NI in an in vivo murine model while preserving neural function. These findings may hold significant clinical implications for patients with prostate cancer or other neurotrophic tumors."
