https://openalex.org/W2083633251,"A candidate gene for the chromosome 1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) locus was identified (STM2). The predicted amino acid sequence for STM2 is homologous to that of the recently cloned chromosome 14 AD gene (S182). A point mutation in STM2, resulting in the substitution of an isoleucine for an asparagine (N141l), was identified in affected people from Volga German AD kindreds. This N141l mutation occurs at an amino acid residue that is conserved in human S182 and in the mouse S182 homolog. The presence of missense mutations in AD subjects in two highly similar genes strongly supports the hypothesis that mutations in both are pathogenic."

https://openalex.org/W1991233288,"The majority of synapses in the mammalian cortex originate from cortical neurons. Indeed, the largest input to cortical cells comes from neighboring excitatory cells. However, most models of cortical development and processing do not reflect the anatomy and physiology of feedback excitation and are restricted to serial feedforward excitation. This report describes how populations of neurons in cat visual cortex can use excitatory feedback, characterized as an effective ""network conductance"", to amplify their feedforward input signals and demonstrates how neuronal discharge can be kept proportional to stimulus strength despite strong, recurrent connections that threaten to cause runaway excitation. These principles are incorporated into models of cortical direction and orientation selectivity that emphasize the basic design principles of cortical architectures."

The molecular basis of this gene-for-gene specificity is unknown. The Arabidopsis thaliana RPM1 gene enables dual specificity to pathogens expressing either of two unrelated Pseudomonas syringae avr genes. Despite this function, RPM1 encodes a protein sharing molecular features with recently described single-specificity R genes. Surprisingly, RPM1 is lacking from naturally occurring, disease-susceptible Arabidopsis accessions."

Resonance light scattering is shown to be a sensitive and selective method for studying electronically coupled chromophore arrays. The approach is illustrated with several examples drawn from porphyrin and chlorin chemistry. The physical principles underlying resonance light scattering are discussed, and the advantages and limitations of the technique are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W1971931358,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors are the principal mediators of synaptic inhibition, and yet when intensely activated, dendritic GABAA receptors excite rather than inhibit neurons. The membrane depolarization mediated by GABAA receptors is a result of the differential, activity-dependent collapse of the opposing concentration gradients of chloride and bicarbonate, the anions that permeate the GABAA ionophore. Because this depolarization diminishes the voltage-dependent block of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by magnesium, the activity-dependent depolarization mediated by GABA is sufficient to account for frequency modulation of synaptic NMDA receptor activation. Anionic gradient shifts may represent a mechanism whereby the rate and coherence of synaptic activity determine whether dendritic GABAA receptor activation is excitatory or inhibitory."

Linkage to known AD-related loci on chromosomes 21 and 14 has been excluded. Significant evidence for linkage to AD in these families was obtained with D1S479 and there was also positive evidence for linkage with other markers in the region. A 112-base pair allele of D1S479 co-segregated with the disease in five of seven families, which is consistent with a common genetic founder.

However, its application has been limited to a few low molecular weight compounds because of the extremely low permeability of human skin. Low-frequency ultrasound was shown to increase the permeability of human skin to many drugs, including high molecular weight proteins, by several orders of magnitude, thus making transdermal administration of these molecules potentially feasible. It was possible to deliver and control therapeutic doses of proteins such as insulin, interferon gamma, and erythropoeitin across human skin. Low-frequency ultrasound is thus a potential noninvasive substitute for traditional methods of drug delivery, such as injections."

https://openalex.org/W2132023176,"In the molecular scheme of living organisms, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP or cAMP) has been a universal second messenger. In eukaryotic cells, the primary receptors for cAMP are the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The crystal structure of a 1-91 deletion mutant of the type I alpha regulatory subunit was refined to 2.8 A resolution. Each of the two tandem cAMP binding domains provides an extensive network of hydrogen bonds that buries the cyclic phosphate and the ribose between two beta strands that are linked by a short alpha helix. Each adenine base stacks against an aromatic ring that lies outside the beta barrel. This structure provides a molecular basis for understanding how cAMP binds cooperatively to its receptor protein, thus mediating activation of the kinase."

INTRODUCTIONThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS), 1The abbreviations used are: RASrenin-angiotensin systemATangiotensinAIIangiotensin IIbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)ESembryonic stemPCRpolymerase chain reaction. composed of renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, is believed to be one of the most important regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis(1Hall J.E. Guyton A.C. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Management. Raven Press, New York1990: 1105-1129Google Scholar). A potent vasoconstrictor octapeptide angiotensin (AT) II (AII), the bioactive product of RAS, exerts numerous physiological responses through its specific receptors located on the plasma membrane. Pharmacological studies have revealed that there are two different types of AII receptors, AT1 and AT2, in mammalians and that the above responses are mainly mediated through AT1 receptors(2Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chui A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, AT1 receptors are situated as the two isoforms, designed AT1a and AT1b, at two different loci, which are 94% identical at the amino acid level and pharmacologically indistinguishable from each other(3Iwai N. Inagami T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).Our previous studies illustrated that the overproduction of AII in transgenic mice carrying both the human renin gene and the human angiotensinogen gene (Tsukuba hypertensive mice) leads to a sustained increase in blood pressure (4Fukamizu A. Sugimura K. Takimoto E. Sugiyama F. Seo M.S. Takahashi S. Hatae T. Kajiwara N. Yagami K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11617-11621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that mice with a null mutation of the angiotensinogen gene display chronic hypotension and a dramatic increase in renin mRNA levels in the kidney, due to the complete loss of angiotensin signals(5Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F. Goto Y. Ishida J. Takimoto E. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31334-31337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These clearly show that RAS plays an indispensable role in the maintenance of blood pressure under physiological conditions. However, it has not yet been determined which types of AT receptors are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and renin gene expression.In the present study, to clarify the functional importance of AT1a-mediated signal transduction pathways and the cellular localization of the receptor expression, we generated mutant mice in which the AT1a receptor gene was disrupted by replacing with the β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene such that lacZ activity is under the transcriptional control of the endogenous AT1a locus. We demonstrated that the AT1a receptor localized to glomerulus and juxtaglomerular apparatus of renal cortex and the homozygous mutant mice display hypotension and hyperreninemia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Targeting and Generation of Mutant MiceA genomic DNA phage library from C57BL/6 mouse was screened with a 416-bp human AT1 cDNA, which corresponds to the portion from the first methionine to the third transmembrane region as a probe. After screening of 5 × 105 phages, we isolated two clones encoding a complete open reading frame of the AT1a gene confirmed by sequencing(6Sasamura H. Hein L. Krieger J.E. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).To construct a targeting vector for the AT1a gene (Fig. 1A), an NcoI site was created around the nucleotide sequences including the translation initiation codon of the gene by the site-directed mutagenesis method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then the NcoI and PmaCI fragment of the gene was replaced with the lacZ cassette(7Saga Y. Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Sakakura T. Aizawa S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene cassettes possessing the promoter and polyadenylation signal from pMC1neoPoly(A) (Stratagene) were placed downstream of the lacZ gene in the opposite orientation. The 810-bp XhoI/NcoI fragment and the 4.0-kb PmaCI/BamHI fragment of the AT1a gene were included upstream and downstream of these cassettes, respectively. At the 3′ terminus of the homologous region, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene was inserted to negatively select by Ganciclovir (GANC, Syntex) for random integrations. The TT2 ES cells, derived from an F1 embryo between C57BL/6 and CBA mice, were grown on embryonic fibroblast feeder cells as described elsewhere(8Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Following electroporation of cells with 20 μg/ml linearized targeting vector (Bio-Rad gene pulser at settings of 400 V and 125 microfarads), cells were selected in 225 μg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml GANC. Homologous recombination in ES cells was checked by PCR using the recombination-specific primer set. ES clones positive for PCR analysis were further analyzed by Southern blot analysis; after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI, size separation in a 0.8% agarose gel, and transfer to nylon membrane, generation of an 8.0-kb wild-type and a 6.8-kb mutant fragment was identified by probes A and B. The absence of additional random integrations of the targeting construct was confirmed by hybridization with a neo probe (probe C).Chimeric mice were generated by injecting the ES cells into ICR 8-cell embryos(8Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Chimeric males with greater than 50% agouti coat color were bred to ICR females, and germline transmission of the mutant allele was identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from F1 offspring with agouti coat color. The heterozygous mice were interbred to obtain mice homozygous for the AT1a gene disruption.Histological AnalysisFor in situ hybridization, samples were immediately frozen at −60°C and cut into 15-μm cryostat sections. The 490-bp SacI/PmaCI fragment and the 520-bp SacI/SpeI fragment, which correspond to 3′-untranslated regions of AT1a and AT1b, respectively, were used as the subtype-specific probes to prevent the cross-hybridization. Each subtype-specific region for AT1a and AT1b was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). Antisense and sense probes were made by in vitro transcription in the presence of digoxigenin-labeled dUTP. In situ hybridization using the digoxigenin-labeled probes was performed as described previously(9Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Takagi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For lacZ staining, samples were fixed in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at room temperature and treated in 30% sucrose for 12 h at 4°C. 10-μm frozen sections were stained at 37°C for 1-3 h in a solution containing 0.4 mg/ml Bluo-Gal (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mM K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mM MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from the kidneys of six independent age-matched mice using ISOGEN (NipponGene) based on the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method(10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of RNA were denatured with formamide, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The 490-bp SacI/PmaCI fragment that corresponds to 3′-untranslated regions of AT1a was used as the AT1a receptor-specific probe. Probes for mouse renin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were previously described(11Tanimoto K. Tamura K. Sugiyama F. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 39: 19-24Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Measurement of Plasma Renin ActivitiesBlood samples were withdrawn from wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous mutant (−/−) mice (88-94 days). Blood was collected into ice-cold microcentrifuge tubes containing EDTA, which were then immediately centrifuged in order to isolate the plasma fraction. The plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay. The concentration of inactive renin was determined by subtraction of angiotensin I cleaved by the plasma renin with or without the treatment of proteinase activations as described previously(12Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Measurement of Blood PressureWild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous mutant (−/−) mice at the age of 56-62 days were used for blood pressure measurement. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured by a programmable sphygmomanometer (BP-200, Softron, Japan) using the tail cuff method as described previously(4Fukamizu A. Sugimura K. Takimoto E. Sugiyama F. Seo M.S. Takahashi S. Hatae T. Kajiwara N. Yagami K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11617-11621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis for comparison of blood pressure was performed by using Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGeneration of AT1a Receptor-deficient MiceTo generate a null mutation of the AT1a gene, we designed a targeting vector that would replace the complete AT1a coding region with the promoterless lacZ gene (Fig. 1A). After electroporation of TT2 cells with the targeting vector, homologous recombination was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization analyses (Fig. 1B). Three independent cell lines out of 330 G418 and GANC-resistant cells had undergone homologous recombination at the AT1a locus. These clones were injected into ICR 8-cell embryos to generate chimeric mice, and two clones gave rise to germline transmission. After confirmation of the transmission of the mutations into germ cells, the heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous offspring, and the mutation at AT1a receptor loci was detected by genomic Southern analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1C). Of the 396 offspring analyzed, 82 (21%) were homozygous for the disrupted allele, and 121 (31%) were wild type, indicating normal embryonic development of the homozygous mutant mice. In the following study, to make equivalence in the effects of other gene backgrounds except for the AT1a gene, we used these intercrossed littermates of heterozygous mice for further physiological experiments.To confirm if the lacZ gene would be inserted in-frame starting from the translational initiation codon of the AT1a gene and expressed under the control of the regulatory element of that gene, we compared the lacZ staining with the signals of specified expression of AT1a mRNA. In the heterozygous mice, the strong lacZ staining was identified in the glomerulus and juxtaglomerular apparatus of the renal cortex (Fig. 2, A and E). The localization of lacZ staining in the heterozygous mice coincided with that of the signals obtained by in situ hybridization using the antisense cRNA probe for the AT1a-specific region in the wild-type (Fig. 2B) and the heterozygous mice (data not shown). No signals using the antisense probe specific for the AT1b region (Fig. 2C) or the sense probe for the AT1a-specific region (Fig. 2D) were detected in the heterozygous mice. These results are in good agreement with those found by in situ hybridization studies using AT1a-specific 35S-labeled riboprobes (13Gasc J-M. Shanmugam S. Sibony M. Corvol P. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Healy D.P. Ye M-q. Troyanovskaya M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F220-F226PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate the regulated lacZ expression under control of the endogenous AT1a promoter.Figure 2:lacZ staining and in situ hybridization of AT1a receptor in renal cortex from wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice. The lacZ staining in heterozygous mutant mice was observed in glomeruli, juxtaglomerular apparatus, and proximal tubules (A). Especially, the strong signals were obtained in mesangial cells and afferent and efferent arterioles (D). The localization of the lacZ staining in the heterozygous mice coincided with that of the signals obtained by in situ hybridization using the antisense cRNA probe for the AT1a-specific region in the wild-type (B) and the heterozygous mice (data not shown). No signal using the antisense probe for the AT1b-specific region (C) or the sense probe for the AT1a-specific region (D) was detected in glomeruli of the heterozygous mice.

To test the effect of AT1a gene disruption on blood pressure, we measured blood pressure of the AT1a-deficient mice by a tail cuff method. A significant decrease in both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in the heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice with 10 and 22 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure, respectively, than that of the wild-type littermates, and the systolic blood pressure in the homozygous mutant mice decreased to 77% of that in the wild-type mice (Fig. 3). The decreased blood pressure was also observed in mice with AT1a receptor mutation (15Ito M. Oliverio M.I. Mannon P.J. Best C.F. Maeda N. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Corvol P. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In our previous study, a drastic increase in renin mRNA levels was found in the kidney of mice with the targeted disruption of angiotensinogen gene, due to the lack of a negative feedback regulation by AII(5Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F. Goto Y. Ishida J. Takimoto E. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31334-31337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, one could expect that the shut-off of AT1a receptor-mediated signalings may elicit an up-regulation of the renin gene expression in the AT1a receptor-deficient mice. To test this possibility, we first confirmed the levels of expression of AT1a receptor in the kidney RNA from the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice by Northern blotting (Fig. 4A). The hybridization signals of AT1a receptor appeared in the heterozygous mice at approximately half the levels present in the wild type, whereas the homozygous mice had no detectable transcripts. A duplicate blot was analyzed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe to confirm that the RNA sample was intact. These results indicated that the AT1a receptor mRNA was completely absent from the homozygous mutant mice.Figure 4:Northern blot analysis (A) and plasma renin activity (B) of the mutant mice. A, 10 μg of total RNA, isolated from the kidneys of six independent age-matched adult mutant mice, were hybridized with either a 3′-untranslated AT1a-specific probe, renin probe, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe.

Northern blot analysis of kidney RNA from wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice revealed that the level of renin mRNA markedly increased in the homozygous mutant mice in comparison with that in the heterozygous mutant and wild-type mice (Fig. 4A). Consequently the plasma concentration of active renin increased 7-8-fold in the homozygous mutant mice compared with that found in the heterozygous mutant and wild-type mice, and most of its plasma renin activity was detected as an active form (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that the homozygous mice display hyperreninemia and suggested that the function of AT1a is dominant regarding the regulation of renin gene expression because AII can suppress it even in the heterozygous mice.In conclusion, we generated a line of mutant mice in which the AT1a receptor gene was disrupted by replacing with the lacZ gene. In the heterozygous mutant mice, the strong lacZ staining was identified in the glomerulus and juxtaglomerular apparatus of the renal cortex. Both the expression levels of renin mRNAs in the kidney and plasma renin activity were not significantly different between the heterozygous mutant and wild-type mice but were markedly increased in the homozygous mutant mice. On the contrary, a significant decrease in blood pressure was observed in the heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. These results demonstrated that an AT1a-mediated signal transduction pathway is, at least in part, involved in the regulation of blood pressure and renin gene expression. Our mice with the replacement of AT1a receptor gene by the lacZ under the control of AT1a endogenous promoter should be useful to further investigate the specific function of AT1a receptor, such as the developmental expression of this gene and the precise identification of the AT1a production site in the central nervous systems under pharmacological conditions.

However, it has not yet been determined which types of AT receptors are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and renin gene expression.In the present study, to clarify the functional importance of AT1a-mediated signal transduction pathways and the cellular localization of the receptor expression, we generated mutant mice in which the AT1a receptor gene was disrupted by replacing with the β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene such that lacZ activity is under the transcriptional control of the endogenous AT1a locus. We demonstrated that the AT1a receptor localized to glomerulus and juxtaglomerular apparatus of renal cortex and the homozygous mutant mice display hypotension and hyperreninemia."
https://openalex.org/W2045676110,"Anandamide, an endogenous arachidonic acid derivative that is released from neurons and activates cannabinoid receptors, may act as a transcellular cannabimimetic messenger in the central nervous system. The biological actions of anandamide and the identity of its target cells are, however, still poorly documented. Here we show that anandamide is a potent inhibitor of gap-junction conductance and dye permeability in striatal astrocytes. This inhibitory effect is specific for anandamide as compared to co-released congeners or structural analogues, is sensitive to pertussis toxin and to protein-alkylating agents, and is neither mimicked by cannabinoid-receptor agonists nor prevented by a cannabinoid-receptor antagonist. Glutamate released from neurons evokes calcium waves in astrocytes that propagate via gap junctions, and may, in turn, activate neurons distant from their initiation sites in astrocytes. We find that anandamide blocks the propagation of astrocyte calcium waves generated by either mechanical stimulation or local glutamate application. Thus, by regulating gap-junction permeability, anandamide may control intercellular communication in astrocytes and therefore neuron-glial interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2026247264,"The relative orientations of carbon monoxide (CO) bound to and photodissociated from myoglobin in solution have been determined with time-resolved infrared polarization spectroscopy. The bound CO is oriented < or = 7 degrees from the heme normal, corresponding to nearly linear FE-C-O. Upon dissociation from the Fe, CO becomes trapped in a docking site that orientationally constrains it to lie approximately in the plane of the heme. Because the bound and ""docked"" CO are oriented in nearly orthogonal directions CO binding from the docking site is suppressed. These solutions results help to establish how myoglobin discriminates against CO, a controversial issue dominated by the misconception that Fe-C-O is bent."

https://openalex.org/W2079755469,"Object-centered spatial awareness--awareness of the location, relative to an object, of its parts--plays an important role in many aspects of perception, imagination, and action. One possible basis for this capability is the existence in the brain of neurons with sensory receptive fields or motor action fields that are defined relative to an object-centered frame. In experiments described here, neuronal activity was monitored in the supplementary eye field of macaque monkeys making eye movements to the right or left end of a horizontal bar. Neurons were found to fire differentially as a function of the end of the bar to which an eye movement was made. This is direct evidence for the existence of neurons sensitive to the object-centered direction of movements."

https://openalex.org/W1964832063,"Protein reaction kinetics in aqueous solution at room temperature are often simplified by the thermal averaging of conformational substates. These substates exhibit widely varying reaction rates that are usually exposed by trapping in a glass at low temperature. Here, it is shown that the solvent viscosity, rather than the low temperature, is primarily responsible for the trapping. This was demonstrated by placement of myoglobin in a glass at room temperature and subsequent observation of inhomogeneous reaction kinetics. The high solvent viscosity slowed the rate of crossing the energy barriers that separated the substates and also suppressed any change in the average protein conformation after ligand dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1973282880,"An aspartic acid residue has been introduced near ring V of the L-side accessory bacteriochlorophyll (BCHlL) or the photosynthetic reaction center in a rhodobacter capsulatus mutant in which a His also replaces Leu 212 on the M-polypeptide. The initial stage of charge separation in the G(M201)D/L(M212)H double mutant yields approximately 70 percent electron transfer to the L-side cofactors, approximately 15 percent rapid deactivation to the ground state, and approximately 15 percent electron transfer to the so-called inactive M-side bacteriopheophytin (BPhM). It is suggested here that the Asp introduced at M201 modulates the reduction potential of BCHlL, thereby changing the energetics of charge separation. The results demonstrate that an individual amino acid residue can, through its influence on the free energies of the charge-separated states, effectively dictate the balance between the forward electron transfer reactions on the L-side of the RC, the charge-recombination processes, and electron transfer to the M-side chromophores."

Previously, we identified tyrosines 492 and 493 of ZAP-70 as being sites of in vivo phosphorylation in response to T cell receptor engagement. To determine the role of phosphorylation in regulating ZAP-70 activity, we mutated each of these tyrosines individually to phenylalanine. When expressed in COS cells, Y493F-mutated ZAP-70 demonstrated normal basal kinase activity, but, unlike wild type ZAP-70, could not be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation induced by incubation with pervanadate or by co-expression of constitutively activated Lck. This suggests that Tyr-493 phosphorylation is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation-induced activation of ZAP-70. The Y492F mutation resulted in 4-fold higher basal kinase activity, which could be stimulated further by tyrosine phosphorylation.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a morphologically and biochemically defined form of active cell death, distinct from necrosis, that occurs in many cell types and organisms. It is characterized by a set of cellular events such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Recently, it has become clear that apoptosis plays an important role in early development, homeostasis, and in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (for review, see 5Ellis R.E.

Apoptosis of cells can occur in response to many stimuli, such as glucocorticoid, ionizing radiation, growth factor deprivation, and the activation of Fas antigen by the Fas ligand or anti-Fas antibodies. Apoptosis is mediated through multiple pathways that involve a complex array of biochemical regulators and molecular interactions. It has been best characterized genetically in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, in which 131 cells undergo apoptosis during development. Among the 14 genes identified that function in different steps of apoptosis in the worm, ced-3 and ced-4 genes are indispensable for cell death to occur (5Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev.

This cytosolic protease activity had properties resembling ICE, as it required an Asp at the substrate P1 position and was inhibited by a tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor of ICE (15Lazebnik Y.A.

These results suggested that a protease resembling ICE (prICE), may be involved in apoptosis of mammalian cells and that prICE may function as a mammalian equivalent of ced-3. This conclusion has prompted intensive investigations to identify an ICE homolog that would be singularly responsible for cleaving PARP during apoptosis. Recently, several mammalian ICE homologs with conserved active site residues have been cloned and sequenced. These include Nedd-2/Ich-1L, TX, and CPP32. Overexpression of each of these ICE homologs induces apoptosis in transfected cells (6Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan E. Blanchet A.-M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R. Lippke J.

Among these, TX encodes a cysteine protease that has the highest resemblance to ICE with a more than 50% sequence identity, while Nedd-2/Ich-1L has a 30% overall protein sequence identity to ICE. In addition, an alternately spliced Ich-1 mRNA encodes a C-terminally truncated protein ICH-1S that appears to function in an anti-apoptotic manner (21Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). We have investigated the cleavage of PARP by ICE, TX, and Nedd-2 in transfected cells and in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that ICE, as well as TX and Nedd-2, are capable of cleaving PARP, consistent with their ability to induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Plasmids for the expression of full-length or the T7-tagged p30 form of human ICE or TX proteins were described previously (6Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan E. Blanchet A.-M. Miossec C. Herve F.

A 5′ end 1-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library using primers 1 and 2. This fragment was re-amplified with primers 3 and 4 to provide a T7-tag at the N terminus. The amplified DNA was then digested with XbaI and EcoRI and joined with an EcoRI-digested 2-kb 3′ end fragment amplified from a human leukocyte cDNA library with primers 5 and 6 and re-amplified by nested PCR using primers 7 and 8.

Briefly, COS cells in 6-well culture plates were transfected with 3 μg each of plasmid DNA. The cells were harvested 24 h after the transfection, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (6Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan E. Blanchet A.-M. Miossec C. Herve F.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography and densitometry. The prICE activity that cleaves PARP during apoptosis represents a possible candidate for the mammalian equivalent of C. elegans cell death gene ced-3. We developed a co-transfection assay in COS cells to test if any of the known ICE-like proteases would cleave PARP in vivo. We isolated human PARP cDNA from human cDNA libraries by polymerase chain reaction. Two PARP clones were used in these experiments: a full-length clone (PARP(F)) encoding a polypeptide of 1014 amino acids and a truncated form (PARP(T)) containing the N-terminal 337 amino acid residues that spans most of the DNA-binding domain and contains the identified prICE cleavage site (Asp214-Gly215). Both the full-length and the truncated forms of PARP contain a short T7 epitope tag fused to their N termini, allowing for the detection of these proteins and their cleavage products on Western blots by an anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 1A) (6Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan E. Blanchet A.-M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R. Lippke J. Rocher C. Westwood R. Su M. Livingston D. Hercend T. Lalanne J.-L. EMBO J. 1995; 9: 1914-1922Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We first co-transfected a plasmid encoding PARP(F) or PARP(T) with a plasmid encoding either an N-terminally truncated p30 version of ICE or a similarly truncated ICE homolog into COS cells by transient transfection. Expression and cleavage of PARP proteins as well as the expression and autoprocessing of ICE or ICE homologs were investigated by Western blots. As we have reported previously (6Faucheu C. Diu A. Chan E. Blanchet A.-M. Miossec C. Herve F. Collard-Dutilleul V. Gu Y. Aldape R. Lippke J. Rocher C. Westwood R. Su M. Livingston D. Hercend T. Lalanne J.-L. EMBO J. 1995; 9: 1914-1922Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar), T7-tagged p30 ICE or TX autoprocesses into p20 forms. We observed a similar processing of T7-tagged p30 Nedd-2 (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, when co-expressed with any of these proteases in COS cells, either the full-length (116 kDa) or the truncated form of PARP (43 kDa) was cleaved into a T7-tagged 31-kDa fragment, consistent with processing at the previously identified cleavage site (Fig. 1B). Similarly, cleavage of PARP was observed in co-transfection experiments with full-length (p45) ICE or TX (data not shown). The cleavage was specific since active site mutations in ICE or TX that abolish their autoprocessing (8Gu Y. Wu J. Faucheu C. Lalanne J.-L. Diu A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. EMBO J. 1995; 9: 1923-1931Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) also abolish PARP cleavage (data not shown). In addition, co-expression of the viral protein CrmA inhibited the cleavage. These results were consistent with either a direct intracellular processing of PARP by ICE, TX, or Nedd-2, or alternatively, these proteases were activating an as yet unidentified COS cell protease that in turn cleaves PARP. One line of evidence that suggested that ICE or TX was cleaving PARP directly came from co-transfection experiments in which COS cells were transfected with a fixed amount of PARP plasmid plus increasing amounts of ICE or TX plasmids (Fig. 1C). We observed that PARP cleavage was directly proportional to the expression level of ICE or TX in the cells. We also observed that ICE was slightly more potent than TX in cleaving PARP, consistent with their relative abilities in inducing apoptosis in transfected cells. *2Y. Gu, unpublished results. The direct correlation between the ICE/TX protease levels and PARP cleavage suggested that ICE or TX was cleaving PARP directly rather than indirectly by activating another protease. To confirm that ICE can cleave PARP directly, we set up an in vitro cleavage assay using highly purified recombinant human ICE (22Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

We observed that incubation of IVTT PARP with purified ICE resulted in the cleavage of the 43-kDa PARP(T) into two fragments (approximately 31 and 12 kDa) similar to that observed in the COS cell co-transfection assay (Fig. 2). At high ICE concentrations, the 31-kDa fragment was apparently cleaved further into two smaller fragments of approximately 21 and 10 kDa. This in vitro cleavage of PARP was time- and enzyme concentration-dependent. PARP cleavage could be observed within 10 min after the addition of purified ICE, and it increases linearly for the first 30 min (data not shown). When we compared the enzyme concentration dependence of PARP cleavage with that of pre-IL-1β (also prepared by IVTT) at an equivalent substrate concentration, we found that a 50-100-fold higher concentration of ICE was required to cleave PARP than to process pre-IL-1β (Fig. 2). We confirmed the specificity of in vitro PARP cleavage by ICE by the inclusion of specific ICE inhibitors in the reactions (Fig. 3). Two ICE inhibitors were used in the experiments: Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone (Cbz-VAD-CH2-DCB). Both compounds are potent inhibitors of ICE in vitro (20Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G.. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O.

Chem. 1994; 37: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the assay (75 nM active ICE), Cbz-VAD-CH2-DCB, an irreversible inhibitor, completely inhibited the cleavage activity at an approximately equimolar concentration to the enzyme (78 nM). Inhibition by Ac-YVAD-CHO, a reversible inhibitor, was concentration-dependent with complete inhibition at 260 nM. Similar experiments with partially purified TX protease also showed cleavage of PARP (data not shown). Thus, these results demonstrate that PARP is a substrate for ICE, TX, and Nedd-2, consistent with observations that all these proteins can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in transfected cells. Our results are in contradistinction to those reported by 15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar, who observed no cleavage of bovine PARP by purified human ICE in vitro. Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that human ICE does not recognize bovine PARP as a substrate, we would suggest that this apparent discrepancy most likely arises from our observation that it requires 50-100-fold higher ICE concentrations to cleave PARP than to cleave pre-IL-1β. Similarly, by comparing apoptosis induction by ICE cDNA constructs under the control of different strength promoters, we have observed that high expression levels of ICE or TX are required to induce apoptosis in transfected COS cells.2 The requirement for an increased amount of enzyme may indicate that PARP is not a substrate for ICE in normal cells under physiological conditions and that apoptosis induced by ICE or ICE-like proteases in transfected cells may be due to promiscuous hydrolysis by these proteases. Induction of apoptosis by overexpression of ICE homologs, therefore, is insufficient evidence for claiming a role for a specific protease in apoptosis of normal cells. There is increasing evidence, however, that ICE homologs may function selectively within the cell. We observed that TX and Nedd-2 have no detectable activity toward pre-IL-1β even when they are overexpressed at very high levels in COS cells. Furthermore, thymocytes from ICE-deficient mice fail to respond to the Fas-mediated apoptosis (13Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), indicating that ICE may play a physiological role in cell death in normal cells. We propose that apoptotic signals can lead to an increase in the intracellular ICE-like protease activity, either by increased expression or activation. Indeed, 16Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar have observed an increase in ICE-like protease activity in apoptotic cells triggered by an anti-Fas antibody. These results suggest that there may be an intracellular control mechanism to protect normal cells expressing ICE-like proteases from being driven into apoptosis under normal conditions. In this regard, it is interesting to note that intact IL-1β-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as the monocytic THP.1 cells, contain a large amount of ICE protein in the inactive precursor form. Upon cell lysis, these precursor proteins are readily processed to the active p20/p10 form (1Ayala J.M. Yamin T.-T. Egger L.A. Chin J. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent inhibition of ICE autoprocessing indicates that ICE activity in these monocytes may be tightly regulated by posttranslational mechanisms. PARP is one of the few polypeptides yet identified that is processed during apoptosis and is the only one for which a cleavage sequence has been reported (15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Although no causal link has been established between PARP cleavage and apoptosis, it is interesting that PARP is cleaved next to an Asp residue at a site identical to one of the two ICE cleavage sites in pre-IL-1β and that it is cleaved by a protease with properties similar to ICE. Outside of the ICE/ced-3 family of cysteine proteases, only one other eukaryotic protease (granzyme B, a serine protease involved in cytotoxic T-cell-induced apoptosis) is known to have a similar substrate cleavage specificity (18Odake S.

The discovery that PARP can be cleaved directly by ICE, TX, and Nedd-2, all of which are able to induce apoptosis in overexpressing cells, further strengthens the correlation between PARP cleavage and apoptosis.

[14C]Acetic acid (sodium salt, 56 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Life Science (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Culture media and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Thin layer chromatography plates were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All the other chemical agents were obtained from Sigma. Human normal (IMR 90) and Zellweger syndrome (GM 4340) fibroblasts, obtained from the Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ), were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 0, cells were plated in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

On day 3, cells were pulsed with 25 μCi of [14C]acetate in ethanol (<1% final concentration) for 7 min at 37°C. The medium was then removed and the label was chased by the addition of fresh medium A containing 10 mM sodium acetate for the indicated times. Cells were then washed twice in the assay buffer (310 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at 25°C. Cholesterol oxidase (0.5 IU/ml) was added in the assay buffer, and the cells were incubated for 3 min at 25°C(14Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay buffer was removed, and the cells were immediately extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen, resuspended with chloroform/methanol (1:1), and applied together with standards to a Silica Gel-G TLC plate. Plates were developed in hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (87:20:1, v/v) and visualized with I2 vapor. Spots were scraped and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to reach 10,000 counts. Phosphodiester oligonucleotides, including SCP-2 antisense (5′-AAAACCCATCTTGTA-3′), sense (5′-TACAAGATGGGTTTT-3′), and missense (5′-AATTCAACTCTGTTC-3′), were synthesized by Chiron Corporation (Emeryville, CA) and purified on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Confluent normal fibroblasts were cultured in serum-free DMEM, and SCP-2 antisense, sense, or missense were added directly to the cultured medium at 10 μM final concentration. This treatment was repeated once daily for up to 5 days. Cell monolayers were harvested by trypsinization, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer. Aliquots containing 50 μg of proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Polyclonal anti-rat SCP-2 antisera 2Polyclonal antibody against SCP-2 (26Baum C.L. Kansal S. Davidson N.O. J.

Baum (Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology Section, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). binding was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Life Science). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Klin. Chem. Klin. Biochem. 1974; 12: 403-408PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Student's t test. The possibility that SCP-2 serves as a carrier protein for newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane was investigated in normal and SCP-2-deficient (Zellweger syndrome) fibroblasts. After 72 h of culture in medium A, normal and SCP-2-deficient cells showed similar rates of cholesterol synthesis. The maximal values of newly synthesized cholesterol in the plasma membrane of normal fibroblasts were observed 10 min after the beginning of the pulse, decreasing rapidly thereafter (Fig. 1). By contrast, the maximal values of radiolabeled cholesterol were found only 20 min after the beginning of the pulse in the plasma membrane of SCP-2-deficient fibroblasts. It is noteworthy that the same amount of [14C]cholesterol was found 20 min after the pulse in both normal and SCP-2-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 1, inset). Immunoblot analysis, using a specific antiserum against SCP-2, confirmed the absence of SCP-2 in these Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Western blot analysis of normal and Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts. 50 μg of proteins of cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot.

None of these drugs altered cholesterol transfer in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the same drugs, used at equivalent concentrations, reduced significantly (37-66%) the transport of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane in SCP-2-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). In the last series of experiments, we treated normal fibroblasts with SCP-2 antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ initiation region of the SCP-2 coding sequence(17Yamamoto R. Kallen C.B. Babalola G.O. Rennert H. Billheimer J.T. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SCP-2 antisense treatment markedly reduced the total amount of both SCP-2 and its 58- and 40-kDa related proteins (Fig. 4), whereas treatment with control oligonucleotides (sense and missense) did not affect SCP-2 expression. In agreement with these results, the biosynthesis of SCP-2 and its related proteins was significantly lowered by 95%, 80%, and 91%, respectively, at 5 days of antisense treatment (data not shown). After 5 days of oligonucleotides treatment, cells were pulsed with [14C]acetate. As shown in Fig. 5, the relative percentage of [14C]cholesterol transported to the plasma membrane in the first 10 min was reduced by 81%, with a simultaneous increase of the radiolabeled cholesterol incorporation at 20 min after the beginning of the pulse. Such effect was not observed in sense- or missense-treated cells. When SCP-2 antisense-treated cells were incubated with colchicine, before the pulse with [14C] acetate, the values of [14C]cholesterol incorporated in the plasma membrane 20 min after the beginning of the pulse were reduced by 45% (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Effect of SCP-2 antisense oligonucleotides on newly synthesized cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane. Confluent normal fibroblasts received SCP-2 antisense, sense, or missense, for 5 days as described in the legend of Fig. 4. Cells cultured without oligonucleotides served as internal controls. The day of the experiment, cells were pulsed and chased for the indicated times. Experiments were conducted as described in Fig. 1. The maximal incorporation rates of [14C]acetate into total cell cholesterol of the different groups were (expressed as counts × min/106 cells): control cells, 3682 ± 405; antisense-treated cells, 3562 ± 701; antisense + colchicine-treated cells, 3428 ± 388; sense-treated cells, 3875 ± 241.

When the expression of SCP-2 is abolished, such as occurs in peroxisomes-deficient cells, or after SCP-2 antisense treatment, newly synthesized cholesterol reaches the plasma membrane through a slower, cytoskeleton- and Golgi-dependent route. Previous reports have shown that transfer of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane of animal cells is not affected by cytoskeleton- and Golgi-disrupting agents(8Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with present results in normal human fibroblasts. However, we found that both the cytoskeleton and the Golgi apparatus are partially required for cholesterol transport in SCP-2-deficient cells. These results support the possibility that two different mechanisms are involved in the transport of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane of normal and SCP-2-deficient cells. This possibility is supported by the evidence that, in normal cells, SCP-2 antisense treatment induced a shift of the maximal values of [14C]cholesterol transport from 10 to 20 min, and that this shift was reduced by colchicine. These observations suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may modulate the two routes and, when SCP-2 is absent, cholesterol leaves this organelle by the cytoskeleton/Golgi-dependent route. The molecular mechanisms by which the endoplasmic reticulum may direct cholesterol to one or the other route are unknown. It is noteworthy that the same amount of radiolabeled cholesterol was found 20 min after the pulse in both normal and SCP-2-deficient cells. In agreement with this result, normal and SCP-2-deficient fibroblasts showed comparable amounts of free cholesterol in the whole cell and in the plasma membrane (results not shown). We do not know if SCP-2-deficient cells remove cholesterol by increasing the number of vesicles leaving the endoplasmic reticulum, the mass of cholesterol per vesicle, or both. SCP-2 antisense treatment reduced the total amount of both SCP-2 and its 58- and 40-kDa related proteins. Both the 58- and 40-kDa proteins represent N-terminal extensions of SCP-2(11Pfeifer S.M. Furth E.E. Ohba T. Chang Y.J. Rennert H. Sakuragi N. Billheimer J.T. Strauss III, J.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Academic Press, San Diego1994: 483-502Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that SCP-2 is involved in cholesterol transport only for its affinity for sterols while other factors (i.e. docking proteins or cytoskeleton-independent vesicles) are carrying the cholesterol-SCP-2 complex to the final destination. Pre-Golgi cholesterol-enriched vesicles have been isolated previously (8Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Golgi apparatus contains substantial amounts of cholesterol, which is particularly enriched in the trans Golgi(22Orci L. Montesano R. Meda P. Malaisse-Lagae F. Brown D. Perrelet A. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).

Plasma membrane cholesterol is not evenly distributed throughout the bilayer but is instead localized into cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-poor domains(24Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Kier A.B.

We do not know if the SCP-2-dependent and the Golgi/cytoskeleton-dependent routes are carrying cholesterol to any specific plasma membrane domains, and if they are playing a specific role in reverse cholesterol transport. These possibilities would imply the presence of docking proteins, or receptors in the plasma membrane, and would give a functional role to the two different routes of intracellular cholesterol transport.

The homolog in yeast, Gal6, has recently been identified and found to bind DNA and to act as a repressor in the Gal4 regulatory system. The crystal structure of Gal6 at 2.2 A resolution reveals a hexameric structure with a prominent central channel. The papain-like active sites are situated within the central channel, in a manner resembling the organization of active sites in the proteasome. The Gal6 channel is lined with 60 lysine residues from the six subunits, suggesting a role in DNA binding. The carboxyl-terminal arm of Gal6 extends into the active site cleft and may serve a regulatory function. Rather than each residing in distinct, separable domains, the protease and DNA-binding activities appear structurally intertwined in the hexamer, implying a coupling of these two activities."

In contrast, a symmetrical complex formed between one GroEL and two GroES oligomers, with substrate protein binding to the outer surface of GroEL, was recently proposed to be the functional chaperonin unit. Electron microscopic and biochemical analyses have now shown that unphysiologically high magnesium concentrations and increased pH are required to assemble symmetrical complexes, the formation of which precludes the association of unfolded polypeptide. Thus, the functional significance of GroEL:(GroES)2 particles remains to be demonstrated."

INTRODUCTIONDeoxycytidylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) catalyzes the deamination of dCMP to dUMP, a reaction that provides the nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45). The activity of the enzyme is allosterically regulated by the ratio of dCTP to dTTP not only in eukaryotic cells but also in T-even phage-infected Escherichia coli, with dCTP acting as an activator and dTTP an inhibitor (9Maley F. Maley G.F. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1972; 5: 177-228Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar; 10Maley F. Maley G.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 49-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since the deaminase and the synthase are elevated in rapidly dividing cells, such as those associated with tumors, embryos (7Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2975-2980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and regenerating liver (8Maley F. Maley G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2968-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a role for these enzymes in DNA replication is clearly implied. Evidence supporting this thesis has been obtained in studies with cells that are deficient in the deaminase (2Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1980; 255: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in altered intracellular dCTP and dTTP pools and an increase in mutation rate (16Sargent R.G. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 12Meuth M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar; 6Kohalmi S.E. Glattke M.

Because of the potential significance of this enzyme to the fidelity of replication and its role in providing substrates for DNA synthesis, dCMP deaminase might serve as a useful target for inhibitors that complement the inhibition of thymidylate synthase.We have recently cloned the human dCMP deaminase cDNA and expressed the functional protein in E. coli (19Weiner K.X.B.

Maley and E. Chu, unpublished data. similar to that described for thymidylate synthase (4Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. Elwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe human lung fibroblast (WI38) genomic library, which was a partial Sau3A1 digest inserted at the XhoI site of the λFIX II vector, was purchased from Stratagene (Palo Alto, CA). Although the XhoI restriction site was not reformed by the insertion, inserts could, however, be removed with NotI. Hybond-N nylon membranes ([α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP) were from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the molecular genetics core facility of the Wadsworth Center using a Millipore model 8750 DNA synthesizer.Isolation of Human dCMP Deaminase Gene ClonesScreening of the human lung fibroblast genomic library (1 × 106 recombinants) was performed according to standard procedures (1Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar; 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.47-9.55Google Scholar). Phage plaques were lifted in duplicate onto nylon membranes, denatured in 0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl, and neutralized in 1.5 M NaCl, 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The membranes were baked for 2 h at 80°C and prehybridized for 2 h at 42°C in 6 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 5 × Denhardt's solution (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.47-9.55Google Scholar), 1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridization was continued for 20 h in the same buffer with 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 32P-labeled pBluescript (Stratagene) (1 × 107 cpm/filter) containing the protein coding region of dCMP deaminase (designated pCD12 in 19Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Maley F. Maley G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12983-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque-purified, and phage DNA was isolated as described previously (11Maniatis T. Hraidson R.C. Lacy E. Lauer J. O'Connell C. Quon D. Sim G.K. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1978; 15: 687-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar; 20Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benziger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Southern blotting and DNA sequence analysis.DNA Isolation and Southern Blotting AnalysisHuman genomic DNA was isolated essentially as described by 3Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar. DNA was digested to completion with various restriction enzymes (10 units/μg of DNA) for 2 h at 37°C. Reaction mixtures were concentrated in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant). The restricted DNA was then electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel using the CHEF II pulse field apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) gel running buffer for 22 h with a 1-6-s ramped pulse time. DNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes essentially as described by 17Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21364) Google Scholar and probed with 32P-labeled pCD12 cDNA. Hybridization conditions were as described previously (18Weiner K.X.B. Pentecost B.P. Dias J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were exposed to Kodak X-OMat film with intensifying screens for 8 days at −70°C.DNA Sequence AnalysisThe dCMP deaminase genomic clones λCD7, λCD21, and λCD23 were digested with either SacI or XbaI to generate a series of overlapping fragments and subcloned into the pBluescript vector. The nucleotide sequence of these fragments was determined by the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52360) Google Scholar) using synthetic 18-21-mer oligonucleotides (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp). The various DNA fragments were linked as described in the DNASIS manual (Hitachi America, Ltd.).Localization of the Deoxycytidylate Deaminase Gene by Fluorescence in Situ HybridizationThe chromosomal location of this gene was performed by Bios Laboratories Inc., New Haven, CT. A genomic clone (λCD21) containing three of the exons of dCMP deaminase (Fig. 1) was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. The labeled probe was combined with 0.33 μg/μl sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal human metaphase cells in a solution containing 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, and 10% dextran sulfate. Normal human metaphase cells were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and bromodeoxyuridine-synchronized peripheral blood lymphocytes. Hybridization signals were detected with anti-digoxigenin fluorescein isothiocyanate; chromosomes were then counterstained with propidium iodide and analyzed. This experiment resulted in specific labeling of the most terminal portion of the long arm of a B-group chromosome. In order to distinguish whether this gene is located on chromosome 4 or 5, a probe was prepared that cohybridized specifically with the centromere of chromosome 4 and the genomic clone. A total of 90 metaphase cells were examined, 59 of which showed specific labeling of chromosome 4. This experiment clearly demonstrated that the centromere of chromosome 4 was labeled and that the gene which encodes dCMP deaminase is localized to band 4q35.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRestriction Fragment Analysis of the Human Fibroblast Genomic LibraryThe genomic library from human lung fibroblasts was restricted with BamHI, XbaI, EcoRI, and HindIII/BglII, and following pulse field electrophoresis in 1.0% agar it was subjected to a Southern analysis (17Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21364) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled human deaminase cDNA (pCD12) as the probe (18Weiner K.X.B. Pentecost B.P. Dias J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each digest yielded two radioactive bands, the first about 10-11 kb 2The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase(s). and the second varying from 8.1 for BamHI, 5.7 for XbaI, 3.0 for EcoRI, and 1.6 kb for HindIII/BglII. From what is known now about the DNA sequence of the CD gene and its restriction map, the two bands result from exon clustering at the 5′-end and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively, with a large intron interspersed (Fig. 1).Isolation of dCMP Deaminase Gene ClonesAbout 1 × 106 recombinants from the human lung fibroblast genomic library were screened with pCD12 (19Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Maley F. Maley G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12983-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which yielded three positive clones, λCD2, λCD7, and λCD21. The phage DNA was isolated from each clone, digested with NotI to release the insert, and analyzed by pulse field gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The sizes of the released inserts were 15 kb for λCD2, 17 kb for λCD7, and 17 kb for λCD21, respectively.Southern blot analysis was used to determine whether these three clones overlapped. The phage DNA from all three clones was digested with NotI, and the resulting restriction fragments were separated by pulse field electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and probed with various oligonucleotides to span the entire length of the deaminase cDNA. The results obtained revealed that λCD7 encompassed exons associated with the 5′-portion of the deaminase gene, and λCD21 contained exons associated with the 3′-end of the deaminase gene. λCD2 appeared to be included entirely within λCD21. Although λCD7 and λCD21 did not overlap, further probing of the genomic library yielded another clone, λCD23, which enabled the complete sequence to be obtained since it overlapped λCD7 and λCD21 (Fig. 1). The size of λCD23 was 17 kb, but Fig. 1 only depicts the region sequenced.Structural Organization of the dCMP Deaminase GeneStructural analysis of the three genomic clones revealed the deaminase gene to encompass about 26 kb of DNA. As shown in Table1 and Fig. 1 the gene contains five exons and four introns, with the introns located within the protein-coding region of the deaminase. Interestingly, intron 2 is quite large, containing 20 kb of DNA, which separates exon 2 from exon 3. All of the exons are quite small, averaging about 100 base pairs each, and are separated by introns containing their characteristic GT-AG signatures (Table1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab An analysis of the potential transcription factor binding sites within the 5′-flanking region of the deaminase gene as shown in Table2 revealed potential TATA and CAATT box binding motifs, as well as several potential AP-1 (Fos-Jun protein complex), SP-1 (GC box binding protein), and CTF/NF-1 DNA-binding sites (5Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). There are also three potential cAMP response elements as well as four half-sites for interaction with the estrogen receptor. Whether these DNA binding motifs function in vivo as cis-acting elements remains to be determined.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Chromosomal Location of the Deaminase GeneA dCMP deaminase probe (pCD21) was used to define the chromosomal locus of the deaminase gene, which was located at 4q35, the very end of this chromosome (Fig. 2). Deletions in this region may therefore have grave consequences for the organism. However, until such time as “gene knockout” experiments are performed, it will not be possible to know the extent to which deletions in this gene affect the organism. These studies are currently in progress.Figure 2:Chromosomal location of the deoxycytidylate deaminase gene as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONDeoxycytidylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) catalyzes the deamination of dCMP to dUMP, a reaction that provides the nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45).
