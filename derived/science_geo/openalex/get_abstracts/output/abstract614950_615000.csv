https://openalex.org/W2949808130,"Drosophila melanogaster has a rich repertoire of innate and learned behaviors. Its 100,000-neuron brain is a large but tractable target for comprehensive neural circuit mapping. Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2884681204,"The prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNP rs11672691 is positively associated with aggressive disease at diagnosis. We showed that rs11672691 maps to the promoter of a short isoform of long noncoding RNA PCAT19 (PCAT19-short), which is in the third intron of the long isoform (PCAT19-long). The risk variant is associated with decreased and increased levels of PCAT19-short and PCAT19-long, respectively. Mechanistically, the risk SNP region is bifunctional with both promoter and enhancer activity. The risk variants of rs11672691 and its LD SNP rs887391 decrease binding of transcription factors NKX3.1 and YY1 to the promoter of PCAT19-short, resulting in weaker promoter but stronger enhancer activity that subsequently activates PCAT19-long. PCAT19-long interacts with HNRNPAB to activate a subset of cell-cycle genes associated with PCa progression, thereby promoting PCa tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, these findings reveal a risk SNP-mediated promoter-enhancer switching mechanism underlying both initiation and progression of aggressive PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2883377762,"Seminal yeast studies have established the value of comprehensively mapping genetic interactions (GIs) for inferring gene function. Efforts in human cells using focused gene sets underscore the utility of this approach, but the feasibility of generating large-scale, diverse human GI maps remains unresolved. We developed a CRISPR interference platform for large-scale quantitative mapping of human GIs. We systematically perturbed 222,784 gene pairs in two cancer cell lines. The resultant maps cluster functionally related genes, assigning function to poorly characterized genes, including TMEM261, a new electron transport chain component. Individual GIs pinpoint unexpected relationships between pathways, exemplified by a specific cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate whose accumulation induces deoxynucleotide depletion, causing replicative DNA damage and a synthetic-lethal interaction with the ATR/9-1-1 DNA repair pathway. Our map provides a broad resource, establishes GI maps as a high-resolution tool for dissecting gene function, and serves as a blueprint for mapping the genetic landscape of human cells."

Repeated environmental stress induces maladaptive behavioral changes, including depression and anxiety, and is a risk factor for various human psychiatric disorders (Duman and Aghajanian, 2012Duman R.S.

To elucidate these mechanisms, rodent models of repeated environmental stress, such as repeated social defeat stress (R-SDS), repeated restraint stress, and chronic unpredictable stress, have been frequently used. In these models, repeated environmental stress alters the morphologies and activities of neurons in multiple brain areas involved in emotional and cognitive functions (Duman and Aghajanian, 2012Duman R.S.

Among these brain areas, certain areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), play pivotal roles in regulating repeated environmental stress-induced behavioral changes. Various kinds of repeated environmental stresses reduce excitatory synaptic transmission and attenuate the environmental stress-induced response of mPFC pyramidal neurons (Ota et al., 2014Ota K.T. Liu R.J. Voleti B. Maldonado-Aviles J.G. Duric V. Iwata M. Dutheil S. Duman C. Boikess S. Lewis D.A. et al.REDD1 is essential for stress-induced synaptic loss and depressive behavior.Nat.

Shortening and reduced branching of dendrites as well as the loss of dendritic spines are also induced (Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009Dias-Ferreira E. Sousa J.C. Melo I. Morgado P. Mesquita A.R.

These neuronal changes are thought to be responsible for repeated environmental stress-induced depression-like behaviors, such as anhedonia and social avoidance (Golden et al., 2013Golden S.A.

Histological and brain imaging studies have reported reduced gray matter volumes and abnormal metabolic activities in the mPFCs of psychiatric patients (Drevets et al., 2008Drevets W.C. Price J.L.

However, the underlying mechanism whereby repeated environmental stress induces alterations in the morphologies and activities of mPFC neurons as well as consequent behavioral changes remains unknown. Although the majority of studies have examined neuronal plasticity, which underlies repeated environmental stress-induced behavioral changes, several laboratories, including ours, have focused on neural inflammation or microglial activation as potential mechanisms of repeated environmental stress (Frank et al., 2007Frank M.G.

Indeed, genetic deletion of inflammation-related molecules and administration of a drug (minocycline) that potentially affects microglial properties have been shown to attenuate behavioral changes that are concomitant with microglial activation and/or monocyte infiltration in the brain and induced by repeated environmental stress. However, because none of these studies have selectively manipulated microglia or gene expression in microglia, direct evidence demonstrating a role of microglia in repeated environmental stress-induced behavioral changes is lacking. Microglia can be activated by various extracellular stimuli, many of which are mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Rivest, 2009Rivest S. Regulation of innate immune responses in the brain.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). TLRs have been identified as pattern recognition receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns and mediate inflammation and immune responses upon infection. In addition, recent studies have pointed to crucial roles of TLRs in diseases of the brain and other organs without apparent infection (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2010Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Regulation of adaptive immunity by the innate immune system.Science. 2010; 327: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, Rivest, 2009Rivest S. Regulation of innate immune responses in the brain.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and have proposed that endogenous molecules are released from cells upon cellular damage or stress and act as endogenous ligands for TLRs for inflammation and tissue remodeling. To identify R-SDS-induced changes in gene expression profiles in the mPFC, we performed a transcriptome analysis and obtained results suggesting that R-SDS upregulates potential ligands for TLR2 and TLR4 in the mPFC. Based on this finding, we analyzed the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in R-SDS and found that genetic deletion of TLR2 and TLR4 (TLR2/4) in combination abolishes R-SDS-induced social avoidance in mice. R-SDS induced microglial activation and altered neuronal c-Fos expression and morphologies in the mPFC, and TLR2/4 deletion mitigated these changes. Furthermore, we developed a method to manipulate gene expression in microglia in a specific brain area and provide sound evidence, for the first time, that TLR2/4 in mPFC microglia are crucial for R-SDS-induced social avoidance. We first set up an R-SDS model in which a single male C57BL/6 mouse or a knockout mouse of the same genetic background (C57BL/6) was subjected to aggressive encounters with a male ICR mouse for 10 min daily, typically for 10 consecutive days (Figure 1A). To identify R-SDS-induced changes in gene expression profiles in the mPFC, we performed a transcriptome analysis in the mPFC without or with R-SDS. Because the level of social avoidance varies across individuals, we separately analyzed and compared the data from susceptible mice, which showed social avoidance after R-SDS, and resilient mice, which did not, in addition to those from naive mice, as reported previously (Krishnan et al., 2007Krishnan V. Han M.H. Graham D.L. Berton O. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Laplant Q. Graham A. Lutter M. Lagace D.C. et al.Molecular adaptations underlying susceptibility and resistance to social defeat in brain reward regions.Cell. 2007; 131: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar) (see the STAR Methods for the definitions of susceptible and resilient mice). This analysis revealed that R-SDS upregulates many inflammation-related genes in mPFC tissue, such as S100a8, S100a9, Lipocalin2, Clec4d, and Ch25h (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) (Figures S1A–S1E). Among these genes, S100a8 and S100a9, which were upregulated in both susceptible and resilient mice, have been shown to form a heterodimer, and, as ligands, to be functionally related to TLR4 and, possibly, TLR2 (Coveney et al., 2015Coveney A.P. Wang W. Kelly J. Liu J.H. Blankson S. Wu Q.D. Redmond H.P. Wang J.H. Myeloid-related protein 8 induces self-tolerance and cross-tolerance to bacterial infection via TLR4- and TLR2-mediated signal pathways.Sci.

We then examined whether TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed in microglia before and after R-SDS. We subjected CX3CR1-EGFP mice, in which EGFP is selectively expressed in microglia in the brain and monocytes in peripheral tissues (Jung et al., 2000Jung S. Aliberti J. Graemmel P. Sunshine M.J. Kreutzberg G.W. Sher A. Littman D.R. Analysis of fractalkine receptor CX(3)CR1 function by targeted deletion and green fluorescent protein reporter gene insertion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar), to R-SDS and isolated EGFP-positive cells and EGFP-negative cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from the whole brain of each mouse. Enrichment of microglia and monocytes (a minor population) in the EGFP-positive population was confirmed by mRNA expression of Cd11b (Integrin αM), a marker for microglia (Figure S1F). The expression levels of the Tlr2 and Tlr4 mRNAs were significantly higher in EGFP-positive cells, which include microglia, compared with those in EGFP-negative cells and were not affected by R-SDS (Figures S1G and S1H). On the other hand, the expression of mRNA for Il1r1 (interleukin-1 [IL-1] receptor type I), which has been shown to be involved in stress-induced microglial changes in rodents (Kreisel et al., 2014Kreisel T. Frank M.G. Licht T. Reshef R. Ben-Menachem-Zidon O. Baratta M.V. Maier S.F. Yirmiya R. Dynamic microglial alterations underlie stress-induced depressive-like behavior and suppressed neurogenesis.Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), was detected only in EGFP-negative cells, and it was significantly upregulated by R-SDS (Figure S1I). These results demonstrate that microglia in the brain express TLR2 and TLR4 regardless of R-SDS. We then examined whether TLR2/4 were involved in R-SDS-induced behavioral changes. In wild-type mice, R-SDS induced social avoidance in the social interaction test (i.e., decreased time for the social interaction zone and increased time for the social avoidance zone; Figures 1B and 1C) and increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test (i.e., decreased time spent in open arms; Figure 1E), as reported previously (Tanaka et al., 2012Tanaka K. Furuyashiki T. Kitaoka S. Senzai Y. Imoto Y. Segi-Nishida E. Deguchi Y. Breyer R.M. Breyer M.D. Narumiya S. Prostaglandin E2-mediated attenuation of mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is critical for susceptibility to repeated social defeat stress in mice.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4319-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mice lacking either Tlr2 (TLR2 knockout [KO]) or Tlr4 (TLR4-KO) also displayed R-SDS-induced social avoidance, as observed in wild-type mice (Figures 2A–2D, S1J, and S1K). Because TLR2 and TLR4 partly share an intracellular signaling pathway, we examined mice lacking Tlr2 and Tlr4 in combination (TLR double knockout [DKO]) and found that social avoidance was abolished in TLR-DKO mice (Figures 1C and 1D). Wild-type mice were categorized as either susceptible or resilient in a similar ratio (12 susceptible mice and 12 resilient mice), but TLR-DKO mice were mostly resilient (1 susceptible mouse and 18 resilient mice). The proportions of susceptible and resilient mice were significantly different between wild-type mice and TLR-DKO mice (χ2 = 10.062, p = 0.0015). In addition, TLR-DKO mice did not show elevated anxiety (Figure 1E). These results demonstrate that TLR2/4 are crucial for R-SDS-induced social avoidance and elevated anxiety. By contrast, wild-type mice and TLR-DKO mice similarly showed a submissive posture, a defensive posture induced by SDS (Tornatzky and Miczek, 1993Tornatzky W. Miczek K.A. Long-term impairment of autonomic circadian rhythms after brief intermittent social stress.Physiol. Behav. 1993; 53: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and its increase along the 10-day course of R-SDS (Figure 1F), suggesting that these mice are able to perceive R-SDS and to maintain its memory. To exclude the potential effects of rearing conditions on phenotypes or to confirm the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, we examined TLR-DKO mice and their littermates. Among the littermates obtained by crossing among TLR2-KO, TLR4-heterozygous mice (Tlr2−/−;Tlr4+/−), TLR2-KO mice (Tlr2−/−;Tlr4+/+), but not TLR-DKO littermates (Tlr2−/−; Tlr4−/−), showed R-SDS-induced social avoidance (Figures 2A and 2B). R-SDS-induced social avoidance was significantly suppressed in TLR-DKO littermates compared with TLR2-KO mice. Consistently, TLR2-KO mice were categorized as susceptible and resilient mice in a similar ratio (3 susceptible mice and 4 resilient mice), but none of the TLR-DKO littermates were susceptible (0 susceptible mice and 6 resilient mice). Likewise, social avoidance was intact in TLR4-KO mice (Tlr2+/+;Tlr4−/−) but not in TLR-DKO littermates obtained by crossing among TLR2 heterozygous, TLR4-KO mice (Tlr2+/−;Tlr4−/−) (Figures 2C and 2D). R-SDS-induced social avoidance was significantly suppressed in TLR-DKO littermates compared with TLR4-KO mice. Consistently, TLR4-KO mice were categorized as susceptible and resilient mice in a similar ratio (3 susceptible mice and 5 resilient mice), but none of the TLR-DKO littermates were susceptible (0 susceptible mice and 9 resilient mice). These results clearly demonstrate that the behavioral abnormalities of TLR-DKO mice are due to genotypes but not due to differences in rearing conditions. These abnormalities were not due to their locomotor deficits either; TLR-DKO mice showed locomotor activities similar to those of TLR2-KO or TLR4-KO littermates (Figures 2E and 2F). We also analyzed Il1r1 knockout (IL-1RI-KO) mice and found that R-SDS significantly induces social avoidance in IL-1RI-KO mice (Figures S1L and S1M). However, R-SDS-induced elevated anxiety was not apparent in these mice (Figure S1N), as reported previously (Wohleb et al., 2011Wohleb E.S. Hanke M.L. Corona A.W. Powell N.D. Stiner L.M. Bailey M.T. Nelson R.J. Godbout J.P. Sheridan J.F. β-Adrenergic receptor antagonism prevents anxiety-like behavior and microglial reactivity induced by repeated social defeat.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These results suggest that IL-1RI plays different roles than TLR2/4 in R-SDS-induced behavioral changes. Previous reports have shown involvement of the mPFC and NAc in repeated environmental stress-induced behavioral changes (Duman and Aghajanian, 2012Duman R.S. Aghajanian G.K. Synaptic dysfunction in depression: potential therapeutic targets.Science. 2012; 338: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, Krishnan and Nestler, 2008Krishnan V. Nestler E.J.

The brain on stress: vulnerability and plasticity of the prefrontal cortex over the life course.Neuron. 2013; 79: 16-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). We examined whether R-SDS as well as single social defeat stress (S-SDS) induced microglial activation in the mPFC and NAc and whether TLR2 and TLR4 were involved in these microglial responses. We performed immunostaining for several markers for microglial activation; namely, CD68, Iba-1, and CD11b (Hinwood et al., 2012Hinwood M. Morandini J. Day T.A. Walker F.R. Evidence that microglia mediate the neurobiological effects of chronic psychological stress on the medial prefrontal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 1442-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Among these markers, we first examined CD68, which showed the lowest signals under basal conditions without R-SDS. In wild-type mice, S-SDS appeared to increase the punctate area positive for CD68 signals in mPFC microglia 4 hr after S-SDS, whereas it did not change 1.5 hr after S-SDS (Figures 3A and 3B and S3A). By contrast, R-SDS increased the CD68-positive area in mPFC microglia 1.5 hr after the last session of R-SDS in susceptible wild-type mice (Figures 3A, 3B, 3F, and 3G), and this increase returned to the baseline 4 hr after R-SDS (Figures 3A and 3B). Indeed, the proportion of mice with the CD68-positive area beyond its distribution in naive mice was significantly larger in the total of defeated wild-type mice (including both susceptible and resilient mice) than in the total of TLR-DKO mice (14 of 19 and 4 of 13, respectively; χ2 = 5.776, p = 0.016; the wild-type and TLR-DKO mice used for this χ2 analysis included all mice used for CD68 immunostaining in this study). We then examined Iba-1 signals in mPFC microglia. S-SDS appeared to decrease Iba-1 fluorescence intensity 1.5 hr but increased it 4 hr after S-SDS (Figures 3C and 3D). R-SDS appeared to increase Iba-1 fluorescence intensity 1.5 hr after the last exposure of R-SDS in susceptible wild-type mice, and this increase returned to the baseline 4 hr after R-SDS (Figures 3C and 3D). These findings demonstrate that R-SDS induces activation of mPFC microglia 4 hr after the last exposure to R-SDS and that SDS-induced activation of mPFC microglia occurs more rapidly with R-SDS, suggesting R-SDS-induced priming of mPFC microglia. Notably, both Iba-1 fluorescence intensity and the CD68-positive area in mPFC microglia after R-SDS were significantly higher in susceptible wild-type mice than in resilient wild-type mice (Figures 3F–3H), indicating that R-SDS-induced activation of mPFC microglia is correlated with the level of social avoidance. We also found that R-SDS increases CD11b signals in mPFC microglia 1.5 hr after the last exposure of R-SDS but not after S-SDS (Figures 3E, 3I, and 3J) in both susceptible and resilient wild-type mice (Figures 3I and 3J). Our statistical analysis also indicated that CD68 signals in the mPFC after R-SDS are more strongly correlated with the level of social avoidance than Iba-1 signals (CD68: r2 = 0.6977, p < 0.0001; Iba-1: r2 = 0.3387, p = 0.0142 for the time in the avoidance zone) Thus, among the three conventional markers for microglial activation, R-SDS-induced increases in CD68 signals in mPFC microglia were most strongly correlated with the level of social avoidance. Because we previously showed that R-SDS for 4 days was sufficient to induce social avoidance (Tanaka et al., 2012Tanaka K. Furuyashiki T. Kitaoka S. Senzai Y. Imoto Y. Segi-Nishida E. Deguchi Y.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4319-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we also performed immunostaining for CD68 and Iba-1 1.5 hr and 4 hr after R-SDS for 4 days. R-SDS for 4 days increased CD68-positive areas in mPFC microglia at both of these time points (Figure 3K). Although Iba-1 intensity did not appear to increase after R-SDS for 4 days (Figure 3L), Iba-1 decrease, which occurred 1.5 hr after S-SDS (Figure 3D), was not observed 1.5 hr after R-SDS for 4 days (Figure 3L). These results indicated that R-SDS for 4 days induces an intermediate pattern of microglial activation between those induced by S-SDS and R-SDS for 10 days. We then examined whether TLR2/4 deficiency affected R-SDS-induced activation of mPFC microglia. In TLR-DKO mice, S-SDS did not increase the CD68-positive area in mPFC microglia (Figures 3A and 3B). The CD68-positive area 4 hr after S-SDS was significantly smaller in TLR-DKO mice than in susceptible wild-type mice. The S-SDS-induced increase in Iba-1 fluorescence intensity in the mPFC 4 hr after S-SDS was also abolished in TLR-DKO mice (Figures 3C and 3D). These results indicated that TLR2/4 are crucial for S-SDS-induced activation of mPFC microglia. By contrast, 1.5 hr after S-SDS, Iba-1 signals were decreased in TLR-DKO mice, as similarly observed in wild-type mice, indicating that this microglial response was not mediated by either TLR2 or TLR4. In addition, TLR-DKO mice did not show an R-SDS-induced increase in CD68 signals in mPFC microglia 1.5 h after the last exposure of R-SDS, which was observed in susceptible wild-type mice (Figures 3A and 3B). These results demonstrate that TLR2/4 are crucial for the activation of mPFC microglia induced by R-SDS as well as that induced by S-SDS. Note that neither the fluorescence intensity of Iba-1 signals nor that of CD11b was affected by R-SDS in TLR-DKO mice (Figures 3C–3E). It was also noted that neither TLR2 nor TLR4 deficiency affected the signals of CD68, Iba-1, or CD11b under the basal condition without SDS (Figures 3A–3E and S2A–S2F). We also examined the roles of TLR2/4 in R-SDS-induced microglial activation in TLR-DKO littermates obtained from the heterozygous crossing. The R-SDS-induced CD68 increase in mPFC microglia was abolished in TLR-DKO littermates, although it remained in susceptible mice with the TLR4-KO genotype (Figures S2A, S2B, S2D, and S2E). Iba-1 fluorescence intensity was not significantly increased in any of these genotypes (Figures S2A, S2C, S2D, and S2F). These results suggest that the respective markers for microglial activation may be differently regulated. Neither TLR2/4 deficiency nor R-SDS affected the number of Iba-1-positive microglia in the mPFC (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the lack of R-SDS-induced activation of mPFC microglia in TLR-DKO mice is due to the TLR2/4 deletion but not due to differences in rearing conditions. By contrast, neither S-SDS nor R-SDS significantly increased Iba-1 or CD68 signals in NAc microglia of either wild-type mice or TLR-DKO mice (Figures S3B–S3G). As reported previously (Wohleb et al., 2013Wohleb E.S. Powell N.D. Godbout J.P. Sheridan J.F. Stress-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived monocytes to the brain promotes anxiety-like behavior.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13820-13833Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), R-SDS promotes infiltration of CD45-positive monocytes to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is located dorsal to the mPFC, in susceptible wild-type mice (Figures 4A, 4C, 4E, and 4G ). However, this monocyte infiltration in the ACC was unaffected in TLR-DKO mice. Notably, monocyte infiltration did not occur in the mPFC, in which R-SDS induces microglial activation (Figure 3), in either wild-type or TLR-DKO mice (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4F). Thus, R-SDS induces microglial activation in the mPFC and monocyte infiltration in the ACC, and TLR2/4 are involved in the former but not in the latter. We next examined whether TLR2/4 are involved in SDS-induced neuronal responses in the mPFC using immunostaining for c-Fos, a marker for neuronal response (Figure 5A). S-SDS induced c-Fos expression in mPFC neurons of both wild-type and TLR-DKO mice (Figures 5B and 5C). This c-Fos expression was abolished by R-SDS in susceptible wild-type mice but maintained in resilient wild-type mice (Figures 5D and 5E). In TLR-DKO mice, R-SDS attenuated SDS-induce"

Here, we demonstrate that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas resistance are still partially immune to Acr-encoding phage. As a consequence, Acr-phages often need to cooperate in order to overcome CRISPR resistance, with a first phage blocking the host CRISPR-Cas immune system to allow a second Acr-phage to successfully replicate. This cooperation leads to epidemiological tipping points in which the initial density of Acr-phage tips the balance from phage extinction to a phage epidemic. Furthermore, both higher levels of CRISPR-Cas immunity and weaker Acr activities shift the tipping points toward higher initial phage densities. Collectively, these data help elucidate how interactions between phage-encoded immune suppressors and the CRISPR systems they target shape bacteria-phage population dynamics.

Bacteriophages (phages) are highly abundant in virtually all environments and are thought to play a key role in shaping the ecology and evolution of their bacterial hosts (Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014Koskella B.

Rev. 2016; 80: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In response to phage predation, many bacteria evolved defense mechanisms that provide protection against phage predation (Labrie et al., 2010Labrie S.J. Samson J.E. Moineau S. Bacteriophage resistance mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), including many with molecular mechanisms that are only starting to be understood (Makarova et al., 2011Makarova K.S.

The observation that phages persist in the environment in spite of these host defenses is likely due to a combination of ecological and evolutionary processes (Thompson, 2005Thompson J.N. The geographic mosaic of coevolution. University of Chicago press, Chicago2005Crossref Google Scholar). One factor that is important in this context is the evolution of phage genes that can specifically block host defenses (Samson et al., 2013Samson J.E. Magadán A.H. Sabri M. Moineau S. Revenge of the phages: defeating bacterial defences.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). For example, approximately half of the sequenced bacterial genomes encode CRISPR-Cas immune systems (Grissa et al., 2007Grissa I. Vergnaud G. Pourcel C. The CRISPRdb database and tools to display CRISPRs and to generate dictionaries of spacers and repeats.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 172Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, Makarova et al., 2015Makarova K.S.

Microbiol. 2015; 13: 722-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), and in response, many phages have evolved anti-CRISPR (acr) genes that inhibit the CRISPR immune response (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J.

Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, Pawluk et al., 2014Pawluk A. Bondy-Denomy J.

Microbiol. 2016; 1: 16085Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the conditions and extent to which these immunosuppressive genes allow phages to persist in the face of bacteria with CRISPR resistance have remained unclear. CRISPR-Cas immune systems provide defense against phage infection by inserting phage-derived sequences (spacers) into CRISPR loci on the host genome (Barrangou et al., 2007Barrangou R. Fremaux C.

CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.Science. 2007; 315: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). The evolution of CRISPR resistance is determined both by the abundance of phage genome fragments in the cell that serve as substrates for spacer acquisition as well as the relative fitness advantage of bacteria with newly acquired spacers (Levin, 2010Levin B.R.

Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). For example, phages encoding AcrIF1 had greater levels of infectivity on CRISPR resistant hosts compared to phages encoding AcrIF4, but in all cases, Acr-phage infectivity was highest on hosts lacking CRISPR-Cas immunity (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). While these data suggest that CRISPR immunity provides partial resistance against Acr-phage infection, it has remained unclear how these patterns of partial resistance impact the ability of Acr-phages to replicate and amplify. Here, we demonstrate that Acr-phages need to cooperate in order to overcome partial resistance of CRISPR immune hosts. This requirement for cooperation has important epidemiological consequences as it causes Acr-phages to be driven extinct if their initial titers are below a critical threshold value but allows them to amplify when their titers exceed this threshold. To investigate the consequences of the partial resistance of CRISPR immune bacteria against Acr-phages (Figure S1A), we expressed AcrIF1 (from phage JBD30) and AcrIF4 (from phage JBD26) in an isogenic phage DMS3mvir background, which lacks an endogenous AcrIF but is closely related to both parental phages (91% and 80% pairwise sequence identity, respectively). Consistent with previous observations (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), efficiency of plaquing (EOP) assays with DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 confirmed partial immunity of P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 (WT PA14) hosts with CRISPR resistance to these Acr-phages and demonstrated that Acrs differ in their ability to block CRISPR resistance, with AcrIF1 being a more potent suppressor of CRISPR resistance than AcrIF4 (Figure 1A). As expected, EOPs of Acr-phages on wild-type (WT) hosts were higher compared to ancestral phage DMS3mvir, which is a priori targeted by one spacer of the WT PA14 CRISPR-Cas system but lower than those of phage DMS3vir, which is not a priori targeted by the WT PA14 CRISPR-Cas system (Figure 1A). Furthermore, EOPs decreased when hosts carried two or five (hereafter named BIM2 and BIM5 [bacteriophage insensitive mutant]) targeting spacers, presumably because this increases the proportion of surveillance complexes that target the phage (in addition to the targeting spacers, all bacteria encode 35 non-targeting spacers). Furthermore, competition between bacteria with CRISPR resistance and sensitive bacteria showed that, in the presence of Acr-phages, CRISPR resistance provides a fitness advantage (Figure 1B; F1,53 = 193.98, p < 0.0001), which is consistent with the observation that targeting spacers provide partial resistance to Acr-phages.Figure 1CRISPR-Cas Confers Partial Immunity to Acr-PhagesShow full caption(A) Efficiency of plaquing (EOP) of DMS3vir (white bars) on PA14 WT (completely sensitive to DMS3vir), BIM2 (one spacer targeting DMS3vir), and BIM5 (four spacers targeting DMS3vir); EOP of DMS3mvir (black bars), DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 (red bars), and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 (blue bars) on PA14 WT (one spacer targeting DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1, and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4), BIM2 (two spacers targeting DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1, and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4), and BIM5 (five spacers targeting DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1, and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4).

While full CRISPR resistance can drive phages extinct (van Houte et al., 2016bvan Houte S. Ekroth A.K. Broniewski J.M. Chabas H. Ashby B. Bondy-Denomy J. Gandon S. Boots M. Paterson S. Buckling A. Westra E.R. The diversity-generating benefits of a prokaryotic adaptive immune system.Nature. 2016; 532: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the phage epidemiology associated with partial resistance to Acr-phages is unclear. We explored this by measuring phage amplification following infection of hosts with CRISPR resistance. Whereas phages always reached similar titers when amplified for 24 hr on CRISPR-KO (knockout) hosts, independent of the initial phage amount (Figures 2A–2C), phage amplification on WT bacteria (one targeting spacer) was dependent on the initial phage amount, with phage DMS3mvir amplifying exclusively beyond a threshold of around 106 plaque-forming units (pfus), corresponding to an approximate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10−2 (Figures 2D–2F). For the Acr-phages, this effect was even stronger on BIM2 (two targeting spacers) and BIM5 (five targeting spacers) hosts, revealing epidemiological tipping points that depend both on the level of host resistance and the strength of the Acr (Figures 2G–2L). DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 could only cause an epidemic on BIM2 if the initial amount of phage exceeded a threshold of ∼105 pfus, corresponding to an MOI of 10−3, and was driven extinct below this threshold (Figure 2H), and for DMS3mvir-AcrIF4, approximately 100-fold more phage was necessary to cause an epidemic (Figure 2I). On BIM5, the tipping point shifted to approximately 10-fold higher phage titers for both Acr-phages (Figures 2K and 2L). Similar experiments with the parental phages JBD26 and JBD30 revealed a qualitatively similar correlation between EOPs and phage amplification patterns on bacteria with CRISPR resistance (one newly acquired targeting spacer) (Figure S1), with a relatively low EOP and clear amplification threshold for JBD26 (Figures S1A and S1D) and relatively high EOP and no clear amplification threshold for JBD30 (Figures S1A and S1E). However, unlike the DMS3mvir-based isogenic mutants, JBD26 and JBD30 also displayed CRISPR-independent variation in their epidemiological dynamics (Figures S1B and S1C), suggesting that differences in the amplification patterns of JBD26 and JBD30 on CRISPR-resistant hosts are unlikely to be solely due to their different Acrs. Given that DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 epidemics often required the bacterial cultures to be infected with higher amounts of phages, we hypothesized that they might be caused by rare phage mutants that “escape” (partial) CRISPR resistance due to mutations in their target sequence (protospacer) (Antia et al., 2003Antia R.

A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model.A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87-0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87-0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95% CI 0.91-0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.92-0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95% CI 0.92-0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.91-0.91).Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models."

Enhancer function requires transcription factor (TF) binding and correlates with histone modifications. However, the extent to which TF binding and histone modifications functionally define active enhancers remains unclear. Here, we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation with a massively parallel reporter assay (ChIP-STARR-seq) to identify functional enhancers in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) genome-wide in a quantitative unbiased manner. Although active enhancers associate with TFs, only a minority of regions marked by NANOG, OCT4, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 function as enhancers, with activity markedly changing under naive versus primed culture conditions. We identify an enhancer set associated with functions extending to non-ESC-specific processes. Moreover, although transposable elements associate with putative enhancers, only some exhibit activity. Similarly, within super-enhancers, large tracts are non-functional, with activity restricted to small sub-domains. This catalog of validated enhancers provides a valuable resource for further functional dissection of the regulatory genome."

However, such efforts require tools to adhere cells into defined morphologies and patterns, and these tools are currently lacking. Here, we report a 100% genetically encoded synthetic platform for modular cell-cell adhesion in Escherichia coli, which provides control over multicellular self-assembly. Adhesive selectivity is provided by a library of outer membrane-displayed nanobodies and antigens with orthogonal intra-library specificities, while affinity is controlled by intrinsic adhesin affinity, competitive inhibition, and inducible expression. We demonstrate the resulting capabilities for quantitative rational design of well-defined morphologies and patterns through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, lattice-like self-assembly, phase separation, differential adhesion, and sequential layering. Compatible with synthetic biology standards, this adhesion toolbox will enable construction of high-level multicellular designs and shed light on the evolutionary transition to multicellularity."
https://openalex.org/W2951304989,"Bacteria utilize CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems for protection from bacteriophages (phages), and some phages produce anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit immune function. Despite thorough mechanistic and structural information for some Acr proteins, how they are deployed and utilized by a phage during infection is unknown. Here, we show that Acr production does not guarantee phage replication when faced with CRISPR-Cas immunity, but instead, infections fail when phage population numbers fall below a critical threshold. Infections succeed only if a sufficient Acr dose is contributed to a single cell by multiple phage genomes. The production of Acr proteins by phage genomes that fail to replicate leave the cell immunosuppressed, which predisposes the cell for successful infection by other phages in the population. This altruistic mechanism for CRISPR-Cas inhibition demonstrates inter-virus cooperation that may also manifest in other host-parasite interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2884661889,"The purpose of this study was to assess the measurement accuracy of the most commonly used tracking technologies in professional team sports (i.e., semi-automatic multiple-camera video technology (VID), radar-based local positioning system (LPS), and global positioning system (GPS)). The position, speed, acceleration and distance measures of each technology were compared against simultaneously recorded measures of a reference system (VICON motion capture system) and quantified by means of the root mean square error RMSE. Fourteen male soccer players (age: 17.4±0.4 years, height: 178.6±4.2 cm, body mass: 70.2±6.2 kg) playing for the U19 Bundesliga team FC Augsburg participated in the study. The test battery comprised a sport-specific course, shuttle runs, and small sided games on an outdoor soccer field. The validity of fundamental spatiotemporal tracking data differed significantly between all tested technologies. In particular, LPS showed higher validity for measuring an athlete's position (23±7 cm) than both VID (56±16 cm) and GPS (96±49 cm). Considering errors of instantaneous speed measures, GPS (0.28±0.07 m⋅s-1) and LPS (0.25±0.06 m⋅s-1) achieved significantly lower error values than VID (0.41±0.08 m⋅s-1). Equivalent accuracy differences were found for instant acceleration values (GPS: 0.67±0.21 m⋅s-2, LPS: 0.68±0.14 m⋅s-2, VID: 0.91±0.19 m⋅s-2). During small-sided games, lowest deviations from reference measures have been found in the total distance category, with errors ranging from 2.2% (GPS) to 2.7% (VID) and 4.0% (LPS). All technologies had in common that the magnitude of the error increased as the speed of the tracking object increased. Especially in performance indicators that might have a high impact on practical decisions, such as distance covered with high speed, we found >40% deviations from the reference system for each of the technologies. Overall, our results revealed significant between-system differences in the validity of tracking data, implying that any comparison of results using different tracking technologies should be done with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2883846346,"Many animals rely on vision to detect, locate, and track moving objects. In Drosophila courtship, males primarily use visual cues to orient toward and follow females and to select the ipsilateral wing for courtship song. Here, we show that the LC10 visual projection neurons convey essential visual information during courtship. Males with LC10 neurons silenced are unable to orient toward or maintain proximity to the female and do not predominantly use the ipsilateral wing when singing. LC10 neurons preferentially respond to small moving objects using an antagonistic motion-based center-surround mechanism. Unilateral activation of LC10 neurons recapitulates the orienting and ipsilateral wing extension normally elicited by females, and the potency with which LC10 induces wing extension is enhanced in a state of courtship arousal controlled by male-specific P1 neurons. These data suggest that LC10 is a major pathway relaying visual input to the courtship circuits in the male brain."

Here, we independently confirmed the finding in a cohort of 2,738 PCa patients and discovered the biological mechanism underlying this association. We found an association of the aggressive PCa-associated allele G of rs11672691 with elevated transcript levels of two biologically plausible candidate genes, PCAT19 and CEACAM21, implicated in PCa cell growth and tumor progression. Mechanistically, rs11672691 resides in an enhancer element and alters the binding site of HOXA2, a novel oncogenic transcription factor with prognostic potential in PCa. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide editing showed the direct effect of rs11672691 on PCAT19 and CEACAM21 expression and PCa cellular aggressive phenotype. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of rs11672691 genotype and PCAT19/CEACAM21 gene expression on PCa prognosis. These results provide a plausible mechanism for rs11672691 associated with aggressive PCa and thus lay the ground work for translating this finding to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2883236658,"Animal cloning can be achieved through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), although the live birth rate is relatively low. Recent studies have identified H3K9me3 in donor cells and abnormal Xist activation as epigenetic barriers that impede SCNT. Here we overcome these barriers using a combination of Xist knockout donor cells and overexpression of Kdm4 to achieve more than 20% efficiency of mouse SCNT. However, post-implantation defects and abnormal placentas were still observed, indicating that additional epigenetic barriers impede SCNT cloning. Comparative DNA methylome analysis of IVF and SCNT blastocysts identified abnormally methylated regions in SCNT embryos despite successful global reprogramming of the methylome. Strikingly, allelic transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses of pre-implantation SCNT embryos revealed complete loss of H3K27me3 imprinting, which may account for the postnatal developmental defects observed in SCNT embryos. Together, these results provide an efficient method for mouse cloning while paving the way for further improving SCNT efficiency."

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Although TRPA1 regulates both pain and itch, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), the most utilized agonist of TRPA1, was thought to primarily elicit pain after intradermal injection (Ross, 2011Ross S.E. Pain and itch: insights into the neural circuits of aversive somatosensation in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether direct activation of TRPA1 causes itch. Most known agonists of TRPA1, such as pungent natural compounds and environmental irritants covalently bind cysteine residues at the intracellular C-terminal of TRPA1 (Macpherson et al., 2007Macpherson L.J. Dubin A.E. Evans M.J. Marr F. Schultz P.G. Cravatt B.F. Patapoutian A.

However, extracellular activation of TRPA1 remains unclear. It is also unknown whether a miRNA can bind and activate an ion channel. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) are the most common primary skin lymphomas (Bradford et al., 2009Bradford P.T. Devesa S.S. Anderson W.F. Toro J.R.

Zibert J.R. et al.Diagnostic microRNA profiling in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Blood. 2011; 118: 5891-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and patients with CTCL frequently complain of severe itching (Field et al., 2016Field H. Gao L. Matwani P. Wong H.K. Pruritus reduction with systemic anti-lymphoma treatments in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma: a narrative review.Dermatol. Ther. (Heidelb.). 2016; 6: 579-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Notably, several microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-21, miR-155, miR-326, and miR-711, are upregulated in skin biopsies from the lymphoma patients (Ralfkiaer et al., 2011Ralfkiaer U. Hagedorn P.H.

Dermatol. 2015; 135: 1128-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We developed a new mouse model of CTCL by intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells. In this model, mice developed lymphoma and chronic itch, which is associated with increased serum levels of hsa-miR-711 released from inoculated human cancer cells. Using a cheek model that can distinguish pain (wiping) and itch (scratching) (Shimada and LaMotte, 2008Shimada S.G. LaMotte R.H. Behavioral differentiation between itch and pain in mouse.Pain. 2008; 139: 681-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we find that intradermal injection of miR-711 induces scratching but not wiping. Furthermore, miR-711 binds to TRPA1 via the core sequence GGGACCC to activate TRPA1 at the extracellular S5-S6 loop. Finally, miR-711 is both sufficient and required for driving chronic itch in the CTCL model. We searched for miRNAs that are dysregulated in patients with lymphoma. Upregulations of miR-21, miR-155, miR-326, and miR-711 were reported in skin biopsies from the lymphoma patients (Ralfkiaer et al., 2011Ralfkiaer U. Hagedorn P.H. Bangsgaard N. Løvendorf M.B. Ahler C.B. Svensson L. Kopp K.L. Vennegaard M.T. Lauenborg B.

Dermatol. 2015; 135: 1128-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the dysregulated miRNAs are capable of inducing itch or pain in naive animals following intradermal injection (1 mM, 5 μL) using the cheek model that can distinguish pain versus itch (Shimada and LaMotte, 2008Shimada S.G. LaMotte R.H. Behavioral differentiation between itch and pain in mouse.Pain. 2008; 139: 681-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Notably, among 4 miRNAs we tested, only miR-711, but not miR-21, miR-155, and miR-326, evoked marked scratching in naive mice (Figures 1A). Pruritus evoked by intradermal miR-711 is dose dependent: mild but significant scratching was evident at 0.01 and 0.1 mM (p < 0.001, Figure S1A). At the highest dose (5 mM, 5 μL) we tested, intradermal miR-711 resulted in a very strong scratching with 395.2 ± 32.8 bouts per hour. This severe pruritus resulted in skin lesion at the injection site (Figures S1A and S1B). Thus, miR-711 is a highly potent pruritogen. The onset of miR-711-induced pruritus was very rapid, with a shorter latency than that induced by the classic pruritogens chloroquine (CQ) and histamine (Figure S1C), suggesting that miRNA may trigger pruritus through different mechanisms. Despite severe pruritus, intradermal cheek injection of miR-711 failed to evoke pain (wiping) at all the concentrations we tested (Figures 1A and S1A). Neither did intradermal miR-21, miR-155, and miR-326 elicit wiping behavior (Figure 1A). We also examined miRNA-induced itch using the back model, as the cheek skin and back skin are differentially innervated by trigeminal ganglion (TG) and DRG sensory neurons. Intradermal injection of miRNA-711 (0.01–1 mM, 10 μL) on the nape of neck also induced dose-dependent scratching, whereas miR-21, miR-155, and miR-326 had no effects (Figures S1E and S1F). How does miR-711 induce itch? TRPA1 and TRPV1 are expressed by pruriceptive and nociceptive DRG neurons and regulate acute and chronic pruritus (Kittaka et al., 2017Kittaka H. Uchida K. Fukuta N. Tominaga M. Lysophosphatidic acid-induced itch is mediated by signalling of LPA5 receptor, phospholipase D and TRPA1/TRPV1.J.

The ion channel TRPA1 is required for chronic itch.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9283-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Given the fast onset of the miR-711-induced pruritus, we reasoned that miR-711 might trigger itch via direct or indirect activation of TRP channels on sensory neurons. miR-711-induced acute itch was abrogated in Trpa1−/− but not Trpv1−/− mice (Figure 1B). Pruriceptive neurons also expressed TLR7, which induces pain or itch by coupling to TRPA1 (Liu et al., 2010Liu T. Xu Z.Z. Park C.K. Berta T. Ji R.R. Toll-like receptor 7 mediates pruritus.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1460-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2014Park C.K. Xu Z.Z. Berta T. Han Q. Chen G. Liu X.J. Ji R.R. Extracellular microRNAs activate nociceptor neurons to elicit pain via TLR7 and TRPA1.Neuron. 2014; 82: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, miR-711-induced pruritus was unaltered in Tlr7−/− mice (Figure 1B). Thus, miR-711 evokes itch via TRPA1 but not TRPV1 and TLR7. Does miRNA induce itch via specific sequence? Figure 1C shows the sequences of different miRNAs we tested in Figure 1A. A comparison of mouse and human miR-711 sequence revealed that mmu-miR-711 and hsa-miR-711 contain the same core sequence GGGACCC and both miRNAs from different species were able to evoke pruritus (Figures 1A and S1D). A miRNA database (miRBase) search showed that hsa-miR-642b-3p also contains the core sequence GGGACCC, and consistently, intradermal hsa-miR-642b-3p resulted in pruritus too (Figure 1A). Like mouse miR-711, hsa-miR-711 and hsa-miR-642b-3p failed to elicit wiping at the concentration that can produce scratching (Figure 1A). To determine the specific sequence of miR-711 that is critical for pruritus, we generated 6 mutants of miR-711 (m1 to m6) by converting several nucleotides to adenosine (Figure 1D) and tested their effects on pruritus. Mutations on the first seven nucleotides in m1, m2, and m6 resulted in marked reduction in scratching, suggesting that GGGACCC is the core sequence for eliciting pruritus (Figure 1E). Importantly, this core sequence was sufficient to elicit scratching but not wiping, whereas the mutant oligonucleotides (AAAAAAA) did not affect pain and itch (Figure 1F). Next, we examined whether AITC and miRNA-711 produce distinct pain or itch. Intradermal and cheek administration of AITC at high concentrations (5 and 10 mM, 5 μL) induced wiping but not scratching. Interestingly, low concentrations of AITC (10 and 100 μΜ) induced mild itch but no pain, whereas a medium concentration (1 mM) induced both scratching and wiping (Figures 1A and S1A). This finding suggests that AITC produces both pain and itch in a dose-dependent manner. We also tested mechanical and thermal pain sensitivity in a hind paw. Intraplantar injection of miR-711, at the concentration that can elicit itch (1 mM), failed to induce heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. In contrast, intraplantar AITC elicited marked hyperalgesia and allodynia (Figures 1G and 1H). Neurogenic inflammation is a unique form of inflammation arising from the release of inflammatory mediators from primary afferent neurons (Ji et al., 2014Ji R.R. Xu Z.Z. Gao Y.J. Emerging targets in neuroinflammation-driven chronic pain.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (1 mM) and AITC (5 mM) elicited robust neurogenic inflammation in hind paws, as revealed in the Evans blue test. However, intraplantar administration of miR-711 (1 mM) failed to elicit neurogenic inflammation (Figures 1I and 1J). Collectively, these results indicate that miR-711 and AITC differently regulate pain, itch, and neurogenic inflammation. To investigate whether miR-711 directly activates TRPA1, we assessed the function of TRPA1 by conducting patch-clamp recordings in heterologous cells. Bath application of miR-711, but not miR-21, miR-155, and miR-326 (10 μM), produced inward currents in Trpa1-expressing HEK293 cells (Figures 2A and 2B ). AITC (50 μM) also induced inward currents in these cells (Figures 2A and 2B). The second application of miR-711 did not induce obvious desensitization of TRPA1 (Figures S2A and S2B). A967079, a selective TRPA1 antagonist (10 and 50 μM) dose-dependently blocked the miR-711-evoked currents (Figures 2A and 2B). A dose-response analysis revealed that miR-711 is more potent than AITC for inducing TRPA1 activation, as indicated by a left-shift of the dose-response curve (Figure 2C). Of interest, the latency of miR-711-induced inward currents is shorter than that of AITC (Figure 2D), implicating a faster action of miR-711. The miR-711-evoked current had a current-voltage relationship consistent with TRPA1 activation, with a reversal potential of 0 mV and outward rectification (Figure 2E). By contrast, miR-711 failed to trigger inward currents in CHO cells that express Trpv1, Trpv2, Trpv3, and Trpv4, suggesting that miR-711 specifically acts on TRPA1 (Figures 2F and 2G). To validate that miR-711 directly activates TRPA1 on the cell surface, we carried out single channel recordings in HEK293 cells expressing TRPA1. Outside-out patch recordings showed that bath application of miR-711 and AITC on the extracellular surface each elicited single-channel opening events (Figure 2H). The miR-711-induced single channel activity was completely blocked by A967079 (Figure 2H). Interestingly, the duration of the miR-711-evoked single channel opening (average open time) but not the open probability, and conductance was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) than that evoked by AITC (Figure 2I and Figure S2C). Inside-out patch recordings in Trpa1-expressing HEK293 cells showed that bath application of AITC but not miR-711 on the intracellular surface elicited single-channel opening events (Figures 2J and 2K). Thus, unlike AITC, miR-711 activates TRPA1 on the extracellular side. To determine the neuronal population activated by miR-711, we performed calcium imaging on cultured DRG neurons isolated from Pirt-GCaMP3 mice (Anderson et al., 2018Anderson M. Zheng Q. Dong X. Investigation of pain mechanisms by calcium imaging approaches.Neurosci. Bull. 2018; 34: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that 10 μM miR-711 did not evoke meaningful calcium signaling, although this concentration was sufficient to induce inward currents in TRPA1-expressing HEK293 cells. At 50 μM, miR-711 caused Ca2+ increase in 3.9% DRG neurons (n = 544 neurons from 3 mice, Figures 3A and 3B ). After miR-711 stimulation, we sequentially stimulated the same DRG neurons with histamine (500 μM), chloroquine (CQ, 1,000 μM), and AITC (200 μM). In 544 neurons we analyzed, 5.5%, 5.1%, and 22.6% neurons showed responses to histamine, CQ, and AITC, respectively (Figure 3C). For the miR-711-resposive neurons, majority of them also showed responses to CQ (66.7%) and histamine (61.9%), and all of them responded to AITC (Figures 3A–3C). As expected, miR-711 (50 μM) also evoked calcium responses in TRPA1-expressing HEK293 cells (Figures S3A and S3B). Notably, A967079 completely blocked the miR-711-evoked calcium responses in DRG neurons, confirming a specific activation of TRPA1 by miR-711 (Figures S3C–S3E). We also examined calcium responses in TG neurons isolated from Pirt-GCaMP3 mice. Interestingly, compared with DRG neurons, TG neurons showed greater responses to miR-711, pruritogens, and AITC: 12.3% (25/204) of TG neurons responded to miR-711 (50 μM), and 6.9%, 9.3%, and 32.4% neurons exhibited respective responses to histamine, CQ, and AITC. Among the miR-711-responsive neurons, the majority of them also showed responses to CQ (76%) and histamine (52%), and all (100%) to AITC (Figures S3F–S3H). Collectively, our calcium imaging data indicate that miR-711 activates a subset of TRPA1+ sensory neurons in mice. To further assess distinct neuronal activation by miR-711 and AITC, we conducted electrophysiology to record inward currents and action potentials in small-diameter DRG neurons (<25 μm). Exposure of dissociated DRG neurons to exogenous miR-711 (10 μM) induced rapid inward currents, which were blocked by A-967079 and abolished in Trpa1 knockout mice (Figures 4A and 4B ). miR-711 (10 μM) also induced action potentials in small-diameter DRG neurons, and this excitation was lost in TRPA1-deficient neurons (Figures 4C and 4D), suggesting that miR-711 is sufficient to excite sensory neurons via TRPA1. Notably, 16.7% (15/90) and 11.5% (15/130) small-diameter neurons responded to AITC and miR-711, respectively, with inward currents or action potentials. Thus, miR-711-respoinding neurons could be a subset of TRPA1+ neurons. Additional action potential analysis revealed that compared with AITC, miR-711 elicited action potentials with a shorter duration, but the after-hyperpolarization of the action potentials did not differ after these treatments (Figures 4D and 4E). It was shown that AITC increased calcium permeability (Bobkov et al., 2011Bobkov Y.V. Corey E.A. Ache B.W.

I/V and reversal potential analysis revealed that compared to AITC, miR-711 had lower permeability to Ca2"

Previous studies have shown that αS truncation might have an important role in αS aggregation. However, little is known about how this truncation influences αS's propagation properties. In the present study, we generated αS fibrils from a series of truncated human αS constructs, characterized their structures and conformational stabilities, and investigated their ability to convert the conformation of full-length αS in vitro, in cultured cells, and in WT mice. We show that both C- and N-terminal truncations of human αS induce fibril polymorphs and exhibit different cross-seeding activities. N-terminally 10- or 30-residue–truncated human αS fibrils induced more abundant αS pathologies than WT fibrils in mice, whereas other truncated fibrils induced less abundant pathologies. Biochemical analyses of these truncated fibrils revealed that N-terminal 10- or 30-residue truncations of human αS change the fibril conformation in a manner that increases their structural compatibility with WT mouse αS fibrils and reduces their stability. C-terminally 20-residue–truncated fibrils displayed enhanced seeding activity in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2884962962,"Adaptation of learning and decision-making might depend on the regulation of activity in the prefrontal cortex. Here we examined how volatility of reward probabilities influences learning and neural activity in the primate prefrontal cortex. We found that animals selected recently rewarded targets more often when reward probabilities of different options fluctuated across trials than when they were fixed. Additionally, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex displayed more sustained activity related to the outcomes of their previous choices when reward probabilities changed over time. Such volatility also enhanced signals in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex related to the current but not the previous location of the previously rewarded target. These results suggest that prefrontal activity related to choice and reward is dynamically regulated by the volatility of the environment and underscore the role of the prefrontal cortex in identifying aspects of the environment that are responsible for previous outcomes and should be learned."
https://openalex.org/W2884945282,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) orchestrate the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and are the primary effector of liver fibrosis. Several factors, including TGF-β1, PDGF and oxidative stress, have been shown to trigger HSC activation. However, the involvement of cellular defence mechanisms, such as the activation of antioxidant response by Nrf2/Keap1 in the modulation of HSC activation is not known. The aim of this work was to elucidate the role of Nrf2 pathway in HSC trans-differentiation involved in the development of fibrosis. To this end, we repressed Nrf2 and Keap1 expression in HSC with specific siRNAs. We then assessed activation markers, as well as proliferation and migration, in both primary and immortalised human HSCs exposed to Smad inhibitors (SB-431542 hydrate and SB-525334), TGF-β1 and/or PDGF. Our results indicate that knocking down Nrf2 induces HSC activation, as shown by an increase in αSMA-positive cells and by gene expression induction of ECM components (collagens and fibronectin). HSC with reduced Nrf2-levels also showed an increase in migration and a decrease in proliferation. We could also demonstrate that the activation of Nrf2-deficient HSC involves the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, as the activation was successfully inhibited with the two tested Smad inhibitors. Moreover, TGF-β1 elicited a stronger induction of HSC activation markers in Nrf2 deficient cells than in wild type cells. Thus, our data suggest that Nrf2 limits HSCs activation, through the inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in HSCs."

In Escherichia coli, carbon flux is redirected through the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, isocitrate lyase (ICL), following phosphorylation and inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), by the kinase/phosphatase, AceK. In contrast, mycobacterial species lack AceK and employ a phosphorylation-insensitive isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), which is allosterically activated by the product of ICL activity, glyoxylate. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses IDH, ICD, ICL, and AceK, raising the question of how these enzymes are regulated to ensure proper flux distribution between the competing pathways. Here, we present the structure, kinetics, and regulation of ICL, IDH, and ICD from P. aeruginosa. We found that flux partitioning is coordinated through reciprocal regulation of these enzymes, linking distribution of carbon flux to the availability of the key gluconeogenic precursors, oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Specifically, a greater abundance of these metabolites activated IDH and inhibited ICL, leading to increased TCA cycle flux. Regulation was also exerted through AceK-dependent phosphorylation of ICD; high levels of acetyl-CoA (which would be expected to accumulate when oxaloacetate is limiting) stimulated the kinase activity of AceK, whereas high levels of oxaloacetate stimulated its phosphatase activity. In summary, the TCA cycle–glyoxylate shunt branch point in P. aeruginosa has a complex enzymology that is profoundly different from those in other species characterized to date. Presumably, this reflects its predilection for consuming fatty acids, especially during infection scenarios.

The mechanisms controlling carbon flux partitioning between the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt were largely worked out in the Escherichia coli model in the 1980s. Here, the TCA cycle enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD, encoded by icd), and the glyoxylate shunt enzyme, isocitrate lyase (ICL, encoded by aceA) compete for available isocitrate. ICD has a much lower Km for isocitrate (Km = 8 μm (2LaPorte D.C. Walsh K. Koshland Jr., D.E. The branch point effect ultrasensitivity and subsensitivity to metabolic control.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6389540): 14068-14075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) than ICL (Km 604 μm (3Walsh K. Koshland D.E. Determination of flux through the branch point of two metabolic cycles: the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6378912): 9646-9654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), so to obtain significant flux through the glyoxylate shunt, ICD needs to be inactivated. This is accomplished by reversible phosphorylation of ICD on Ser-113, mediated by a dual function kinase/phosphatase, AceK (4Walsh K. Koshland D.E. Branch point control by the phosphorylation state of isocitrate dehydrogenase: a quantitative examination of fluxes during a regulatory transition.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260 (2861202): 8430-8437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoserine 113 is thought to electrostatically repulse isocitrate, thereby preventing substrate binding (5Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Consequently, when the kinase activity of AceK is dominant, ICD becomes phosphorylated and inactivated, allowing carbon flux to be redirected through the glyoxylate shunt. In contrast, when the phosphatase activity of AceK dominates, flux is restored through the TCA cycle. The ratio of kinase/phosphatase activity in AceK is controlled by allosteric regulators (6Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G.

Not all bacteria share the same enzymology as E. coli at the TCA cycle–glyoxylate shunt branch point (TGB); some bacteria encode a second, AceK-insensitive isocitrate dehydrogenase isozyme, IDH. Genome sequencing efforts have revealed that some species, such as the industrially important fermenter Corynebacterium glutamicum, contain only idh, whereas others contain only icd (e.g. E. coli). Generally, and as might be expected, there is a strong correlation between the presence of genes encoding ICD, ICL, and AceK in a genome. However, there are exceptions to this. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes ICL, ICD, and IDH, but lacks AceK. Without a mechanism to inactivate ICD, this raises the question of how flux is redirected through the glyoxylate shunt in this organism. This was partially resolved by the finding that ICD appears to be fully dispensable for flux through the TCA cycle in M. tuberculosis (7Murima P. Zimmermann M. Chopra T. Pojer F. Fonti G. Dal Peraro M. Alonso S. Sauer U. Pethe K. McKinney J.D. A rheostat mechanism governs the bifurcation of carbon flux in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (10.1038/ncomms12527 27555519): 12527Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), so only ICL and IDH compete for the pool of isocitrate. Recent work done in a related species of mycobacteria (Mycobacterium smegmatis) indicates that flux partitioning at the TGB is determined primarily by allosteric activation of IDH by ICL-derived glyoxylate (7Murima P. Zimmermann M. Chopra T. Pojer F. Fonti G. Dal Peraro M. Alonso S. Sauer U. Pethe K. McKinney J.D. A rheostat mechanism governs the bifurcation of carbon flux in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (10.1038/ncomms12527 27555519): 12527Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An additional layer of unexplored complexity is seen in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, three enzymes compete for isocitrate: ICD, IDH, and ICL. Moreover, P. aeruginosa also encodes the ICD kinase/phosphatase, AceK. This raises the question of how AceK-mediated post-translational regulation of ICD activity is integrated with the activities of ICL and IDH. The lack of clarity here is ironic, especially given that Kornberg and Krebs originally elucidated the glyoxylate shunt in a Pseudomonas strain, KB1 (8Kornberg H.L. Madsen N.B. Synthesis of C4-dicarboxylic acids from acetate by a “glyoxylate bypass” of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24 (10.1016/0006-3002(57)90268-8 13436500): 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the enzymology of flux partitioning in P. aeruginosa TGB further, we cloned and purified ICL, ICD, IDH, and AceK from this organism. Kinetic analysis of the purified enzymes revealed that in striking contrast with E. coli and M. smegmatis, P. aeruginosa ICL has a higher affinity for isocitrate (Km 12 μm) compared with the competing dehydrogenases, ICD (Km 26 μm) and IDH (Km 18 μm) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). ICD and IDH shared similar Km values for their other substrate, NADPH (32 and 34 μm, respectively). ICD and IDH were expressed at comparable levels during growth on either glucose or acetate (supplemental Fig. 1E). Commensurate with earlier observations that there is significant flux through the glyoxylate shunt even during growth on glucose (9Berger A. Dohnt K. Tielen P. Jahn D. Becker J. Wittmann C. Robustness and plasticity of metabolic pathway flux among uropathogenic isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (10.1371/journal.pone.0088368 24709961): e88368Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), ICL was expressed (albeit at low levels) on this substrate. However, ICL expression increased during growth on acetate. Again, this is consistent with earlier observations that acetate induces expression of the ICL-encoding gene, aceA (10Díaz-Pérez A.L.

Open table in a new tab At 531 amino acids, P. aeruginosa ICL is longer than E. coli ICL (434 amino acids) and shares only 27% amino acid sequence identity with the latter. It also lies on a distinct branch of the evolutionary tree for this enzyme (which also includes ICL from pathogens such as Burkholderia cepacia and Acinetobacter baumanii), with no structurally characterized homologues to date (supplemental Fig. 2). To investigate this further, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of P. aeruginosa ICL to 1.9 Å resolution (PDB code 6G1O), with Ca2+ and glyoxylate embedded in the active site (Fig. 1). Crystallographic statistics are given in Table S1. The presence of a Ca2+ (which was coordinated with the glyoxylate ligand and three water molecules) in the ICL active site was confirmed using Checkmymetal. In the crystal structure, there is one ICL polypeptide per asymmetric portion of the unit cell, which belonged to the I222 space group (Fig. 1A). These polypeptides are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis to yield a tetrameric structure (Fig. 1B) with extensive contacts made between each protomer (supplemental Fig. 3). This is consistent with gel filtration/multiangle light scattering (GFC/MALS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) data indicating that ICL behaves as a 231-kDa tetramer in solution (supplemental Fig. 4). Each protomer in P. aeruginosa ICL is composed of 17 α-helices and 14 β-strands arranged around a central TIM barrel-like core (secondary structure assignments are shown in supplemental Fig. 5). However, the overall fold of each protomer is distinct when compared with ICL from E. coli and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1C). In particular, helices α1 and α2 of P. aeruginosa ICL are flipped as a unit by almost 180° relative to the axis of α3, and α6 is extended by an additional four helical turns. In addition, α13 and α14 extend away from the globular core of the protein, generating structural projections that give the tetramer a distinctly rugged, starlike profile. The most obvious difference, however, is the presence of a relatively unstructured “head-domain” spanning the region between Ile-272 and Ile-306. The head domains of adjacent protomers form some of the more intimate contacts underpinning tetramer formation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, ICL from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans also has a headlike domain, although this is rich in α-helices and does not appear to play a significant role in interprotomer interactions (11Britton K. Langridge S. Baker P.J. Weeradechapon K. Sedelnikova S.E. De Lucas J.R. Rice D.W. Turner G.

The catalytic core of the enzyme is conserved. The active site of ICL is composed of two distinct parts: those residues associated with the β-strands and loops around the rim of the TIM barrel and a flexible loop of structure between β4 and β5 (12Britton K.L. Abeysinghe I.S.B. Baker P.J. Barynin V. Diehl P. Langridge S.J. McFadden B.A. Sedelnikova S.E. Stillman T.J. Weeradichapon K. Rice D.W. The structure and domain organization of Escherichia coli isocitrate lyase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

In our structure, this β4-β5 loop points away from the active site. Presumably, in the presence of isocitrate, this loop swings inwards to cap the active site, as it does in ICL from M. tuberculosis (13Sharma V. Sharma S. Hoener zu Bentrup K. McKinney J.D. Russell D.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Structure of isocitrate lyase, a persistence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (10.1038/77964 10932251): 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The glyoxylate moiety in our structure is displaced by 6 Å toward the β4-β5 loop, leaving it poised ready to exit the active site, although it remains anchored on the enzyme through coordination with the Ca2+ (Fig. 1D). Given its position at the TGB, it is unsurprising that the activity of P. aeruginosa ICL is modulated by certain metabolites. P. aeruginosa ICL activity was inhibited by oxaloacetate, pyruvate, succinate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and CoA (Fig. 2). No activators were identified. Oxaloacetate (Ki = 1.9 mm), pyruvate (Ki = 2 mm), and CoA (Ki = 1.2 mm) all inhibited the enzyme noncompetitively (Fig. 2A), whereas the reaction product, succinate, inhibited uncompetitively (K′i = 0.6 mm) and PEP displayed mixed inhibition (Fig. 2B). In common with other isocitrate lyases, the enzyme was also susceptible to uncompetitive inhibition by itaconic acid (K′i = 0.5 mm) and nitropropionic acid (K′i = 0.6 mm) (14Rittenhouse J.W. McFadden B.A. Inhibition of isocitrate lyase from Pseudomonas indigofera by itaconate.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 163 (10.1016/0003-9861(74)90456-1 4852477): 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Schloss J.V. Cleland W.W.

The latter may reflect the partial structural similarity between PEP and maleic acid. In P. aeruginosa, two isocitrate dehydrogenases, IDH and ICD, compete with ICL for isocitrate. In solution, IDH (monomeric molecular mass 82 kDa) had an apparent molecular mass of 235 kDa (GFC/MALS) or 273 kDa (AUC), suggesting that it adopts a higher-order structure (supplemental Fig. 6). To investigate the enzyme further, we solved its X-ray crystal structure (PDB code 6G3U) to 2.7 Å resolution (Fig. 3). The asymmetric unit comprised two molecules of IDH; one (designated chain A) contained bound α-ketoglutarate and NADP, and the other (chain B) contained no bound substrate/product (Fig. 3A). However, the interface between these monomers was small, and analysis using PISA (16Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 (10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.022 17681537): 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar) suggested that the two molecules cannot be considered to be protomers of a functional dimer. Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of the P. aeruginosa A and B chains revealed large conformational differences, especially in the smaller domain of each chain (supplemental Fig. 7), suggesting that catalysis is accompanied by structural rearrangements. The α-ketoglutarate binding cleft is sandwiched between the two IDH domains (supplemental Fig. 7A), with side chains from both domains involved in binding. The active site residues are remarkably well conserved between IDH and ICD (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the proposed common evolutionary origins of both proteins (17Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Structure of the monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase: evidence of a protein monomerization by a domain duplication.Structure. 2002; 10 (10.1016/S0969-2126(02)00904-8 12467571): 1637-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and raises the question of why IDH is not a substrate for AceK (Fig. 3C). Comparison of the P. aeruginosa IDH active site architecture with that of ICD in the AceK–ICD complex from E. coli (PDB code 3LCB) reveals that despite the conserved constellation of catalytic residues, the active sites are differently structured, with the two ICD motifs known to be critical for recognition by AceK (the P-loop and AceK recognition segment (ARS)) absent in IDH (Fig. 3D). Glyoxylate was recently reported to be the principal regulator of IDH in M. smegmatis, enabling “rheostatic” control of flux through the glyoxylate shunt (7Murima P. Zimmermann M. Chopra T. Pojer F. Fonti G. Dal Peraro M. Alonso S. Sauer U. Pethe K. McKinney J.D. A rheostat mechanism governs the bifurcation of carbon flux in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (10.1038/ncomms12527 27555519): 12527Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, and although glyoxylate did stimulate P. aeruginosa IDH activity, pyruvate and oxaloacetate were far more potent regulators. All three compounds changed the isocitrate dependence of IDH kinetics from hyperbolic to sigmoidal (Fig. 4A), and all had a pronounced effect on kcat with only a small impact on Km (Table 1), indicating that the enzyme is of the rarer V-type allosteric class. The shift to sigmoidal isocitrate kinetics in the presence of these activators suggests cooperativity in substrate binding, consistent with IDH adopting a higher-order structure in solution. However, these effectors had much less impact on the NADP dependence of IDH kinetics, which remained essentially hyperbolic (Fig. 4B). In common with previously characterized isocitrate dehydrogenases, IDH (and also ICD) was strongly inhibited by mixtures containing oxaloacetate and glyoxylate, presumably due to the nonenzymatic formation of oxalomalate (18Nimmo H.G. Kinetic mechanism of Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase and its inhibition by glyoxylate and oxaloacetate.Biochem. J. 1986; 234 (10.1042/bj2340317 3521584): 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The second isocitrate dehydrogenase encoded by P. aeruginosa is ICD. P. aeruginosa ICD crystallized as a dimer (Fig. 5A and Table S1) and also behaved as a dimer in solution (supplemental Fig. 9). The structure (PDB code 5M2E), solved to 2.7 Å resolution, was very similar to that reported for the E. coli enzyme (supplemental Fig. 8A), with a clasplike structure mediating the dimerization (19Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Structure of a bacterial enzyme regulated by phosphorylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The residues lining the substrate binding site were also conserved between the E. coli and P. aeruginosa enzymes (supplemental Fig. 8B). ICD was competitively inhibited by the reaction product, α-ketoglutarate (Ki = 666 μm; supplemental Fig. 8C). However, the main mode of regulation was through AceK-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, in all of our experiments with AceK and ICD from P. aeruginosa (hereafter, AceKPA and ICDPA), the maximal inhibition attributable to AceK-mediated phosphorylation was only around 75% (Fig. 5C). This is not due to a lower intrinsic activity of AceKPA, because AceKPA was able to completely inactivate ICD from E. coli (ICDEC) (Fig. 5C). Comparison of the ICDPA and ICDEC active site region revealed slight differences in the spatial disposition of the P-loop required for AceK recognition (supplemental Fig. 8D), making it formally possible that ICDPA is less sensitive to AceK-mediated phosphorylation. However, AceKEC was able to completely inactivate ICDPA, indicating that these local differences in P-loop conformation are unlikely to be functionally significant (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data suggest that in the absence of external factors to stimulate its kinase activity, AceKPA cannot fully inhibit ICDPA. Although the P. aeruginosa and E. coli ICD enzymes are 79% identical at the amino acid sequence level, and the site of phosphorylation (Ser-115 in P. aeruginosa ICD) is conserved, the corresponding AceK orthologues show substantial differences. In particular, the N-terminal regulatory domain is just 35% identical between the two species. In contrast, the C-terminal catalytic domain is 60% identical and retains all of the sequence motifs thought to be important for kinase and phosphatase activity. These data suggest that P. aeruginosa AceK is likely to be regulated differently compared with the E. coli orthologue. To investigate this further, we examined how a panel of potential regulators affected AceKPA-dependent inactivation of ICDPA (supplemental Fig. 10). ICD was first phosphorylated by AceK for 60 min (enough to maximally inactivate the dehydrogenase (Fig. 5C)). Following this, the indicated potential regulators were added, and restoration of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was monitored after 30 min (supplemental Fig. 10A). As a control, and to confirm the species specificity of each regulator, we also examined (i) whether the same compounds affected AceKEC-dependent restoration of ICDEC activity (supplemental Fig. 10B) and (ii) whether the regulators had any intrinsic impact on ICD activity (supplemental Fig. 11). With the exception of citrate (which presumably competitively blocks the ICD active site) and, to a lesser extent, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and phosph"

Knowledge of the FG structures could facilitate the development of a clinically effective intrinsic FXase inhibitor for anticoagulant drugs. Here, a new fucosylated glycosaminoglycan was obtained from the widely traded sea cucumber Bohadschia argus. The precise structure was deduced as {→4)-[l-Fuc3S4S-α-(1→3)-]-d-GlcA-β-(1→3)-d-GalNAc4S6S-β-(1} through analysis of its chemical properties and homogeneous oligosaccharides purified from its β-eliminative depolymerized products. The B. argus FG with mostly 3,4-di-O-sulfated fucoses expands our knowledge on FG structural types. This β-elimination process, producing oligosaccharides with well-defined structures, is a powerful tool for analyzing the structure of complex FGs. Among these oligosaccharides, an octasaccharide displayed potent FXase inhibitory activity. Compared with oligosaccharides with various degrees of polymerization (3n and 3n − 1), our analyses reveal that the purified octasaccharide is the minimum structural unit responsible for the potent selective FXase inhibition, because the d-talitol in the nonsaccharide is unnecessary. The octasaccharide with 2,4-di-O-sulfated fucoses is more potent than that of one with 3,4-di-O-sulfated fucoses. Thus, sulfation patterns can play an important role in the inhibition of intrinsic factor Xase complex."

Neurons in the developing brain assemble into circuits through the formation and remodeling of synaptic connections. Following their initial assembly, synapses undergo an extensive period of refinement during which they are strengthened, remodeled, or eliminated based upon their level of activity, such that stronger synapses are retained while weaker synapses are eliminated (Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015Riccomagno M.M.

This synaptic refinement is influenced by spontaneous, intrinsically driven neural activity during early postnatal life and is remarkably sensitive to sensory experience later in postnatal development (Andreae and Burrone, 2018Andreae L.C.

Whereas a significant number of proteins have been described to mediate earlier stages of synapse formation, comparatively few molecular regulators of later stages of postnatal synaptic refinement have been identified. In particular, the molecular mechanisms by which sensory experience drives synaptic refinement are not yet well understood. One challenging aspect of the identification of molecules that regulate synaptic refinement is the dependence of this process upon properly timed, physiologically relevant patterns of neuronal activity. Therefore, synaptic refinement is most effectively studied within the context of an intact circuit (Hashimoto and Kano, 2013Hashimoto K. Kano M. Synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Sanes and Lichtman, 1999Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Development of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Toward this end, the retinogeniculate pathway in which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) synapse onto excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus has emerged as a useful model for studying postnatal circuit development (Hong and Chen, 2011Hong Y.K. Chen C. Wiring and rewiring of the retinogeniculate synapse.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The retinogeniculate synapse undergoes distinct postnatal phases of refinement that first rely upon spontaneous retinal activity between birth and postnatal day (P)20 and subsequently require visual input (Hooks and Chen, 2006Hooks B.M. Chen C. Distinct roles for spontaneous and visual activity in remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2006; 52: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, Hooks and Chen, 2008Hooks B.M. Chen C. Vision triggers an experience-dependent sensitive period at the retinogeniculate synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The temporal segregation of these phases provides a unique opportunity to disentangle experience-dependent mechanisms from those driven by spontaneous activity that have been more extensively investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the experience-dependent phase of synaptic refinement in the dLGN, specifically during the vision-sensitive period between P20 and P30. How might sensory input drive this vision-sensitive phase of retinogeniculate refinement at the molecular level? Decades of work across many brain regions have shown that neuronal activation, such as that mediated by sensory experience, has both short-term and long-term effects on synaptic connectivity. For example, in the short-term, protein phosphorylation and neurotransmitter receptor trafficking can scale synaptic strength and efficacy on the order of seconds to minutes (Turrigiano, 2012Turrigiano G. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity: local and global mechanisms for stabilizing neuronal function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). However, long-term changes that result in a persistent remodeling of synapses, like those that occur during refinement, rely upon the induction of gene expression programs in the nuclei of activated neurons (West and Greenberg, 2011West A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription in synapse development and cognitive function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005744Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These transcriptional programs include immediate early genes (IEGs), such as Fos, Egr1, and Npas4, that encode broadly expressed transcriptional regulators and are induced within 1 hr of neurotransmitter release onto a postsynaptic neuron (Bloodgood et al., 2013Bloodgood B.L.

Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1330-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These transcription factors then bind cis-regulatory elements across the genome to drive the expression of late-response genes (LRGs), whose protein products can function at synapses to regulate neuronal connectivity (Mardinly et al., 2016Mardinly A.R. Spiegel I. Patrizi A. Centofante E. Bazinet J.E. Tzeng C.P. Mandel-Brehm C. Harmin D.A. Adesnik H. Fagiolini M. Greenberg M.E. Sensory experience regulates cortical inhibition by inducing IGF1 in VIP neurons.Nature. 2016; 531: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas these prior studies have been conducted primarily using mouse cortical tissue, they raise the possibility that similar sensory-driven gene programs in the mouse dLGN might encode postsynaptic mediators of vision-sensitive retinogeniculate refinement. However, coordinated experience-dependent gene expression in the mouse dLGN had not yet been fully characterized, and whether induced genes are critical for vision-sensitive refinement remained to be determined. In the present study, we applied whole-transcriptome single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the genes that are acutely induced in excitatory TC neurons in response to visual stimulation during the vision-sensitive period of synaptic refinement in the dLGN. Among the hundreds of experience-dependent genes identified, the cell surface pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is the most robustly induced. We focused our subsequent analysis on the function of Fn14 for several reasons, including its high level of inducibility, selective expression in excitatory neurons, subcellular localization to the cell surface, and relatedness to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily of molecules that bind ligands known to mediate synaptic composition and strength and have the ability to remodel tissues in response to injury or disease (Burkly, 2014Burkly L.C.

Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural techniques to compare retinogeniculate development in wild-type (WT) and Fn14 knockout (KO) mice, we found that Fn14 is largely dispensable for spontaneous activity-dependent refinement at P13 and P20 but is required for vision-sensitive refinement between P20 and P27. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that Fn14 is a sensory-dependent regulator of functional and structural refinement of the retinogeniculate synapse that serves as a molecular link between experience-dependent gene expression and synaptic refinement in the brain. To test our hypothesis that genes induced by visual experience contribute to the vision-sensitive component of retinogeniculate refinement, we sought to characterize the experience-dependent transcriptome in neurons of the dLGN. Toward this end, we employed a previously used method to synchronize vision-dependent gene expression by rearing mice in the dark for several days and then re-exposing them to light. Although this manipulation is non-physiological for the mouse, it provides a robust stimulation paradigm for the detection of experience-dependent genes (Mardinly et al., 2016Mardinly A.R. Spiegel I. Patrizi A. Centofante E. Bazinet J.E. Tzeng C.P. Mandel-Brehm C. Harmin D.A. Adesnik H. Fagiolini M. Greenberg M.E. Sensory experience regulates cortical inhibition by inducing IGF1 in VIP neurons.Nature. 2016; 531: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One obstacle to analyzing experience-dependent transcription in vivo is the recent finding that multiple cell populations in the brain—including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, glia, and vascular cells—mount cell-type-specific gene programs in response to sensory stimulation (Hrvatin et al., 2018Hrvatin S. Hochbaum D.R. Nagy M.A. Cicconet M. Robertson K. Cheadle L. Zilionis R. Ratner A. Borges-Monroy R. Klein A.M. et al.Single-cell analysis of experience-dependent transcriptomic states in the mouse visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, to avoid obscuring the cell type specificity of vision-dependent gene expression, we sequenced the dLGN at single-cell resolution. WT C57BL/6J mice were dark reared during the vision-sensitive period of retinogeniculate refinement between P20 and P27 (late dark reared [LDR]) and then re-exposed to light for 0 (unstimulated condition), 1, or 8 hr (Figure 1A). These time points were chosen to allow for the detection of both immediate-early genes (IEGs) (1 hr) and late-response genes (LRGs) (8 hr). As expected, this paradigm induced robust changes in gene expression, including an increase in the levels of the well-described IEGs Fos and Npas4 as measured by whole-tissue RNA-seq, qPCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunofluorescence (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A–S1F). Consistent with the conclusion that these changes accurately reflect acute, activity-driven increases in gene transcription, analysis of chromatin accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq on dLGN tissue following 3 hr of visual stimulation identified open chromatin at activity-dependent enhancers surrounding the Fos locus (Figure S1G; Buenrostro et al., 2015Buenrostro J.D.

Neurosci. 2017; 20: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Having confirmed that this paradigm induces sensory-driven changes in gene expression, we subjected mice to LDR and visual stimulation, microdissected the dLGNs, and isolated the nuclei for snRNA-seq. Previous studies have shown that RNA-seq of individual nuclei as opposed to whole cells preserves a larger number of neurons across multiple subtypes, minimizes the effects of cell dissociation on gene expression, and enriches transcripts for those that are being actively transcribed in vivo (Habib et al., 2017Habib N.

Therefore, in the current study, whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed on individual nuclei that were captured and barcoded using a recently developed technique termed inDrops (Figure 1A; Klein et al., 2015Klein A.M.

Transcript levels across all genes were compared between the 1 or 8 hr time point and the unstimulated condition (Qiu et al., 2017Qiu X. Mao Q. Tang Y. Wang L. Chawla R. Pliner H.A. Trapnell C. Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), and differentially expressed genes were identified based upon at least a 1.5-fold difference with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. This strategy identified both up- and downregulated genes at each time point (Table S1). Overall, 43 genes were upregulated in excitatory neurons and 16 in inhibitory neurons at 1 hr, and 233 genes were upregulated in excitatory neurons and 157 in inhibitory neurons at 8 hr (Figures 1G–1J). Previous studies in mouse visual cortex have shown that the early gene programs mounted in response to sensory stimulation overlap across neuronal subtypes, and the late-response programs are more neuronal subtype specific (Hrvatin et al., 2018Hrvatin S. Hochbaum D.R. Nagy M.A. Cicconet M. Robertson K. Cheadle L. Zilionis R. Ratner A. Borges-Monroy R.

Npas4 regulates excitatory-inhibitory balance within neural circuits through cell-type-specific gene programs.Cell. 2014; 157: 1216-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, we find that in the dLGN, only four of the early-response genes induced in excitatory and inhibitory neurons overlap: the IEGs Egr1 and Nr4a1; the circadian transcription factor Per1; and an uncharacterized gene Fam13c (Figures 1G and 1H). By contrast, the broadly expressed IEG Fos was highly induced in excitatory neurons, but not in inhibitory neurons, and the gene encoding the postsynaptic scaffold component Homer1 was selectively induced in inhibitory neurons, but not excitatory neurons. Because IEG transcription factors have been proposed to function as regulators of late-response activity-dependent gene programs, the observation that some IEGs are shared between excitatory and inhibitory neurons while others are activated selectively in a neuronal subtype-specific manner in the dLGN suggests that the late-response programs within these neuronal populations might also include both shared as well as neuronal subtype-specific genes. Consistent with this prediction, the late-response gene programs induced in excitatory and inhibitory neurons following 8 hr of re-exposure to light showed a moderate degree of overlap, with 45 genes shared between the two datasets and 300 genes displaying a neuronal subtype-specific pattern of induction (Figures 1I and 1J). Shared genes of interest include the neuropeptide Vgf, which is among the most highly induced genes in both cell types and has known roles in synaptic plasticity downstream of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and CREB activation (Lin et al., 2014Lin P. Wang C. Xu B. Gao S. Guo J. Zhao X. Huang H. Zhang J. Chen X. Wang Q. Zhou W.

Additionally, the chemokine Cx3cl1 (fractalkine), which is thought to regulate brain development and neuroinflammation, is also induced in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Arnoux and Audinat, 2015Arnoux I. Audinat E. Fractalkine signaling and microglia functions in the developing brain.Neural Plast. 2015; 2015: 689404Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The induction of these genes in both neuronal populations suggests that they may be involved in experience-dependent functions within both subtypes, including shared aspects of synapse development and remodeling. Our observation that the late-response gene programs in excitatory and inhibitory neurons display overlap was unexpected based on recent findings in the visual cortex, where late-response programs are nuanced and subtype specific (Hrvatin et al., 2018Hrvatin S. Hochbaum D.R. Nagy M.A. Cicconet M. Robertson K. Cheadle L. Zilionis R. Ratner A. Borges-Monroy R. Klein A.M. et al.Single-cell analysis of experience-dependent transcriptomic states in the mouse visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This difference may reflect a unique feature of thalamic or dLGN circuit wiring. For example, excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dLGN both receive driving input from RGCs, through which they each inherit their receptive field properties, as well as modulatory input from layer VI of visual cortex that sharpens these features (Weyand, 2016Weyand T.G. The multifunctional lateral geniculate nucleus.Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 27: 135-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the anatomical and physiological context of a neuron may significantly influence its late-response gene program. Nevertheless, we note that many genes are induced in one neuronal subtype, but not the other. For example, the non-canonical Notch ligand Dlk2 is highly induced in excitatory neurons, and the RNA-binding protein Pcbp4 is selectively induced in inhibitory neurons. Overall, this atlas of single-cell transcriptomics provides a useful resource for future studies investigating visual experience-dependent gene expression in the dLGN. Although inhibitory neurons in the dLGN receive the same patterned activity as their neighboring TC neurons and excitatory and inhibitory neurons display some overlap in LRG expression, inhibitory neurons are different from TC neurons in that they do not undergo a developmental process of synaptic refinement (Seabrook et al., 2013Seabrook T.A. Krahe T.E. Govindaiah G. Guido W. Interneurons in the mouse visual thalamus maintain a high degree of retinal convergence throughout postnatal development.Neural Dev. 2013; 8: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For this reason, we speculated that molecular regulators of sensory-driven synaptic refinement in TC neurons would include LRGs that are highly induced by experience selectively in TC neurons and not interneurons. Thus, we next focused our attention on an LRG that is specifically induced in dLGN excitatory neurons. The most highly induced gene after 8 hr of visual stimulation that is selective to excitatory neurons encodes the cell surface pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor TNF receptor superfamily member 12a, or Tnfrsf12a (Figure 1I). The protein encoded by Tnfrsf12a, referred to as Fn14, promotes tissue remodeling in non-neural systems, such as skeletal muscle, in part by driving inflammatory gene expression through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (Brown et al., 2003Brown S.A.

Fn14 has also been shown to mediate actin remodeling by engaging the cytoskeletal regulator Rac1, suggesting that Fn14 might regulate retinogeniculate refinement by effecting vision-dependent changes in synaptic architecture (Tanabe et al., 2003Tanabe K.

Although little was known about Fn14 expression or function in the brain, we hypothesized that, following its induction by sensory experience, Fn14 might remodel synaptic connections between RGCs and excitatory neurons of the dLGN. Consistent with this possibility, RNA-seq of whole-tissue dLGN by previously described strategies (Figure S2; Gray et al., 2014Gray J.M. Harmin D.A. Boswell S.A. Cloonan N. Mullen T.E. Ling J.J.

We validated the sensory-driven induction and developmental expression profile of Fn14 by qPCR (Figures 2A and 2B ) and further found by western blotting of dLGN extracts that Fn14 protein is upregulated around 8 hr following re-exposure of LDR animals to light, with Fn14 protein expression peaking between 24 and 48 hr after light exposure (Figures 2C and 2D). Western blotting also revealed a 60% decrease in Fn14 protein expression at P27 following LDR compared to normally reared (NR), age-matched controls, indicating that visual stimulation not only acutely upregulates Fn14 expression but also is required for the proper expression of Fn14 in the dLGN during development (Figures 2E and 2F). Similarly, probing dLGN lysates from animals at different postnatal ages revealed a protein expression pattern that is correlated with Fn14 mRNA expression, with Fn14 protein expression increasing significantly at P16 and remaining high through the vision-sensitive period between P20 and P27 (Figures 2G and 2H). We next employed multiplexed single-molecule FISH to characterize the regional distribution of Fn14 in coronal brain sections from P27 mice following LDR and re-exposure to light for 8 hr. Low-magnification confocal microscopy revealed that Fn14 is expressed in the thalamus and selectively enriched in the dLGN but is undetectable in other brain regions, including visual and auditory cortices and hippocampus (Figure 3A). This expression profile is consistent with RNA-seq datasets from the visual cortex that show little Fn14 expression in cortical excitatory neurons, even after visual stimulation (Hrvatin et al., 2018Hrvatin S.

https://openalex.org/W2883891109,"Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are a large (∼3000 members) and structurally diverse class of metabolites restricted to a limited number of plant families in the order Gentianales. Tabernanthe iboga or iboga (Apocynaceae) is native to western equatorial Africa and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Howard Lotsof is credited with bringing iboga to the attention of Western medicine through his accidental discovery that iboga can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Since this observation, iboga has been investigated for its use in the general management of addiction. We were interested in elucidating ibogaine biosynthesis to understand the unique reaction steps en route to ibogaine. Furthermore, because ibogaine is currently sourced from plant material, these studies may help improve the ibogaine supply chain through synthetic biology approaches. Here, we used next-generation sequencing to generate the first iboga transcriptome and leveraged homology-guided gene discovery to identify the penultimate hydroxylase and final O-methyltransferase steps in ibogaine biosynthesis, herein named ibogamine 10-hydroxylase (I10H) and noribogaine-10-O-methyltransferase (N10OMT). Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (I10H) or Escherichia coli (N10OMT) and incubation with putative precursors, along with HPLC–MS analysis, confirmed the predicted activities of both enzymes. Moreover, high expression levels of their transcripts were detected in ibogaine-accumulating plant tissues. These discoveries coupled with our publicly available iboga transcriptome will contribute to additional gene discovery efforts and could lead to the stabilization of the global ibogaine supply chain and to the development of ibogaine as a treatment for addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2884179193,"Background Screening for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus is recommended for Asian Americans with a body mass index ≥23. However, the optimal body mass index cut-off score for predicting the risk of diabetes mellitus in Japanese people is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine the best body mass index cut-off score for predicting insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus in the Japanese population. Methods This study had two parts, a clinical investigation and a retrospective observational investigation. In the clinical part of the study, 58 participants (26 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 32 non-diabetics) underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which their glucose disposal rate was measured. For the retrospective part of the study, medical check-up data from 88,305 people in the Tottori Prefecture were analyzed for clinical evidence of diabetes mellitus. The optimal BMI cut-off scores for prediction of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus were determined. Results In the clamp study, the optimal body mass index cut-off score to predict insulin resistance in non-diabetic patients was 22.7. All participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus were insulin resistant, and the optimal body mass index cut-off score for prediction of severe insulin resistance was 26.2. When the data from the type 2 diabetic and the non-diabetic participants were combined, the optimal body mass index cut-off score for prediction of insulin resistance was 23.5. Analysis of 88,305 medical check-up records yielded an optimal body mass index cut-off score for prediction of diabetes mellitus of 23.6. Conclusions These results suggest that having a body mass index ≥23 is a risk factor for insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus in the Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W2885022409,"A metastatic cancer diagnosis is associated with high levels of distress in patients and caregivers. Mindfulness interventions can reduce distress and improve quality of life in cancer patients. However, standard mindfulness training relies on in-person instruction, which is often not practical for either patients receiving chemotherapy or their caregivers. In the Being Present single arm pilot study, we designed and tested an 8-week audio-based mindfulness meditation program for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy with or without a participating caregiver. The study accrued 33 of 74 (45%) eligible patients consenting together with 20 family caregivers (53 participants total) within nine months. Forty-one participants were evaluable (77%); 10 of 12 cases of attrition were attributable to hospitalization or death. Median participant age was 51 (range 21–78 years); 38% were men. Baseline levels of distress were similar in patients and caregivers. The top reasons for participation cited in pre-intervention interviews were to increase relaxation/calm, improve mood/emotions, and reduce stress/anxiety. In measures of adherence, 59% of responses to weekly texts asking: “Have you practiced today?” were “Yes” and 59% of interviewees reported practicing >50% of the time. Compared to baseline, post-intervention surveys demonstrated significantly reduced distress (p = 0.01) and anxiety (p = 0.03); as well as increased non-reactivity (p<0.01), and feeling at peace (p<0.01). Post-intervention qualitative interviews, where 71% of participants reported benefit, were consistent with quantitative findings. In the interviews, participants spontaneously described reduced stress/anxiety and increased relaxation/calm. Benefits appeared to be accentuated in patient-caregiver pairs as compared to unpaired patients. Seventy-nine percent of participants reported plans for continued practice after study completion. We conclude that the Being Present audio-based mindfulness meditation program is of interest to, feasible, and acceptable for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and caregivers, with initial evidence of efficacy. These results will guide plans for a follow-up study. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02423720"
https://openalex.org/W2883595601,"Increasing evidence supports the important role of H2S in renal physiology and the pathogenesis of kidney injury. Whether H2S regulates water metabolism in the kidney and the potential mechanism are still unknown. The present study was conducted to determine the role of H2S in urine concentration. Inhibition of both cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), 2 major enzymes for endogenous H2S production, with propargylglycine (PPG) and amino-oxyacetate (AOAA), respectively, caused increased urine output and reduced urine osmolality in mice that was associated with decreased expression of aquaporin (AQP)-2 in the renal inner medulla. Mice treated with both PPG and AOAA developed a urine concentration defect in response to dehydration that was accompanied by reduced AQP-2 protein expression. Inhibition of CSE alone was associated with a mild decrease in AQP-2 protein level in the renal medulla of heterozygous CBS mice. GYY4137, a slow H2S donor, markedly improved urine concentration and prevented the down-regulation of renal AQP-2 protein expression in mice with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). GYY4137 significantly increased cAMP levels in cell lysates prepared from inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) suspensions. AQP-2 protein expression was also upregulated, but was significantly inhibited by the adenyl cyclase inhibitor MDL12330A or the PKA inhibitor H89, but not the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonist tolvaptan. Inhibition of endogenous H2S production impaired urine concentration in mice, whereas an exogenous H2S donor improved urine concentration in lithium-induced NDI by increasing AQP-2 expression in the collecting duct principal cells. H2S upregulated AQP-2 protein expression, probably via the cAMP-PKA pathway.—Luo, R., Hu, S., Liu, Q., Han, M., Wang, F., Qiu, M., Li, S., Li, X., Yang, T., Fu, X., Wang, W., Li, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883343666,"Purpose To classify subjects with primary angle closure into clusters based on features from anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) imaging and to explore how these clusters correspond to disease subtypes, including primary angle closure suspect (PACS), primary angle closure glaucoma(PACG), acute primary angle closure (APAC) and fellow eyes of APAC and reveal the factors that become more predominant in each subtype of angle closure. Method A cross-sectional study of 248 eyes of 198 subjects(88 PACS eyes, 53 PACG eyes, 54 APAC eyes and 53 fellow eyes of APAC) that underwent complete examination including gonioscopy, A-scan biometry, and ASOCT. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method was used to classify eyes based on ASOCT parameters. Results Statistical clustering analysis produced three clusters among which the anterior segment parameters were significantly different. Cluster 1(43 eyes) had the smallest anterior chamber depth(ACD) and area, as well as the greatest lens vault (p<0.001 for all). Cluster 2(113 eyes) had the thickest iris at 2000 microns(p = 0.048), and largest iris area(p<0.001), and the deepest ACD (p<0.001). Cluster 3(92 eyes) was characterized by elements of both clusters 1 and 2 and a higher iris curvature(p<0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of clusters among subtypes of angle closure eyes(p<0.001). Although the patterns of clusters were similar in PACS and PACG eyes, with the majority of the eyes classified into cluster 2(55%, and 62%, respectively), the highest proportion of APAC and fellow eyes were assigned to clusters 1(44%) and 3 (51%), respectively. Conclusion Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three clusters with different features. Predominant anatomical components are different among subtypes of primary angle closure."
https://openalex.org/W2884855741,"The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an autocidal control method that relies on inundative releases of sterilized mass-reared insects. This technology has been used in several area-wide programmes for the suppression/eradication of fruit fly populations. Choosing the optimum sterilizing dose and the sterile release density is an essential step of the SIT. Considering unsolved issues related to the application of this technique against Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), this study aimed to define accurately the central target dose for both sexes of this species and to verify the induction of sterility in fertile flies at different sterile:fertile ratios. The results from the regression analyses proved that the sterilization process for the A. fraterculus Brazilian-1 morphotype (the most common in southern Brazil and Argentina) could consist of irradiating pupae 72 h before adult emergence at 40 Gy, with no detrimental effects to standard quality control parameters. The ovarian development in irradiated females was characterized, demonstrating that doses equal to or higher than 25 Gy cause complete and irreversible ovarian atrophy. The laboratory and field cage tests showed that the sterility induction increased with the proportion of sterile flies, and a sterile:fertile ratio of 50:1 should be appropriate in SIT field trials. The sterile females apparently did not distract the sterile males, despite of the slightly higher reductions in pupal yield for all ratios in their absence. The data generated in this study have a great practical value and will help decision-makers in planning field trials to evaluate the efficacy of the SIT against A. fraterculus populations."
https://openalex.org/W2884259470,"High utility itemset mining has become an important and critical operation in the Data Mining field. High utility itemset mining generates more profitable itemsets and the association among these itemsets, to make business decisions and strategies. Although, high utility is important, it is not the sole measure to decide efficient business strategies such as discount offers. It is very important to consider the pattern of itemsets based on the frequency as well as utility to predict more profitable itemsets. For example, in a supermarket or restaurant, beverages like champagne or wine might generate high utility (profit), but also sell less frequently compared to other beverages like soda or beer. In previous studies, it is observed that people who buy milk, bread, or diapers from a supermarket, also tend to buy beer or soda. But the items like milk, diapers, beer, or soda generate less utility (profit value) compared to beverages like champagne or wine. If we combine items like champagne or wine having high utility but less frequency, with the frequently sold items like milk, diaper, or beer, we can increase the utility of the transaction by providing some discount offers on champagne or wine. In this paper, we are integrating low-frequency itemsets with high-frequency itemsets, both having low or high utility, and provide different association rules for this combination of itemsets. In this way, we can generate a more accurate measure of pattern mining for various business strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2883270717,"Repair after damage is essential for tissue homeostasis. Postmenstrual endometrial repair is a cyclical manifestation of rapid, scar-free, tissue repair taking ∼3–5 d. Skin repair after wounding is slower (∼2 wk). In the case of chronic wounds, it takes months to years to restore integrity. Herein, the unique “rapid-repair” endometrial environment is translated to the “slower repair” skin environment. Menstrual fluid (MF), the milieu of post-menstrual endometrial repair, facilitates healing of endometrial and keratinocyte “wounds” in vitro, promoting cellular adhesion and migration, stimulates keratinocyte migration in an ex vivo human skin reconstruct model, and promotes re-epithelialization in an in vivo porcine wound model. Proteomic analysis of MF identified a large number of proteins: migration inhibitory factor, neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin, follistatin like-1, chemokine ligand-20, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor were selected for further investigation. Functionally, they promote repair of endometrial and keratinocyte wounds by promoting migration. Translation of these and other MF factors into a migration-inducing treatment paradigm could provide novel treatments for tissue repair.—Evans, J., Infusini, G., McGovern, J., Cuttle, L., Webb, A., Nebl, T., Milla, L., Kimble, R., Kempf, M., Andrews, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883294351,"Introduction Animal models have been vital for scientific discovery but have limitations, especially in infectious disease research. It is essential to develop a means to study these diseases in human models. We hypothesized that altruistic people would willingly participate in research near the end-of-life (EOL), for the benefit of science and to provide one last gift to society. Methodology Two surveys were administered to 377 self-reported HIV-negative and 96 HIV-positive individuals. Hypothetical questions assessed their willingness to participate in altruistic research in the last 6 months of life, which might result in a shortened lifespan or physical discomforts. The self-reported HIV-negative group was also asked about willingness to be exposed to infectious pathogens for the sake of research. Results Almost all responders expressed willingness to participate in research at the EOL, regardless of HIV-status. The majority of participants were willing to endure physical discomfort for the sake of research. ‘Blood draws’ was identified as the most tolerable physical discomfort (>70% in both groups). In both groups, >60% were willing to shorten their lifespans for the sake of research. A third of the self-reported HIV-negative group expressed willingness to be exposed to at least one infectious agent to participate in EOL research. Conclusions Our exploratory study demonstrates that people would welcome the opportunity to participate in altruistic research near the EOL. Such research could greatly impact the way infectious disease research is conducted. This study is limited however by its hypothetical nature. Further research is necessary to confirm this interest in those with terminal illness before any further clinical research effort at the EOL can be performed."

However, a substantial number of ischemic strokes in NVAF patients are related to non-CE mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the non-CE risk factors in ischemic stroke patients had NVAF.We included 401 patients (65.6% male, 68.6 ± 9.6 years old) who had been hospitalized due to ischemic stroke and had a known or newly diagnosed NVAF. The CE (intracardiac thrombus, dense spontaneous echo contrast, or low left atrial appendage flow velocity) and non-CE (complex aortic plaque, significant carotid stenosis, or intracranial arterial stenosis) risk factors were investigated at the time of the index stroke.The number of CE and non-CE risk factors increased with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores (p for trends < 0.001). The presence of CE risk factors was independently associated with persistent atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.003), heart failure (p = 0.003), and left atrial volume index (p < 0.001). In contrast, the presence of non-CE risk factors was independently associated with age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.049), diabetes (p = 0.030), and coronary artery calcium score (CACS; p < 0.001). CACS had the added value in predicting non-CE risk factors of ischemic stroke regardless of the CHA2DS2-VASc risk category (p < 0.001).Non-CE risk factors in ischemic stroke patients with NVAF are associated with high CHA2DS2-VASc score and CACS. Atherosclerotic non-CE risk factors should be considered as potential mechanisms of stroke even in patients with AF-associated ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2883784555,"The dimerization-driven paradoxical activation of RAF proto-oncogene Ser/Thr kinase (RAF) is the predominant cause of drug resistance and toxicity in cancer therapies with RAF inhibitors. The scaffold protein 14-3-3, which binds to the RAF C terminus, is essential for RAF activation under physiological conditions, but the molecular basis is unclear. Here we investigated whether and how 14-3-3 regulates the dimerization-driven transactivation of the RAF isoform CRAF by RAF inhibitors and affects drug resistance and toxicity by virtue of the dominant role of CRAF in these processes. We demonstrated that 14-3-3 enhances the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF by stabilizing CRAF dimers. Further, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and CRAF itself as two putative kinases that redundantly phosphorylate CRAF's C terminus and thereby control its association with 14-3-3. Next, we determined whether the combinatory inhibition of AMPK and CRAF could overcome the paradoxical effect of RAF inhibitors. We found that the AMPK inhibitor (AMPKi) not only blocked the RAF inhibitor–driven paradoxical activation of ERK signaling and cellular overgrowth in Ras-mutated cancer cells by blocking phosphorylation of Ser-621 in CRAF but also reduced the formation of drug-resistant clones of BRAFV600E-mutated cancer cells. Last, we investigated whether 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of CRAF is required for CRAF catalytic activity and observed that it was dispensable in vivo. Altogether, our study unravels the molecular mechanism by which 14-3-3 regulates dimerization-driven RAF activation and identified AMPKi as a potential agent to counteract drug resistance and adverse effects of RAF inhibitors in cancer therapies.

In a RAF dimer, the catalysis-deficient protomer, either because of mutation or inhibitor loading, facilitates the other protomer to assemble in an active conformation and thus triggers its catalytic activity (8Hu J.

Blockage of dimerization-driven transactivation of RAF kinase has important implications in RAF inhibitor–mediated cancer therapy. mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinase N-terminal acidic AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor CRAF kinase domain amino acids cAMP response element–binding protein short hairpin RNA hemagglutinin the N-terminus of firefly luciferase the C-terminus of firefly luciferase deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif of CRAF protein kinase A acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Dimerization-driven transactivation of RAF kinase is regulated by many factors. Canonical upstream Ras activation has been shown to facilitate RAF dimerization, probably through relieving the intramolecular interaction between the Ras-binding domain and kinase domain (14Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Active Ras induces heterodimerization of cRaf and BRaf.Cancer Res. 2001; 61 (11325826): 3595-3598PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, RAF inhibitors promote RAF dimerization by altering the conformation of its kinase domain (4Lavoie H. Therrien M. Regulation of RAF protein kinases in ERK signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (10.1038/nrm3979 25907612): 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The dimerization-favored conformation of the RAF molecule could be also achieved by catalytic spine mutations or β3-αC loop deletions that exist in cancer genomes (11Yuan J. Ng W.H. Lam Y.P.P. Wang Y. Xia H. Yap J. Guan S.P. Lee S.G.A. Wang M. Baccarini M. Hu J.

Furthermore, the differential molecular traits among RAF isoforms result in their distinct propensities in dimerization-driven transactivation. ARAF has a noncanonical APE motif that weakens its dimerization ability and accounts for its lesser activity toward MEK (11Yuan J. Ng W.H. Lam Y.P.P. Wang Y. Xia H. Yap J. Guan S.P. Lee S.G.A. Wang M. Baccarini M. Hu J.

The unique N-terminal acidic (NtA) motif of BRAF enables this isoform to strongly transactivate the other two isoforms through dimerization, whereas the transactivation ability of CRAF and ARAF is regulated by their NtA motif phosphorylation (8Hu J. Stites E.C. Yu H. Germino E.A. Meharena H.S. Stork P.J.S. Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Shaw A.S.

In addition, 14-3-3 has been suggested to regulate the dimer-dependent activation of RAF kinase, but the molecular basis of this regulation remains unknown (14Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A.

Because CRAF is the key isoform of RAF kinase responsible for the RAF inhibitor-induced paradoxical activation of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling in cancer therapy, in this study, we used it as a module to explore the molecular mechanism that governs 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of RAF kinase and thus regulates its dimerization-driven transactivation. Our data indicated that 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of CRAF, which is phosphorylated redundantly by AMPK and CRAF itself, facilitates CRAF transactivation by enhancing its dimerization. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential value of the AMPKi against the paradoxical effect of RAF inhibitors in cancer therapy and demonstrated that the AMPKi could not only effectively block RAF inhibitor–induced activation of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling and cellular overgrowth in Ras-mutated cancer cells but also reduce the formation of drug-resistant clones derived from BRAFV600E-mutated cancer cells. To extend our findings, we investigated the role of 14-3-3 in the catalysis of active CRAF and found that it is dispensable for CRAF catalytic activity in vivo. Taken together, this study elucidates how 14-3-3 regulates the dimerization-driven transactivation of RAF kinase and provides a potential approach to overcome the resistance and adverse effects of RAF inhibitors in cancer therapy. Previous studies have suggested that 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of RAF kinase is critical for its dimer-dependent activation (14Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R.

To confirm this finding and further explore the molecular details of this regulation, we deleted or mutated the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif of the allosteric CRAF mutant that has a fused catalytic spine and an acidic NtA motif (DDEE/A373F) (30Hu J. Yu H. Kornev A.P. Zhao J. Filbert E.L. Taylor S.S. Shaw A.S.

Using these kinase-dead mutants (DDEE/A373F/S621A and DDEE/A373F/ΔC), we carried out an RAF co-activation assay developed in our previous studies (8Hu J. Stites E.C. Yu H. Germino E.A. Meharena H.S. Stork P.J.S. Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Shaw A.S. Allosteric activation of functionally asymmetric RAF kinase dimers.Cell. 2013; 154 (10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.046 23993095): 1036-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Hu J.

When co-expressed in 293T cells, these mutants had much less ability to transactivate the WT CRAF receiver and, in turn, induced less phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in contrast to their prototype (Fig. 1, A, seventh and eighth lanes, and B). These data demonstrated that 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of CRAF indeed plays a critical role in the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF. To understand how 14-3-3 regulates the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF, we measured the dimer affinity of CRAF mutants with either deletion or mutation of the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif by complementary split luciferase assays (Fig. 2A). To do this, Nluc (the N terminus of luciferase) and Cluc (the C terminus of luciferase) were fused, respectively, to the CRAF kinase domain (CKD, aa 324–648) with or without the S621A mutation or deletion of the 14-3-3 binding motif (hereafter referred to as ΔC). Then Nluc-CKD was co-expressed with either Cluc-CKD/S621A or Cluc-CKDΔC in 293T cells (Fig. 2B). The Cluc-fused R401H mutant (Cluc-CKD/R401H), which has a disrupted dimer interface, was used as a control. The RAF inhibitor PLX4720 (vemurafenib) induced much less luciferase signaling in 293T transfectants that express either Cluc-CKD/S621A, Cluc-CKD ΔC, or Cluc-CKD/R401H, in contrast to those expressing the WT counterpart (Fig. 2C), suggesting that CKD/S621A and CKDΔC have much less ability than CKD/R401H to associate with CKD upon inhibitor loading. To further confirm this finding, we next carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 2, D and E, treatment of 293 transfectants that express CKD with PLX4720 induced robust dimerization that is impaired by S621A mutation or deletion of the 14-3-3 binding motif (ΔC) as was done by R401H mutation. Taken together, these data indicate that 14-3-3 binding to the C terminus of CRAF improves the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF by facilitating its dimerization or stabilizing its dimers. It is well-known that the binding of 14-3-3 to the C terminus of CRAF requires the phosphorylation of Ser-621 in the RSXSXP motif. Previous studies have suggested that the phosphorylation of Ser-621 is mediated by PKA, AMPK, or CRAF in different contexts (26Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Negative regulation of Raf-1 by phosphorylation of serine 621.Mol. Cell.

To clarify which kinase(s) target(s) this site and thus regulates the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF, we examined phospho–Ser-621 of WT CRAF or its kinase-dead mutant (A373F) expressed in 293T cells with or without pharmaceutical inhibition of PKA or AMPK. As shown in Fig. 3A, bottom panel, treatment of 293 transfectants with the PKA inhibitor H89 dramatically diminished the phosphorylation of cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB), a direct target of PKA, whereas treatment with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C completely blocked the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a putative effector of AMPK, suggesting that the activity of PKA or AMPK, respectively, is inhibited in these cells. However, only the kinase-dead A373F mutant lost phospho–Ser-621 upon AMPK inhibition with Compound C (Fig. 3A, seventh lane), whereas PKA inhibition with H89 slightly enhanced phospho–Ser-621 in both WT and kinase-dead A373F CRAF (Fig. 3A, third and sixth lanes). These data indicated that Ser-621 in the 14-3-3 binding motif of CRAF is phosphorylated redundantly by AMPK and CRAF itself, although the mechanism for the slight increase of phospho–Ser-621 in the presence of the PKA inhibitor is unclear and requires further investigation in the future. Further, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay that the blockage of phospho–Ser-621 in kinase-dead A373F CRAF by Compound C impaired the association of 14-3-3 with this mutant (Fig. 3, C and D). The paradoxical activation of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling driven by RAF inhibitors is not only responsible for the intrinsic resistance of Ras-mutated cancers but also one of the important causes that lead to acquired resistance in BRAFV600E-harboring cancers (32Holderfield M. Deuker M.M. McCormick F. McMahon M. Targeting RAF kinases for cancer therapy: BRAF-mutated melanoma and beyond.Nat. Rev.

Moreover, CRAF has been shown to be a key isoform of RAF kinase that mediates RAF inhibitor–induced paradoxical activation of this signaling pathway (18Heidorn S.J. Milagre C. Whittaker S. Nourry A.

As it has been demonstrated that the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF requires phosphorylation of the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif redundantly by AMPK and CRAF itself, we next investigated whether AMPKi blocks the RAF inhibitor–induced paradoxical activation of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling in Ras-mutated cancer cells, thus representing a viable combination strategy. As reported before, the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib activated RAF–MEK–ERK signaling in a paradoxical manner in the Ras-mutated cancer cell lines H1299 (NrasQ61K) and Sk-mel-2 (NrasQ61R) but not in the Ras-WT cancer cell line H522 (Fig. 4, A–F). This paradoxical effect of vemurafenib on H1299 and Sk-mel-2 cancer cell lines was blocked by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C (Fig. 4, A–F) or the shRNA-mediated knockdowns of AMPKα1, the predominant isoform of AMPKα in H1299 cells (Fig. 4, G–I). Furthermore, the paradoxical stimulation of cell growth by vemurafenib in H1299 and Sk-mel-2 cancer cell lines was also inhibited by Compound C or AMPKα1 knockdown (Fig. 5, A–G). Noteworthy, the concentrations of Compound C used in our experiments could effectively block the phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK (Fig. 5H) but had no apparent toxicity in these cell lines (Fig. 5, A, C, and E), which excludes the potential artifacts arising from this AMPK inhibitor. Altogether, these data further support that AMPK- and CRAF-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif plays a critical role in the dimerization-driven transactivation of CRAF.Figure 5.The AMPKi inhibits the enhanced proliferation of Ras-mutated cancer cell lines induced by the RAF inhibitor. A, C, and E, the nontoxic concentrations of Compound C for different cancer cell lines were determined by cell growth assays in medium with 2-fold diluted drug. H1299 lung cancer cells, Sk-mel-2 melanoma cancer cells, and H522 lung cancer cells were tolerant to 0.16 μm, 1.0 μm, and 0.62 μm Compound C, respectively. B, D, and F, the cell proliferation profiles in medium with 2-fold diluted PLX4720 with or without Compound C at the tolerant concentrations (0.16 μm for H1299, 1.0 μm for Sk-mel-2, or 0.62 μm for H522) were constructed by cell counting after 1-week culture. G, the cell proliferation profiles of H1299 stable cell lines with shRNA against AMPKα1 or luciferase were also obtained as in B. H, the inhibition of AMPK activity in cancer cells treated with Compound C at the tolerant concentrations in B, D, and F was confirmed by anti-phospho-ACC immunoblot.

Hence we examined whether AMPKi would enhance the efficacy of RAF inhibitors by impairing the drug resistance in BRAFV600E-harboring cancers. To this end, we treated A375 and A101D, two BRAFV600E-positive melanoma cell lines, with vemurafenib alone or plus Compound C and identified the formation of drug-resistant clones by crystal violet staining. As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of Compound C at a concentration without apparent toxicity (0.62 μm) effectively blocked the phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK and dramatically reduced the formation of drug-resistant clones from both melanoma cell lines.

We report here that recombinant fungal and archaeal viperin enzymes catalyze the addition of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA•) to the double bond of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), producing a new compound we named adenylated isopentyl pyrophosphate (AIPP). The reaction is specific for IPP, as other pyrophosphate compounds involved in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway did not react with 5′-dA•. Enzymatic reactions employing IPP derivatives as substrates revealed that any chemical change in IPP diminishes its ability to be an effective substrate of fungal viperin. Mutational studies disclosed that the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Tyr-245 in fungal viperin is the likely source of hydrogen in the last step of the radical addition, providing mechanistic insight into the radical reaction catalyzed by fungal viperin. Structure-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of viperin interacting with IPP revealed a good fit of the isopentenyl motif of IPP to the active site cavity of viperin, unraveling the molecular basis of substrate specificity of viperin for IPP.

The reaction is specific for IPP, as other pyrophosphate compounds involved in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway did not react with 5′-dA•. Enzymatic reactions employing IPP derivatives as substrates revealed that any chemical change in IPP diminishes its ability to be an effective substrate of fungal viperin. Mutational studies disclosed that the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Tyr-245 in fungal viperin is the likely source of hydrogen in the last step of the radical addition, providing mechanistic insight into the radical reaction catalyzed by fungal viperin. Structure-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of viperin interacting with IPP revealed a good fit of the isopentenyl motif of IPP to the active site cavity of viperin, unraveling the molecular basis of substrate specificity of viperin for IPP. Collectively, our findings indicate that IPP is an effective substrate of fungal and archaeal viperin enzymes and provide critical insights into the reaction mechanism.

Viperin (also known as RSAD2 and Cig5) was first identified as a gene induced by human cytomegalovirus in fibroblasts (6Zhu H. Cong J.P. Shenk T.

Since its discovery, viperins from diverse vertebrates, ranging from humans to fish, have been studied for their antiviral activity. In addition to IFN-γ, viperin is also induced by IFN-α, IFN-β, dsDNA, dsRNA, lipopolysaccharide, and infection with viruses.

Despite extensive studies over the past 16 years, however, the molecular mechanism underlying viral inhibition by viperin is unknown. The study that has come closest to revealing the mechanism of action was carried out by Wang et al. (24Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. The interferon-inducible protein viperin inhibits influenza virus release by perturbing lipid rafts.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2 (18005724): 96-10510.1016/j.chom.2007.06.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and suggested that viperin physically interacts with farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) and inhibits its enzymatic activity. But a recent study by Makins et al. (35Makins C. Ghosh S. Román-Meléndez G.D. Malec P.A. Kennedy R.T. Marsh E.N.G.

The recently published crystal structure of viperin from Mus musculus (MmuViperin) provides molecular insight into viperin as a radical SAM enzyme (36Fenwick M.K. Li Y. Cresswell P. Modis Y.

U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28607080): 6806-6811PubMed Google Scholar), but the study did not reveal possible biological substrate(s) of viperin. More recently, two studies described the in vitro reconstitution of viperin-catalyzed reactions and resulted in two different conclusions (37Honarmand Ebrahimi K. Carr S.B. McCullagh J. Wickens J. Rees N.H. Cantley J. Armstrong F.A.

Based on our study presented here, we have disagreements with both studies, and we will discuss them below. Several studies over the years have provided insight into the roles of different regions of viperin in its antiviral activity. First, the motifs required for coordinating [4Fe-4S] and SAM binding are essential for the antiviral activity of viperin (14Jiang D. Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.-T. Identification of three interferon-inducible cellular enzymes that inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus.J.

Second, the C-terminal extension is also essential for the antiviral activity of viperin, as even a single deletion or mutation of the very last C-terminal residue abolishes its antiviral activity (14Jiang D. Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.-T. Identification of three interferon-inducible cellular enzymes that inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus.J.

Third, although the N-terminal domain, which is responsible for anchoring viperin on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (39Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. The N-terminal amphipathic α-helix of viperin mediates localization to the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits protein secretion.J. Biol.

Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.-T. Identification of three interferon-inducible cellular enzymes that inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus.J.

To illuminate the mechanism of the enzymatic reaction carried out by viperin, we have carried out extensive bioinformatic, biochemical, and structural analyses of viperin. We demonstrate here that fungal viperin specifically catalyzes the radical addition of 5′-dA• to the double bond of IPP, resulting in the formation of a new compound, AIPP. To provide insight into the mode of action of human viperin (HsaViperin), we performed a Blastp search based on the HsaViperin sequence against the Protein Data Bank. At the time we started our work on viperin a few years ago, the only hit of our search using the default setting of Blastp (E = 10) was the structure of MoaA from Staphylococcus aureus (SauMoaA) (41Hänzelmann P. Schindelin H. Binding of 5′-GTP to the C-terminal FeS cluster of the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme MoaA provides insights into its mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

MoaA catalyzes the first step of biosynthesis of the essential molybdopterin co-factor using GTP as the substrate (42Hover B.M. Tonthat N.K. Schumacher M.A. Yokoyama K. Mechanism of pyranopterin ring formation in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We noticed that several residues in MoaA responsible for binding the triphosphate motif of GTP are conserved in HsaViperin (Fig. S1), implying that the substrate(s) of viperin might also contain a phosphate motif(s). This observation, together with the knowledge from a previous study indicating that viperin inhibits enzymatic activity of FPPS (24Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. The interferon-inducible protein viperin inhibits influenza virus release by perturbing lipid rafts.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2 (18005724): 96-10510.1016/j.chom.2007.06.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that, instead of FPPS, the substrate(s) or product(s) of FPPS might be the target(s) of viperin. To test this hypothesis, we first constructed the sequence similarity network (SSN) of viperin (43Gerlt J.A. Bouvier J.T. Davidson D.B. Imker H.J. Sadkhin B. Slater D.R. Whalen K.L. Enzyme function initiative-enzyme similarity tool (EFI-EST): a web tool for generating protein sequence similarity networks.Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, in addition to viperin found in eukaryota (magenta nodes), viperin homologs are also present in a dozen archaea (green nodes) as well as ∼60 bacteria (blue nodes). Furthermore, the eukaryotic viperin are predominantly from two distinct kingdoms, with 117 sequences from Animalia and 74 sequences from Fungi. Guided by SSN of viperin, we selected 12 viperin (four each from bacteria, archaea, and fungi) for cloning to obtain recombinant proteins for in vitro reconstitution and structural characterization. Among the 12 cloned viperin, only viperin from fungal Trichoderma virens (TviViperin) and archaeal Methanofollis liminatans (MliViperin) produced soluble proteins in Escherichia coli (Fig. S2A). In addition, we also obtained the recombinant protein of HsaViperin with the N-terminal 50 aa truncated (HsaViperin-ΔN50; Fig. S2A), which has previously been shown to express in E. coli (8Duschene K.S. Broderick J.B. The antiviral protein viperin is a radical SAM enzyme.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20176015): 1263-126710.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Shaveta G.

As expected, the eukaryotic HsaViperin and TviViperin are more homologous with each other than the archaeal MliViperin, which is reflected both in the SSN (Fig. 1A) and the degrees of sequence identities among them (Fig. 1B). Among the three, archaeal MliViperin has the highest level of expression in E. coli (Fig. S2A, lane 4), but the purified recombinant fungalTviViperin exhibits the highest solubility in solution.HsaViperin-ΔN50 ranks last both in the level of expression in E. coli and the solubility of the purified protein, consistent with the previous observations (8Duschene K.S. Broderick J.B. The antiviral protein viperin is a radical SAM enzyme.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20176015): 1263-126710.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Shaveta G.

Accordingly, the recombinant fungal TviViperin and archaeal MliViperin were used for most experiments reported here. We carried out enzymatic assays with recombinant viperin using the pyrophosphate compounds involved in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway as substrates. The chemical structures of two of these compounds, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and IPP, are shown in Fig. 2A. For the reaction catalyzed by fungal TviViperin, only SAM was observed in the absence of the reducing agent sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), which serves as the electron donor (Fig. 2B, trace i). The addition of Na2S2O4 resulted in formation of 5′-dA•, which is subsequently quenched to 5′-adenosine sulfinic acid (5′-SO2HA) and 5′-deoxyadenosine (5′-dA) in the absence of a substrate (Fig. 2B, trace ii). A small amount of methylthioadenosine (MTA), the major decomposing product of SAM, was also produced with the radical reaction for a reason we do not understand (Fig. 2B, trace ii; compare with trace i). The addition of DMAPP produced similar results (Fig. 2B, trace iii; compare with trace ii), indicating that DMAPP is not a substrate of fungal TviViperin. However, when IPP was employed as the substrate, a major new product, which is shown as two partially separated peaks, was formed in addition to the minor abortive products of 5′-SO2HA and 5′-dA (Fig. 2B, trace iv). As described below, this new product results from the radical addition of 5′-dA• to the double bond of IPP, and it is therefore named adenylated isopentyl pyrophosphate (AIPP). The selectivity of the reaction is remarkable, as DMAPP and IPP share the same chemical connection and only differ in the location of the double bond"

The structures of most enzymes involved in PVD chromophore maturation have been elucidated, but the structure of the essential tyrosinase PvdP, a monooxygenase required for the penultimate step in PVD biosynthesis, is not known. Here, we closed this gap by determining the crystal structure of PvdP in an apo and tyrosine-complexed state at 2.1 and 2.7 Å, respectively. These structures revealed that PvdP is a homodimer, with each chain consisting of a C-terminal tyrosinase domain and an N-terminal eight-stranded β-barrel reminiscent of streptavidin that appears to have a structural role only. We observed that ligand binding leads to the displacement of a “placeholder” tyrosine that blocks the active site in the apo structure. This exposes a large, deep binding site that seems suitable for accommodating ferribactin, a substrate of PvdP in PVD biosynthesis. The binding site consists almost exclusively of residues from the tyrosinase domain. Of note, we also found that this domain is more closely related to tyrosinases from arthropods rather than to tyrosinases from other bacteria.

Here, we report that SnoN also plays a critical role in white adipose tissue (WAT) development by regulating mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) self-renewal and differentiation. We found that SnoN promotes MSC differentiation in the adipocyte lineage by antagonizing activin A/Smad2, but not TGFβ/Smad3 signaling. Mice lacking SnoN or expressing a mutant SnoN defective in binding to the Smads were protected from high-fat diet–induced obesity and insulin resistance, and MSCs lacking a functional SnoN exhibited defective differentiation. We further demonstrated that activin, via Smad2, appears to be the major regulator of WAT development in vivo. We also noted that activin A is abundantly expressed in WAT and adipocytes through an autocrine mechanism and promotes MSC self-renewal and inhibits adipogenic differentiation by inducing expression of the gene encoding the homeobox transcription factor Nanog. Of note, SnoN repressed activin/Smad2 signaling and activin A expression, enabling expression of adipocyte-specific transcription factors and promoting adipogenic differentiation. In conclusion, our study has revealed that SnoN plays an important in vivo role in adipocyte differentiation and WAT development in vivo by decreasing activity in the activin/Smad2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2883415654,"Logistic regression (LR) models are among the most frequently used statistical tools in ecology. With LR one can infer if a species’ habitat use is related to environmental factors and estimate the probability of species occurrence based on the values of these factors. However, studies often use inadequate sampling with regards to the arbitrarily chosen ratio between occupied and unoccupied (or available) locations, and this has a profound effect on the inference and predictive power of LR models. To demonstrate the effect of various sampling strategies/efforts on the quality of LR models, we used a unique census dataset containing all the used roosting cavities of the tree-dwelling bat Nyctalus leisleri and all cavities where the species was absent. We compared models constructed from randomly selected data subsets with varying ratios of occupied and unoccupied cavities (1:1, 1:5, 1:10) with a full dataset model (ratio 1:31). These comparisons revealed that the power of LR models was low when the sampling did not reflect the population ratio of occupied and unoccupied cavities. The use of weights improved the subsampled models. Thus, this study warns against inadequate data sampling and highly encourages a randomized sampling procedure to estimate the true ratio of occupied:unoccupied locations, which can then be used to optimize a manageable sampling effort and apply weights to improve the LR model. Such an approach may provide robust and reliable models suitable for both inference and prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2883588085,"From small communities to entire nations and society at large, inequality in wealth, social status, and power is one of the most pervasive and tenacious features of the social world. What causes inequality to emerge and persist? In this study, we investigate how the structure and rules of our interactions can increase inequality in social groups. Specifically, we look into the effects of four structural conditions-network structure, network fluidity, reputation tracking, and punishment institutions-on the distribution of earnings in network cooperation games. We analyze 33 experiments comprising 96 experimental conditions altogether. We find that there is more inequality in clustered networks compared to random networks, in fixed networks compared to randomly rewired and strategically updated networks, and in groups with punishment institutions compared to groups without. Secondary analyses suggest that the reasons inequality emerges under these conditions may have to do with the fact that fixed networks allow exploitation of the poor by the wealthy and clustered networks foster segregation between the poor and the wealthy, while the burden of costly punishment falls onto the poor, leaving them poorer. Surprisingly, we do not find evidence that inequality is affected by reputation in a systematic way but this could be because reputation needs to play out in a particular network environment in order to have an effect. Overall, our findings suggest possible strategies and interventions to decrease inequality and mitigate its negative impact, particularly in the context of mid- and large-sized organizations and online communities."

The p.G307S mutation is the most frequent cause of CBS deficiency in Ireland, which has the highest prevalence of CBS deficiency in Europe. Individuals homozygous for this mutation tend to be severely affected and are pyridoxine nonresponsive, but the molecular basis for the strong effects of this mutation is unclear. Here, we characterized a transgenic mouse model lacking endogenous Cbs and expressing human p.G307S CBS protein from a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter (Tg-G307S Cbs−/−). Unlike mice expressing other mutant CBS alleles, the Tg-G307S transgene could not efficiently rescue neonatal lethality of Cbs−/− in a C57BL/6J background. In a C3H/HeJ background, zinc-induced Tg-G307S Cbs−/− mice expressed high levels of p.G307S CBS in the liver, and this protein variant forms multimers, similarly to mice expressing WT human CBS. However, the p.G307S enzyme had no detectable residual activity. Moreover, treating mice with proteasome inhibitors failed to significantly increase CBS-specific activity. These findings indicated that the G307S substitution likely affects catalytic function as opposed to causing a folding defect. Using molecular dynamics simulation techniques, we found that the G307S substitution likely impairs catalytic function by limiting the ability of the tyrosine at position 308 to assume the proper conformational state(s) required for the formation of the pyridoxal–cystathionine intermediate.

ZmCOPT genes have expression in all of the tested tissues, including roots, stems, leaves and flowers (male and female), and their expression levels vary responding to stress due to Cu-deficiency and excess.

https://openalex.org/W2883166376,"Flavin-binding photoreceptor proteins sense blue-light (BL) in diverse organisms and have become core elements in recent optogenetic applications. The light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) protein Vivid (VVD) from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a classic BL photoreceptor, characterized by effecting a photocycle based on light-driven formation and subsequent spontaneous decay of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct. Here we report that VVD presents alternative outcomes to light exposure that result in protein self-oxidation and, unexpectedly, rise of stability through kinetic control. Using optical absorbance and mass spectrometry we show that purified VVD develops amorphous aggregates with the presence of oxidized residues located at the cofactor binding pocket. Light exposure increases oxidative levels in VVD and specific probe analysis identifies singlet oxygen production by the flavin. These results indicate that VVD acts alternatively as a photosensitizer, inducing self-oxidative damage and subsequent aggregation. Surprisingly, BL illumination has an additional, opposite effect in VVD. We show that light-induced adduct formation establishes a stable state, delaying protein aggregation until photoadduct decay occurs. In accordance, repeated BL illumination suppresses VVD aggregation altogether. Furthermore, photoadduct formation confers VVD stability against chemical denaturation. Analysis of the aggregation kinetics and testing of stabilizers against aggregation reveal that aggregation in VVD proceeds through light-dependent kinetic control and dimer formation. These results uncover the aggregation pathway of a photosensor, where light induces a remarkable interplay between protein damage and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2884555204,"Objective Despite poor clinic communication and staff treatment being reported by donors, high rates of overall satisfaction are still reported in surveys. This study will evaluate the importance of communication and interaction between donors and fertility clinic staff in gamete donor care. Methods We report on 120 egg and sperm donors’ responses to a UK-wide online satisfaction survey. The survey focused on donors’ interactions with fertility clinic staff pre-, during, and post- donation. Basic cross-tabulation was performed on the data using online survey software. Textual data was read and extracts identified, which illustrated and expanded on the findings from the numerical data. Diagrammatic modeling was also utilised to analyse the textual data, with particular focus to relationships between the donors and clinic staff, the main activities within the gamete donation process, and how these activities may affect donor satisfaction with the gamete donation process. Results Donors expressed concern for the infertile couple and the resulting child; conveyed frustration at not receiving information on the expenses they could claim; felt lost in the system regarding the ease of making clinic appointments, and once made they were routinely not seen on time for these appointments. Donors also negatively commented on aftercare, the location and condition of the donation room, and information on contraception. In addition, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome was frequently reported, with these egg donors believing that clinic staff were not concerned with their physical or emotional well-being, but were instead disproportionately focused on extracting the eggs. Conclusions The multifaceted notion of donors highlights the complexity inherent to the gamete donation process, which comprises various aspects of uncertainty in the donation system, and ambiguity in the donation process. Categorising donors as Altruist, Customer, and Patient, conveys the particular importance of staff communication and treatment in donor care. These categories are not mutually exclusive however, in that an individual donor may experience more than one of these perspectives during the course of their gamete donation journey. Finally, there were a number of exemplar cases, where donors reported high satisfaction throughout, and these correlated with them being given a single point of contact at the clinic. Subject to resource constraints, we suggest that this practice should be implemented throughout clinics in the UK, so that donors have access to dedicated clinic staff who not only support them emotionally and physically throughout the gamete donation process, but also ensure that communication is open, clear, timely, and consistent."
https://openalex.org/W2884587967,"In plant breeding, one of the main purpose of multi-environment trial (MET) is to assess the intensity of genotype-by-environment (G×E) interactions in order to select high-performing lines of each environment. Most models to analyze such MET data consider only the additive genetic effects and the part of the non-additive genetic effects are confounded with the residual terms and this may lead to the non-negligible residual covariances between the same trait measured at multiple environments. In breeding programs it is also common to have the phenotype information from some environments available and values are missing in some other environments. In this study we focused on two problems: (1) to study the impact of different residual covariance structures on genomic prediction ability using different models to analyze MET data; (2) to compare the ability of different MET analysis models to predict the missing values in a single environment. Our results suggests that, it is important to consider the heterogeneous residual covariance structure for the MET analysis and multivariate mixed model seems to be especially suitable to predict the missing values in a single environment. We also present the prediction abilities based on Bayesian and frequentist approaches with different models using field data sets (maize and rice) having different levels of G×E interactions."

Applied to rivers and streams containing larval lampreys, TFM seldom harms non-target fishes, but the effects of sub-lethal treatments on fish physiology are not well understood. We examined the effects of 9 h exposure to TFM on the stress axis and liver metabolic capacity of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using in vivo and in vitro approaches. The fish that had been acutely exposed to TFM in vivo had increased plasma cortisol levels at 12 h post-treatment, but TFM exposure did not interfere with in vitro cortisol production in head kidney preparations. Subjecting trout to an acute handling stressor 12 h post-TFM exposure resulted in a relative attenuation of the plasma cortisol and glucose response compared to pre-stress levels. We conclude that routine TFM treatments can lead to elevations of plasma cortisol following exposure, plus a relative dampening of the stress response in rainbow trout, with high cortisol levels lasting at least 12 h post-treatment. Since the ability of the fish to produce cortisol and the liver metabolic capacity were not compromised following TFM exposure, it is likely that their ability to cope with other stressors is not altered in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2884300910,"Background Achieving weight loss is the cornerstone of the treatment of the metabolic consequences of obesity, in particular of glucose intolerance. Objective To determine whether improvement in glucose control depends on dietary macronutrient composition of the diet at identical weight loss. Materials and methods Twenty-two weeks old diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice lost weight through caloric restriction on normal chow (R-NC) or high fat diet (R-HF). Control mice were fed normal chow (LEAN) or high fat diet (OBESE) ad libitum. Body weight and composition were assessed after 8 weeks of dietary intervention. Glucose homeostasis was evaluated by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Epididymal white adipose (eWAT) and hepatic tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. Results By 30 weeks of age, the body weight of the mice on R-NC (31.6±1.7g, mean±SEM) and R-HF (32.3±0.9g) was similar to LEAN mice (31.9±1.4g), while OBESE mice weighed 51.7±2.4g. Glucose tolerance in R-NC was better than in LEAN mice (69% AUC IPGTT, P 0.0168) whereas R-HF mice remained significantly less glucose tolerant (125% AUC IPGTT, P 0.0279 vs LEAN), despite identical weight loss. The eWAT pads and adipocyte size were similar in LEAN and R-NC mice, while the eWAT pad size of R-HF was 180% of R-NC (P < 0.0001) and the average adipocyte size of R-HF mice was 134% of R-NC fed mice (P 0.0285). No LEAN or R-NC mice had hepatic steatosis, in contrast to 28.6% of R-HF mice. Compared to OBESE mice, inflammatory markers were lower in eWAT and liver tissue of R-NC, but not in R-HF mice. Measures of visceral adiposity correlated well with glucose tolerance parameters. Conclusions In mice, caloric restriction on a normal chow diet improved glucose tolerance significantly more when identical weight loss was achieved on a high fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W2883965671,"Spatial distributions of fished species must be well characterized to avoid local depletions, identify critical habitat, and predict and mitigate interactions with other fisheries. The Bristol Bay red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) fishery is one of the largest crab fisheries in Alaska. Summer crab distributions have been well documented by decades of bottom trawl surveys. However, crab movement and distribution are poorly understood outside the summer survey period, which creates several management challenges. One important component of fishery management is the existence of no-trawl zones, which are intended to protect crab from bottom trawl fisheries. However, it is difficult to evaluate the placement of no-trawl zones, because most crab bycatch occurs in trawl fisheries during winter when crab distributions are unknown. Daily fishing logs, kept by skippers in the red king crab fleet since 2005, contain detailed information on the spatial distribution of catch and effort of legal sized male crab during the autumn crab fishery. However, data contained in these hand-written logbooks have not been readily accessible. We digitized daily fishing logs from 2005 to 2016 and used spatial information on catch and effort to infer geographic distributions of legal sized male king crab during the crab fishing season. Changes in distribution were tracked across this 12-yr period and comparisons were made between warm and cold temperature regimes. In warm years (2005, 2014–2016), crab aggregated in the center of Bristol Bay, Alaska, while in cold years (2007–2013) they were closer to the Alaska Peninsula. The majority of crab were caught in no-trawl areas (63.4% on average), but variations occurred among years and with temperature regime (40.0–86.8% in no-trawl zones). As temperatures continue to shift in the Bering Sea, it will be important to continue monitoring crab distributions outside the summer survey period."
https://openalex.org/W2884325585,"Introduction This is the first exploration of service providers’ attitudes and beliefs of quality and quality improvement in the community pharmacy setting in the UK. Materials and methods A series of interviews and focus groups was conducted with stakeholders from the pharmacy profession in the UK. Interviews were semi-structured and conducted face-to-face or by telephone. Focus groups were conducted with naturally-occurring groups i.e. at pharmacy conferences. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed systematically using an interpretive approach. Results Forty-two individuals participated across four focus groups and four interviews. A maximum variation sample was achieved in terms of pharmacist and pharmacy characteristics. Participants were generally positive about the need for quality and quality improvement and provided multifaceted and interlinked interpretations of quality and acknowledged its dynamic nature “quality moves forward”. The challenge of standardising practice whilst providing person-centred care emerged: “you don’t want to lose the personal touch, but you can’t have people having a variable experience and one day it’s fantastic and the next day it isn’t”. A variety of quality measurement methods were identified including direct observation (by internal and external agents) and feedback (mystery shoppers, colleagues, regulatory inspectors, service users), suggesting that standardisation was also needed in terms of future quality measurement. There was a tendency to report negative events as triggers for improvement. Future initiatives could adopt more positive approaches including positive deviants “There’s nothing more powerful than people who’ve come up with something really good sharing it with their other colleagues”. Discussion The results are being used to develop and evaluate future quality improvement initiatives in this sector. These are likely to be targeted at organisational, team and individual levels."
https://openalex.org/W2884504490,"A debt-based economy cannot survive without economic growth. However, if private debt consistently grows faster than GDP, the consequences are financial crises and the current unprecedented level of global debt. This policy dilemma is aggravated by the lack of analyses factoring the impact of debt-growth cycles on the environment. What is really the relationship between debt and natural resource sustainability, and what is the role of debt in decoupling economic growth from natural resource availability? Here we present a conceptual Agent-Based Model (ABM) that integrates an environmental system into an ABM representation of Steve Keen's debt-based economic models. Our model explores the extent to which debt-driven processes, within debt-based economies, enhance the decoupling between economic growth and the availability of natural resources. Interestingly, environmental and economic collapse in our model are not caused by debt growth, or the debt-based nature of the economic system itself (i.e. the 'what'), but rather, these are due to the inappropriate use of debt by private actors (i.e. the 'how'). Firms inappropriately use bank credits for speculative goals-rather than production-oriented ones-and for exponentially increasing rates of technological development. This context creates temporal mismatches between natural resource growth and firms' resource extraction rates, as well as between economic growth and the capacity of the government to effectively implement natural resource conservation policies. This paper discusses the extent to which economic growth and the availability of natural resources can be re-coupled through a more sustainable use of debt, for instance by shifting mainstream banking forces to partially support environmental conservation as well as economic growth."
