https://openalex.org/W2037482151,"Rare species may have an advantage in a community by suffering less from disease; here it is shown that, because pathogens are shared among species, it is not just the abundance of a particular species but the structure of the whole community that affects exposure to disease. One advantage that rare species have in a community is that they may suffer less from disease — and pathogen pressure increases as a host species becomes more abundant. In a study of a Californian grassland habitat, Ingrid Parker et al. demonstrate that the structure of the whole community also influences exposure to disease. They show that plants suffer more disease when they have evolutionarily close species around them, reflecting the fact that many pathogens can attack several species, and as they move from host to host they tend to favour species that are closely related. The authors develop a model to predict the incidence of disease in different species of plants in natural communities, and successfully predict the degree of disease pressure on newly introduced plant species. They also show that this phylogenetically distant species advantage might contribute to the invasiveness of introduced species. Pathogens play an important part in shaping the structure and dynamics of natural communities, because species are not affected by them equally1,2. A shared goal of ecology and epidemiology is to predict when a species is most vulnerable to disease. A leading hypothesis asserts that the impact of disease should increase with host abundance, producing a ‘rare-species advantage’3,4,5. However, the impact of a pathogen may be decoupled from host abundance, because most pathogens infect more than one species, leading to pathogen spillover onto closely related species6,7. Here we show that the phylogenetic and ecological structure of the surrounding community can be important predictors of disease pressure. We found that the amount of tissue lost to disease increased with the relative abundance of a species across a grassland plant community, and that this rare-species advantage had an additional phylogenetic component: disease pressure was stronger on species with many close relatives. We used a global model of pathogen sharing as a function of relatedness between hosts, which provided a robust predictor of relative disease pressure at the local scale. In our grassland, the total amount of disease was most accurately explained not by the abundance of the focal host alone, but by the abundance of all species in the community weighted by their phylogenetic distance to the host. Furthermore, the model strongly predicted observed disease pressure for 44 novel host species we introduced experimentally to our study site, providing evidence for a mechanism to explain why phylogenetically rare species are more likely to become invasive when introduced8,9. Our results demonstrate how the phylogenetic and ecological structure of communities can have a key role in disease dynamics, with implications for the maintenance of biodiversity, biotic resistance against introduced weeds, and the success of managed plants in agriculture and forestry."

Applying these measurements in a Hanbury Brown and Twiss set-up, phonon correlations of the nanomechanical resonator are explored from below to above threshold of a parametric instability leading to self-oscillation of the resonator. Discussion of the results in terms of a ""phonon laser"", and analysis of the sensitivity of the phonon counting technique are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2045992567,"Lateral compositional and physicochemical heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature of cellular membranes on various length scales, from molecular assemblies to micrometric domains. Segregated lipid domains of increased local order, referred to as rafts, are believed to be prominent features in eukaryotic plasma membranes; however, their exact nature (i.e. size, lifetime, composition, homogeneity) in live cells remains difficult to define. Here we present evidence that both synthetic and natural plasma membranes assume a wide range of lipid packing states with varying levels of molecular order. These states may be adapted and specifically tuned by cells during active cellular processes, as we show for stimulated insulin secretion. Most importantly, these states regulate both the partitioning of molecules between coexisting domains and the bioactivity of their constituent molecules, which we demonstrate for the ligand binding activity of the glycosphingolipid receptor GM1. These results confirm the complexity and flexibility of lipid-mediated membrane organization and reveal mechanisms by which this flexibility could be functionalized by cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031873115,"The unresolved ecophysiological significance of Dark Septate Endophytes (DSE) may be in part due to existence of morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species in the most common Phialocephala fortinii s. l.—Acephala applanata species complex (PAC). We inoculated three middle European forest plants (European blueberry, Norway spruce and silver birch) with 16 strains of eight PAC cryptic species and other DSE and ectomycorrhizal/ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and focused on intraradical structures possibly representing interfaces for plant-fungus nutrient transfer and on host growth response. The PAC species Acephala applanata simultaneously formed structures resembling ericoid mycorrhiza (ErM) and DSE microsclerotia in blueberry. A. macrosclerotiorum, a close relative to PAC, formed ectomycorrhizae with spruce but not with birch, and structures resembling ErM in blueberry. Phialocephala glacialis, another close relative to PAC, formed structures resembling ErM in blueberry. In blueberry, six PAC strains significantly decreased dry shoot biomass compared to ErM control. In birch, one A. macrosclerotiorum strain increased root biomass and the other shoot biomass in comparison with non-inoculated control. The dual mycorrhizal ability of A. macrosclerotiorum suggested that it may form mycorrhizal links between Ericaceae and Pinaceae. However, we were unable to detect this species in Ericaceae roots growing in a forest with presence of A. macrosclerotiorum ectomycorrhizae. Nevertheless, the diversity of Ericaceae mycobionts was high (380 OTUs) with individual sites often dominated by hitherto unreported helotialean and chaetothyrialean/verrucarialean species; in contrast, typical ErM fungi were either absent or low in abundance. Some DSE apparently have a potential to form mycorrhizae with typical middle European forest plants. However, except A. applanata, the tested representatives of all hitherto described PAC cryptic species formed typical DSE colonization without specific structures necessary for mycorrhizal nutrient transport. A. macrosclerotiorum forms ectomycorrhiza with conifers but not with broadleaves and probably does not form common mycorrhizal networks between conifers with Ericaceae."

Recently it has been proposed that the transmembrane V0 sector of v-ATPase and its a-subunits promote membrane fusion in the endocytic and exocytic pathways independent of their acidification functions. Here, we tested if such a proton-pumping independent role of v-ATPase also applies to phagosome-lysosome fusion.

https://openalex.org/W2071276750,"Objective The HAS-BLED score enables a risk estimate of major bleeds in patients with atrial fibrillation on vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) treatment, but has not been validated for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). We analyzed whether the HAS-BLED score accurately identifies patients at high risk of major bleeds during VKA treatment for acute VTE. Methods Medical records of 537 patients with acute VTE (primary diagnosis pulmonary embolism in 223, deep vein thrombosis in 314) starting VKA treatment between 2006-2007 were searched for items on the HAS-BLED score and the occurrence of major bleeds during the first 180 days of follow-up. The hazard ratio (HR) for the occurrence of major bleeds comparing non-high with high-risk patients as defined by a HAS-BLED score ≥ 3 points was calculated using Cox-regression analysis. Results Major bleeds occurred in 11/537 patients (2.0%, 5.2/100 person years, 95% CI 2.8-9.2). Cumulative incidences of major bleeds were 1.3% (95% CI 0.1-2.5) in the non-high (HAS-BLED < 3) and 9.6% (95%CI 2.2-17.0) in the high-risk group (HAS-BLED ≥ 3), (p <0.0001 by Log-Rank test), with a HR of 8.7 (95% CI 2.7-28.4). Of the items in the HAS-BLED score, abnormal renal function (HR 10.8, 95% CI 1.9-61.7) and a history of bleeding events (HR 10.4, 95% CI 2.5-42.5) were independent predictors of major bleeds during follow-up. Conclusion Acute VTE patients with a HAS-BLED score ≥ 3 points are at increased risk of major bleeding. These results warrant for correction of the potentially reversible risk factors for major bleeding and careful International Normalized Ratio monitoring in acute VTE patients with a high HAS-BLED score."
https://openalex.org/W2076575215,"l-Serine is required to synthesize membrane lipids such as phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. Nevertheless, it remains largely unknown how a diminished capacity to synthesize l-serine affects lipid homeostasis in cells and tissues. Here, we show that deprivation of external l-serine leads to the generation of 1-deoxysphingolipids (doxSLs), including 1-deoxysphinganine, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (KO-MEFs) lacking d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh), which catalyzes the first step in the de novo synthesis of l-serine. A novel mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach demonstrated that 1-deoxydihydroceramide was the most abundant species of doxSLs accumulated in l-serine-deprived KO-MEFs. Among normal sphingolipid species in KO-MEFs, levels of sphinganine, dihydroceramide, ceramide, and hexosylceramide were significantly reduced after deprivation of external l-serine, whereas those of sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate were retained. The synthesis of doxSLs was suppressed by supplementing the culture medium with l-serine but was potentiated by increasing the ratio of l-alanine to l-serine in the medium. Unlike with l-serine, depriving cells of external l-leucine did not promote the occurrence of doxSLs. Consistent with results obtained from KO-MEFs, brain-specific deletion of Phgdh in mice also resulted in accumulation of doxSLs in the brain. Furthermore, l-serine-deprived KO-MEFs exhibited increased formation of cytosolic lipid bodies containing doxSLs and other sphingolipids. These in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that doxSLs are generated in the presence of a high ratio of l-alanine to l-serine in cells and tissues lacking Phgdh, and de novo synthesis of l-serine is necessary to maintain normal sphingolipid homeostasis when the external supply of this amino acid is limited.Background: l-Serine deficiency affects sphingolipid homeostasis.Results: Reduced l-serine promotes the accumulation of 1-deoxysphingolipids and the formation of lipid bodies.Conclusion: Diminished capacity for l-serine synthesis leads to a higher l-alanine to l-serine ratio and elicits the synthesis of 1-deoxysphingolipids and lipid body formation.Significance: 1-Deoxysphingolipids occur in certain disease conditions characterized by a metabolic imbalance between l-alanine and l-serine. l-Serine is required to synthesize membrane lipids such as phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids.

Despite a growing scientific literature focused on lipid production by Y. lipolytica, there remain significant knowledge gaps regarding the key biological processes involved. We applied a combination of metabolomic and lipidomic profiling approaches as well as microscopic techniques to identify and characterize the key pathways involved in de novo lipid accumulation from glucose in batch cultured, wild-type Y. lipolytica. We found that lipids accumulated rapidly and peaked at 48 hours during the five day experiment, concurrent with a shift in amino acid metabolism. We also report that exhaustion of extracellular sugars coincided with thickening of the cell wall, suggesting that genes involved in cell wall biogenesis may be a useful target for improving the efficiency of lipid producing yeast strains."

These small contractile cells produce large quantities of apolipoprotein E (apoE) whose isoforms influence cerebrovascular functions and determine the genetic risk for Alzheimer disease. Despite extensive studies on astrocyte-secreted apoE, which supports synapses by transporting cholesterol to neurons, the biochemical properties and function of apoE secreted by pericytes are not clear. Because pericytes mediate important functions in the CNS, including the initiation of glial scar formation, angiogenesis, and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, we investigated the potential role of apoE in pericyte mobility. We found that knockdown of apoE expression significantly accelerates pericyte migration, an effect that can be rescued by exogenous apoE3, but not apoE4, a risk factor for Alzheimer disease. ApoE-regulated migration of pericytes also requires the function of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a major apoE receptor in the brain that is abundantly expressed in pericytes. Because apoE-knockdown also leads to enhanced cell adhesion, we investigated the role of apoE in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, we found that the levels of active RhoA are increased significantly in apoE knockdown pericytes and that RhoA inhibitors blocked pericyte migration. Taken together, our results suggest that apoE has an intrinsic role in pericyte mobility, which is vital in maintaining cerebrovascular function.

The method depended on a laborious concentration step. We have now developed an easy to perform test based on a magnetic immunoassay platform, utilizing high avidity monoclonal antibodies for the detection of LAM in urine. With this method the analytical sensitivity of the assay was increased 50-100-fold compared to conventional ELISA. In a pilot study of HIV-negative patients with microbiologically verified TB (n=17) and healthy controls (n=22) the sensitivity of the test was 82% and the specificity 100%. This is in stark positive contrast to a range of studies using available commercial tests with polyclonal anti-LAM Abs where the sensitivity of the tests in HIV-negative TB patients was very low."
https://openalex.org/W2022261443,"Homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are two major DNA double-strand-break repair pathways. While HR-mediated repair requires a homologous sequence as the guiding template to restore the damage site precisely, NHEJ-mediated repair ligates the DNA lesion directly and increases the risk of losing nucleotides. Therefore, how a cell regulates the balance between HR and NHEJ has become an important issue for maintaining genomic integrity over time. Here we report that SIRT1-dependent KAP1 deacetylation positively regulates NHEJ. We show that up-regulation of KAP1 attenuates HR efficiency while promoting NHEJ repair. Moreover, SIRT1-mediated KAP1 deacetylation further enhances the effect of NHEJ by stabilizing its interaction with 53BP1, which leads to increased 53BP1 focus formation in response to DNA damage. Taken together, our study suggests a SIRT1-KAP1 regulatory mechanism for HR-NHEJ repair pathway choice."
https://openalex.org/W2069114689,"Modulation of KRAS activity by upstream signals has revealed a promising new approach for pancreatic cancer therapy; however, it is not clear whether microRNA-associated KRAS axis is involved in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Here, we identified miR-193b as a tumor-suppressive miRNA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Expression analyses revealed that miR-193b was downregulated in (10/11) PDAC specimens and cell lines. Moreover, we found that miR-193b functioned as a cell-cycle brake in PDAC cells by inducing G1-phase arrest and reducing the fraction of cells in S phase, thereby leading to dampened cell proliferation. miR-193b also modulated the malignant transformation phenotype of PDAC cells by suppressing anchorage-independent growth. Mechanistically, KRAS was verified as a direct effector of miR-193b, through which the AKT and ERK pathways were modulated and cell growth of PDAC cells was suppressed. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-193b-mediated deregulation of the KRAS axis is involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis, and suggest that miR-193b could be a potentially effective target for PDAC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2050487884,"Smooth muscle in the pulmonary artery of PAH subjects, both idiopathic and hereditary, is characterized by hyperplasia. Smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from subjects with or without PAH retain their in vivo phenotype as illustrated by their expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and expression of H-caldesmon. Both non PAH and PAH HPASMC display a lengthy, approximately 94h, cell cycle. The HPASMC from both idiopathic and hereditary PAH display an abnormal proliferation characterized by continued growth under non-proliferative, non-growth stimulated conditions. This effector independent proliferation is JNK and p38 MAP kinase dependent. Blocking the activation of either abrogates the HPASMC growth. HPASMC from non PAH donors under quiescent conditions display negligible proliferation but divide upon exposure to growth factors such as PDGF-BB or FGF2 but not EGF. This growth does not involve the MAP kinases. Instead it routes via the tyrosine kinase receptor through mTOR and then 6SK. In the PAH cells PDGF-BB and FGF2 augment the dysregulated cell proliferation, also through mTOR/6SK. Additionally, blocking the activation of mTOR also modulates the MAP kinase promoted dysregulated growth. These results highlight key alterations in the growth of HPASMC from subjects with PAH which contribute to the etiology of the disease and can clearly be targeted at various regulatory points for future therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2090273555,"Understanding how an animal utilises its surroundings requires its movements through space to be described accurately. Satellite telemetry is the only means of acquiring movement data for many species however data are prone to varying amounts of spatial error; the recent application of state-space models (SSMs) to the location estimation problem have provided a means to incorporate spatial errors when characterising animal movements. The predominant platform for collecting satellite telemetry data on free-ranging animals, Service Argos, recently provided an alternative Doppler location estimation algorithm that is purported to be more accurate and generate a greater number of locations that its predecessor. We provide a comprehensive assessment of this new estimation process performance on data from free-ranging animals relative to concurrently collected Fastloc GPS data. Additionally, we test the efficacy of three readily-available SSM in predicting the movement of two focal animals. Raw Argos location estimates generated by the new algorithm were greatly improved compared to the old system. Approximately twice as many Argos locations were derived compared to GPS on the devices used. Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) for each optimal SSM were less than 4.25km with some producing RMSE of less than 2.50km. Differences in the biological plausibility of the tracks between the two focal animals used to investigate the utility of SSM highlights the importance of considering animal behaviour in movement studies. The ability to reprocess Argos data collected since 2008 with the new algorithm should permit questions of animal movement to be revisited at a finer resolution."

https://openalex.org/W2011782794,"ZNF804A (Zinc Finger Protein 804A) has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and bipolar disorder (BD) in replicated genome wide association studies (GWAS) and by copy number variation (CNV) analysis. Although its function has not been well-characterized, ZNF804A contains a C2H2-type zinc-finger domain, suggesting that it has DNA binding properties, and consequently, a role in regulating gene expression. To further explore the role of ZNF804A on gene expression and its downstream targets, we used a gene knockdown (KD) approach to reduce its expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). KD was accomplished by RNA interference (RNAi) using lentiviral particles containing shRNAs that target ZNF804A mRNA. Stable transduced NPC lines were generated after puromycin selection. A control cell line expressing a random (scrambled) shRNA was also generated. Neuronal differentiation was induced, RNA was harvested after 14 days and transcriptome analysis was carried out using RNA-seq. 1815 genes were found to be differentially expressed at a nominally significant level (p<0.05); 809 decreased in expression in the KD samples, while 1106 increased. Of these, 370 achieved genome wide significance (FDR<0.05); 125 were lower in the KD samples, 245 were higher. Pathway analysis showed that genes involved in interferon-signaling were enriched among those that were down-regulated in the KD samples. Correspondingly, ZNF804A KD was found to affect interferon-alpha 2 (IFNA2)-mediated gene expression. The findings suggest that ZNF804A may affect a differentiating neuron’s response to inflammatory cytokines, which is consistent with models of SZ and ASD that support a role for infectious disease, and/or autoimmunity in a subgroup of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2075140738,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes and are in clinical trials for disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is expressed in many peripheral and neuronal tissues and is activated by circulating GLP-1. Other than food intake, little is known about factors regulating GLP-1 secretion. Given a normally basal circulating level of GLP-1, knowledge of mechanisms regulating GLP-1R signaling, which has diverse functions in extrapancreatic tissues, remains elusive. In this study, we found that the potency of GLP-1, not exendin 4, is specifically enhanced by the endocannabinoid-like lipids oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and 2-oleoylglycerol but not by stearoylethanolamide (SEA) or palmitoylethanolamide. 9.2 μm OEA enhances the potency of GLP-1 in stimulating cAMP production by 10-fold but does not affect its receptor binding affinity.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes and are in clinical trials for disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is expressed in many peripheral and neuronal tissues and is activated by circulating GLP-1. Other than food intake, little is known about factors regulating GLP-1 secretion. Given a normally basal circulating level of GLP-1, knowledge of mechanisms regulating GLP-1R signaling, which has diverse functions in extrapancreatic tissues, remains elusive. In this study, we found that the potency of GLP-1, not exendin 4, is specifically enhanced by the endocannabinoid-like lipids oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and 2-oleoylglycerol but not by stearoylethanolamide (SEA) or palmitoylethanolamide. 9.2 μm OEA enhances the potency of GLP-1 in stimulating cAMP production by 10-fold but does not affect its receptor binding affinity.

https://openalex.org/W2070026086,"The level of drebrin, an evolutionarily conserved f-actin-binding protein that regulates synaptic structure and function, is reduced in the brains of patients with chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down’s syndrome (DS). It was suggested that excitotoxic neuronal death caused by overactivation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) occurs in AD and DS; however, the relationship between excitotoxicity and drebrin loss is unknown. Here, we show that drebrin is a novel target of calpain-mediated proteolysis under excitotoxic conditions induced by the overactivation of NMDARs. In cultured rodent neurons, degradation of drebrin was confirmed by the detection of proteolytic fragments, as well as a reduction in the amount of full-length drebrin. Notably, the NMDA-induced degradation of drebrin in mature neurons occurred concomitantly with a loss of f-actin. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of f-actin loss facilitated the drebrin degradation, suggesting a functional linkage between f-actin and drebrin degradation. Biochemical analyses using purified drebrin and calpain revealed that calpain degraded drebrin directly in vitro. Furthermore, cerebral ischemia also induced the degradation of drebrin in vivo. These findings suggest that calpain-mediated degradation of drebrin is a fundamental pathology of neurodegenerative diseases mediated by excitotoxicity, regardless of whether they are acute or chronic. Drebrin regulates the synaptic clustering of NMDARs; therefore, degradation of drebrin under excitotoxic conditions may modulate NMDAR-mediated signal transductions, including pro-survival signaling. Overall, the results presented here provide novel insights into the molecular basis of cellular responses to excitotoxicity in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2081398430,"Lysine residues are implicated in driving the ligand binding to the LDL receptor family. However, it has remained unclear how specificity is regulated. Using coagulation factor VIII as a model ligand, we now study the contribution of individual lysine residues in the interaction with the largest member of the LDL receptor family, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1). Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and SPR interaction analysis on a library of lysine replacement variants as two independent approaches, we demonstrate that the interaction between factor VIII (FVIII) and LRP1 occurs over an extended surface containing multiple lysine residues. None of the individual lysine residues account completely for LRP1 binding, suggesting an additive binding model. Together with structural docking studies, our data suggest that FVIII interacts with LRP1 via an extended surface of multiple lysine residues that starts at the bottom of the C1 domain and winds around the FVIII molecule."

They have the novel property of showing marked facilitation to repeated applications of agonist, and the intrinsic channel pore dilates to allow the passage of fluorescent dyes. A 60-s application of ATP to hP2X7 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes gave rise to a current that had a biphasic time course with initial and secondary slowly developing components. A second application of ATP evoked a response with a more rapid time to peak. This facilitation was reversed to initial levels following a 10-min agonist-free interval. A chimeric approach showed that replacement of the pre-TM1 amino-terminal region with the corresponding P2X2 receptor section (P2X7–2Nβ) gave responses that quickly reached a steady state and did not show facilitation.

https://openalex.org/W1978671525,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with reduced growth hormone levels and signaling. Such hormonal changes also occur in metabolic acidosis. Since mild metabolic acidosis can be diet induced, diet-induced acid load may constitute a nutritional factor with possible influence on NAFLD development. This study explored whether a higher diet-induced acid load is associated with an increased likelihood of NAFLD. Apparently healthy Chinese adults (330 male, 463 female) aged 19-72 years were recruited through population screening between 2008 and 2010 in a cross-sectional population-based study in Hong Kong. Estimated net endogenous acid production (NEAP) was calculated using Frassetto’s method and potential renal acid load (PRAL) was calculated using Remer’s method based on dietary data from a food frequency questionnaire. NAFLD was defined as intrahepatic triglyceride content at >5% by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Possible advanced fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness at >7.9 kPa by transient elastography. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between each measure of dietary acid load and prevalent NAFLD or possible advanced fibrosis with adjustment for potential anthropometric and lifestyle factors. 220 subjects (27.7%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. Estimated NEAP was positively associated with the likelihood of having NAFLD after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, current drinker status and the presence of metabolic syndrome [OR (95% CI) = 1.25 (1.02-1.52), p = 0.022]. The association was slightly attenuated but remained significant when the model was further adjusted for other dietary variables. No association between PRAL and NAFLD prevalence was observed. Both estimated NEAP and PRAL were not associated with the presence of possible advance fibrosis. Our findings suggest that there may be a modest association between diet-induced acid load and NAFLD. More studies are needed to ascertain the link between diet-induced acid load and NAFLD and to investigate the underlying mechanisms."

A comprehensive knowledge of the insect olfactory system is essential for the development of efficient semiochemical-based control methods. The olfactory sensilla are located particularly on the antennae, and these can detect plant volatiles that provide important cues for the insects in the search for their host plants. To date, the fine structure of P. archon antennal sensilla studies and their role in host-plant perception have not been investigated in great detail. Using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the antennae of both sexes of P. archon are described here in detail, according to the different types, quantities and distributions of the sensilla. Six types of sensilla were identified. The most widespread are sensilla trichoidea, sensilla basiconica and sensilla auricilica, which are associated with olfactory function. These have cuticular shafts characterised by numerous pores, and they are innervated by two or three sensory neurons. Sensilla coeloconica, sensilla chaetica and sensilla ampullacea are associated with olfactory or olfactory-thermoreception, mechano-gustatory, and thermo-hygroreception functions, respectively. Moreover, the role of P. archon antennae in locating of the host palms was evaluated using electroantennograms, to monitor responses to ester and terpene compounds previously identified as volatiles of damaged/fermenting palm tissues. P. archon showed responses to all of the synthetic chemicals tested, with greater responses in the females, providing a significant sex*dose effect. Among the compounds tested, ethyl isobutyrate elicited the strongest antenna responses. The fine structure of the cuticular and cellular components of the P. archon antenna sensory equipment is described for the first time. The results of this study form an important starting point and complement physiological and behavioural studies, to provide valuable information of practical importance for the development of efficient semiochemical-based control methods."
https://openalex.org/W2081623685,"Background Reduced neutrophil apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is involved in neutrophil apoptosis. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25VitD3) can induce tumor cell apoptosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 1α,25VitD3 on peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis in AECOPD and examine the role of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Methods The study enrolled 36 AECOPD patients and 36 healthy volunteers. Venous blood samples were obtained from both groups. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D) levels in peripheral venous blood were assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); the neutrophils were separated and cultured with SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) and 1α,25VitD3. Neutrophil apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry, and phospho-p38 MAPK protein expression was detected by Western blot. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used for the between-group differences and correlation analysis, respectively. Results The 25-(OH) D levels were lower in AECOPD patients than in healthy controls, and the peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis results were similar. 1α,25VitD3 increased the apoptosis rate and the level of phospho-p38 MAPK in peripheral blood neutrophils of AECOPD patients. SB203580 partly inhibited 1α,25VitD3-induced peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis and phospho-p38 MAPK overexpression. The 25-(OH) D levels were positively correlated with increased peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis and phospho-p38 MAPK levels. In addition, expression of the phospho-p38 MAPK protein was also positively correlated with peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis. Conclusion Our results suggest that 1α,25VitD3 induces peripheral blood neutrophil apoptosis through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in AECOPD patients."

S6K can also undergo phosphorylation at as many as seven other Ser/Thr sites, including four serine residues in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain was originally proposed to open up the S6K conformation, allowing phosphorylation by mTOR and subsequent S6K activation (9.Dennis P.B. Pullen N.

Alternatively, cortical neurons (14 DIV) were treated with roscovitine (25 μm) or rapamycin (87 pm) for 6 h. To examine S6K phosphorylation, FLAG-S6K construct (4 μg) was cotransfected with Cdk5 and p35 plasmids (1 μg each) into HEK-293T cells by Lipofectamine Plus. After 24 h, cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus various protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and lysate was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant proteins, the immunoprecipitated FLAG-S6K was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant Cdk5 and p35 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 30 °C. To extract proteins from Cdk5 knock-out brains, tissues were homogenized in PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After adding equal volume of 2× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, homogenate was incubated at 4 °C for 45 min and centrifuged for 16,000 × g for 10 min. For biochemical studies of cortical neurons, cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus various protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Signal intensity of the corresponding bands in Western blots was quantified using Photoshop software. The intensity of phospho-S6K and phospho-S6 was normalized with total S6K and total S6, respectively. To examine the subcellular localization of Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K, hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 15 min. Neurons were incubated with blocking solution (Dulbecco's PBS plus 0.4% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA) for 1 h and with phospho-Ser-411 S6K antibody (1:50), total S6K antibody (1:200), or MAP2 antibody (1:1000) in blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with washing buffer (0.02% Triton X-100 and 0.25% BSA in Dulbecco's PBS), neurons were incubated with the corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted in 0.02% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. To examine dendritic spines of transfected neurons, cells were incubated with anti-GFP antibody (1:2000) diluted in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl) at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with washing buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer and 0.5 m NaCl), neurons were incubated with the corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted in GDB buffer) at room temperature for 1 h. Images were acquired by a Nikon A1 or Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 40×, 60× (Nikon), or 63× (Leica) oil immersion objectives. Eight to 12 serial individual optical sections were collected (z interval of 0.4 μm). Dendritic spines were quantified by Metamorph software: three isolated dendritic segments (60–70 μm long) that were about 20 μm away from the cell body were analyzed for each neuron, and the head and neck widths of individual dendritic protrusion were measured. The protrusion was defined as a mature dendritic spine if the head width to neck width ratio was greater than 1.5. The quantification of spine density described in FIGURE 6., FIGURE 7. was performed in blinded fashion.FIGURE 7.Phosphorylation of S6K at Ser-411 is required for spine morphogenesis. A, 293T cells were transfected with vector, FLAG-tagged WT S6K or phospho-deficient S411A mutant, and cells were stained by anti-FLAG antibody. Both wild type and S411A mutant were expressed similarly. B, transfecting hippocampal neurons with GFP and S6K-shRNA significantly reduced S6K staining intensity (red) in the GFP-positive neurons, and the S6K staining was reversed by coexpression of either WT or phospho-deficient S411A mutant of S6K (seven to nine neurons were analyzed for each condition; *, p < 0.05; n.s., not significant; one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's multiple comparison test; error bars represent S.E.).

The pipettes used typically had a resistance of 3–5 megaohms when filled with an internal solution consisting of 130 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 0.4 mm Tris GTP, and pH was adjusted to 7.3. The cells were continuously superfused with an external solution of the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11 mm glucose, and 26 mm NaHCO3 at a flow rate of 1.5–2 ml/min. The external solution was bubbled with carbogen and maintained at 34 ± 1 °C. Tetrodotoxin (1 μm) and bicuculline (10 μm) were included to block action potentials and GABA transmission, respectively. Once a whole cell recording was achieved, the cell was held at −70 mV to record the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), filtered at 3 kHz, for 5–15 min. The mEPSCs were analyzed by the commercial software MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Statistical significance of experiments involving two experimental conditions was assessed by Student's t test, whereas that of experiments involving three or more experimental conditions was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's or Bonferroni's post hoc test. All experiments were performed at least three times except those specifically indicated. The BDNF-induced mTOR pathway has been implicated in spine development and maturation (19.Schratt G.M. Tuebing F. Nigh E.A. Kane C.G. Sabatini M.E. Kiebler M. Greenberg M.E. A brain-specific microRNA regulates dendritic spine development.Nature. 2006; 439: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Given that Cdk5 activity is increased by BDNF (20.Cheung Z.H. Chin W.H. Chen Y. Ng Y.P. Ip N.Y. Cdk5 is involved in BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we asked whether Cdk5 might regulate substrates in the mTOR pathway. Toward this end, we focused on S6K, which is one of the major signaling proteins downstream of mTOR. S6K can be phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk5 at Ser-411 within the C-terminal autoinhibitory loop (12.Hou Z. He L. Qi R.Z. Regulation of S6 kinase 1 activation by phosphorylation at Ser-411.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6922-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that specifically recognized S6K phosphorylation at Ser-411, as indicated by the complete elimination of signal when Ser-411 was substituted by Ala (S411A), we confirmed that coexpression of Cdk5 and p35 in 293T cells increased phosphorylation of S6K at Ser-411 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Moreover, incubation of S6K with recombinant Cdk5 and p35 proteins also increased Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Kinases other than Cdk5, including Cdc2 and MAPK, can induce Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K (10.Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. An array of insulin-activated, proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate the p70 S6 kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Shah O.J. Ghosh S. Hunter T. Mitotic regulation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 involves Ser/Thr, Pro phosphorylation of consensus and non-consensus sites by Cdc2.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). mTOR also phosphorylates Ser/Thr sites (Ser-424/Thr-421) in the autoinhibitory domain of S6K in vitro (21.Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Immunopurified mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylates and activates p70 S6 kinase α in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine whether Cdk5 is the major kinase that phosphorylates S6K at Ser-411 in neuron. Incubation of cortical neurons with the Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine significantly reduced Ser-411 phosphorylation. In contrast, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin caused complete elimination of Thr-389 phosphorylation without affecting Ser-411 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To confirm the importance of Cdk5 in phosphorylating Ser-411 of S6K in the brain, Western blotting with antibody against phospho-Ser-411 was performed on brain homogenate derived from wild type or Cdk5-null mice. Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K was drastically reduced in the absence of Cdk5. The loss of Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K was accompanied with reduced phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, another S6K substrate, eEF2K, was unaffected in Cdk5 knock-out brain as phosphorylation of eEF2K and its downstream target elongation factor eEF2 was similar between wild type and Cdk5 knock-out brains (Fig. 2, A and B). To verify the role of Cdk5 in mediating Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K in neurons rather than glial cells, primary hippocampal neurons were cultured from wild type and Cdk5 knock-out mice. Phospho-Ser-411 immunoreactivity was detected not only in the neuronal cell soma but also in dendrites, and the dendritic phospho-S6K immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in Cdk5−/− neurons (Fig. 2C). These findings together indicate that Cdk5 is the major kinase that phosphorylates S6K at Ser-411 in neuronal dendrites and the brain. If Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K by Cdk5 is an important signaling event in neurons, we reasoned that a constitutively active S6K should, at least in part, rescue some of the phenotypes in neurons lacking Cdk5. Toward this end, we made a constitutively active S6K construct by deleting the C-terminal inhibitory domain and substituting the Thr-389 with the phosphomimetic Glu as indicated by previous study (22.Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Identification of a conserved motif required for mTOR signaling.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies reporting a role of Cdk5 in dendrite development, we found that knockdown of Cdk5 in hippocampal neurons led to impaired dendritic growth. Notably, coexpression of the constitutively active but not wild type S6K could partially rescue the dendritic defects in Cdk5-depleted neurons (Fig. 3). S6K therefore acts downstream of Cdk5 in neurons to control dendrite development. Most studies that examine the induction of S6K activity focus on Thr-389, whereas the regulation of S6K phosphorylation at other sites is not clear. We therefore examined how the Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K is regulated in neuron. One major extracellular stimulus that triggers the mTOR signaling pathway and is relevant to the regulation of synaptic function is the neurotrophin BDNF. Consistent with a previous study (23.Takei N. Inamura N. Kawamura M. Namba H. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor induces mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent local activation of translation machinery and protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9760-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), BDNF stimulation led to increased Thr-389 phosphorylation of S6K and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein. BDNF also induced phosphorylation of S6K at Ser-411 (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of Cdk5 by roscovitine significantly attenuated the induction of Ser-411, but not Thr-389, phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 4, A and B). Despite the normal induction of Thr-389 phosphorylation, the BDNF-induced S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation was significantly reduced by roscovitine (Fig. 4, A and B). These findings suggest that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-411 is crucial for S6K activation by BDNF; however, the induced Ser-411 phosphorylation does not prime the subsequent induction of Thr-389 phosphorylation. The synthesis of BDNF is regulated by neuronal activity (2.Verpelli C. Piccoli G. Zibetti C. Zanchi A. Gardoni F. Huang K. Brambilla D. Di Luca M. Battaglioli E. Sala C. Synaptic activity controls dendritic spine morphology by modulating eEF2-dependent BDNF synthesis.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given that Ser-411 phosphorylation was induced by BDNF, we asked whether the S6K phosphorylation also depends on neuronal activity. Indeed, blockade of spontaneous neuronal activity by TTX significantly reduced S6K phosphorylation at Ser-411 (Fig. 4C) as well as S6 phosphorylation (data not shown). This raises the possibility that the Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K might be involved in mediating neuronal responses to synaptic activity. Either BDNF or spontaneous neuronal activity promotes spine morphogenesis (1.Papa M. Segal M. Morphological plasticity in dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuroscience. 1996; 71: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2.Verpelli C. Piccoli G. Zibetti C.

In order to identify the key stand variables that influence the tree height-dbh relationship and to develop and validate a suit of models for predicting tree height, data from 5961 tree samples aged from 6 years to 53 years and collected from 80 Chinese-fir plantation plots were used to fit 39 models, including 33 nonlinear models and 6 linear models, were developed and evaluated into two groups. The results showed that composite models performed better in height estimate than one-independent-variable models. Nonlinear composite Model 34 and linear composite Model 6 were recommended for predicting tree height in Chinese fir plantations with a dbh range between 4 cm and 40 cm when the dbh data for each tree and the quadratic mean dbh of the stand (Dq) and mean height of the stand (Hm) were available. Moreover, Hm could be estimated by using the formula Hm = 11.707 × l n(Dq)-18.032. Clearly, Dq was the primary stand variable that influenced the height-dbh relationship. The parameters of the models varied according to stand age and site. The inappropriate application of provincial or regional height-dbh models for predicting small tree height at local scale may result in larger uncertainties. The method and the recommended models developed in this study were statistically reliable for applications in growth and yield estimation for even-aged Chinese-fir plantation in Huitong and Changsha. The models could be extended to other regions and to other tree species only after verification in subtropical China."

https://openalex.org/W2030100853,"We recently developed a longer lasting recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein, rFVIIIFc, to extend the half-life of replacement FVIII for the treatment of people with hemophilia A. In order to elucidate the biological mechanism for the elongated half-life of rFVIIIFc at a cellular level we delineated the roles of VWF and the tissue-specific expression of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the biodistribution, clearance and cycling of rFVIIIFc. We find the tissue biodistribution is similar for rFVIIIFc and rFVIII and that liver is the major clearance organ for both molecules. VWF reduces the clearance and the initial liver uptake of rFVIIIFc. Pharmacokinetic studies in FcRn chimeric mice show that FcRn expressed in somatic cells (hepatocytes or liver sinusoidal endothelial cells) mediates the decreased clearance of rFVIIIFc, but FcRn in hematopoietic cells (Kupffer cells) does not affect clearance. Immunohistochemical studies show that when rFVIII or rFVIIIFc is in dynamic equilibrium binding with VWF, they mostly co localize with VWF in Kupffer cells and macrophages, confirming a major role for liver macrophages in the internalization and clearance of the VWF-FVIII complex. In the absence of VWF a clear difference in cellular localization of VWF-free rFVIII and rFVIIIFc is observed and neither molecule is detected in Kupffer cells. Instead, rFVIII is observed in hepatocytes, indicating that free rFVIII is cleared by hepatocytes, while rFVIIIFc is observed as a diffuse liver sinusoidal staining, suggesting recycling of free-rFVIIIFc out of hepatocytes. These studies reveal two parallel linked clearance pathways, with a dominant pathway in which both rFVIIIFc and rFVIII complexed with VWF are cleared mainly by Kupffer cells without FcRn cycling. In contrast, the free fraction of rFVIII or rFVIIIFc unbound by VWF enters hepatocytes, where FcRn reduces the degradation and clearance of rFVIIIFc relative to rFVIII by cycling rFVIIIFc back to the liver sinusoid and into circulation, enabling the elongated half-life of rFVIIIFc."

The successful transition to flowering not only ensures the completion of plant life cycles, it also serves as the basis for the production of economically important seeds and fruits. CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are two genes playing critical roles in flowering time control in Arabidopsis. Through homology-based cloning and rapid-amplifications of cDNA ends (RACE), we obtained full-lengths cDNA sequences of Prunus persica CO (PpCO) and Prunus persica FT (PpFT) from peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) and investigated their functions in flowering time regulation. PpCO and PpFT showed high homologies to Arabidopsis CO and FT at DNA, mRNA and protein levels. We showed that PpCO and PpFT were nucleus-localized and both showed transcriptional activation activities in yeast cells, consistent with their potential roles as transcription activators. Moreover, we established that the over-expression of PpCO could restore the late flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis co-2 mutant, and the late flowering defect of the Arabidopsis ft-1 mutant can be rescued by the over-expression of PpFT, suggesting functional conservations of CO and FT genes in peach and Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that PpCO and PpFT are homologous genes of CO and FT in peach and they may function in regulating plant flowering time."

The relationship between ROS1 or RET rearrangements, clinicopathological features, and prognostic factors were analyzed in resected stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC. Of the 204 cases, 4 cases were confirmed with ROS1 rearrangement, but no RET rearrangement was detected. All 4 ROS1-rearranged cases were adenocarcinomas. The predominant pathological type was acinar pattern in ROS1-rearranged tumors, except for 1 case harboring a mixture acinar and mucous tumor cells. Variants of ROS1 rearrangement were SDC4-ROS1 (E2:E32), SDC4-ROS1 (E4:E32) and SDC4-ROS1 (E4:E34). There was no significant association between ROS1 rearrangement and clinicopathological characteristics. In this cohort, multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) indicated that squamous cell carcinoma and lobectomy were independent predictors of poor prognosis; R0 surgical resection and non-pleural invasion were independent predictors of good prognosis. In resected stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC patients, ROS1-rearranged cases tended to occur in younger patients with adenocarcinomas. The prognosis of resected stage IIIA-N2 is generally considered poor, but patients with ROS1 rearrangement will benefit from the targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2011493412,"Studies of partial migrants provide an opportunity to assess the cost and benefits of migration. Previous work has demonstrated that sedentary American dippers (residents) have higher annual productivity than altitudinal migrants that move to higher elevations to breed. Here we use a ten-year (30 period) mark-recapture dataset to evaluate whether migrants offset their lower productivity with higher survival during the migration-breeding period when they occupy different habitat, or early and late-winter periods when they coexist with residents. Mark-recapture models provide no evidence that apparent monthly survival of migrants is higher than that of residents at any time of the year. The best-supported model suggests that monthly survival is higher in the migration-breeding period than winter periods. Another well-supported model suggested that residency conferred a survival benefit, and annual apparent survival (calculated from model weighted monthly apparent survival estimates using the Delta method) of residents (0.511 ± 0.038SE) was slightly higher than that of migrants (0.487 ± 0.032). Winter survival of American dippers was influenced by environmental conditions; monthly apparent survival increased as maximum daily flow rates increased and declined as winter temperatures became colder. However, we found no evidence that environmental conditions altered differences in winter survival of residents and migrants. Since migratory American dippers have lower productivity and slightly lower survival than residents our data suggests that partial migration is likely an outcome of competition for limited nest sites at low elevations, with less competitive individuals being forced to migrate to higher elevations in order to breed."

Using a combined approach of x-ray crystallography, solution scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy we determined that full-length Olfm1 forms disulfide-linked tetramers with a distinctive V-shaped architecture. The base of the “V” is formed by two disulfide-linked dimeric N-terminal domains. Each of the two V legs consists of a parallel dimeric disulfide-linked coiled coil with a C-terminal β-propeller dimer at the tips. This agrees with our crystal structure of a C-terminal coiled-coil segment and β-propeller combination (Olfm1coil-Olf) that reveals a disulfide-linked dimeric arrangement with the β-propeller top faces in an outward exposed orientation. Similar to its family member myocilin, Olfm1 is stabilized by calcium. The dimer-of-dimers architecture suggests a role for Olfm1 in clustering receptors to regulate signaling and sheds light on the conformation of several other olfactomedin domain family members.

https://openalex.org/W2015324378,"Risk stratification of patients with systolic chronic heart failure (HF) is critical to better identify those who may benefit from invasive therapeutic strategies such as cardiac transplantation. Proteomics has been used to provide prognostic information in various diseases. Our aim was to investigate the potential value of plasma proteomic profiling for risk stratification in HF. A proteomic profiling using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization - time of flight - mass spectrometry was performed in a case/control discovery population of 198 patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction <45%): 99 patients who died from cardiovascular cause within 3 years and 99 patients alive at 3 years. Proteomic scores predicting cardiovascular death were developed using 3 regression methods: support vector machine, sparse partial least square discriminant analysis, and lasso logistic regression. Forty two ion m/z peaks were differentially intense between cases and controls in the discovery population and were used to develop proteomic scores. In the validation population, score levels were higher in patients who subsequently died within 3 years. Similar areas under the curves (0.66 – 0.68) were observed for the 3 methods. After adjustment on confounders, proteomic scores remained significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Use of the proteomic scores allowed a significant improvement in discrimination of HF patients as determined by integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement indexes. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of plasma proteins may help to improve risk prediction in HF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2047158194,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a soluble protein that directs membrane-bound receptors to lysosomes for degradation. In the most studied example of this, PCSK9 binding leads to the degradation of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), significantly affecting circulating LDL-C levels. The mechanism mediating this degradation, however, is not completely understood. We show here that LDLR facilitates PCSK9 interactions with amyloid precursor like protein 2 (APLP2) at neutral pH leading to PCSK9 internalization, although direct binding between PCSK9 and LDLR is not required. Moreover, binding to APLP2 or LDLR is independently sufficient for PCSK9 endocytosis in hepatocytes, while LDL can compete with APLP2 for PCSK9 binding to indirectly mediate PCSK9 endocytosis. Finally, we show that APLP2 and LDLR are also required for the degradation of another PCSK9 target, APOER2, necessitating a general role for LDLR and APLP2 in PCSK9 function. Together, these findings provide evidence that PCSK9 has at least two endocytic epitopes that are utilized by a variety of internalization mechanisms and clarifies how PCSK9 may direct proteins to lysosomes."

However, the effect and the anti-asthmatic mechanism of thalidomide in the pathogenesis of asthmatic airways are not fully understood.This study is designed to determine the effect and the potential mechanism of thalidomide in the pathogenesis of asthmatic airways using animal model of allergic asthma.Six-week-old female BALB/C mice were sensitized with alum plus ovalbumin (OVA) and were exposed to OVA via intranasal route for 3 days for challenge. Thalidomide 200 mg/kg was given via gavage twice a day from a day before the challenge and airway hyperresponsivenss (AHR), airway inflammatory cells, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were evaluated. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators were evaluated using ELISA, real time (RT)-qPCR, and flow cytometry. CRL-2456, alveolar macrophage cell line, was used to test the direct effect of thalidomide on the activation of macrophages in vitro.The mice with thalidomide treatment showed significantly reduced levels of allergen-induced BALF and lung inflammation, AHR, and the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators including Th2 related, IL-17 cytokines, and altered levels of allergen-specific IgG1/IgG2a. Of interesting note, thalidomide treatment significantly reduced expression levels of allergen- or Th2 cytokine-stimulated alternative activation of macrophages in vivo and in vitro.These studies highlight a potential use of thalidomide in the treatment of allergic diseases including asthma. This study further identified a novel inhibitory effect of thalidomide on alternative activation of macrophages as a potential mechanism of anti-asthmatic effect of thalidomide."

Here we dissect the ordered assembly of the RAG1/2 heterotetramer with 12RSS and 23RSS DNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2155133470,"Predation strategies in response to altering prey abundances can dramatically influence the demographic effects of predation. Despite this, predation strategies of humans are rarely incorporated into quantitative assessments of the demographic impacts of humans killing carnivores. This scarcity largely seems to be caused by a lack of data. In this study, we contrasted predation strategies exhibited by people involved in retaliatory killing and recreational sport hunting of leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg District Municipality, South Africa. We predicted a specialist predation strategy exemplified by a type II functional response for retaliatory killing, and a generalist strategy exemplified by a type III functional response for recreational sport hunting. We could not distinguish between a type I, a type II, or a type III functional response for retaliatory killing, but the most parsimonious model for recreational sport hunting corresponded to a type I functional response. Kill rates were consistently higher for retaliatory killing than for recreational sport hunting. Our results indicate that retaliatory killing of leopards may have severe demographic consequences for leopard populations, whereas the demographic consequences of recreational sport hunting likely are less dramatic."
https://openalex.org/W2162242431,"Oxidative stress enhances inflammation and reduces the effectiveness of corticosteroids, but the inflammatory signalling pathways induced by oxidants remain ill-defined. Phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10 (H3-Pser10) marks out a subset of inflammatory genes for transcription, several of which are induced in oxidant-associated inflammation. However, the influence of oxidants or of corticosteroids on this modification remains unknown. We assessed the regulation of H3-Pser10 by oxidants and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human blood monocytes and lung macrophages and the effectiveness of its abolition in controlling inflammatory gene expression in cells from asthmatic subjects compared to corticosteroids alone. Both oxidants and LPS promoted the induction of H3-Pser10 which was unaffected by corticosteroids. The induction of H3-Pser10 was mediated through p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and IκB kinase 2 (IKK-2) signalling. Consequently, inhibitors of p38α MAPK or IKK-2 used in combination with dexamethasone were more effective at controlling inflammatory gene expression from monocytes and lung macrophages from asthmatic patients than the corticosteroid alone. Therefore, reduction of H3-Pser10 by inhibition of p38α MAPK or of IKK-2 may provide greater anti-inflammatory control than corticosteroids alone in oxidant-associated inflammation such as severe asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2013739503,"Background The study focuses on the perceived nature / technique opposition in pregnancy and delivery emerging from gynaecologist/ midwife/ pregnant woman relationships. We developed a cross-sectional survey to identify, by means of a multidimensional data-driven approach, the main latent concepts structuring the between items correlation correspondent to the different general opinions present in the data set. The obtained results can set the basis to improve patient satisfaction while decreasing healthcare costs. Methods The sample is made of 90 pregnant women within 24-48 hours after natural or operative birth, from three maternity units in Italy. Women filled in a questionnaire about their relationship with gynaecologist and midwife during pregnancy and hospital stay for delivery. Results Participation rate approached 100%. The emerging factorial structure gave a proof-of-concept of the hypothesis of ‘nature vs. technique’ as the main dimension shaping women opinions. The results highlighted the role of midwife as the ‘link’ between the natural and technical dimension of birth. The quality of welcome and the establishing of an empathic relation between mother and healthcare professional was shown to decrease further request of care in the post-partum period. Conclusions The “fault plane” between nature and technique is a very critical zone for litigation. Women are particularly sensitive to the consideration and attention they receive at their admission in the hospital, as well as to the quality of human relationship with midwife. The perceived quality of welcome scaled with a decreased need of additional care and, more in general, with a more faithful attitude towards health professionals. We hypothesize that increasing the quality of welcome can exert an effect on both welfare costs and litigation. This opens the way (through an extension of this pilot study to wider populations) to relevant ameliorative actions on quality of care at practically null cost."
https://openalex.org/W2129444867,"Understanding the symbiotic relationship between gut microbes and their animal host requires characterization of the core microbiota across populations and in time. Especially in captive populations of endangered wildlife species such as the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), this knowledge is a key element to enhance feeding strategies and reduce gastrointestinal disorders. In order to investigate the temporal stability of the intestinal microbiota in cheetahs under human care, we conducted a longitudinal study over a 3-year period with bimonthly faecal sampling of 5 cheetahs housed in two European zoos. For this purpose, an integrated 16S rRNA DGGE-clone library approach was used in combination with a series of real-time PCR assays. Our findings disclosed a stable faecal microbiota, beyond intestinal community variations that were detected between zoo sample sets or between animals. The core of this microbiota was dominated by members of Clostridium clusters I, XI and XIVa, with mean concentrations ranging from 7.5-9.2 log10 CFU/g faeces and with significant positive correlations between these clusters (P<0.05), and by Lactobacillaceae. Moving window analysis of DGGE profiles revealed 23.3-25.6% change between consecutive samples for four of the cheetahs. The fifth animal in the study suffered from intermediate episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during the monitoring period and exhibited remarkably more change (39.4%). This observation may reflect the temporary impact of perturbations such as the animal’s compromised health, antibiotic administration or a combination thereof, which temporarily altered the relative proportions of Clostridium clusters I and XIVa. In conclusion, this first long-term monitoring study of the faecal microbiota in feline strict carnivores not only reveals a remarkable compositional stability of this ecosystem, but also shows a qualitative and quantitative similarity in a defined set of faecal bacterial lineages across the five animals under study that may typify the core phylogenetic microbiome of cheetahs."

https://openalex.org/W2064200906,"Background Reactors found in nature can be described as micro-heterogeneous systems, where media involved in each micro-environment can behave in a markedly different way compared with the properties of the bulk solution. The presence of water molecules in micro-organized assemblies is of paramount importance for many chemical processes, ranging from biology to environmental science. Self-organized molecular assembled systems are frequently used to study dynamics of water molecules because are the simplest models mimicking biological membranes. The hydrogen bonds between sucrose and water molecules are described to be stronger (or more extensive) than the ones between water molecules themselves. In this work, we studied the capability of sucrose moiety, attached to alkyl chains of different length, as a surface blocking agent at the water-interface and we compared its properties with those of polyethylenglycol, a well-known agent used for this purposes. Published studies in this topic mainly refer to the micellization process and the stability of mixed surfactant systems using glycosides. We are interested in the effect induced by the presence of sucrose monoesters at the interface (direct and reverse micelles) and at the palisade (mixtures with Triton X-100). We believe that the different functional group (ester), the position of alkyl chain (6-O) and the huge capability of sucrose to interact with water will dramatically change the water structuration at the interface and at the palisade, generating new possibilities for technological applications of these systems. Results Our time resolved and steady state fluorescence experiments in pure SEs micelles show that sucrose moieties are able to interact with a high number of water molecules promoting water structuration and increased viscosity. These results also indicate that the barrier formed by sucrose moieties on the surface of pure micelles is more effective than the polyoxyethylene palisade of Triton X-100. The fluorescence quenching experiments of SEs at the palisade of Triton X-100 micelles indicate a blocking effect dependent on the number of methylene units present in the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant. A remarkable blocking effect is observed when there is a match in size between the hydrophobic regions forming the apolar core (lauryl SE/ Triton X-100). This blocking effect disappears when a mismatch in size between hydrophobic tails, exists due to the disturbing effect on the micelle core."
https://openalex.org/W1988923521,"Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV; also called Ganjam virus in India) is a bunyavirus of the genus Nairovirus. It causes a haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in sheep and goats with mortality up to 90%. The virus is closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Little is currently known about the biology of NSDV. We have generated specific antibodies against the virus nucleocapsid protein (N) and polymerase (L) and used these to characterise NSDV in infected cells and to study its distribution during infection in a natural host. Due to its large size and the presence of a papain-like protease (the OTU-like domain) it has been suggested that the L protein of nairoviruses undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage into polymerase and one or more accessory proteins. Specific antibodies which recognise either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the NSDV L protein showed no evidence of L protein cleavage in NSDV-infected cells. Using the specific anti-N and anti-L antibodies, it was found that these viral proteins do not fully colocalise in infected cells; the N protein accumulated near the Golgi at early stages of infection while the L protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, further supporting the multifunctional nature of the L protein. These antibodies also allowed us to gain information about the organs and cell types targeted by the virus in vivo. We could detect NSDV in cryosections prepared from various tissues collected post-mortem from experimentally inoculated animals; the virus was found in the mucosal lining of the small and large intestine, in the lungs, and in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), where NSDV appeared to target monocytes and/or macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2036006226,"Molinate is a recalcitrant thiocarbamate used to control grass weeds in rice fields. The recently described molinate hydrolase, from Gulosibacter molinativorax ON4T, plays a key role in the only known molinate degradation pathway ending in the formation of innocuous compounds. Here we report the crystal structure of recombinant molinate hydrolase at 2.27 Å. The structure reveals a homotetramer with a single mononuclear metal-dependent active site per monomer. The active site architecture shows similarities with other amidohydrolases and enables us to propose a general acid-base catalysis mechanism for molinate hydrolysis. Molinate hydrolase is unable to degrade bulkier thiocarbamate pesticides such as thiobencarb which is used mostly in rice crops. Using a structural-based approach, we were able to generate a mutant (Arg187Ala) that efficiently degrades thiobencarb. The engineered enzyme is suitable for the development of a broader thiocarbamate bioremediation system."
https://openalex.org/W2081154226,"A neuroimaging technique based on the saturation-recovery (SR)-T1 MRI method was applied for simultaneously imaging blood oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) contrast and cerebral blood flow change (ΔCBF), which is determined by CBF-sensitive T1 relaxation rate change (ΔR1CBF). This technique was validated by quantitatively examining the relationships among ΔR1CBF, ΔCBF, BOLD and relative CBF change (rCBF), which was simultaneously measured by laser Doppler flowmetry under global ischemia and hypercapnia conditions, respectively, in the rat brain. It was found that during ischemia, BOLD decreased 23.1±2.8% in the cortical area; ΔR1CBF decreased 0.020±0.004s-1 corresponding to a ΔCBF decrease of 1.07±0.24 ml/g/min and 89.5±1.8% CBF reduction (n=5), resulting in a baseline CBF value (=1.18 ml/g/min) consistent with the literature reports. The CBF change quantification based on temperature corrected ΔR1CBF had a better accuracy than apparent R1 change (ΔR1app); nevertheless, ΔR1app without temperature correction still provides a good approximation for quantifying CBF change since perfusion dominates the evolution of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1app). In contrast to the excellent consistency between ΔCBF and rCBF measured during and after ischemia, the BOLD change during the post-ischemia period was temporally disassociated with ΔCBF, indicating distinct CBF and BOLD responses. Similar results were also observed for the hypercapnia study. The overall results demonstrate that the SR-T1 MRI method is effective for noninvasive and quantitative imaging of both ΔCBF and BOLD associated with physiological and/or pathological changes."
