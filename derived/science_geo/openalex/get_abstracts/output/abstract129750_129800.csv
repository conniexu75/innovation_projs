https://openalex.org/W2161307276,"Natural killer T (NKT) lymphocytes express an invariant T cell antigen receptor (TCR) encoded by the Valpha14 and Jalpha281 gene segments. A glycosylceramide-containing alpha-anomeric sugar with a longer fatty acyl chain (C26) and sphingosine base (C18) was identified as a ligand for this TCR. Glycosylceramide-mediated proliferative responses of Valpha14 NKT cells were abrogated by treatment with chloroquine-concanamycin A or by monoclonal antibodies against CD1d/Vbeta8, CD40/CD40L, or B7/CTLA-4/CD28, but not by interference with the function of a transporter-associated protein. Thus, this lymphocyte shares distinct recognition systems with either T or NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109196266,"Units of 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone that dimerize strongly in a self-complementary array of four cooperative hydrogen bonds were used as the associating end group in reversible self-assembling polymer systems. The unidirectional design of the binding sites prevents uncontrolled multidirectional association or gelation. Linear polymers and reversible networks were formed from monomers with two and three binding sites, respectively. The thermal and environmental control over lifetime and bond strength makes many properties, such as viscosity, chain length, and composition, tunable in a way not accessible to traditional polymers. Hence, polymer networks with thermodynamically controlled architectures can be formed, for use in, for example, coatings and hot melts, where a reversible, strongly temperature-dependent rheology is highly advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W1995529916,"A lymphocyte subpopulation, the Valpha14 natural killer T (NKT) cells, expresses both NK1.1 and a single invariant T cell receptor encoded by the Valpha14 and Jalpha281 gene segments. Mice with a deletion of the Jalpha281 gene segment were found to exclusively lack this subpopulation. The Valpha14 NKT cell-deficient mice could no longer mediate the interleukin-12 (IL-12)-induced rejection of tumors. Although the antitumor effect of IL-12 was thought to be mediated through natural killer cells and T cells, Valpha14 NKT cells were found to be an essential target of IL-12, and they mediated their cytotoxicity by an NK-like effector mechanism after activation with IL-12."
https://openalex.org/W1965971815,"The interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathway leads to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation in mammals and is similar to the Toll pathway in Drosophila : the IL-1R–associated kinase (IRAK) is homologous to Pelle. Two additional proximal mediators were identified that are required for IL-1R–induced NF-κB activation: IRAK-2, a Pelle family member, and MyD88, a death domain–containing adapter molecule. Both associate with the IL-1R signaling complex. Dominant negative forms of either attenuate IL-1R–mediated NF-κB activation. Therefore, IRAK-2 and MyD88 may provide additional therapeutic targets for inhibiting IL-1–induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2091348587,"During the last glacial period, Earth's climate underwent frequent large and abrupt global changes. This behavior appears to reflect the ability of the ocean's thermohaline circulation to assume more than one mode of operation. The record in ancient sedimentary rocks suggests that similar abrupt changes plagued the Earth at other times. The trigger mechanism for these reorganizations may have been the antiphasing of polar insolation associated with orbital cycles. Were the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels to trigger another such reorganization, it would be bad news for a world striving to feed 11 to 16 billion people."
https://openalex.org/W2001341743,"Transgenic Drosophila that expressed either luciferase or green fluorescent protein driven from the promoter of the clock gene period were used to monitor the circadian clock in explanted head, thorax, and abdominal tissues. The tissues (including sensory bristles in the leg and wing) showed rhythmic bioluminescence, and the rhythms could be reset by light. The photoreceptive properties of the explanted tissues indicate that unidentified photoreceptors are likely to contribute to photic signal transduction to the clock. These results show that autonomous circadian oscillators are present throughout the body, and they suggest that individual cells in Drosophila are capable of supporting their own independent clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2076972670,"Lavie's theory of attention proposes that the processing load in a relevant task determines the extent to which irrelevant distractors are processed. This theory was tested by asking participants in a study to perform linguistic tasks of low or high load while ignoring irrelevant visual motion in the periphery of the display. Although task and distractor were unrelated, both functional imaging of motion-related activity in cortical area V5 and psychophysical measures of the motion aftereffect showed reduced motion processing during high load in the linguistic task. These findings fulfill the prediction that perception of irrelevant distractors depends on the relevant processing load."
https://openalex.org/W2003659422,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or chronic hyperinsulinemia that induce insulin resistance trigger increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and of its major insulin receptor substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2. To unravel the molecular basis for this uncoupling in insulin signaling, we undertook to study the interaction of Ser/Thr-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 with the insulin receptor. We could demonstrate that, similar to IRS-1, IRS-2 also interacts with the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (amino acids 943–984) but not with the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 1245–1331) of IR expressed in bacteria as His6fusion peptides. Moreover, incubation of rat hepatoma Fao cells with TNFα, bacterial sphingomyelinase, or other Ser(P)/Thr(P)-elevating agents reduced insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, markedly elevated their Ser(P)/Thr(P) levels, and significantly reduced their ability to interact with the JM region of IR. Withdrawal of TNFα for periods as short as 30 min reversed its inhibitory effects on IR-IRS interactions. Similar inhibitory effects were obtained when Fao cells were subjected to prolonged (20–60 min) pretreatment with insulin. Incubation of the cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase reversed the inhibitory effects of insulin. These findings suggest that insulin resistance is associated with enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which impairs their interaction with the JM region of IR. Such impaired interactions abolish the ability of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation and further propagate the insulin receptor signal. Moreover, the reversibility of the TNFα effects and the ability to mimic its action by exogenously added sphingomyelinase argue against the involvement of a proteolytic cascade in mediating the acute inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin action.

The α subunits contain the insulin-binding domain while the transmembrane β subunits function as a tyrosine-specific protein kinase (IRK) that undergoes autophosphorylation following insulin binding (reviewed in Ref. 1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation activates the IRK (2Zick Y. Kasuga M. Kahn C.R. Roth J. J. Biol.

IRS-1 and IRS-2, two related protein substrates of IRK, have a highly conserved amino terminus, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a poorly conserved carboxyl terminus with several tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. IRS-1 and IRS-2 also contain over 30 Ser/Thr residues in consensus phosphorylation sites (4Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F.

The relative roles of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in mediating insulin action is presently unknown, although IRS-2 functions as an alternative substrate of IR in IRS-1 null mice (6Patty M.-E. Sun X.-J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which manifest a mild form of insulin resistance.Insulin resistance is a state in which target cells fail to respond to ordinary levels of circulating insulin (7Olefsky J.M. Molina J. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 121-153Google Scholar). At the molecular level, impaired insulin signaling results from mutations or post-translation modifications of the insulin receptor itself or any of its downstream effector molecules. A major negative regulatory role to insulin action is attributed to agents that enhance Ser/Thr phosphorylation of either the receptor itself or of its downstream effectors, which reduce IRK activity or its ability to phosphorylate substrate proteins (see Refs.8Zick Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 217-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 9Roth R.A. Liu F. Chin J.E. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1994; 41: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar for reviews). For example, insulin's counter-regulatory hormones such as epinephrine or glucagon increase cAMP levels, activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and increase the Ser(P)/Thr(P) content of the insulin receptor, which results in an insulin-resistant state. Similarly, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, inhibits insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1 while increasing the Ser/Thr phosphorylation level of this protein (10Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a mediator of insulin resistance in infection, tumor cachexia, and obesity, also acts in a similar manner. TNFα diminishes insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1 while it induces Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1, which decreases its electrophoretic mobility (12Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). These effects of TNFα are not the result of increased protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity but are presumably mediated through inhibition of Ser phosphatases or activation of Ser kinase(s) (12Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The effects of TNFα are mimicked by treating cells with sphingomyelinase or after addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs (C2and C6) (14Kanety H. Hemi R. Papa M.Z. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9895-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 17Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) to impair insulin action. Overall, these findings suggest the existence of converging desensitization mechanisms for IR and IRS-1 that involve Ser/Thr phosphorylation of these proteins.A question still unresolved is how Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IR or its substrates affects their mutual interactions and what is the relative contribution of each of the elements in this signaling complex to the impairment in insulin signal transduction. This question is difficult to tackle in studies carried out in intact cells, because agents that enhance cellular Ser/Thr phosphorylation often affect both IR and its substrates. Hence, impaired signal transduction could result from enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IR itself, its downstream effectors (e.g. IRS-1 and IRS-2), or both. In the present study we undertook to address this issue by eliminating the effects of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IR, focusing only on changes in Ser(P)/Thr(P) content of IRS-1 and IRS-2. We took advantage of our previous findings that the isolated juxtamembrane (JM) domain of IR (amino acids 943–984),but not its carboxyl-terminal (CT) region (amino acids 1245–1331),is sufficient to mediate interactions between IR and IRS-1 (18Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that similar to IRS-1, IRS-2 also interacts with the JM but not the CT region of IR. Moreover, insulin, TNFα, and other Ser(P)/Thr(P)-inducing agents significantly reduce the ability of IRS-1 or IRS-2 to interact with the JM region of IR. Such impaired interactions abolish the ability of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation and further propagate the insulin receptor signal, thus providing us with a possible molecular mechanism for the induction of an insulin-resistant state.DISCUSSIONIn this study we present evidence that insulin resistance at the molecular level is induced at least in part by enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, which impedes their interaction with the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor, turning them into poorer receptor substrates that fail to undergo appropriate Tyr phosphorylation. Impaired Tyr phosphorylation eliminates the ability of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to recruit downstream effector molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (12Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and results in severe impairment of insulin signal transduction.Several lines of evidence support such a model. First, we could demonstrate that IRS-2, like IRS-1, specifically interacts with the isolated JM region of IR but not with its isolated CT region. Moreover, 14-amino acid-long peptides, derived from the JM, but not the CT region, effectively compete with binding of the IRS proteins to the JM region. Second, in line with previous studies (9Roth R.A. Liu F. Chin J.E. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1994; 41: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 97: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we have shown that agents such as TNFα, SMase, TPA, okadaic acid, and calyculin A, all known to counteract insulin action, increase the Ser(P)/Thr(P) content of IRS-1 and IRS-2, as exemplified here by a decrease in their electrophoretic mobility. Third, we established an inverse correlation between the extent of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (manifested by their reduced mobility) and the ability of these proteins to interact with the isolated JM region of IR. Fourth, we were able to demonstrate the reversibility of these events, at least with regard to TNFα, again emphasizing the involvement of post-translation modifications in the form of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in modulating the affinity of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to the JM region.Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS proteins may represent a junction where cross-talk between signals emitted by insulin and other hormones takes place. Of special interest is the attenuation in insulin signaling in response to TNFα, because the latter was recently suggested to be a cause and a link to obesity-induced insulin resistance (11Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Kanety H. Hemi R. Papa M.Z. Karasik A. J. Biol.

Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). TNFα binds with a high affinity to two receptors having different intracellular domains (17Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These receptors, p55 TNFαR (TNFαR1) and p75 TNFαR (TNFαR2), are transmembrane glycoproteins devoid of any enzymatic activity that associate with different intracellular effectors (34Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Activation of TNFαR1 is sufficient to mediate most biological responses by TNFα, including insulin-resistant states (35Skolnik E.Y. Marcusohn J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As of now, the TNFα receptors have been shown to utilize distinct mechanisms to couple to proximal cytoplasmic signaling molecules. Recruitment of the signal transducer FADD (also known as MORT1) to the TNFαR1 complex mediates apoptosis through activation of an intricate protease cascade (26Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 36Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), whereas two other signal transducers, RIP and TRAF2, mediate both Jun amino-terminal kinase and NF-κB activation (36Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Similarly, FAN, a novel protein containing a WD-repeat motif, couples TNFαR1 to neutral SMase (17Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) whose stimulation results in the production of ceramide (33Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), which in turn activates several kinases (16Kolesnick R. Golde D.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stimulation of these kinase(s) (14Kanety H. Hemi R. Papa M.Z. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9895-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which impairs IR-IRS interactions, occurs after only 15 min of TNFα treatment of Fao cells, suggesting that TNFα mediates insulin resistance in these cells via post-translational modification of an existing protein. Moreover, TNFα effects are mimicked by bacterial SMase and are reversible in nature, again suggesting involvement of signaling elements different from proteases.TNFα, SMase, and ceramide did not affect Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-2 in 32D cells overexpressing both IR and IRS-2 (32D-IR/IRS-2 cells) (15Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the conclusion that IRS-1 but not IRS-2 is involved in the mechanism by which TNFα, SMase, and ceramides inhibit insulin signaling (15Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above findings, our results clearly indicate that the insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, as well as their interactions with IR are subjected to inhibition either by TNFα or by SMase. The reason for these conflicting results is presently unknown, but they could be accounted for by the fact that our studies were carried out in insulin-responsive rat hepatoma cells rather than myeloid 32D cells. Hence, it might well be that part of the endogenous machinery responsible for negative feedback control of IRS-2 is missing from 32D cells, which were not designed physiologically to respond to insulin signals.IRS-2 shares substantial structural homology as well as biological activity with IRS-1 (5Sun X.-J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Both proteins interact with downstream effectors of the insulin signaling like Grb2, the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SH-PTP2 (5Sun X.-J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 6Patty M.-E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, IRS-2 functions as an alternative substrate of the IR in IRS-1-deficient mice (5Sun X.-J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Our results add another layer of similarity between the two proteins, showing that IRS-2, like IRS-1, is subjected to regulation by TNFα and other Ser(P)/Thr(P) elevating agents, at least in insulin-responsive hepatoma cells. It has recently been proposed that through the induction of Ser/Thr phosphorylation TNFα converts IRS-1 to an inhibitor of IRK (15Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Our results offer an alternative explanation for the role of Ser/Thr-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2. According to our model TNFα-induced insulin resistance is associated with enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which results in impaired interaction of these proteins with the insulin receptor. Such impaired interaction abolishes the ability of these proteins to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation and further propagate the insulin signal.The redundancy of kinases capable of inhibiting IR-IRS interactions is not surprising in view of the fact that different stimuli, having in common the ability to elevate intracellular Ser(P)/Thr(P) content, all induce insulin resistance. Some stimuli, like TNFα or TPA, are activators of specific kinases, whereas others such as calyculin A or okadaic acid elevate Ser(P)/Thr(P) content through inhibition of protein phosphatases. Prolonged exposure of cells to insulin itself increases the Ser(P)/Thr(P) content of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and impedes their interaction with the JM domain. Of note is the fact that the reduced binding of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to the JM peptide in insulin-treated cells occurred at a slower rate when compared with their rate of insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation. These findings are compatible with the notion that insulin-induced activation of Ser/Thr kinases occurs more slowly when compared with the immediate activation of the IRK and the Tyr phosphorylation of its substrate proteins. Our results further suggest that initiation of negative feedback control mechanisms in the form of enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation and dissociation of receptor-substrates complexes is designed to commence with a delayed onset, thus allowing enough time for the insulin signal to propagate before it is turned off. The reversible nature of this feedback control mechanism is emphasized by the fact that protein phosphatases are capable of neutralizing this process, at least in vitro.The presence of multiple potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 and IRS-2 makes the identification of specific residues involved in impaired IR-IRS interactions a formidable task. Nonetheless, recent insights into structure-function aspects of IRS proteins turns the PTB domain, present both within IRS-1 and IRS-2, into a likely candidate. This domain, which shares 75% sequence identity between IRS-1 and IRS-2, mediates their interactions with the JM region of IR (39Eck M.J. Dhe P.S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alignment of the PTB domains (amino acids 162–316 of IRS-1 and amino acids 192–351 of IRS-2 (5Sun X.-J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar)) reveals the presence of 16 conserved Ser/Thr residues whose phosphorylation might affect the interactions of the PTB domain with the JM region. It has been recently suggested that IRS-2 interacts with IR through an additional domain (amino acids 591–786) that presumably binds to the kinase region of IR (40Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of this domain to the overall IR-IRS-2 interactions was not addressed in the present work, the correlation between diminished IRS-2 phosphorylation and diminished interactions of this protein with the JM region suggests that the PTB domain constitutes a significant contributor to the IR-IRS-2 interactions. In that respect, our results are somewhat at variance with those of Yenushet al. (41Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that deletion of the PTB domain only partially inhibits (∼30%) the ability of IRS-1 to undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation (at 10−7m insulin) in 32D cells. The reason for the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that the high IRS-1/IR ratio in 32D cells, which overexpress IRS-1 while having only ∼500 insulin receptors/cell, enables generation of IR-IRS-1 complexes and phosphorylation of IRS-1 even when an important domain for interaction, such as the PTB region, is deleted. Indeed, at low concentrations of insulin (10−9m) Tyr phosphorylation of PTB-deleted IRS-1 is severely impaired (41Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of IRS-1 impairs its ability to undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in cultured cells (42Voliovitch H. Schindler D.G. Hadari Y.R. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18083-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) without impairing its ability to interact with the JM peptide in vitro (18Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hence, both the pleckstrin homology and PTB domain are required to maintain IR-IRS-1 interactions in insulin-responsive cells. IRS-1 or IRS-2, phosphorylated either on Tyr or Ser/Thr residues tend to dissociate more readily from the JM peptide. This is compatible with the idea (SchemeFSI) that once IRS proteins are phosphorylated on Tyr residues they translocate away from the receptor to other cellular regions to further propagate the insulin signal. In contrast, Ser/Thr phosphorylation interferes with binding of IRS-1 or IRS-2 to the JM region and prevents their subsequent Tyr phosphorylation.Ser/Thr phosphorylation appears to be a general mean to down-modulate insulin receptor signaling both under physiological and pathological states. Hence, Ser/Thr kinases stimulated by insulin act as negative feedback regulators that phosphorylate IRS proteins and induce a conformational change that diminishes the interactions between IRS-PTB domains and the JM region of IR. Other Ser(P)/Thr(P)-elevating agents (e.g. TNFα) utilize the same principle to inhibit insulin signal transduction and establish an insulin-resistant state (SchemeFSI). Similarly, insulin-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of mSos results in the dissociation of Sos-Grb2 complexes and attenuation of the Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras/MAP kinase cascade (43Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 44Chen D. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hence, the two major insulin signaling pathways, those mediated by IRS proteins and those mediated by Shc, are subjected to negative feedback control in the form of Ser/Thr phosphorylation. This conclusion targets us toward potential pharmacological interventions in disease states where this mechanism can be the underlying cause of insulin resistance, such as the prevalent form of obesity-induced diabetes.

DeBellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that comprises receptors for steroids, thyroid hormones, and retinoids (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K.

Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of AR exhibits a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to other members of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) subfamily, the progesterone (PR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors, and as a consequence, the four receptors appear to recognize very similar, if not identical, hormone response elements (1Quigley C.A.

Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). However, the cognate steroids of these receptors elicit biological responses that are hormone-specific, implying that important determinants for steroid- and receptor-specific actions reside outside the DBD. In the case of other subfamilies of nuclear receptors, different mechanisms have been described to account for cell- and promoter-specific regulation of gene expression, including receptor heterodimerization, variable spacing between hormone response elements, and orientation of hormone response element half-sites (4Zechel C. Shen X.-Q. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Glass C.K. DiRenzo J. Kurokawa R. Han Z.

Since these mechanisms may not be used by PR, GR, MR, and AR, it is assumed that their highly variable N-terminal regions are responsible for the cell- and steroid-specific regulation of target genes. In support of this notion, induction of mouse sex-limited protein gene (slp) expression has been shown to be mediated by the N-terminal region of murine AR, but not by that of GR (7Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of GR has been shown to function as a specificity determination domain on the proliferin promoter composite response element (8Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Dissimilarities in the transcriptional activities of two human PR forms, PR-A and PR-B, suggest that isoform specificity is associated with structural differences in their N termini (9Tora L.

Similar to PR, two AR isoforms differing in the length of the N-terminal regions appear to exist in human cells, although functional similarities and/or differences between the two forms have not been elucidated (12Wilson C.M.

Most of the coregulators are relatively promiscuous in that nuclear receptors are capable of associating with many of them, and probably simultaneously. No coactivator or corepressor interacting specifically with the N-terminal region of nuclear receptors has been reported. Moreover, it has not been clarified whether some of the factors interact with receptor regions other than the LBD. Studies using relatively large deletions and truncations revealed that the N-terminal halves of rat and human ARs encompass sequences mandatory for transcriptional activation and repression (30Palvimo J.J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of human and rat ARs are highly homologous, the location and length of various poly(amino acid) stretches in the N-terminal region differ considerably (1Quigley C.A.

In this work, we have delineated sequences important for transactivation by rAR and demonstrate that the ability of this receptor to utilize distinct N-terminal regions for promoter activation is modulated by the hormone-occupied LBD. Our results also indicate that coactivators F-SRC-1 and CBP not only enhance AR-mediated transactivation, but also facilitate androgen-dependent association of the N and C termini of rAR. This is not a feature typical of all nuclear receptor coactivators, as SRC-1, which activates PR, GR, and the estrogen receptor (ER), inhibits the functions of rAR. pARE2tk-CAT contains two copies of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene ARE inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter driving the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, of which the cryptic AP-1 site was deleted from the vector backbone (36Reinikainen P.

The following mammalian transactivation and two-hybrid system vectors were obtained from CLONTECH: pM for expressing the DBD of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 protein (amino acid residues 1–147) and pVP16 for expressing the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (amino acid residues 411–456); and pM-53 coding for a fusion of the GAL4 DBD to mouse p53 protein and pVP16-T expressing a fusion of the VP16 activation domain to SV40 large T-antigen. The pM2GAL4-DBD fusion vector was a gift from Dr. I. Sadowski (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) (42Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Testosterone was obtained from Makor Chemicals, Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). [3H]Acetyl coenzyme A was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. AR antibody (anti-AR peptide 3) was raised against a region corresponding to residues 14–32 of rat AR (43Xie Y.-B. Sui Y.-P. Shan L.-X. Palvimo J.J. Phillips D.M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4939-4948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assay reagent was purchased from Promega. The rat AR expression vector pSGrAR and receptor deletion mutants ARΔ46–408, ARΔ38–296, and ARΔ40–147 were constructed as described previously (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M.

The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant ARΔ641–902 was constructed by PCR using pSGrAR as template and the primers 5′-GATGAAGCTTCTGGTTGTCAC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CAGAGATCTACTGGGATGGGTCC-3′ (downstream). The PCR product was digested with HindIII/BglII and cloned into pSGrAR. Amino-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR using pSGrAR as template and the upstream primer 5′-GAACCCGGGCCCCAGGCACC-3′ with the following downstream primers: ARΔ149–295, 5′-AAACCCGGGCCCAGTAGGGACAACG-3′; ARΔ212–295, 5′-GCCCCCGGGGCCTCCCTTGCTCTCACGC-3′; and ARΔ256–295, 5′-TCCCCCGGGCTCAGATGTTCCAGTGCTTC-3′. PCR products were digested withSmaI and cloned into the receptor mutant ARΔ788–902 (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs were then digested with EcoRI, and the inserts were cloned into pSGrAR. ARΔ149–295/Δ641–902, ARΔ212–295/Δ641–902, and ARΔ256–295/Δ641–902 were constructed by cleaving an internal fragment from ARΔ149–295, ARΔ212–295, and ARΔ256–295 by digestion with NheI and cloning it into ARΔ641–902. ARΔ46–408/Δ641–902, ARΔ38–296/Δ641–902, and ARΔ40–147/Δ641–902 were created by digesting ARΔ46–408, ARΔ38–296, and ARΔ40–147 withBamHI and HindIII and cloning inserts into ARΔ641–902. Fusion vectors containing the indicated amino acids of rAR (in parentheses) were constructed as follows: GAL4 DBD-rAR-(5–538) and VP16-rAR-(5–538) were created by PCR using pSGrAR as template with the upstream primer 5′-GGTGGAATTCGGGCTGGGAAGGGTCTAC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-GTCTTCTAGAGTGGGAAGTAATAGTC-3′. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into pM and pVP16 vectors. GAL4 DBD-rAR-(144–293), GAL4 DBD-rAR-(208–293), and GAL4 DBD-rAR-(260–293) were created by PCR using pSGrAR as template. The following upstream primers were used with the downstream primer 5′-CCGAAGCTTCGTCCAGGGAAAGACCTT-3′: GAL4 DBD-rAR-(144–293), 5′-GTTGTCCCGGGTGGGCCCCACTTTCC-3′; GAL4 DBD-rAR-(208–293), 5′-GAGAGCCCGGGAGGCCACTGGGGCTC-3′; and GAL4 DBD-rAR-(260–293), 5′-GCAGCCCCGGGGCGACTGCATGTACG-3′. PCR products were digested withSmaI/HindIII and cloned into pM2. GAL4 DBD-rAR-(37–265) was constructed by deleting the sequence encoding amino acids 37–265 from mutant ARΔ788–902 usingSmaI/MluI and cloning it into the pM vector. GAL4 DBD-rAR-(295–550) was made by deleting sequence coding for amino acid residues 295–550 from mutant ARΔ38–295 usingSmaI/HindIII and cloning it into the pM vector. GAL4 DBD-rAR-(265–550) was assembled by deleting the sequence coding for amino acids 265–550 from the ARΔ788–902 mutant usingMluI/HindIII and cloning it into the pM2 vector. VP16-rAR-(37–265) and VP16-rAR-(295–550) were constructed by digesting the GAL4 DBD-rAR-(37–265) and GAL4 DBD-rAR-(295–550) fusion vectors with EcoRI/XbaI and cloning the inserts into the pVP16 vector. GAL4 DBD-rAR LBD was prepared as described previously (44Moilanen A. Rouleau N. Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Correct nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CV-1 and COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 units/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in the same medium containing also nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cells (1.5 × 106) were plated on a 10-cm dish 24 h before adding the precipitate with the amounts of expression and reporter vectors depicted in the figure and table legends. β-Galactosidase expression plasmids, pSV-β-gal (4 μg/10-cm plate) and pCMVβ (2 μg/10-cm plate), were used as internal controls for transfection efficiency. For preparation of whole cell extracts, the indicated amounts of expression vectors/10-cm dish were transfected by electroporation into COS-1 cells (37Palvimo J.J. Reinikainen P. Ikonen T.

An electrical discharge was applied by a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser transfection apparatus (settings, 300 V and 500 microfarads). For domain interaction studies (2.3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish), 1.5 μg of chimeric expression vectors and 3 μg of pUAS5E1b-CAT reporter vector were transfected into CHO cells using DOTAP transfection reagent (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eighteen hours after transfection, the medium was changed to one containing charcoal-stripped 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of androgen. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was determined with reagents from Promega using a Luminoskan RT reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) (39Palvimo J.J. Partanen M. Jänne O.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses of the data were carried out using two-tailed Student's t test. Whole cell extracts from transfected COS-1 cells were prepared as described previously and resolved by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (43Xie Y.-B. Sui Y.-P. Shan L.-X. Palvimo J.J. Phillips D.M. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4939-4948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,45Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and processed as described previously (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the ARΔ46–408 and ARΔ38–296 mutants of rAR are not able to activate transcription from either an ARE-containing simple promoter or a complex androgen-responsive promoter (Fig.1 A) (30Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ARΔ40–147 mutant had transcriptional activity comparable to that of the native receptor. To map the regions that are required for transcriptional activation in more detail, a series of N-terminal internal deletion mutants was constructed. The activity of the ARΔ149–295 mutant was only 14% of that of ligand-activated wild-type AR in CV-1 cells (Fig. 1 A). Deletion mutants ARΔ212–295 and ARΔ256–295 both had ∼50% of the activity of the native receptor. Thus, deletion of 40 amino acids (residues 256–295) decreased the transcriptional activity of AR by one-half, indicating that part of the core AF1 (activationfunction-1) is located within this region. Comparison of ARΔ149–295 and ARΔ212–295 activities (14 ± 1% versus 48 ± 5%) identified a weaker AF1 region located N-terminally from residue 212, in the region of amino acids 149–212. Very similar results were obtained with a reporter driven by the natural probasin promoter (pPB(−285/+32)-LUC) (TableI). In contrast to the results with probasin and thymidine kinase promoters, deletion of amino acids 212–295 (ARΔ212–295) increased the activity of the mutant protein over that of wild-type rAR when a reporter regulated by two AREs in front of the E1b TATA sequence (pARE2E1b-CAT) was used (Table I). Furthermore, deletion of residues 256–295 caused a smaller decrease in the activation function of rAR on the minimal E1b promoter than on the two other promoters studied, suggesting that the region between amino acids 149 and 212 contains the major AF1 needed to activate this minimal promoter. The three latter receptor mutants were also examined in CHO cells using pARE2tk-CAT as the reporter. The results were similar, but not completely identical, to those obtained in CV-1 cells (Table I). Collectively, there are at least two distinct subregions (amino acids 149–212 and 256–295) within the N-terminal region of rAR that mediate promoter- and cell-specific contacts in the transactivation process.Table ITranscriptional activation of different promoter constructs by wild-type rAR and N-terminal deletion mutantsReceptor formRecipient cell line and promoter constructCV-1, pARE2tk-CATCV-1, pPB(−285/+32)-LUCCV-1, pARE2E1b-CATCHO, pARE2tk-CATNative AR100100100100ARΔ149–29514 ± 18 ± 17 ± 11 ± 1ARΔ212–29548 ± 551 ± 5137 ± 128 ± 8ARΔ256–29554 ± 1538 ± 472 ± 338 ± 16Functional activity of rAR forms was tested by cotransfecting the receptor expression plasmid (1 μg) and reporter vector (5 μg) into CV-1 or CHO cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are expressed relative to those of wild-type rAR in the presence of androgen (pSGrAR plus testosterone = 100%).

https://openalex.org/W2053010478,"The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) group of transcription factors is retained in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells. NFAT activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import. This process requires calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT caused by the phosphatase calcineurin. The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylates NFAT4 on two sites. Mutational removal of the JNK phosphorylation sites caused constitutive nuclear localization of NFAT4. In contrast, JNK activation in calcineurin-stimulated cells caused nuclear exclusion of NFAT4. These findings show that the nuclear accumulation of NFAT4 promoted by calcineurin is opposed by the JNK signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2087298204,"Abstract The dissociation constants (K d) of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 for the active and latent forms of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and enzyme inhibition studies. SPR analysis shows biphasic kinetics with high (nm) and low (μm) affinity binding sites of TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 for MMP-2 (72- and 62-kDa species) and MMP-9 (92- and 82-kDa species), respectively. In contrast, binding data of TIMP-2 to an MMP-2 45-kDa active form lacking the C-terminal domain and to an MMP-2 C-terminal domain (CTD) fragment displays monophasic kinetics withK d values of 315 and 60 nm, respectively. This suggests that the CTD contains the high affinity binding site, whereas the catalytic domain contains the low affinity site. Also, binding of TIMP-2 to pro-MMP-2 is stronger at both the high and low affinity sites than the corresponding binding of TIMP-2 to the MMP-2 62-kDa form demonstrating the importance of the N-terminal prodomain. In addition, the K d value of TIMP-1 for the MMP-2 62-kDa species is 28.6 nm at the high affinity site, yet neither the MMP-2 45-kDa species nor the CTD interacts with TIMP-1. Enzyme inhibition studies demonstrate that TIMPs are slow binding inhibitors with monophasic inhibition kinetics. This suggests that a single binding event results in enzyme inhibition. The kinetic parameters for the onset of inhibition are fast (k on ∼105 m −1 s−1) with slow off rates (k off ∼10−3 s−1). The inhibition constants (K i) are in the 10−7–10−9 m range and correlate with the values determined by SPR."
https://openalex.org/W1994199097,"Analysis of a large sample of well-dated fossil mammals from localities in the Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia revealed sampling biases that affect patterns of faunal turnover during the late Pliocene. When these biases were accounted for, results indicated that 58 to 77 percent of the mammal species were replaced between 3.0 and 1.8 million years ago (Ma). Overall diversity increased from 3.0 to 2.0 Ma but then declined. No distinct turnover pulse is seen between 2.8 and 2.5 Ma; instead, the most significant period of faunal change began after 2.5 Ma and continued through 1.8 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W1969835310,"The lethal yellow ( A Y /a ) mouse has a defect in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) signaling in the brain that leads to obesity, and is resistant to the anorexigenic effects of the hormone leptin. It has been proposed that the weight-reducing effects of leptin are thus transmitted primarily by way of POMC neurons. However, the central effects of defective POMC signaling, and the absence of leptin, on weight gain in double-mutant lethal yellow ( A Y /a ) leptin-deficient ( lep ob /lep ob ) mice were shown to be independent and additive. Furthermore, deletion of the leptin gene restored leptin sensitivity to A Y /a mice. This result implies that in the A Y /a mouse, obesity is independent of leptin action, and resistance to leptin results from desensitization of leptin signaling."

High-temperature annealing treatments modified the intergrain barriers of the as-grown films through surface decomposition of CrO 2 into insulating Cr 2 O 3 , which led to a threefold enhancement of the low-field magnetoresistance. This enhancement indicates the potential of this simple method to directly control the interface barrier characteristics that determine the magnetotransport properties."
https://openalex.org/W2008359273,"Phosphorylation of αB-crystallin, a member of the hsp27 family, in human glioma (U373 MG) cells was stimulated by exposure of the cells to various stimuli, which included heat, arsenite, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), okadaic acid, H2O2, anisomycin, and high concentrations of NaCl or sorbitol, but not in response to agents that elevated intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. Cells exposed to PMA together with okadaic acid yielded three bands of 32P-labeled αB-crystallin when immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an isoelectric focusing gel. All of the phosphorylated residues were identified as serine, an indication that three different serine residues can act as sites of phosphorylation in αB-crystallin. Structural analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin occurred at serines 19, 45, and 59. Dithiothreitol and staurosporine selectively inhibited the phosphorylation induced by arsenite and the phorbol ester, respectively. SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, suppressed the phosphorylation induced by arsenite, anisomycin, H2O2, sorbitol, NaCl, and heat shock, but not that induced by PMA and okadaic acid. The PMA-induced phosphorylation was selectively suppressed by an inhibitor of p44 MAP kinase kinase, PD98059. Although PMA and arsenite preferentially stimulated the phosphorylation of Ser-45 and Ser-59, respectively, as determined with antibodies that recognized the respective phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin, all three sites were phosphorylated in response to each stimulus. These results suggest that p38 MAP kinase or p44 MAP kinase might be involved in the signal transduction cascade that leads to the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin. The phosphorylation of αB-crystallin was also enhanced in the heart and diaphragm when rats were exposed to heat stress (42 °C for 20 min).

It has been reported that phosphorylation of hsp27 results in the dissociation of an aggregated form of hsp27 to oligomers (27Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylated hsp27 no longer exhibits the ability to inhibit the polymerization of actin (28Benndorf R. Hayeß K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reports on the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin are mostly related to the phosphorylation of this protein in the lens. Phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin (αB1-crystallin) have been found in bovine lens (29Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Kleiman N.J. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Roersma E.C. Meyer H.E. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and αB-crystallin in extracts of bovine lens can be phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner (31Spector A. Chiesa R. Sredy J.

Eye Res. 1995; 61: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that H2O2 stimulated the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in rat lens, and Bennardini et al. (35Bennardini F. Juliano C. Benetti D. Mian M. Chiesi M. Mattana A. Franconi F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in cultures of bovine articular chondrocytes. In this report, we show that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in U373 MG human glioma cells and in rat tissues can be induced by various stimuli, and we also identify the sites of phosphorylation in αB-crystallin, as determined by use of antibodies that recognized each of the phosphorylation sites specifically. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4α-PMA), okadaic acid, and staurosporine were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Dithiothreitol was obtained from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). SB202190 and PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor α (with specific activities of 2 × 107 and 2.55 × 106 units/mg of protein, respectively) were obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceuticals (Osaka). Forskolin, cholera toxin, anisomycin, and protein A were obtained from Sigma. Dibutyryl cAMP was obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Ampholine pH 6–8, Ampholine pH 3.5–10, and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). U373 MG cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Tokyo) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were seeded on 90-mm dishes, and the medium was changed every 2 or 3 days. When the cells had reached confluence, various chemicals, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or in H2O, were added to the culture medium. After a 90-min incubation in a CO2 incubator, unless otherwise specified, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.15 g of Na2HPO4, and 0.2 g of KH2PO4 in 1000 ml of H2O) and frozen at −80 °C for a few days prior to analysis. The frozen cells on each dish were collected and suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaF, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and 5 mm EDTA. Each suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for analysis by isoelectric focusing (IEF) of αB-crystallin. In some experiments, pellets were washed once with the Tris buffer by sonication as described above and then solubilized with 8 murea for analysis by IEF. Isoelectric focusing was performed as described by O'Farrell (36O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Protean II system from Bio-Rad (Tokyo). In brief, an aliquot of cell extract that contained 10–40 μg of protein was mixed with 4 volumes of sample buffer (2% Ampholine mixture (4 parts Ampholine pH 6–8 and 1 part Ampholine pH 3.5–10), 9.5 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Fifty-microliter aliquots of the mixture were then applied to a gel composed of 9.2 m urea, 2% Ampholine mixture, 4% acrylamide, and 2% Nonidet P-40, and electrophoresis was performed at 400 V for 16 h at 16.5 °C. For Western blot analysis, proteins on a gel were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (type GV; Nihon Millipore Ltd., Yonezawa, Japan), and the membrane was immunostained, as described previously (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), with antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or against specifically phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin that had been prepared as described below. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (27Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then they were incubated for 90 min in a CO2 incubator with 1 μm PMA and 0.2 μm okadaic acid. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then frozen at −80 °C for 2 h. The frozen cells were scraped off the plates, disrupted by passage through a 24-gauge needle, and then centrifuged as described above. The soluble fraction of the cells (100 μg of protein) was incubated at 4 °C for 5 h with 5 μg of affinity-purified rabbit IgG against αB-crystallin (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and then 50 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose were added to the mixture with further incubation at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The beads were subjected to rapid agitation on a mixer for 5 min with 50 μl of the sample buffer for IEF, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were subjected to IEF or analysis of phosphoamino acids. The immunopurified extract was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography. Each band containing phosphorylated αB-crystallin was cut out and subjected to hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was then evaporated in dryness under nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved in 5 μl of formate/acetate buffer (formic acid, acetic acid, and water (26:78:900, v/v)), pH 1.9, supplemented with 67 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma) and applied to a silica gel plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Electrophoresis was performed in the above buffer at pH 1.9 and 30 mA for 40 min. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed in a different buffer (acetic acid, pyridine, and water (10:1:200, v/v)) at pH 3.5 and 35 mA for 30 min. The phosphoamino acids on the dried plate were visualized by staining with ninhydrin, and then the plate was subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. The sites of phosphorylation in αB-crystallin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/TSQMS) (37Nakayama H. Uchida K. Shinkai F. Shinoda T. Okuyama T. Seta K. Isobe T. J. Chromatogr. 1996; 730: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The system consisted of a Model 140A liquid chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) that was connected to a Model TSQ-700 mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). αB-Crystallin (2 μg), purified from U373 MG cells that had been exposed to 1 μm PMA and 0.2 μm okadaic acid for 90 min as described below, was digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin at 37 °C for 5 h in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digest was fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography on a capillary column (0.5 mm, inner diameter, × 150 mm) packed with Aquapore C18 (particle size, 5 mm; Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 20 min at a flow rate of 8.5 ml/min. The eluate was introduced directly to the ESI interface of the mass spectrometer. After mapping of tryptic peptides, the phosphopeptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for identification of the sites of phosphorylation. The spectrometer was operated under the following conditions: electrospray voltage, 4.5 kV; temperature, 200 °C; and electron multiplier voltage, 1000 V for peptide mapping and 1600 V for sequencing. For analysis of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry, αB-crystallin was purified from extracts of U373 MG cells that had been exposed to 1 μm PMA plus 0.2 μmokadaic acid for 90 min. The cells were scraped from ∼100 dishes (90 mm in diameter), sonicated, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant (∼80 ml) was incubated at room temperature with 0.5 mg of affinity-purified antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of αB-crystallin. After 2 h of a gentle shaking, 1 ml of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-coupled Sepharose beads (Sigma) was added to the mixture with additional incubation at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose beads were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. αB-Crystallin trapped on the beads was eluted with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 7 m urea, 1 mm glycol ether diaminetetraacetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The eluate was then applied to a column (0.8 cm, inner diameter, × 7.5 cm) of TSK-SP-5PW (Tosoh, Tokyo), and αB-crystallin was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) in the above buffer as described previously (38Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three peptides corresponding to internal sequences of human αB-crystallin, containing phosphorylated Ser-19 (residues 17–27, FHSPSRLFDQF+C; p19S), Ser-45 (residues 44–54, LSPFYLRPPSF+C; p45S), and Ser-59 (residues 57–67, APSWFDTGLSE+C; p59S), respectively, were synthesized. Each peptide was conjugated with hemocyanin (Sigma) usingN-(4-carboxycyclohexylmethyl) maleimide (Zieben Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) (39Yoshitake S. Yamada Y. Ishikawa E. Masseyeff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in rabbits by injection of each conjugate (0.5 mg of peptide/animal), and antibodies were purified with bovine lens αB1-crystallin-coupled Sepharose in the case of antibodies against p19S and p45S and with p59S peptide-coupled Sepharose in the case of antibodies against p59S by the previously described procedure (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (body weight, ∼250 g) were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute for Developmental Research. The rats were subjected to heat stress as described previously (40Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Ito H. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1238-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After 20 min of heat stress at 42 °C, rats were killed under ether anesthesia, and tissues were dissected out on dry ice and kept frozen at −80 °C for a few days. The frozen tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and each suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subjected to IEF followed by Western blot analysis. The insoluble fraction was also analyzed as described above. Levels of cyclic AMP in cells were determined using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (EIA, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Concentrations of protein in soluble fractions of cells and tissues and in fractions solubilized with urea from pellets after centrifugation were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Bovine αB1-crystallin and αB2-crystallin and rat α-crystallin, used as standards for IEF, were purified from lenses as described previously (8Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Human αB-crystallin was purified from skeletal muscle (14Kato K. Shinohara H. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7718-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U373 MG human glioma cells were exposed to NaAsO2 at various concentrations for 60 min, and then cell extracts were subjected to IEF with subsequent Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, arsenite acted in a dose-dependent manner to induce the generation of a form of αB-crystallin that had a lower isoelectric point than the control. Since the newly induced form of αB-crystallin had an isoelectric point similar to that of αB1-crystallin, a phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin, it appeared that the observed modification of αB-crystallin under the above conditions was due to phosphorylation. The arsenite-induced phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin was detected after 20 min of exposure, and its level increased in a time-dependent manner for 120 min (Fig. 1 B). When cells that had been exposed to arsenite for 120 min were incubated for 2 h in the standard medium, the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin disappeared (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that considerable dephosphorylating activity was present in the cells. We next examined whether or not okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine protein phosphatases, could induce the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin. As shown in Fig. 2 A, exposure of cells to 0.2 μm okadaic acid stimulated the accumulation of αB-crystallin in a time-dependent manner. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of αB-crystallin in cells are under dynamic equilibrium. The band that migrated between the unphosphorylated (p0) and phosphorylated (p1) forms, which was also detected in the preparation of α-crystallin purified from lens, seemed to be αB-crystallin that had received other modification. Generation of the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin was also observed when cells were exposed to IL-1α and PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C, although the extent of the phosphorylation induced by IL-1α was smaller than that induced by arsenite or PMA (Fig. 2 B). 4α-PMA, an inactive analog of PMA, and tumor necrosis factor α each barely induced any phosphorylation of αB-crystallin (Fig.2 B). It has been reported that αB-crystallin in extracts of bovine lens can be phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner in vitro (31Spector A. Chiesa R. Sredy J. Garner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4712-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Kleiman N.J. Spector A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, activators of protein kinase A, such as dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin, barely induced any phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in U373 MG cells (Fig.2 C). Other compounds, such as H2O2 (oxidative stress), sorbitol and NaCl (hypertonic stress), and anisomycin (an activator of p38 MAP kinase) (41Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), also stimulated the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in the soluble fraction of U373 MG cells (Fig.3 A). The phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin was also detected in the insoluble fraction of cells that had been treated with H2O2 (Fig.3 A) or with arsenite or PMA (data not shown). However, except in the case of heat stress, most of the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin was detected in the soluble fraction of the cells. The phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin was not detected in the soluble fraction of cells that had been heated at 43–47 °C for 20 min (Fig. 3 B). αB-Crystallin in cells is converted from a soluble form to an insoluble form soon after heat treatment (13Inaguma Y. Shinohara H. Goto S. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we solubilized the insoluble fractions of cell extracts using 8 m urea and then subjected the resultant mixtures to IEF and subsequent Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.3 B, we detected the heat stress-induced and temperature-dependent phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in the insoluble fraction of U373 MG cells. The arsenite-induced phosphorylation of αB-crystallin was suppressed in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol, whereas the PMA-induced phosphorylation was selectively inhibited by 100 nm staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (Fig.4 A). By contrast, the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin that was stimulated by anisomycin (Fig. 4 B) or by other chemicals (data not shown) was unaffected by the presence of dithiothreitol or staurosporine. However, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB202190 (42Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kemar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar), inhibited the phosphorylation that was induced by arsenite, anisomycin, H2O2, sorbitol, NaCl, and heat, but not the phosphorylation that was induced by PMA and okadaic acid (Fig.5). On the other hand, an inhibitor of p44 MAP kinase kinase, PD98059 (43Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), selectively suppressed the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin inducible by PMA (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation that was induced by anisomycin (Fig. 5) or by each of the other stimuli described above (data not shown) was barely inhibited by the presence of PD98059. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin by the various agents involves different signal transduction cascades.Figure 5Effects of SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, and PD98059, an inhibitor of p44 MAP kinase kinase, on the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin. Cells were exposed, in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 10 μm SB202190 (SB) or 50 μm PD98059 (PD), to 200 μm arsenite, 1 μm PMA, 10 μg/ml anisomycin (AMC), 0.2 μm okadaic acid (OA), 4 mm H2O2, 0.4m sorbitol, 0.15 m NaCl, or heat (45 °C for 30 min) in the standard medium, and soluble extracts of cells (the urea-solubilized extract of pellets in the case of heat-treated cells) were analyzed by IEF and subsequent Western blotting.Control, untreated cells.

This protein has also been shown to cause apoptosis when added to cell free extracts. In this report, we studied the role of cytochrome c (cyto-c) in dexamethasone (Dex), anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb), and ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. The results demonstrate that ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis is associated with an increase in cytosolic cyto-c levels, whereas apoptosis induced by Dex or anti-Fas mAb has no detectable effect on cyto-c release. By contrast, caspase-3 was activated in response to all of these agents. Thus, our findings suggest that Dex or anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis is not accompanied by cyto-c release and that there are at least two different pathways leading to activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells that can be distinguished by accumulation of cytosolic cyto-c.

The cellular response to diverse classes of stress inducers includes growth arrest and activation of apoptosis; however, the intracellular signals that control these events are unclear. Apoptosis is triggered through a controlled program that is associated with distinctive morphological changes including membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, chromatin aggregation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (1Willie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6683) Google Scholar).

Activation of caspases (CPP32, interleukin 1-β converting enzyme, interleukin 1-β converting enzyme homologue-1, and mammalianced-3 homologue-2) and DNA fragmentation are two well characterized biochemical markers of apoptosis. Direct evidence for involvement of caspases in apoptosis is derived from studies with the baculovirus protein p35, which directly inhibits cysteine proteases and blocks activation of apoptosis (7Bump N.J.

Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that mitochondria may play an important role in inducing apoptosis by releasing cyto-c (12Liu X. Kim C.M. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous cyto-c to cytosolic preparations from growing cells activates caspases and also induces DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei (12Liu X. Kim C.M. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown recently that DNA fragmentation factor is also required to mediate apoptosis after activation of caspase 3 (CPP32) (15Liu X. Zon H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). To determine the role of cyto-c in induction of apoptosis, we examined the effect of three distinct stress inducers, IR, Dex, and anti-Fas mAb, in MM.1S multiple myeloma (MM) cell line and patient MM cells. We and others have previously demonstrated that IR, Dex, and Fas trigger apoptosis in MM cells (16Chauhan D. Kharbanda S.M. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Robertson M. Kufe D.W. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Kharbanda S.M. Anderson K.C.

The results of the present study demonstrate that IR, but not Dex and anti-Fas mAb, induces accumulation of cytosolic cyto-c; all of these agents caused apoptosis in these cells. Similar results were obtained when cells from MM patient were treated with these agents. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that in MM cells, there are at least two different pathways that lead to apoptosis in MM cells: one correlated and the other not correlated with release of cyto-c from mitochondria. Human MM.1S multiple myeloma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (20Goldman-Leikin R.E. Salwen H.R. Herst C.V. Variakoji's D. Bian M. Lebeau M. Selvanayayan P. Marder R. Anderson R. Weitzman S. Rosen S.T. J. Lab. Clin. Invest. 1989; 113: 345-355Google Scholar,21Moalli P.A. Pillay S. Weiner D. Leikin R. Rosen S.T. Blood. 1992; 79: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells were isolated from a patient with MM (patient PCL) by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and incubated with HB-7 (anti-CD38) mAb-biotin-streptavidin and 2H4 (anti-CD45RA) mAb-fluorescein isothiocyanate on ice. Tumor cells (96 ± 2% CD38+45RA−) were isolated using an Epics C cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), washed, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. γ-Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gamma-cell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Canada) under aerobic conditions, with a137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 Gy min−1 as determined by dosimetry. Cells were also treated with 10 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) or with 7C11 anti-Fas monoclonal antibody as described previously (16Chauhan D. Kharbanda S.M. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Robertson M. Kufe D.W. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed by the addition of 40% cold ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and treated with RNase (50 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. After treatment with RNase, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 15 μg/ml propidium iodide. Flow cytometric analyses was done using FACScan. MM.1S or patient MM cells were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was suspended in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin and pepstatin A) containing 250 nm sucrose. The cells were homogenized three times in a Dounce homogenizer with a sandpaper-polished pestle. Cytosolic fractions were isolated as described previously (22Kharbanda S.M. Pandey P. Schofield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated from cell lysates by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-cyto-c (23Kirken R.A. Lincoln A.J. Fink P.S. Prochaska L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), anti-CPP32 (Transduction Laboratories), / anti-PKC-δ (Santa Cruz), anti-Tubulin (Sigma), or anti-HSP 60 (Stressgen, Canada) antibodies. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) using the manufacturer's protocol. S-100 cytosolic fractions from untreated MM.1S cells were incubated with anti-cyto-cantibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation. This immunodepletion procedure was repeated twice in the resulting supernatant. The absence of cyto-c in immunodepleted extracts (cyto-c free lysates) was confirmed by Western blotting. Concentrated 10 μl of cyto-c free lysate was incubated with purified cyto-c (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature in 40 μl of buffer A, followed by the addition of 6 × SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were probed with anti-PKC-δ antibodies. To determine induction of apoptosis in MM.1S MM cells by diverse inducers, the cells were treated with 20 Gy of IR, 10 μmDex, or 5 μg/ml of anti-Fas mAb for 48 h and flow cytometric analyses using propidium iodide was performed (16Chauhan D. Kharbanda S.M. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Robertson M. Kufe D.W. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Kharbanda S.M. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with IR results in 71 ± 2% (n = 3) apoptotic cells, whereas Dex and anti-Fas mAb treatment leads to 61 ± 1.6 and 66 ± 3% apoptotic cells (n = 3), respectively. Previous studies have shown that accumulation of cyto-c in the cytosol occurs in response to multiple apoptotic stimuli and plays an important role in inducing apoptosis (12Liu X. Kim C.M. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibardo A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar). To examine whether the release of cyto-c from mitochondria is a universal event during apoptosis, MM.1S MM cells were exposed to IR, Dex, or anti-Fas mAb antibody, and their effects on accumulation of cyto-c in cytosol were analyzed. The cytosolic S-100 fractions were isolated and analyzed for levels of cyto-c. Cytosolic cyto-c levels were increased at 3 and 6 h after irradiation (Fig.1 A). In contrast to IR, cyto-c levels in the cytosol were unchanged during treatment of MM.1S cells with either Dex or anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 1 B and 2A). The IR-induced increase in cytosolic cyto-c was specific, because there was no change in the protein levels of tubulin (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). Similar results were obtained when patient MM (PCL) cells were exposed to IR, Dex, or anti-Fas mAb (Fig.2 B, right and left upper panels, and data not shown). The treatment of PCL patient MM cells did not affect the protein levels, as evidenced by the unaltered tubulin protein levels (Fig. 2 B, right and left lower panels). As an additional control, the blots were reprobed with a specific mitochondrial protein, HSP-60. The results demonstrate undetectable levels of HSP-60 in the S-100 cytosolic fractions (data not shown). These results indicate that the release of cyto-c from mitochondria may be important for triggering apoptosis in response to certain agents, in particular, DNA damaging agents, and that this is not an obligatory event during Dex or anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis in MM cells.Figure 2A, accumulation of cytochromec in response to anti-Fas mAb. MM.1S MM cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of anti-Fas mAb for the indicated times. As a control, cells were also treated with 20 Gy of IR for 6 h. Cytosolic proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody.B, PCL MM patient cells were also treated with 20 Gy of IR or 10 μm of Dex and harvested at the indicated times. Cytosolic proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-tubulin antibody as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Multiple lines of evidence indicate that apoptosis can be triggered by the activation of cysteine proteases, and the most intensively studied apoptotic caspase is CPP32 (caspase-3) (24Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H.J. Poirer G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown in a cell free system that the addition of purified cyto-c to the cyto-c-depleted extracts activates CPP32 and DNA fragmentation (15Liu X. Zon H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Because treatment of MM.1S MM cells with either Dex or anti-Fas mAb activates DNA fragmentation in the absence of cytosolic accumulation of cyto-c, we asked whether CPP32 is cleaved and activated by these inducers. MM.1S MM cells were treated with Dex or anti-Fas mAb, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting either with CPP32 or its known substrate protein kinase C δ (6Emoto Y. Mannome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.W. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate cleavage and activation of CPP32 (as shown by cleavage of PKC-δ) in response to Dex or anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 3, Aand B). Similar results were obtained when MM.1S cells were treated with IR (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, in an in vitro cell free system, the addition of purified cyto-c to the cyto-c immunodepleted MM.1S cytosolic lysates (Fig. 3 C, left panel) showed cleavage of PKC-δ and CPP32 (Fig. 3 C, right panel and data not shown). The results further suggest that MM.1S cytosolic fractions trigger the apoptotic program when cyto-c was added exogeneously. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that cleavage and activation of CPP32 and induction of apoptosis by anti-Fas mAb and Dex in MM.1S cells is not accompanied by the accumulation of cyto-c in the cytosol. The results described above indicate that there are multiple pathways that can trigger the program that leads to apoptosis. The multiplicity and complexity of apoptotic signals do not suggest the same linear pathway. Release of cyto-c from mitochondria to cytosol has been shown to be a potential target for regulation of apoptosis (13Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibardo A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Our results clearly demonstrate that accumulation of cyto-c in cytosol, which is associated with IR-induced apoptosis, is not observed during either Dex- or Fas-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in cyto-c-dependent and -independent induction of apoptosis in MM cells."

Protein kinase activity was detected in precipitates with monoclonal antibody to ganglioside GD3 (R24) from membranal fraction of rat brain. Using in vitro kinase assay, several phosphorylated proteins of 40, 53, 56, and 80 kDa were isolated by gel electrophoresis. Of these proteins, the proteins of 53 and 56 kDa (p53/56) were identified as two isoforms of Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn, based on co-migration during gel electrophoresis, comparative peptide mapping, and sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn antibody. The identification was confirmed using a cDNA expression system in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which express solely ganglioside GM3, the enzymatic substrate of GD3synthase. In co-transfection with GD3 synthase and Lyn expression plasmids, R24 immunoprecipitated Lyn and anti-Lyn antibody immunoprecipitated GD3. R24 treatment of rat primary cerebellar cultures induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, sucrose density gradient analysis showed that Lyn of cerebellum and CHO transfectants were detected in a low density light-scattering band, i.e. the caveolae membrane fraction. R24 immunoprecipitated caveolin from Triton X-100 extract of CHO transfectants. These observations suggest that GD3 may regulate Lyn in a caveolae-like domain on brain cell membranes.

Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of all vertebrate cells and are thought to play functional roles in cellular interactions and control of cell proliferation (1Yamakawa T.

In the nervous system, where gangliosides are especially enriched, the species and amounts of gangliosides undergo profound changes during development, suggesting that they may play fundamental roles in this process (5Rösner H. Al-Aqtum M. Rahmann H. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 20: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The accumulation of gangliosides within the neurons in ganglioside storage disease results in extensive neurite growth (6Purpura D.P. Nature. 1978; 276: 520-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Exogenously administered gangliosides have been shown to accelerate regeneration of the central nervous system in vivo after lesioning (7Toffano G. Savoini G. Moroni F. Lombardi G. Calza L. Agnati L.F. Brain Res. 1983; 261: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous gangliosides or anti-ganglioside antibody to the primary neurons and neuroblastomasin vitro has been shown to stimulate the differentiation with concomitant neurite sprouting and extension (8Roisen F.J.

Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differentiation caused by anti-ganglioside antibody is due to increased cAMP accumulation and activation of protein kinase A (10Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Anderson G.M. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ganglioside could modulate a signaling pathway of neuronal differentiation. However, molecular mechanisms of the ganglioside-dependent neuronal differentiation remain obscure. We have been investigating a biosynthesis of gangliosides during normal neuronal development and oncogenic transformation (12Nakakuma H. Sanai Y. Shiroki K. Nagai Y. J. Biochem.

Ganglioside biosynthesis takes place in the Golgi apparatus, where glucosylceramide is glycosylated by sequential addition of galactose, sialic acid, andN-acetylgalactosamine. Ganglioside GD3 is important as a precursor of the b and c series ganglioside. Recently we isolated GD3 synthase (α2,8-sialyltransferase) cDNA and found that the GD3 synthase expression was regulated in stage- and spatio-restricted manners in the rat central nervous system (17Nara K.

Sanai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GD3 is the predominant ganglioside of the early, immature nervous system of birds and mammals, but its amount decreases in contrast with the accumulation of higher sialylated gangliosides during maturation (21Yu R.K. Macala L.J. Taki T. Weinfield H.M. Yu F.S. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1825-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). GD3 is implicated in cell attachment (22Cheresh D.A. Pierschbacher M.D. Herzig M.A. Mujoo K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and cell-to-cell interactions during embryogenesis (23Sariola H. Aufderheide E.

Non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src subfamily are implicated in signal transduction systems that control cell proliferation and differentiation (24Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 85-113Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated ganglioside GD3 binding proteins from rat brain to clarify the ganglioside-mediated signal transduction and identified two of them as Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn. The mouse IgG3 anti-ganglioside GD3monoclonal antibody R24 was obtained from hybridoma R24(American Type Culture Collection no. HB8445). Anti-Lyn (Lyn8), anti-Fyn (Fyn301), and anti-Yes (3H9) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Anti-Src monoclonal antibody (GD11) was a gift from Dr. Y. Fukui (Faculty of Life Science and Agriculture, University of Tokyo). Anti-Lyn rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 2The abbreviations used are: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DIG, detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched complex. -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was purchased from Zymed (San Francisco, CA). Phosphospecific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antibody was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Triton X-100 and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. Cultures were prepared from cerebella of 7-day-old rats as described by Yuzaki (25Yuzaki M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were isolated by trypsinization, followed by trituration in DNase solution; they were then suspended in Fischer's serum-free medium. Membrane fraction was prepared from adult Wistar rat brain. Brains were homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (0.32 m sucrose 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA) using a Teflon motor-driven glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifugated at 900 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifugated at 11,500 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet of the rat brain or centrifugated cultured cells was solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 20 min. The postnuclear supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. Aliquots (0.5 ml, 750 μg of protein) of the supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl), and then incubated with anti-GD3antibody R24 (2.5 μg) for 1 h and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, washed once with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2), and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was started by addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by autoradiography. In a re-immunoprecipitation experiment, after the kinase reaction the samples were boiled for 5 min in lysis buffer with 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer, and then re-immunoprecipitated with anti-Src family kinase antibodies or R24. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (26Mori A. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Mizuno K. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. Sakai H.

Phosphoprotein radiolabeled with32Pi (p53/56) was eluted from a polyacrylamide gel and hydrolyzed in 6 m hydrochloric acid at 105 °C for 2 h. The hydrolysate was evaporated and resuspended in 50 μl of carrier phosphoamino acid solution containing 1 mmphosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine. The solution was then subjected to cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) with a developing solution consisting of 1-butanol, isopropyl alcohol, formic acid, and water (3:1:1:1). The plate was dried, sprayed with ninhydrin to determine the positions of phosphoamino acids, and then subjected to autoradiography. Rat primary cerebellar cultures were harvested 24 h after seeding by pipetting. The cells were treated first with R24 and then with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected transiently (48 h) with the pME18S expression plasmid (27Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell.

Expression of transgenes was confirmed by immunoblotting. Lyn was not detected endogenously in CHO cells. Although Src was endogenously detected in CHO cells, transient expression greatly enhanced Src. CHO cells express solely the ganglioside GM3, an enzymatic substrate of GD3 synthase. We previously established a CHO cell line, CST, expressing GD3 synthase and synthesizing GD3 constitutively by stable transfection of full-length human GD3 synthase cDNA (20Ogura K. Nara K. Watanabe Y. Kono K. Tai T. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we used CST cells as GD3-positive cells and parental CHOP cells (CHO expressing polyoma large T) as GD3-negative cells (17Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasahara K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of glycosphingolipids was performed using 2 μCi/ml [14C] galactose (300 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) for 24 h. Lipids in immunoprecipitates were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v) by sonication and separated on a silica gel TLC in a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.5% CaCl2 (55/45/10, v/v/v). Cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 20 μg/ml R24 at 37 °C for the indicated times on dish. After washing with ice-cold PBS, lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Lyn antibody and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). Kinase activity was measured by in vitro autophosphorylation. Sucrose density gradient analysis was performed according to the method described (30Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Rat cerebellum or CHO transfectants were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in TNE/Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA). The lysate was brought to 40% sucrose. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in TNE without Triton X-100 was layered over the lysate. Gradients were centrifuged for 16–20 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. Nine fractions were harvested from 5% to 30% sucrose by bottom puncture. Fraction 10 was collected from 40% sucrose. Immunoprecipitates with anti-GD3 antibody (R24) from Triton X-100 extract of adult rat brain membrane were analyzed for the presence of protein kinase activity by an in vitro kinase assay. In vitrokinase reaction resulted in phosphorylation of several proteins of 40, 53, 56, and 80 kDa, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). No kinase activity was detected in R24 precipitates performed in the presence of 30 μmGD3 or in immunoprecipitates with control mouse IgG3. The present study dealt with identification of 53- and 56-kDa proteins (p53/56). The 32P-labeled p53/56 were eluted from SDS-PAGE and hydrolyzed with 6 m hydrochloric acid. The hydrolysate was separated by thin layer chromatography. Radioactivity was detected only in the position of phosphotyrosine (Fig.2).Figure 2Phosphoamino acid analysis of p53/56.The phosphoamino acid of the p53/56 band in in vitro kinase assay was examined. The markers used were phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), phosphothreonine (P-Thr), and phosphoserine (P-Ser).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The molecular weight and tyrosine phosphorylation of p53/56 suggested that it could be a Src family tyrosine kinase. To investigate this possibility, we have compared the SDS-PAGE patterns of in vitro phosphorylated proteins that were immunoprecipitated from membrane fraction of rat brain by antibodies specific to several members of the Src tyrosine kinase family, i.e. Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn, to that of GD3 specific antibody R24. The pattern of phosphorylated proteins obtained with anti-Lyn antibody resembled most closely the protein pattern resulted from R24 immunoprecipitation, with p53/56 migrating exactly as two autophosphorylated splice isoforms, p53 lyn and p56 lyn , of Lyn (Fig. 3 A). Phosphorylation of 40- and 80-kDa proteins were also observed in immunoprecipitates by anti-Lyn antibody. The bands of p53/56 and p53/56 lyn were excised and subjected to comparative peptide mapping after digestion with V8 protease. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the maps of p53/56 and p53/56 lyn appeared indistinguishable. The maps differed from those of Src, Fyn, and Yes (data not shown). The identification was confirmed by sequential immunoprecipitation with R24 and anti-Lyn antibody. The in vitro kinase assay was performed with R24 immunoprecipitates, after which the immune complexes were disrupted by boiling in SDS-containing buffer and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific to Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn. Anti-Lyn antibody, but not anti-Src, -Fyn, or -Yes antibodies, precipitated specifically the p53/56 in re-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3 C). R24 did not precipitate p53/56 after SDS boiling, indicating that R24 does not bind p53/56 directly. The association of Lyn with GD3 was confirmed using a cDNA expression system in CHO cells. GM3(NeuAcα2,3Galβ1, 4Glcβ1,1-ceramide) is the only ganglioside synthesized in CHO cells and is an enzymatic substrate of GD3 synthase. We have previously established an CHO cell line, CST, constitutively expressing GD3 synthase (20Ogura K. Nara K. Watanabe Y. Kono K. Tai T. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both CHO and CST cells were transfected transiently with an expression plasmid carrying cDNA for a p56 splice isoform of Lyn. Lyn activity was co-precipitated by R24 from CST cells that constitutively synthesized GD3, but not from CHO cells (Fig.4 A). In a control transfection with a Src expression plasmid, R24 did not precipitated Src activity in CST cells expressing Src (Fig. 4 B). This finding suggests that R24 does not precipitate the whole membrane protein. To substantiate further the association of Lyn with GD3, CST cells overexpressing p56 lyn were metabolically labeled with [14C]galactose. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn antibody, lipids were extracted from the co-immunoprecipitates and subjected to TLC and autoradiography. 14C-Labeled GD3 was detected in the immunoprecipitate with anti-Lyn antibody, but not with control mouse IgG. 3K. Kasahara, Y. Watanabe, T. Yamamoto, and Y. Sanai, unpublished observation. Therefore, we conclude that ganglioside GD3 associates with Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn in rat brain. Lyn is known to be localized in cerebellar granule cells (31Umemori H. Wanaka A. Kato H. Takeuchi M. Tohyama M. Yamamoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility of GD3-Lyn association in rat primary cerebellar cultures, of which more than 90% are granule cells. Flow cytometric analysis using R24 revealed that GD3was expressed on the cell surface (Fig.5 A). As expected, R24 also co-precipitated Lyn from Triton X-100 extract of the cells (Fig.5 B). To clarify the possibility of GD3-mediated signal transduction via Lyn, we measured Lyn activity in primary cerebellar cultures after treatment with R24. For this, Triton X-100 extracts were prepared from primary cerebellar cultures, which were treated with R24 for 0.5–30 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Lyn antibody. Kinase activity was measured by in vitro autophosphorylation. R24 treatment resulted in a rapid (within 1 min) and significant (3-fold) increase of Lyn activity, with no change in the amount of Lyn protein (Fig. 6). A possible increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins as a result of treatment of rat primary cerebellar cultures with R24 was investigated. After incubation with R24, cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and cell extracts were fractionated into supernatant and particulate fraction. After SDS-PAGE, phosphotyrosines were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Treatment with R24 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the supernatants, including a prominent phosphorylation of a protein of about 80 kDa (Fig. 7). The phosphorylation peaked at 1 min and returned to the control level at 30 min. One of the detected proteins was identified as MAPK, using phosphospecific MAPK antibody. The antibody detects p42 and p44 MAPK only when it is catalytically activated by phosphorylation at Tyr-204. The phosphorylation peaked at 5 min and returned to the control level at 30 min. This observation suggests that R24 stimulates the MAPK cascade via a Lyn signaling pathway. Ganglioside is known to form clusters in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer (32Thompson T.E. Tillack T.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 361-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Lyn anchors on the inner leaflet via N-terminal lipid modification, palmitoylation, and myristoylation (33Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). How does GD3associate with Lyn? The association is probably due to the presence of detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched complex (DIG) or caveolae-like domains on the cell surface of the brain (34Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These complexes are known to be enriched in Src family tyrosine kinase, and can be isolated as a low density light-scattering band by sucrose density gradient analysis. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of Lyn in a sucrose density gradient. Subcellular fractionation of extracts from either rat cerebellum or CST cells transfected with p56 lyn was performed in parallel. Most of Lyn from a rat cerebellum and about 50% of Lyn from CST cells in a 150-mm dish was present in the light scattering band at fractions 3–5 (Fig.8, B and E, respectively). Src from rat cerebellum was detected in the same fractions as Lyn; however, most of the Src from CST cells overexpressing Src in a 150-mm dish was found at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 8, C and F, respectively). This discrepancy probably derives from differences in the protein/detergent ratio during the initial homogenization, as has recently been pointed out (35Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), because most of Lyn and about 70% of Src from the transfectants in 10 150-mm dishes were present in the light scattering band (data not shown). In the CST cells, caveolin (a marker protein of caveolae) was also present in the low density fraction (Fig.8 G). Caveolin was not detected in homogenate of cerebellum (data not shown). We investigated whether R24 immunoprecipitated caveolae of CHO cells. In CHO cells transfected with GD3 synthase, R24 co-precipitated caveolin (Fig. 9). In the present study, we demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody to ganglioside GD3, R24, co-immunoprecipitates Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn from Triton X-100 extracts of rat brain and primary cerebellar cell cultures. This suggests that there is a specific association of Lyn with GD3 on rat brain cell membrane. The main region of the GD3-Lyn association in brain may be cerebellar granule cells. Indeed, both Lyn mRNA and protein are predominantly expressed in the cerebellar granule cells, as has been shown by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (31Umemori H. Wanaka A. Kato H. Takeuchi M. Tohyama M. Yamamoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,36Chen S. Bing R. Rosenblum N. Hillman D.E. Neuroscience. 1996; 71: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The same area expresses GD3 synthase and synthesizes GD3 (19Watanabe Y. Nara K. Takahashi H. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. J. Biochem.

Brain Res. 1996; 732: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); the latter can be detected on the surface of rat primary cerebellar cells by flow cytometric analysis (this study). Binding of R24 to GD3 activated Lyn and induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in rat primary cerebellar cell cultures. This suggests that the GD3-Lyn association is not an artifact of detergent extraction and that GD3could mediate transmembrane signaling in rat cerebellar granule cells via Lyn. Similar observations were reported for human peripheral T cells, where treatment with R24 led to T cell activation associated with rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including phospholipase Cγ, as well as to phosphatidylinositol turnover, calcium flux, Ras activation, cell proliferation, and cytokine secretion. The phosphatidylinositol turnover and cell proliferation can be blocked by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (41Welte K. Miller G. Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Natoli E. Kunicka J.E. Cordon-Cardo C. Buhrer C.

The association of Src family kinase Lyn with gangliosides has also been reported for rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells (44Oliver C. Sahara N. Kitani S. Robbins A.R. Mertz L.M. Siraganian R.P. J.

In this system, a monoclonal antibody AA4, which recognizes α-galactosyl derivatives of ganglioside GD1b on RBL-2H3 cells, co-precipitates Lyn and the IgE receptor. Binding of AA4 leads to activation of Lyn, and subsequent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including phospholipase Cγ1, phosphatidylinositol turnover, calcium flux, activation of protein kinase C and, ultimately, morphological change of RBL-2H3 cells. The effects induced by AA4 on Lyn are similar to those seen following Lyn activation through the IgE receptor. These data suggest that the interaction of Src family kinase with ganglioside could play a role in receptor-mediated signal transduction. Binding of R24 to GD3 in rat primary cerebellar cultures induced phosphorylation of MAPK at Tyr-204, which was shown to be critic"

Empirical support of these models is provided. Parasitoids emanating from a population outbreak of tussock moths ( Orgyia vetusta ) suppressed the growth of nearby experimental populations of the moth, while experimental populations farther away were able to grow. This result explains the observed localized nature of tussock moth outbreaks and illustrates how population distributions can be regulated by dynamic spatial processes."
https://openalex.org/W2044708260,"Vacuolar-type (V) ATPases are thought to be the main determinant of phagosomal acidification. In phagosomes containing mycobacteria, which ostensibly impair the delivery of V-ATPases to the phagosomal membrane, the pH would be expected to be near neutral. This prediction was tested by microfluorescence ratio imaging using macrophages from mice susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Although less acidic than their counterparts containing dead bacteria, phagosomes containing live Mycobacteria bovis were nearly 1 pH unit more acidic than the cytosol, suggesting the existence of alternate H+ transport mechanisms. We therefore investigated whether Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) contributes to phagosomal acidification. Immunoblotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and pharmacological studies indicated that NHE1 is the predominant isoform of the exchanger in macrophages. Fractionation revealed that NHE1 is incorporated into the phagosomal membrane, and measurements of pH indicated that it is functional in this location. Nevertheless, acidification of the lumen of phagosomes containing either latex beads or live M. bovis was insensitive to (3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)-guanidine methanesulfonate, a potent inhibitor of NHE1. This may have been due to the absence of an appropriate lumen to cytosol Na+ gradient, because the phagosomal membrane was found to be devoid of Na+/K+ pumps. Unexpectedly, the acidification of M. bovis phagosomes was fully reversed by specific inhibitors of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, suggesting that ATPases are present only transiently or in reduced quantities in the phagosomal membrane.

Leukocytes internalize invading pathogens into a membrane-bound organelle called the phagosome. The microbes are initially encircled by extensions of the plasmalemma, and the resulting nascent phagosome subsequently matures upon fusion with endosomes, lysosomes, and possibly other vesicular compartments (1Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Shwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J.

Acidification of the phagosomal interior is a critical component of the microbicidal response; not only is the low pH directly toxic to many microorganisms but, in addition, lytic enzymes secreted into the phagosomal lumen function optimally at acidic pH. Phagosomal acidification has been attributed principally to the activity of vacuolar type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases), 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPases, vacuolar type H+-ATPases; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; NHS-CF,N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein; HOE 694, (3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)-guanidine methanesulfonate; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pH o , extracellular pH; pH i , intracellular pH; pH p , phagosomal pH; BCG, bacillus Calmette-Guerin strain ofM. bovis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). which have been shown to accumulate in the phagosomal membrane as it matures within the cell (1Pitt A.

The importance of V-ATPase-mediated acidification to microbial elimination is highlighted by the failure of macrophages to kill organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This and other species of mycobacteria avoid acid-mediated degradation by preventing insertion of H+ pumps into the phagosomal membrane (5Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Chakraborty P. Haddix P.L. Collins H.L. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. Gluck S.L. Heuser J. Russell D.G. Science. 1994; 263: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 6Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the growth of mycobacteria ceases at pH <6.2 (7Oh Y.K. Straubinger R.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 319-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that their ability to modulate phagosomal pH is an important determinant of intracellular survival. Despite the ostensible absence of V-ATPases, phagosomes containing live mycobacteria were noted to be significantly more acidic than the extracellular or cytosolic milieu (i.e. pH 6.2versus 7.0–7.4) (5Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Chakraborty P. Haddix P.L. Collins H.L. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. Gluck S.L. Heuser J. Russell D.G. Science. 1994; 263: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). This observation suggests the existence of additional mechanisms of phagosomal acidification. Because fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes with the phagosome is inhibited in cells infected with mycobacteria (6Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 8de Chastellier C. Lang T. Thilo L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 167-182PubMed Google Scholar, 9de Chastellier C. Frehel C. Offredo C. Skamene E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3775-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that plasmalemmal transporters, internalized during phagosome formation, may contribute to the V-ATPase-independent acidification. A possible candidate for early phagosomal acidification is the Na+/H+ exchanger, or NHE. This antiporter is present in the plasma membrane of virtually all mammalian cells, where it catalyzes the electroneutral exchange of one Na+ for one H+ (10Grinstein S. Rothstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 11Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. Shock. 1996; 5: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The exchange reaction, which is characteristically susceptible to inhibition by amiloride and its analogs, is driven by the concentration gradients of these ions and does not require direct expenditure of metabolic energy (12Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the inward Na+ gradient generated by the Na+/K+-ATPase drives H+ out of the cell. Because it is constitutively present in the surface membrane, it is likely that the NHE is incorporated into the phagosomal membrane during microbial internalization. At the phagosomal membrane, its forward activity would exchange Na+, taken up from the extracellular space during phagocytosis, for cytosolic H+, resulting in phagosomal acidification. On thermodynamic grounds, the NHE could support an acidification of up to 2 pH units, provided that intraphagosomal Na+ was maintained at extracellular levels. This could in turn be accomplished by the continued operation of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which might be similarly internalized upon phagosome formation. In this regard, the Na+/K+-ATPase is known to be incorporated into endocytic compartments where it can remain functional, as judged by its effects on endosomal pH (13Fuchs R. Schmid S. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Cain C.C. Sipe D.M. Murphy R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3469-3474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present experiments were performed to define the mechanisms contributing to the acidification of phagosomes containing live mycobacteria. Specifically, we assessed if the NHE is in fact internalized into phagosomes and whether it contributes to the early stages of phagosomal acidification. We also examined the presence and activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, to define if a suitable ionic gradient would be available for sustained NHE function in the phagosome. Finally, we considered whether V-ATPases may play a direct or indirect role in the acidification of phagosomes containing live mycobacteria.

Polyclonal antibodies to the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger were raised by injecting rabbits with a fusion protein containing the last 157 residues (658–815) of the human homologue as described (16Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to the 39-kDa subunit of the V-ATPase were raised by injecting rabbits with a fusion protein encoding the entire subunit. Antibodies directed against the α1, α2, and β1 subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase were generously provided by Dr. M. J. Caplan (Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Monoclonal antibodies to LAMP-2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein-2) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, maintained by the University of Iowa and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD) (17Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-rat IgG were obtained from Bio-Rad. Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). PBS consisted of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 10 KCl, 8 sodium phosphate, 2 potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The Na+-rich medium used in the Na+ loading experiments contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 glucose, 15 Hepes, pH 7.4. The Na+-free medium contained the same salts, but Na+ was substituted byN-methyl-d-glucammonium. The K+-rich medium had the same composition as Na+ medium, yet NaCl was replaced by KCl. In all cases the osmolarity was set to 290 ± 5 mosm with the major salt. The murine cell line J774 was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc.) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the Mycobacterium-susceptible mice strain C57BL/6 (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) as described (18Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the peritoneal cavities of 6–8-week-old mice were lavaged with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells, comprising approximately 30% macrophages as determined by Wright staining, were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in Hepes-buffered medium RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were then incubated with bacteria as described below and plated on glass coverslips. Non-adherent cells (predominantly lymphocytes) were removed by washing with fresh medium. M. bovis strain BCG, sub-strain Montreal (BCG), was obtained from the Armand Frappier Institute (Laval, Quebec, Canada) and maintained as described (19Forget A. Skamene E. Gros P. Miailhe A.C. Turcotte R. Infect. Immun. 1981; 32: 42-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, one pelicule cultured on Sauton medium for 21 days was homogenized to 100 mg/ml and frozen at −80 °C. Prior to infecting macrophages, freshly cultured bacteria were passaged for 1 week in Dubos liquid medium at 37 °C. Where indicated, BCG were killed by boiling for 5 min. For fluorescence determinations, cells were plated to 60–70% confluence on glass coverslips. To measure pH i , they were incubated with 2 μg/ml BCECF acetoxymethyl ester for 15 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence of BCECF was measured essentially as in Ref. 20Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Nathans A.B. Watson R.W.F. Marshall J.C. Rotstein O.D. Arch. Surg. 1996; 131: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Briefly, the coverslip was placed in a thermostatted Leiden holder on the stage of a Zeiss IM-35 microscope with a 63 ×, 1.4 N.A. oil-immersion objective. A Sutter filter wheel was used to alternately position the two excitation filters (500 ± 10 and 440 ± 10 nm) in front of a xenon lamp. To minimize dye bleaching and photodynamic damage, neutral density filters were used to reduce the intensity of the light reaching the cells. The excitation light was directed to the cells via a 510-nm dichroic mirror, and fluorescence emission was collected by a 535 ± 25 nm bandpass filter. Data were recorded every 30 s by irradiating the cells for 50 ms at each of the excitation wavelengths. Images were captured with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., NJ). Image acquisition was controlled by the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.), operating on a Pentium Dell computer (Dell Inc., Canada). The resulting ratio images were displayed on-line, and regions of interest encompassing individual cells were defined. Calibration of the fluorescence ratio versus pH was performed for each experiment by equilibrating the cells in isotonic K+-rich medium buffered to varying pH values (between 7.45 and 6.0) in the presence of the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin (5 μm). Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the extracellular pH, assumed to be identical to the internal pH, against the corresponding fluorescence ratio (21Grinstein S. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C283-C291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure forward NHE activity, the cytoplasm was acid-loaded by incubation with 50 mm NH4Cl during the last 10 min of loading with BCECF, followed by three rapid washes with NH4Cl- and Na+-free solution. The cells were then exposed to Na+-containing solutions, as specified in the text. Reverse NHE activity was measured by perfusing Na+-loaded cells in Na+-free media. Cytosolic Na+ loading was attained by incubating the cells in Na+-rich medium containing 1 mm ouabain for 1 h at 23 °C. The cells were stained with BCECF during the last 10 min of the Na+-loading procedure. Reverse NHE activity was initiated by perfusing the cells with K+-rich medium at pH 6.0 or 7.4. Measurements of pH p were obtained through the combined application of video microscopy and fluorescence ratio imaging. J774 cells plated on glass coverslips or suspended peritoneal macrophages from C57/BL6 mice were exposed to opsonized, fluoresceinated latex beads (3 μm diameter, Sigma) or BCG, respectively. Latex particles were opsonized by incubation in fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times in PBS, and then labeled by incubation in fluorescein isothiocyanate (2 mg/ml in PBS, pH 8.0) for 1 h 37 °C. BCG were washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 to promote disaggregation, and then labeled by incubation in NHS-CF (0.1 mg/ml) on ice for 30 min. This procedure was shown earlier to have no measurable effects on cellular uptake or bacterial viability (7Oh Y.K. Straubinger R.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 319-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After repeated washing to remove unbound fluorescent label, particles were suspended in PBS containing 5 mm glucose and added to cells at a ratio of approximately 10 particles/cell for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, bafilomycin, concanamycin, or HOE 694 was present during this incubation. Peritoneal macrophages were then plated on glass coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for adherence to occur. For pH measurement, the coverslips were mounted on the Leiden chamber as above, and excitation was alternated at 490 and 440 nm for 250 ms, capturing images at 1-min intervals. The sample was continuously illuminated at 620 nm by placing a red filter in front of the transmitted incandescent source. By placing an additional dichroic mirror in the light path, the red light was directed to a video camera, allowing continuous visualization of cell morphology and of the course of phagocytosis by digital interference contrast microscopy, while the fluorescent light was directed onto a 535 ± 25 nm emission filter placed in front of the cooled CCD camera used for fluorescence detection (see Ref. 22Demaurex N. Downey G.P. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar for details). Calibration of fluorescence ratioversus pH p was obtained in situ as above using KCl and nigericin. A representative experiment designed to determine the pH of phagocytosed particles is illustrated in Fig.1, which proceeds sequentially from top to bottom. The colorimetric pH scale to the right of the figure provides an assessment of the particle pH as displayed in the pseudocolor ratio image. Because not all the particles that associate with cells become internalized, it was essential to identify those beads or bacteria that underwent phagocytosis. Because differential interference contrast microscopy could not reliably discriminate between extra- and intracellular beads or bacteria, three functional criteria were used routinely. First, the pH of particles within phagosomes was elevated by addition of bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the V-ATPase (Fig. 1), or NH4Cl (not shown), which traverses the plasma and phagosomal membranes as NH3 and becomes protonated in the phagosomal lumen. Neither bafilomycin nor NH4Cl are expected to affect extracellular beads. Second, abrupt changes in extracellular pH affected extracellular beads but had no acute effect on intraphagosomal particles (Fig. 1). Finally, addition of nigericin altered pH p but had no effect on extracellular beads. Therefore, sensitivity to added NH4Cl or to extracellular acidification was used routinely to identify intraphagosomal particles. The buffering power of the phagosome and cytosol were determined fluorimetrically. Cytosolic measurements were made in BCECF-loaded cells, whereas phagosomal measurements were made in separate cells that had phagocytosed fluoresceinated particles, as detailed above. Following stabilization of cytosolic or phagosomal pH, rapid alkalinization was induced by addition of defined concentrations of NH4Cl, and the new pH i or pH p was determined. The buffering capacity of the compartment studied was calculated as detailed elsewhere and is expressed as mmol/pH unit/liter (23Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). The cellular content of Na+ was determined by flame photometry, using Li+ as an internal standard. After the indicated treatment (see “Results”), adherent cells were washed three times in ice-cold medium containing 140 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm Hepes, titrated to pH 7.3 with Tris-Cl. Cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of the same solution. An aliquot was taken for the determination of cell number and volume using a Coulter counter-Channelyzer (Coulter Inc., Hialeah, FL), and the remaining cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 15 mm Li+ standard solution. Samples were analyzed in a model 443 flame photometer (Instrumentation Laboratories, Lexington, MA) and compared with Na+ standards. To obtain a microsomal fraction, 1.5 × 107cells were sedimented (250 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mmsucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Homogenization was performed by 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, at which time approximately 90% of cells were broken as monitored by microscopy. The resulting homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was sedimented at 100,000 ×g for 1 h yielding the “microsomal fraction.” Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (BCA assay, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A plasma membrane preparation was obtained by a slight modification of the method of Lutz et al. (24Lutz D.A. Chen C. McLaughlin B.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). J774 cells plated on 10-cm Petri dishes were sheared by squirting shearing buffer (0.1m Tris-Cl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7) through a 10-ml syringe with an 18-gauge needle oriented at a 45° angle to the surface of the dish, until no intact cells were detected by light microscopy. Cell membranes still adherent to the dish were then scraped into 100 μl of 1/5 × Laemmli's sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) and concentrated 5-fold by lyophilization. Typically, 15 Petri dishes were used per preparation. Protein concentration was then determined by the method of Lowryet al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitation of proteins using 10% trichloroacetic acid. A phagosomal fraction was obtained as described (2Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on 10-cm Petri dishes until they reached approximately 80% confluence. Latex beads (0.8 μm diameter blue dyed, Sigma) were added to the cells, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold PBS plus protease inhibitors (10 min each, with continuous shaking) and disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer until approximately 90% of cells were broken as assessed by light microscopy. The homogenate was next subjected to centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was mixed with 60% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4 and applied to the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of the following steps: 10, 25, 35, and 40% sucrose-imidazole, 2 ml each. The gradient was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the phagosome fraction was collected from the 10–25% interphase. This was added to 15 ml of PBS and sedimented at 40,000 × g for 15 min. The phagosomal pellet was solubilized for immunoblotting following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purity was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, as described (18Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Protean II minigel system (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then immersed in blocking buffer (0.25% gelatin, 10% ethanolamine, 1 m Tris, pH 9.0) for 2 h. Blots were incubated with primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C (antibodies to V-ATPase, NHE1 and the α1, α2, and β1 subunits of the Na+-K+ ATPase were used at a 1:1000 titer, whereas LAMP2 antibodies were used at 1:4). The blots were then washed three times for 10 min each in antibody buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5). Blots were next incubated with anti-rabbit IgG for V-ATPase, NHE1, and the β1 subunits of the Na+-K+ ATPase (titer, 1:10000), anti-mouse IgG for the α1 and α2 subunits of the Na+-K+ATPase, or anti-rat IgG (titer, 1:10,000) for anti-LAMP2. Membranes were washed and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was isolated from ≅106 cells by guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction, based on the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 162: 156-165Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by affinity chromatography with an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). J774 mRNA was then reverse-transcribed, and the complementary DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) and a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler model 480. After completion of the PCR reaction (35 cycles), a 10-ml sample of the PCR tube was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel pre-stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide, and the gel was photographed under UV illumination. For illustration, the photograph was scanned and labeled using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Inc, Mountain View, CA). Four isoform-specific sets of primers were used, which hybridized to unique regions of the rat NHE1, NHE2, NHE3, and NHE4. Primers were as follows: NHE1, 5′ primer, CCT ACG TGG AGG CCA AC; 3′ primer, CAG CCA ACA GGT CTA CC; size of the PCR product, 429 base pairs (bp); NHE2, 5′ primer, GCT GTC TCT GCA GGT GG; 3′ primer, CGT TGA GCA GAG ACT CG; size of PCR product, 680 bp; NHE3, 5′ primer, CTT CTT CTA CCT GCT GC; 3′ primer, CAA GGA CAG CAT CTC GG; size of PCR product, 574 bp; NHE4, 5′ primer, CTG AGC TCT GTG GCT TC; 3′ primer, C GAG GAA ATG CAG CAG C; size of PCR product, 381 bp. All four sets of primers yielded the expected PCR products when linearized pCMV plasmids containing the full-length clone of the corresponding isoform were used as a template but did not yield discernible products when any of the other isoforms was used as template. Immunofluorescence studies were performed on peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice that had phagocytosed live M. bovis essentially as described (28Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W.-J. Schreiber A. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were allowed to internalize mycobacteria that had been labeled with NHS-CF (0.01 mg/ml) as above. The concentration of NHS-CF was one-tenth that used for fluorescence ratio imaging studies, to prevent any green fluorescence from crossing over into the rhodamine filter set. Cells were fixed for 3 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and then washed in PBS containing 100 mmglycine for 10 min. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at 22 °C, washed in ice-cold PBS, and blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with a 1/100 dilution of the polyclonal antibody raised to the 39-kDa subunit of the V-ATPase, followed by a 1/1000 dilution of Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The immunoreactivity of the anti-39-kDa antibody was eliminated by preincubation with the antigenic purified fusion protein for 1 h at room temperature, confirming its specificity. After staining, cells were mounted using Slow Fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was analyzed using a Leica Model TCS4D (Heidelberg, Germany) laser confocal microscope with a 63 × objective. Composites of confocal images were assembled and labeled using Photoshop and Illustrator software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). All experiments were performed at least four times. Representative confocal images are displayed where appropriate. To assess the affinity and specificity of the NHE1 antibody, positive controls consisted of human platelets and NHE1-transfected Chinese hamster fibroblasts lacking endogenous exchanger, which were obtained as described (29Pouyssegur J.

The secretin encoded by filamentous phage f1 was purified. Mass determination of individual molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed two forms, a unit multimer composed of about 14 subunits and a multimer dimer. The secretin is roughly cylindrical and has an internal diameter of about 80 angstroms, which is large enough to accommodate filamentous phage (diameter of 65 angstroms)."
https://openalex.org/W2149217788,"Mantle-derived xenoliths from the Cameroon Line and northern Tanzania display differences in their platinum-group element (PGE) abundance patterns. The Cameroon Line lherzolites have uniform PGE patterns indicating a homogeneous upper mantle over several hundreds of kilometers, with approximately chondritic PGE ratios. The PGE patterns of the Tanzanian peridotites are similar to the PGE systematics of ultramafic rocks from ophiolites. The differences can be explained if the northern Tanzanian lithosphere developed in a fluid-rich suprasubduction zone environment, whereas the Cameroon Line lithosphere only experienced melt extraction from anhydrous peridotites."

The carbohydrate antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody HNK-1 was originally described as a marker for human natural killer cells (1Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunology. 1981; 127: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Later it was shown to be expressed predominantly on glycolipids and glycoproteins from nervous tissue (2McGarry R.C. Helfand S.L. Quarles R.H.

The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope is carried by many, but not all, neural recognition glycoproteins and is involved in homo- and heterophilic binding of these proteins (for a review, see Ref. 12Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Of special interest is the association of the epitope with Schwann cells myelinating motor but not sensory axons (10Löw K. Orberger G. Schmitz B. Martini R. Schachner M. Eur. J.

Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The key enzymes in the biosynthesis of HNK-1 carbohydrates are a glucuronyltransferase (20Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol.

A cDNA encoding the glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of at least the HNK-1 glycoprotein epitope has recently been cloned (23Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A.

We describe here the cloning of a cDNA coding for a sulfotransferase active on terminal glucuronic acid residues and whose expression can render cells immunoreactive with HNK-1 antibody when cotransfected with a glucuronyltransferase cDNA. CHOP2 cells (24Cummings L. Warren C.E. Granovsky M. Dennis J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were grown in minimal essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 (all from Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland). For transfections, G418 was omitted. Hybridoma supernatants containing antibodies HNK-1 (mouse, Ref. 1Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunology. 1981; 127: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar) and L2–412 (rat, Ref. 4Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) were produced as described(18) and used without further purification. The glucuronyltransferase cDNA was in the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (23Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from cerebral cortex of newborn rats was converted to double-stranded cDNA using a kit from Stratagene, and a 1–3 kb fraction prepared by gel electrophoresis was cloned into the vector pXMD1 (25Kluxen F.-W. Bruns C. Lübbert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4618-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Plates with transformed colonies were replicated to nitrocellulose filters, which were then further processed for storage as filter “sandwiches” at −80 °C (26Hanahan D. Meselson M. Gene. 1980; 10: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Bacteria remaining on the plates were regrown overnight and collected for preparation of plasmid DNA. Subpools were prepared by cutting replica sandwiches into 10–12 pieces and regrowing the bacteria from one side of the sandwich. For production of a fusion protein, the sulfotransferase cDNA downstream from the MscI site at nucleotide 319 (see below) was subcloned into the filled EcoRI site of plasmid pPROTA (27Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments, 2 parts of test plasmids were supplemented with 1 part plasmid coding for glucuronyltransferase (23Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CHOP2 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (28Kluxen F.-W. Lübbert H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but without chloroquine treatment. Glutaraldehyde-fixed monolayers of transfected cells were stained with HNK-1 or L2–412 antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse for HNK-1 and goat anti-rat for L2–412, both from Jackson ImmunoResearch) and color development with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. CHOP2 cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline 2 days after transfection with the sulfotransferase cDNA plasmid. After centrifugation, the cells from an 80-cm2 flask were taken up in 250 μl of 100 mm Bis-TRIS, pH 6.6, containing mixed protease inhibitors (chymostatin/pepstatin A/leupeptin/antipain/aprotinin, all at 10 μg/ml). Aliquots were stored at −20 °C and only thawed once. Cerebral cortex of 7-day-old rats was homogenized in the same buffer (25% w/v) and similarly aliquoted. The sulfotransferase assays were done in 100 mm Bis-TRIS (pH 6.6), 10 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, and 0.1% Triton X-100, in a final volume of 20 μl including 10 μl of the transfected cell homogenate (50 μg protein) or 5 μl of 25% brain homogenate (30 μg protein), 100 pmol of [35S]PAPS 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; Galβ-pNP, 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose; GlcAβ1→3Galβ-R, 2-heptanoylamidoethyl-(3-O-β-d-glucuronyl)-β-d-galactose; GlcAβ-pNP, 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronic acid; HPTLC, high performance-thin layer chromatography; EST, expressed sequence tag. (900 Bq; from New England Nuclear, diluted with unlabeled PAPS from Sigma), and 10 nmol of acceptor substrate. The acceptors used were 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose (Galβ-pNP), 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronic acid (GlcAβ-pNP) (both Fluka) or 2-heptanoylamidoethyl-(3-O-β-d-glucuronyl)-β-d-galactose (GlcAβ1→3Galβ-R). 2A. V. Kornilov, L. O. Kononov, A. A. Sherman, and N. E. Nifant'ev, unpublished data. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with mild shaking. Then 100 μl of 4:6, water:methanol was added to the samples and centrifuged, and the residue was re-extracted with 100 μl of 1:1 water:methanol. Combined supernatants were dried, redissolved in 10 μl of 1:1, water:methanol, and run on aluminum-supported HPTLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) in 5:4:1, chloroform:methanol:0.25% KCl/water. Activity was assessed using a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) or by autoradiography. For the protein A fusion protein, the medium of transfected cells was replaced 1 day after transfection by medium with 5% low immunoglobulin calf serum (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) and incubated for 2 more days. The medium (20 ml) was filtered (5 μm) and incubated overnight with 100 μl of human IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) after addition of 0.05% sodium azide and mixed protease inhibitors (see above). The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of 100 mm Bis-TRIS, pH 6.6, containing 0.05% sodium azide, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then stored in this buffer at 4 °C in the same volume as the cell pellets. Assays were carried out directly with the beads as with cell homogenates, except that Triton X-100 was omitted. For expression screening, we used the cell line CHOP2 (24Cummings L. Warren C.E. Granovsky M. Dennis J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a derivative of the Lec2 cell line (29Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that lacks the CMP-sialic acid transporter. This mutation results in an increase in glycoproteins and glycolipids terminating in β4-galactose, potentially increasing the amount of substrate available to the glucuronyl and subsequently acting sulfotransferase. Transfection of CHOP2 cells with the recently cloned glucuronyltransferase (23Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) indeed led to very clear surface staining of the cells with antibody L2–412, which recognizes the nonsulfated form of the carbohydrate (Fig.1 E). Plasmid DNA from 40 pools of 5,000–10,000 cerebral cortex cDNA clones was cotransfected with the glucuronyltransferase cDNA. Two days after transfection, the monolayers were stained with HNK-1, and the number of colored cells in each plate was scored. In one pool, about 20 positive cells were seen, indicating the sulfotransferase was expressed in these cells (Fig. 1 A). In two rounds of subdividing positive pools, the number of positive cells increased first to several hundred (Fig. 1 B) and then to several percent of all cells (Fig. 1 C). A single clone isolated from the last pool gave, upon cotransfection, HNK-1-positive cells at about the same frequency as seen when cells were transfected with glucuronyltransferase cDNA alone and stained with antibody L2–412 (Fig. 1, D and E). This isolated cDNA clone, therefore, is likely to encode the HNK-1 sulfotransferase. The HNK-1 reactivity after transfection with the sulfotransferase cDNA is dependent on the presence of the glucuronyltransferase. Only a very faint HNK-1 reactivity, but clearly higher than in mock transfected cells, is seen after transfection with the sulfotransferase alone (Fig. 1 F). Western blotting of proteins isolated from transfected cells (Fig.2) confirms these results. Mock transfected cells gave no signal with L2–412 or HNK-1, cells transfected with glucuronyltransferase cDNA alone showed only L2–412 reactive proteins, and cells transfected with both glucuronyltransferase and sulfotransferase cDNAs were positive with both antibodies. Faint staining of probably a single protein is seen with both L2–412 and HNK-1 in blots of proteins from cells transfected with only the sulfotransferase cDNA (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 3), suggesting that Chinese hamster ovary cells already expose a low level of acceptor that can be used by the transfected sulfotransferase. This protein is presumably responsible for the faint HNK-1 immunostaining seen on whole cells transfected only with sulfotransferase cDNA. The presence of sulfotransferase activity was confirmed by enzyme assays in vitro. Sulfotransferase activity was determined with Galβ-pNP, GlcAβ-pNP, and GlcAβ1→3Galβ-R as acceptors (Fig. 3). Homogenates of cells transfected with the isolated sulfotransferase clone showed activity toward GlcAβ-pNP and GlcAβ1→3Galβ1-R, but not to Galβ-pNP. Homogenates of mock-transfected cells gave no sulfotransferase activity; cerebral cortex homogenate could use both GlcAβ-pNP and Galβ-pNP as acceptor, suggesting the presence of more than one sulfotransferase in this tissue. The sulfotransferase activity toward the disaccharide acceptor GlcAβ1→3Galβ-R in brain as measured from panel A, lane 4, is 154 pmol/mg-h, very close to the maximal activity measured by Chou and Jungalwala (22Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 330-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a glycolipid acceptor. Transfected CHOP2 cells show an activity of 80 pmol/mg-h. There was no increase in activity with longer oligosaccharides (data not shown), and activity toward GlcAβ-pNP was about 5 times lower in both rat brain and CHOP2 cells. The enzyme encoded by the cloned cDNA is therefore able to perform the same transfer of sulfate to terminal β-linked GlcA residues as measured in rat cerebral cortex. To more conclusively demonstrate that the isolated cDNA clone encodes the sulfotransferase itself, we produced a fusion protein that could be readily separated from other cellular components. The part of the cDNA encoding the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains was replaced by DNA encoding protein A preceded by a signal sequence. Fusion protein secreted into the medium was captured on human IgG-agarose beads, and sulfotransferase activity was determined (Fig.3 D). Activity was found with the bound protein A fusion protein, but not when the sulfotransferase cDNA was cloned in the reverse orientation or when the protein A moiety was absent. The measured enzyme activity produced per cell is about twice as high for the secreted protein A fusion as for the membrane-bound sulfotransferase measured in cell homogenates. The cloned 2649-base pair cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 356 amino acids (Fig.4). The protein probably is a type II transmembrane protein, as a potential transmembrane region is observed close to the N terminus, and the enzymatic activity is expected to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi lumen. No significant sequence similarity was observed between the translation product of the cloned cDNA and any known protein. More than ten overlapping human ESTs were found that potentially encode the human homolog of the cloned rat sulfotransferase. Several other ESTs showed a much lower similarity with the rat cDNA clone and may encode two different homologs of the human gene, indicating that there probably is a human gene family of at least three members. Several cDNAs encoding enzymes involved in glycosylation have been isolated by expression cloning (30Fukuda M. Bierhuizen M.F.A. Nakayama J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The most often used technique is panning and plasmid recovery from transfected mammalian cells. However, although the panning procedure will enrich the desired plasmid, after one or several rounds of panning, recovered plasmids are still divided into pools and tested for expression of the sugar epitope (sibling selection) (30Fukuda M. Bierhuizen M.F.A. Nakayama J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found it much more efficient to directly start a sibling selection procedure. The cloned sulfotransferase cDNA was shown to induce HNK-1 reactivity in CHOP2 cells only in combination with a glucuronyltransferase, indicating that these two enzymes, together with common enzymes already present in CHOP2 cells, are required and sufficient for the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope on glycoproteins. It is, however, not known if these two enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of all HNK-1 carbohydrate epitopes observed in nervous tissue. While the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope in nervous tissues is only observed on a limited number of proteins (11Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), very many proteins seem to carry the epitope after expression of the enzymes in CHOP2 cells. The situation in CHOP2 cells may be abnormal, owing to lack of competition for acceptor by other enzymes, such as sialyltransferases and fucosyltransferases. In vitro sulfotransferase assays showed that the cloned cDNA encodes an enzyme capable of transferring sulfate from PAPS to acceptor substrates containing terminal GlcA. The disaccharide GlcAβ1→3Galβ-R is as good an acceptor as the complete glycolipid used previously to characterize the natural enzyme(22), and the acceptor preferences of the enzyme encoded by the cloned cDNA parallel those seen with brain homogenate. The cloned enzyme therefore seems potentially capable of synthesizing the known HNK-1 structures on glycolipids and glycoproteins (15Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C. Quarles R.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11717-11725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W.E.M. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the cloned sulfotransferase showed no significant sequence similarity to other sulfotransferases, not even to the recently cloned sulfatide sulfotransferase (33Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. Tokyo. 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme transfers sulfate from PAPS to the C-3 of galactose residues, a reaction very similar to that of the HNK-1 sulfotransferase, expected to transfer the sulfate to C-3 of GlcA residues. As cytoplasmic sulfotransferases that use various substrates all have some sequence similarity (34Rikke B.A. Roy A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it might be expected that sulfotransferases acting on carbohydrate structures would also be structurally related. This is, however, not found among the enzymes whose cDNAs have been cloned so far. These comprise two different N-heparan sulfate sulfotransferases (35Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Eriksson I. Sandback D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing 70% sequence identity with each other, chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (37Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), sulfatide sulfotransferase (33Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. Tokyo. 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the HNK-1 sulfotransferase. However, all these enzymes show the same membrane topology and are predicted to be type II membrane proteins with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a larger luminal catalytic domain. This structure is typical of Golgi glycosyltransferases(38Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several human ESTs are very similar to the cloned rat HNK-1 sulfotransferase cDNA, and probably encode the same enzyme in humans. Surprisingly, no such mouse ESTs are present in the data bases. Further ESTs, both human and mouse, are found that may encode more distant relatives of the enzyme. Although these transcripts can of course encode completely different enzymes, it is interesting that for both the HNK-1 glucuronyltransferase (23Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the HNK-1 sulfotransferase a family of related genes seems to exist. A similar situation may occur as for the fucosyltransferase gene family (39Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Oriol R. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 1995; 2: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), wherein the enzymes differ only slightly in acceptor specificity. Such variations might be responsible for at least some of the marked differences observed in developmental and spatial patterns of HNK-1 immunostaining when different species are compared (7Holley J.A. Yu R.K. Dev Neurosci. 1987; 9: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The availability of clones for both a glucuronyltransferase and a sulfotransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope will greatly enhance studies on the regulation of the expression of these carbohydrate structures. The enzymes can be used to produce substantial amounts of HNK-1 carbohydrate, allowing more detailed testing than heretofore possible of its role in the nervous system.

Such phosphorylation is most likely regulated by the Type I interferon receptor (IFNR)-associated Tyk-2 kinase, as suggested by the detection of Type I IFN-dependent tyrosine kinase activity in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates and the IFNα-dependent association of CrkL with Tyk-2 in intact cells. Two other Type I IFNs, IFNβ and IFNω, also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL, suggesting that the protein is involved in the signaling pathways of several different Type I IFNs.

These proteins function as adapters, linking tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or their substrates to downstream signaling elements. CrkL has one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains (21Ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1994; 8: 2469-2474Google Scholar) that mediate its cellular interactions with other proteins. There is accumulating evidence that CrkL associates with C3G (22Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M. Gold M.R. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation is most likely regulated by the Tyk-2 kinase, as suggested by the IFNα-dependent association of CrkL with Tyk-2 in vivo. We also demonstrate that in the IFNα-sensitive U-266 and Daudi cell lines, CrkL interacts with C3G via its N terminus SH3 domain, suggesting that CrkL links the functional Type I IFNR complex to the C3G-Rap-1 growth inhibitory pathway.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe initially performed studies in which the IFNα-sensitive U-266 and Daudi cell lines were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα, the cells were lysed, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CrkL antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in an SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine. A 36-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, corresponding to CrkL, was clearly detectable in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from IFNα-treated U-266 or Daudi cells (Fig. 1,A and C). Stripping and reprobing the blots with the anti-CrkL antibody confirmed that equal amounts of the CrkL protein were present prior to and after IFNα stimulation (Fig. 1,B and D). Similarly, IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL was seen in studies using Molt-4, HL-60, and 293T cells. 2S. Ahmad, Y. Alsayed, T. Rana, and L. C. Platanias, unpublished data. We subsequently determined the kinetics and dose dependence of the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL. IFNα induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein within 1 min of treatment of U-266 cells. The signal was present at 5 min and declined to base-line levels at 30–90 min, suggesting that such phosphorylation is rapid and transient (Fig. 2, A andB). The IFNα-induced phosphorylation of the protein was also dose-dependent (Fig. 2 C) and exhibited a similar dose-response pattern to the one for Type I IFN-induced growth inhibitory effects in these cells (Fig.2 D).Figure 2Kinetics and dose dependence of the IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL. A, U-266 cells were treated with IFNα for the indicated times, and after cell lysis, lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine.B, the blot shown in A was stripped and reprobed with the anti-CrkL antibody. C, serum-starved U-266 cells were treated with the indicated doses of IFNα for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine.

Both IFNβ and IFNω induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL in U-266 cells (Fig.3), suggesting that the protein is involved in the signaling pathways of several different Type I IFNs.Figure 3Tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL by IFNβ and IFNω.

Under the conditions of the in vitro kinase assay, phosphorylation of the CrkL protein was detectable prior to IFN treatment and increased further after Type I IFN stimulation (Fig. 4, A andB), strongly suggesting that CrkL associates with and acts as a substrate for a Type I IFN-regulated tyrosine kinase.Figure 4Detection of Type I IFN-dependent tyrosine kinase activity in association with CrkL.

When anti-Tyk-2 immunoblots were performed on anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from Molt-4 cells, we noticed that a minimal amount of Tyk-2 was detected in association with CrkL at base line (Fig. 5 A). The amount of Tyk-2 associated with CrkL increased significantly after 1 min of treatment with IFNα, while the signal diminished at 5 min, suggesting that IFNα induces a rapid and transient association of CrkL with Tyk-2 (Fig. 5, A andB). Previous studies have also shown that Tyk-2 is constitutively associated with the c-cbl proto-oncogene product (Cbl) (37Uddin S. Gardziola C. Dangat A. Yi T. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which has two binding sites for the CrkL Src homology 2 domain (38Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). When the interaction of CrkL with Cbl was studied, we noticed that a small amount of Cbl was associated with CrkL at base line (Fig. 5 C). The signal increased significantly after 1 min of treatment of cells with IFNα and gradually declined to base-line levels (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, during IFNα stimulation CrkL interacts with the Tyk-2-Cbl signaling complex in a rapid and transient manner, to function as a substrate for the kinase activity of Tyk-2.Figure 5Interaction of CrkL with the Tyk-2 tyrosine kinase and the c-cbl proto-oncogene product. A, Molt-4 cells were treated with IFNα for the indicated times, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and immunoblotted with an antibody against Tyk-2.

We sought to determine whether CrkL interacts with C3G in U-266 and also Daudi cells, which exhibit sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of Type I IFNs (35Evinger M. Rubinstein M. Pestka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Fish E.N. Banerjee K. Stebbing N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

C3G was detectable in association with CrkL prior to and after IFNα stimulation in both cell lines (Fig.6). When GST fusion proteins encoding the full-length CrkL protein or the different SH3 domains of CrkL were used in binding studies, C3G bound to the GST-CrkL (full length) and the GST-CrkL-N-SH3, but not the GST-CrkL-C-SH3 (Fig. 6). Thus, CrkL interacts constitutively with C3G in these cells, and such interaction is likely mediated by its N terminus SH3 domain.Figure 6Association of CrkL with the guanine exchange factor C3G in U-266 and Daudi cells. Anti-C3G immunoblots are shown.

Recent evidence by studies in mice with targeted disruption of the Stat-1 gene have established that the Stat pathway is essential for the antiviral effects of IFNα (40Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach J.K. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D.

Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our studies have shown that the function of the IRS pathway is not essential for induction of antiviral responses (49Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. Colamonici O.R. Kellum M. Pitha P. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 2574-2582PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our data have demonstrated that the function of neither the Stat nor the IRS pathways alone is sufficient to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFNα, suggesting that other signaling elements are required (49Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. Colamonici O.R. Kellum M. Pitha P. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 2574-2582PubMed Google Scholar).In the current report we provide evidence that the CrkL adaptor protein is engaged in Type I IFN signaling, providing a link between the Type I IFNR-associated Tyk-2 kinase and the guanine exchange factor C3G. Our data also suggest that the CrkL-Tyk-2 interaction may be mediated by the Tyk-2-associated c-cbl proto-oncogene product, a finding consistent with the presence of CrkL-binding sites in Cbl (38Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). The engagement of such a pathway by the Type I IFNR may prove of importance in the generation of IFNα-induced antiproliferative effects, as C3G regulates activation of Rap-1 that antagonizes Ras and has tumor suppressor activity. The activation of this pathway appears to play a role in cell growth regulation in various other systems. For instance, a recent study has demonstrated that CrkL is tyrosine-phosphorylated during B cell antigen receptor stimulation and interacts constitutively via its N terminus SH3 domain with C3G in Ramos cells (22Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32306-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that its function may be involved in the negative regulation of the Ras pathway during B-cell receptor activation (22Ingham R.J.

Similarly, another recent report has demonstrated that in anergic T-cells, a signaling cascade involving the CrkL-C3G complex is activated, resulting in Rap1 activation and inhibition of T-cell growth (43Boussiotis V.A. Barber D.L. Berezovskaya A. Freeman G.J. Gribben J.G. Nadler L.M.

IFNα has remarkable clinical activity in the treatment of CML patients and in fact is the treatment of choice for patients not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

The enzyme is a dimer containing one FAD, two 2Fe/2S centers, and one molybdopterin cofactor per M r 150,000 subunit (1Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. Third Ed. The Enzymes. XII. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar, 2Hille R. Massey V. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. 7. Wiley-Interscience, New York1985: 443-518Google Scholar). Mammalian XO exists as the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase type (XDH) in freshly prepared samples, i.e.it exhibits low xanthine-O2 reductase activity but high xanthine-NAD reductase activity even in the presence of O2(3Della Corte E. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But during extraction or purification procedures, the enzyme can be easily converted to an O2-dependent oxidase type (XO), i.e. it exhibits low xanthine-NAD activity but high xanthine-O2 reductase activity. This conversion occurs reversibly by oxidation of sulfhydryl groups or irreversibly through proteolysis (3Della Corte E. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Della Corte E. Stirpe F.

Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As H2O2 and O2− are formed as products when molecular oxygen is used as an electron acceptor, the conversion from XDH to XO has been proposed as the basis of the mechanism of recirculation injury (11McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme is easily converted to XO, the enzyme can be purified as the dehydrogenase (XDH) form by rapid purification (6Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or in the presence of thiol reagents such as mercaptoethanol or DTT (7Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. 1982; 92: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or as an XO form which can be converted to XDH by incubation with thiols (9Saito T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10015-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in structural, spectroscopic and kinetics properties between XDH and XO obtained by analyses of the purified enzymes were reviewed recently (12Nishino T. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Upon modification of the protein molecule either by proteolysis or disulfide formation, significant conformational changes occur, particularly around the flavin (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Massey V. Schopfer L.M. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10567-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Saito T. Nishino T. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15930-15935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme from rat liver can be converted to XO by limited proteolysis, which results in nicking at two positions which were identified by sequencing the NH2 termini of three isolated peptides (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identification of the cysteine residues whose oxidation is responsible for XDH to XO was not easy because of the involvement of many cysteine residues being modified to form disulfide bridges during the conversion by ordinary sulfhydryl modifiers. Waud and Rajagopalan (16Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) observed that as many as 14 cysteine residues in rat liver enzyme were titrated with DTNB during conversion from XDH to XO. More recently rat liver and bovine milk enzymes can be converted to XO by 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS) as a modifier forming 4 disulfide bridges, i.e. eight cysteine residues were associated with this modification (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar). It is likely that parts of cysteine residues are close enough to readily form disulfide bridges within the enzyme because cysteine disulfide bridges were formed by reaction with 4-PDS rather than single cysteine residues being modified (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that a single cysteine residue is involved in the conversion (18Kaminski Z.W. Jezewska M.M. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the method employed in the report is not appropriate for the determination of the number of residues in chemical modification studies, as discussed by Rakitzis (19Rakitzis E.T. Biochem. J. 1984; 231: 493-494Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this work, the cysteine residues responsible for XDH to XO interconversion were determined by chemical modification using fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB). Chemical modification of bovine milk XO by FDNB was reported previously to show modification of two lysine residues with a 6-fold decrease in xanthine:O2oxidoreductase activity (20Nishino T. Tsushima K. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7348-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XO of rat liver, reversibly or irreversibly prepared, showed almost the same type of reactivity with FDNB as the milk enzyme with modification of two lysine residues near the xanthine binding site. During the modification with FDNB, however, it was found that the dehydrogenase form can be converted to the oxidase form prior to modification of lysine residues. The peptides containing modified cysteine residues were isolated and sequenced. Rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase was purified from livers of 8–10-week old rats, by the methods previously reported (21Ikegami T. Nishino T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to that at 450 nm of the purified enzyme was around 5.2. The enzyme activity was measured according to the method reported previously (9Saito T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10015-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XDH activity was determined following absorbance change at 340 nm, and XO activity was at 295 nm without NAD+. The activity-to-flavin ratio at 25 °C (AFR25) was obtained by dividing the change in absorbance/minute at 295 nm in the presence of NAD under aerobic conditions by the absorbance at 450 nm of the enzyme used in the assay. The D/O ratio as defined by Waud and Rajagopalan (6Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was determined as the ratio of the absorbance change at 295 nm under aerobic conditions in the presence of NAD to that in the absence of NAD. The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a value of 35,800 m−1 cm−1 for the molar absorbance/enzyme-bound FAD (6Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The freshly purified enzyme was converted to the XDH form, with a D/O ratio of 9–10, by incubation with 5 mm DTT. The completely reversible XO form was prepared by treatment with 4-PDS according to the methods described previously (9Saito T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10015-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar). 3H-FDNB was obtained from New England Nuclear Co. and was diluted with unlabeled FDNB to a specific activity of 259,000 dpm/nmol. Molar extinctions at 360 nm of 17,700m−1 cm−1 for DNP-lysine and of 17,500 m−1 cm−1 for average DNP-amino acids were used (22Ikeda T. Koide T. Marsuo T. Narita K. Murachi T. Experimental Methods in Biochemistry. 1. Tokyo Kagaku-Dojin, Tokyo1976: 118-223Google Scholar). A molar extinction of 16,000m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm was used for DNP-cysteine (22Ikeda T. Koide T. Marsuo T. Narita K. Murachi T. Experimental Methods in Biochemistry. 1. Tokyo Kagaku-Dojin, Tokyo1976: 118-223Google Scholar) before and after DTT treatment. XDH was prepared as described above and the first reaction was carried out with unlabeled 700 μm FDNB in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, for 10 min at 25 °C to react with nonspecific residues. The reaction was then quenched by cooling the solution quickly to 0 °C on ice followed by immediate passing through a Sephadex G-25 column at 4 °C. The second reaction was carried out with 700 μm3H-FDNB in 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer pH 8.5 for strictly 10 min to convert XDH to XO. The labeled XDH was carboxymethylated under anaerobic conditions without prior DTT reduction and was then digested with a mixture of V8 protease Staphylococcus aureus(Boehringer Mannheim) and TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8. The peptides were purified by using three different C18 reverse phase HPLC columns from Capcellpak (Shiseido), Microsorb (Rainin), and μBondapak (Waters). Peptide detection was performed photometrically at 360 nm for specific absorbance of DNP-amino acids or at 226 nm. XO, which was prepared either by spontaneous oxidation or by 4-PDS treatment (17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar), was incubated with various concentrations of FDNB in 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C. XO modified with FDNB was partially digested with trypsin and was separated into three fragments under denatured conditions by the method described previously (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finally purified labeled peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis using an Applied-Biosystem gas-phase amino acid sequencer, model 477A, equipped with PTH analyzer 120A. Incorporation of radioactivity into the amino acid residue was confirmed by determination of radioactivity of the aliquots of each cycles of PTH-amino acids. The partial digestion of native XDH with Protease V8 was carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.4 mm EDTA with or without 10 mmDTT at 25 °C with the ratio of substrate to enzyme of 25 to 1 (weight/weight). Aliquots were withdrawn at 2, 4, or 20 h of incubation, and activities were determined. To measure the intrinsic XDH activity, after proteolysis the enzyme was incubated with 10 mm DTT overnight to reduce disulfide bonds that may have been formed by auto-oxidation during partial digestion. The samples withdrawn at 4 and 20 h were subjected to ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 microconcentrators, and a part of the filtrate was applied to a C18 reverse phase column equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, which was monitored at 226 nm. The amino acid sequence of every peak was determined. When native XDH having a D/O ratio between 9 and 10 was incubated with FDNB at pH 8.5, the total enzyme activity was decreased gradually to a limiting value of the initial activity as shown in Fig. 1. This type of inactivation by prolonged incubation of enzyme with FDNB was also observed with rat liver XO as well as bovine milk XO (20Nishino T. Tsushima K. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7348-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is described below. During short time incubation with FDNB, however, XDH was found to be converted to XO, with 80% conversion within 10 min at pH 8.5. As the enzyme was not converted to XO without FDNB under these conditions and the conversion rate was much faster than the decrease of total activity, it was suggested that this conversion might be due to rapid modification of cysteine residues independently of modification of the residues responsible for irreversible inactivation of both enzyme forms by prolonged incubation with FDNB. When aliquots of enzyme, which had been converted to various degrees of XO activity, were incubated with 10 mm DTT overnight, it was found that while total activity declined steadily with time of treatment with FDNB, 80–90% of the residual activity was present as XDH after DTT treatment, indicating that the modification is reversible. Although rapid conversion from XDH to XO suggests that the conversion is not due to spontaneous formation of a disulfide bridge but to modification of cysteine residues, it is still possible that the FDNB-modified cysteine residue might be attacked by another cysteine residue to result on the formation of disulfide bridge. Such cases are known to occur in the modification of rat liver (17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar) or bovine milk XDH (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 4-PDS. To check this possibility, the reconversion of the FDNB-modified as well as the 4-PDS-modified XDH was performed by incubation with DTT. The XO enzyme modified by 4-PDS was rapidly reconverted to XDH with 5 mm DTT and the conversion was almost complete within 30 min (data not shown). On the other hand, it took several hours for the XO enzyme modified by FDNB to reconvert to 80% of XDH with 10 mm DTT (data not shown). As it was noticed that the conversion from XDH to XO with FDNB was not rapid at pH 7.8 (data not shown), to identify the responsible cysteine residues for the D-O conversion, subsequent reactions were performed in two steps to minimize nonspecific modifications. In the first step reaction, the XDH (86.4% of dehydrogenase activity, and 13.6% of oxidase activity) was incubated with 700 μm unlabeled FDNB at 25 °C for 10 min at pH 7.8 in potassium phosphate buffer followed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 to remove excess unlabeled FDNB, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After the first step reaction, the AFR value decreased from 100 to 86, suggesting some incorporation of DNP group into lysine residues. However, most of the enzyme was retained as XDH (75% dehydrogenase activity, 25% oxidase activity). During this modification, unlabeled nonspecific DNP-Cys and DNP-Lys residues were estimated to be 2.3 and 0.3 mol/mol of enzyme FAD, respectively, using absorbance at 360 nm and 340 nm before and after DTT treatment. In the second step reaction, the sample was reacted with 3H-FDNB at 25 °C for 10 min at pH 8.5 in pyrophosphate buffer. After the second reaction, the enzyme showed only 7.5% of dehydrogenase activity, indicating that XDH was almost completely converted to XO during the second step reaction. The spectra of the DNP incorporated enzymes after first and second reaction are shown in Fig.2. Incorporation of total3H-DNP compound into the enzyme was 2.25 mol/mol of enzyme FAD, of which 0.92 mol was released upon DTT treatment in concomitant re-conversion from XO to XDH, and was therefore considered to be incorporated into cysteine residue(s). The AFR value decreased from 86 to 52 during the second reaction. This is due to the further modification of lysine residues, consistent with the existence of some DNP compound (estimated to be 1.33 mol/mol of enzyme) remaining with the enzyme after DTT treatment. Incorporation of 0.92 mol of label/mol of enzyme FAD into cysteine residue(s) during 67% XDH to XO conversion corresponds to 1.36 mol of DNP/mol of enzyme FAD for 100% conversion. 6 nmol of enzyme prepared as above was carboxymethylated without DTT reduction to avoid possible transfer of the DNP group to other sulfhydryl residues. After dialysis, the sample was digested for 3 h at 37 °C in 0.1 mammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 7.8 with a mixture of V8protease and trypsin. The recovery of radioactivity in this step was 86%. All digested samples were purified by using the three kinds of reverse phase HPLC column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recovery of radioactivity in each step of HPLC chromatography was about 90%, and the overall recovery of radioactivity that was releasable with DTT treatment was 65%. In the final steps of HPLC chromatography, the peptides were separated into three main peaks where 90% of the total radioactivity was associated. All radioactive purified peptides were subjected to gas phase protein sequencing and the obtained sequences were as follows: 1) Asp-Met-3H-DNP-Cys-Gly-Lys, 2) Asn-3H-DNP-Cys-Trp-Lys, and 3) Asn-3H-DNP-Cys-Lys. As was described in the previous section, 1.36 mol of DNP/mol of enzyme FAD was incorporated if 100% D-O conversion was assumed to occur. But the radioactivity incorporation into these peptides was approximately equal among these three peptides; the ratio of radioactivities of the three peptides was 1.1/1.4/1, corresponding to an estimated amount of modification of each cysteine of 0.43, 0.54, and 0.39 mol/FAD, respectively. The explanation for these numbers of modification will be considered under “Discussion.” From comparison with the complete amino acid sequence of the rat enzyme deduced previously from cDNA cloning (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these peptides were identified as containing Cys535, Cys992, and Cys1324. As the mammalian enzyme is known to be converted from XDH to XO and whereas XDHs from other sources such as chicken and probably Drosophila are not, it is noteworthy to see the sequences alignment around these cysteine residues from various sources (23Ichida K.

It is found that residues corresponding to both Cys535 and Cys992 are conserved in all mammalian XDHs, whereas the residue corresponding to Cys992is replaced by arginine in chicken XDH. The regions around Cys535 are relatively not well conserved among the enzymes from various species, although others are well conserved. In chicken XDH, the corresponding residue to Cys535 is conserved but is followed by glutamic acid, whereas it is followed by glycine in mammalian XDHs. The residue is not conserved in XDHs from other sources than vertebrae, where aspartic residues exist in the region near the residue corresponding to Cys535 of the rat enzyme. It is intriguing to note that all of these residues of aldehyde oxidase are replaced by tyrosine residues, with exception of aldehyde oxidoreductase from Desulfovibrio gigas, where peptide sequences corresponding to those of the modified residues in rat XDH are missing. During the course of FDNB modification and digestion experiments, it was noticed that protease V8 showed very different patterns of partial digestion of XDH, compared with that of trypsin. Tryptic digestion resulted in proteolysis at two positions resulting in the formation of 20-, 40-, and 85-kDa fragments, with concomitant conversion from XDH to XO (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this tryptic digestion was carried out in the presence of 5 mm DTT under the same conditions, however, XDH retaining 82% initial activity without conversion into XO was obtained with formation of only 20- and 125-kDa fragments as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4). This indicates that proteolysis at the interconnecting segment between 20 and 125 kDa was not responsible for the irreversible conversion, but the segment between 40 and 80 kDa was. By protease V8 treatment, most of the enzyme remained with apparently the same size as the native one, and the enzyme was partly digested by prolonged incubation at 25 °C resulting in only a small amount of formation of 85- and 62-kDa fragments, which were detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). The activity (initial D/O = 9) remained mostly (60–70%) as XDH after V8 digestion with or without 5 to 10 mm DTT, with apparently no effect of DTT itself on V8 digestion. The lower XDH activity compared with the control enzyme (80–90%), which was incubated without V8 protease, might be due to minor nicking at the segment between 40- and 85-kDa domains. During digestion, aliquots were withdrawn after 4 and 20 h and applied to Centricon 10 ultrafiltrators to separate the small fragments of digested peptides that could be missed in SDS-PAGE analysis. From each filtrate, almost the same amount of a single peptide was obtained, judged from the elution pattern of HPLC (data not shown), indicating that this segment was easily hydrolyzed by V8 protease. The peptide at each incubation time point was sequenced and was found to be the same, composed of the nine amino acid residues of the C-terminal peptide of XDH, containing Cys1324. (Asn1323-Cys-Lys-Ser-Try-Ser-Val-Arg-Ile1331). Amino acids analysis indicated that the amount of peptides was nearly stoichiometric to the original enzyme, and the amino acid composition was coincident to the C-terminal nine-amino acid peptide (data not shown). The sample of 60–70% of XDH, which had lost its C-terminal peptide of nine amino acids, was again converted to XO when it was kept at 4 °C for several weeks without DTT under aerobic conditions. These results indicate that the cysteine residue of the C-terminal peptide is not involved in the conversion of XDH to XO. As in the case of bovine milk XO, the oxidase type of rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase, which was prepared by the methods described under “Experimental Procedures,” was inactivated to a limited value by incubation with various concentrations of FDNB. As shown in the inset of Fig.5, the enzyme activity decreased at a rate dependent on the FDNB concentration down to a level around 30% of the initial activity. The fact that this remaining activity is due to the modified enzyme, and is not due to 30% of remaining native enzyme, was confirmed by the lack of any further decrease when more FDNB was added to the reaction mixture after the limiting activity level was reached (data not shown). The incorporation of FDNB into the enzyme was approximately 3.5 mol/enzyme FAD with 70% loss of activity calculated using an average molar extinction of 17,500m−1 cm−1 of DNP amino acids. When inactivated enzyme was treated with DTT, some amount of DNP-compounds was released without reactivation of total catalytic activity; inactivated enzyme was still associated with 2–2.4 mol of DNP/mol of enzyme FAD. These results suggested that the FDNB modification responsible for the loss of activity is not likely to be due to modification of cysteine, histidine, or tyrosine residues, but due to modification of lysine residue(s) (36Shaltiel S. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These inactivation modes and changes of absorption spectrum of rat enzyme by modification with FDNB were quite similar to those of inactivated DNP-milk XO reported previously (20Nishino T. Tsushima K. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7348-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the bovine milk XO, it was shown by rapid reaction kinetics that the reduction rate of DNP-enzyme by xanthine was slower than that of native enzyme, indicating that the xanthine binding site was modified by FDNB(20). Furthermore, two lysine residues near the xanthine binding site were suggested to be modified during incubation. To identify the modified residues in the rat enzyme, isolation of peptide fragments modified with FDNB were performed after digestion of the modified enzyme by trypsin. Purified rat liver XO was incubated with 700 μm of FDNB in 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer pH 8.5 containing 0.4 mm EDTA at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by cooling on ice and immediately was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess FDNB. The eluted DNP-enzyme still retained 36% residual activity and was incubated with 10 mm DTT overnight. After DTT treatment, the number of DNP-residues associated with the protein decreased from 3.4 to 2.5 mol/mol of enzyme FAD and the 36% residual activity was unchanged. The DNP-enzyme was digested by trypsin at 30 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, overnight to produce nicked DNP-enzyme (2.12 mol of DNP/mol of E-FAD). The nicked DNP-XDH was subjected to gel filtration after denaturation using HPLC column and found to be dissociated into three fragments as described previously with native rat liver enzyme (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution pattern of gel filtration using HPLC (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.6 and recoveries of the peptides are summarized in Table I. Peak 1, which is considered to be an incompletely digested fragment, has only 10% retained DNP compounds as judged by the 360 nm absorbance. The peptide fragment of 85 kDa contained 76% of the total absorbance at 360 nm of all fragments. As the 85-kDa fragment is the molybdopterin-containing domain (13Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), this result is consistent with the results obtained from the experiments with bovine milk XO, that FDNB reacts with the residues near to the xanthine binding site. The spectrum of the 85-kDa fragment is typical of a DNP-peptide with absorption maximum at 360 nm. The 85-kDa fragment was further digested with trypsin and V8protease and DNP-peptides were purified using Capcellpak and μBondapak of C18 reverse-phase HPLC columns and were sequenced. The two DNP-peptides were isolated and the sequences were as follows: 1) Thr746-Asn-Cys-Thr-Ile-Ala-ValPro-DNP-Lys754-Gly-Glu756,2) Leu762-Phe-Val-Ser-Thr-Gln-Asn-Thr-Met-DNP-Lys771-Thr772.Table IThe recovery of the fragment containing modified amino acid residues by FDNB in 3 fragments of XORetention timeMWRecovery(A280)(A360)minkDa(%)31.41009.51034.18546.576404022.56462071Total percent85.593The molecular weights of the eluted peptide samples shown in Fig. 6were estimated by SDS-PAGE using the standard proteins.

Open table in a new tab The molecular weights of the eluted peptide samples shown in Fig. 6were estimated by SDS-PAGE using the standard proteins. The recovery of peptides from gel filtration was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm, and the recovery of DNP-residues content in each of the peptides was estimated by absorbance at 360 nm. DNP-Lys was identified as authentic PTH-DNP-Lys by protein sequencing. The sequences of these DNP-peptides belong to that of the largest fragment of 85 kDa (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the residues are also conserved in the sequence of the bovine milk enzyme. These residues are well conserved in all known mammalian XOs (Fig. 3, panel d). As the mode of inhibition of the bovine milk enzyme was very similar to that of rat enzyme, the same lysine residues in milk enzyme could well be modified by FDNB. In this study we modified cysteine residues using FDNB, a less specific thiol-modifying reagent. XDH pretreated with unlabeled FDNB at lower pH was modified with 3H-DTNB at pH 8.5, with modification of 1.36 mol cys 3H-DNP/FAD accompanying conversion of XDH to XO. It is unlikely that FDNB modification was due to disulfide bridge formation as in the case of 4-PDS (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar) but was due to a single cysteine modification since the rate of reactivation of modified enzyme by DTT was significantly slower than the XO formed by reaction with 4-PDS. The lack of disulfide formation in this modification may be due to lower reactivity of dinitrophenyl-cysteine than dithiopyridyl-cysteine toward other cysteine residues that may exist near the modified cysteine residue. Radioactivity was incorporated into the enzyme upon modification with concomitant conversion from XDH to XO, and furthermore, the incorporated3H-DNP was slowly released by DTT treatment with reconversion to XDH. Although only 1.36 mol DNP-residues were incorporated and distributed between three cysteine residues, some amount might be not involved in the XDH to XO conversion. Three DNP-modified peptides containing Cys535, Cys992and Cys1324 were obtained from the modified enzyme with the estimated incorporation of 0.43, 0.54, and 0.39 mol/FAD, respectively. It was found that Cys1324 was not involved in the conversion from the experiment of V8 protease treatment of XDH, indicating that Cys1324 was nonspecifically modified. Non-involvement of Cys1324 for the conversion has been also confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments using Baculovirus/insect cell system where Cys1324 was replaced by serine. 2Nishino, T. and Nishino, T., unpublished results. The explanation for the fact that only one mol/FAD incorporation into two different cysteine residues might be that one of the two cysteine residues, which may form a disulfide bridge during reversible conversion of XDH to XO, is alternatively modified so that dinitrophenylation of either of the residues may disturb the further modification of the other cysteine residue by steric hindrance. Thus, it is likely that Cys535and/or Cys992 are responsible for the conversion from XDH to XO. We have attempted to address this question by replacement of these residues with serine, but expression of the mutant enzymes has so far been unsuccessful. The mammalian enzyme is known to be converted from XDH to XO (12Nishino T. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Although it is not well characterized in XDHs from other sources, it is known that at least XDHs from chicken and probablyDrosophila are not converted to XO. It is intriguing that the residues corresponding to both Cys535 and Cys992 are all conserved in mammalian XDHs(10, 23–25), whereas the residue corresponding to Cys992 is replaced by arginine in chicken XDH (26Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the chicken XDH, the residue corresponding to Cys535 is followed by glutamic acid (26Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) whereas it is followed by glycine in mammalian XDHs(10, 23–25). The lack of spontaneous formation of disulfide bridges in chicken XDH might be explained by such a replacement. The differences in surrounding residues might also explain that the residue corresponding to Cys535 in chicken XDH cannot be easily modified by sulfhydryl modifying reagents. Most probably the conformational change might occur particularly around the FAD moiety in the XDH to XO conversion by modification of these residues (8Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Massey V. Schopfer L.M. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10567-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The residue corresponding to Cys535 is not conserved in XDHs from sources other than vertebrae, suggesting that these enzymes might not be converted into XO forms by sulfhydryl oxidation. The Cys535 residue is in the NAD (37Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FAD-binding domain (13Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), whereas Cys992 and Cys1324 are in the molybdopterin domain (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues could be located at the interface of these domains close enough to form a disulfide bridge resulting in the conformational changes. The only available three dimensional structure of enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family is at the moment the structure of aldehyde oxidoreductase fromDesulfovibrio gigas (38Romao M.J. Archer M. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Legall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). As this enzyme lacks an FAD domain but possesses molybdopterin and iron-sulfur center domains (34Thoenes U. Flores O.L. Neves A. DeVreese b. van Beeumen J.J. Huber R. Ramao M.J. Legall J. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the residue corresponding to Cys535 is missing. The residue corresponding to Cys992 in this enzyme is also missing (34Thoenes U. Flores O.L. Neves A. DeVreese b. van Beeumen J.J. Huber R. Ramao M.J. Legall J. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but the residues corresponding to the neighboring residues of Cys992 such as Thr610, His611 or Lys612 are actually located at the surface of the molybdopterin domain (38Romao M.J. Archer M. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Legall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These residues might be supposed to be at the interface to the FAD domain of XDH. In other aldehyde oxidases the discussed cysteine residues are replaced by tyrosine residues. All of these enzyme are known to exist solely as an oxidase form. As with bovine milk XO, rat liver XDH was also inactivated to a limited value by rather prolonged incubation with various concentrations of FDNB. These inactivation modes and changes of absorption spectrum of the rat enzyme by modification with FDNB were quite similar to those of inactivated DNP-milk XO reported previously (20Nishino T. Tsushima K. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7348-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the bovine milk XO it was shown by rapid reaction kinetics that the reductive half reaction of the DNP-enzyme by xanthine was slower than that of native enzyme, indicating that the residues near the xanthine binding site were modified (20Nishino T. Tsushima K. Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7348-7353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies the modified residues of the rat XO form were identified by isolation of peptide fragments modified with FDNB. The residues were actually in the 85-kDa domain which contains the molybdopterin cofactor (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the mode of inhibition of rat XDH was very similar to that of bovine milk XO, the same residues would presumably be modified in the milk enzyme. These residues are conserved among all of the known mammalian XOs (10Amaya Y. Yamazaki Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ichida K. Amaya Y. Noda K. Minoshima S. Hosoya T. Sakai O. Shimizu N. Nishino T.

Neves A. DeVreese b. van Beeumen J.J. Huber R. Ramao M.J. Legall J. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the presumed location of these residues in the three-dimensional structure suggests that they are directly associated neither with the molybdopterin cofactor nor with the possible active site pocket (38Romao M.J. Archer M. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Legall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibition is due to a conformational change around the xanthine binding site. Incomplete inactivation with FDNB is consistent with this conclusion. We thank Dr.Vincent Massey, the University of Michigan, for valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2131287937,"The mid-latitude atmosphere is dominated by westerly, nearly zonal flow. Occasionally, this flow is deflected poleward by blocking anticyclones that persist for 10 days or longer. Experiments in a rotating annulus used radial pumping to generate a zonal jet under the action of the Coriolis force. In the presence of two symmetric ridges at the bottom of the annulus, the resulting flows were nearly zonal at high forcing or blocked at low forcing. Intermittent switching between blocked and zonal patterns occurs because of the jet's interaction with the topography. These results shed further light on previous atmospheric observations and numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2056403356,"Octamer binding transcription factors (Oct factors) play important roles in activation of transcription of various genes but, in some cases, require cofactors that interact with the DNA binding (POU) domain. In the present study, a yeast two-hybrid screen with the Oct-1 POU domain as a bait identified MAT1 as a POU domain-binding protein. MAT1 is known to be required for the assembly of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK), which is functionally associated with the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Further analyses showed that MAT1 interacts with POU domains of Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3 in vitro in a DNA-independent manner. MAT1-containing TFIIH was also shown to interact with POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2. MAT1 is shown to enhance the ability of a recombinant CDK7-cyclin H complex (bipartite CAK) to phosphorylate isolated POU domains, intact Oct-1, and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, but not the originally defined substrate, CDK2. Phosphopeptide mapping indicates that the site (Ser385) of a mitosis-specific phosphorylation that inhibits Oct-1 binding to DNA is not phosphorylated by CAK. However, one CAK-phosphorylated phosphopeptide comigrates with a Cdc2-phosphorylated phosphopeptide previously shown to be mitosis-specific, suggesting that, in vitro, CAK is able to phosphorylate at least one site that is also phosphorylated in vivo. These results suggest (i) that interactions between POU domains and MAT1 can target CAK to Oct factors and result in their phosphorylation, (ii) that MAT1 not only functions as a CAK assembly factor but also acts to alter the spectrum of CAK substrates, and (iii) that a POU-MAT1 interaction may play a role in the recruitment of TFIIH to the preinitiation complex or in subsequent initiation and elongation reactions.

However, activation of octamer-containing promoters through Oct-1 requires additional promoter-specific cofactors. For example, the B cell-specific coactivator OCA-B, the ubiquitous PTF, and the HSV-encoded VP16 are necessary for the maximum activation of immunoglobulin promoters, small nuclear RNA genes, and HSV immediate early genes, respectively. These additional factors interact with the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 (9Pierani A. Heguy A. Fujii H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

To identify other factors that modulate Oct-1 activity, we cloned additional POU domain-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of several isolates was identified as MAT1, a subunit of CDK-activating kinase (CAK). CAK was originally identified as a kinase that activates CDKs in vitro by phosphorylating a conserved threonine residue in the T-loop of CDKs (14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2934) Google Scholar). CAK consists of MAT1 along with CDK7 and cyclin H; MAT1 acts to assemble the latter two subunits to form a stable active kinase containing all three subunits (15Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M.

Here, we show that MAT1 directly binds to the POU domains of several Oct factors and, consequently, enhances their phosphorylation by CAK. The expression vector for 6HisT7MAT1 was constructed as follows. First, 6HisT-pET21b was constructed by ligating the larger fragment of NdeI-PstI-digested 6HisT-pET11d (24Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and the smaller fragment ofNdeI-PstI-digested pET21b (Novagen). The coding region of MAT1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers (5′-CCTTGAATTCCATGGACGATCAGGGTTG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CCGGGTCGACTTATAAATGGTTAACTGGGCT-3′ (downstream)) from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium cDNA clone (identification number 230976), which contains the whole coding region of MAT1. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI andSalI and cloned into the EcoRI andSalI sites of 6HisT-pET21b. The resulting vector (pHT7MAT1) was used to express MAT1 containing N-terminal hexahistidine and T7 epitope tags. A hybrid gene encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147), the hemagglutinin epitope tag, and the POU domain of Oct-1 was constructed in the yeast bait vector pCENCYH as follows. First the larger PvuI fragment of the yeast multiple copy vector pAS2, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

ThisNdeI-BamHI fragment was cloned into theNdeI-BamHI sites of pCENCYH to obtain pAI11. The expression vector for FLAG-Oct-1 (pFOct-1) was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.G.

TheNdeI-BglII fragment containing the full-length Oct-1 was swapped with the NdeI-BamHI fragment of TFIIEβ in pF:TFIIEβ-11d (29Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pFOct-1. pAI11 was transformed into the Y190 yeast strain (25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). The expression of the GAL4-(1–147)-POU-1 hybrid protein was verified by Western blotting with anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Babco) (data not shown). This yeast was transformed by a B cell cDNA library in pACT (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and plated on SC medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole). His+ colonies exhibiting β-galactosidase activity using the filter lift assay (31Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) were restreaked onto SC medium plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. 39 colonies that exhibited β-galactosidase activity reproducibly were further characterized. Library plasmids were recovered by transforming leucine-deficient Escherichia coli MH4 (leuB − , Δ(lac)X74, galU, galK, hsr − , hsm + , strA) with total DNA prepared from these colonies. Transformants were identified on minimal medium lacking leucine and containing ampicillin. To ensure that the correct cDNAs were identified, isolated library plasmids were individually cotransformed with pAI11 into Y190, and only four library plasmids were found to reproduce β-galactosidase activity. To check the specificity of interaction of these clones with the POU domain, Y190 was cotransformed with the library plasmids and pLAM5′, which encodes a human lamin C fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (CLONTECH). Since the four positive plasmids failed to give β-galactosidase activity, the sequences of the inserts were determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). GST and GST-POU domain fusion proteins (10Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The amount of proteins bound to the resin was determined by SDS-PAGE using BSA (Boehringer Mannheim) as a standard. [35S]Methionine-labeled 6HisT7MAT1 and luciferase were transcribed and translated in vitro from pHT7MAT1 and the luciferase control DNA, respectively, by using the TnT system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six micrograms of GST-POU proteins or 8 μg of GST protein bound to 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose in 210 μl of BC100 buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA were used for each binding experiment. One microliter (each) of reticulocyte lysate containing expressed proteins was added to initiate binding. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the resin was washed extensively with BC100 buffer at 4 °C. Proteins retained on the resin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after elution with SDS-loading buffer. Similarly, 3.7 μg of GST-POU-1 or GST-POU-2 proteins or 7.2 μg of GST protein bound to 3 μl of glutathione-Sepharose in 70 μl of BC100 buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA were used for binding experiments with 30 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (8.4 mg of protein/ml) in BC100 buffer. After 17 h of incubation at 4 °C, resins were washed extensively with BC100 buffer. Retained proteins were eluted with SDS-loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed with appropriate antibodies, and visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). 6HisT7MAT1 was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)/pLysS after induction by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were disrupted in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm PMSF) by sonication, and the insoluble fraction containing most of 6HisT7MAT1 was collected by centrifugation. Proteins were solubilized in binding buffer containing 6 mguanidine hydrochloride and incubated at room temperature with nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) preequilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washes with binding buffer containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 mmZnSO4, the protein on the resin was renatured by serial dilution of the guanidine hydrochloride with equal volumes of binding buffer containing 0.1 mm ZnSO4, such that the final concentration of guanidine hydrochloride was 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and finally 0.1875 m. Resin was incubated in each diluted buffer for at least 10 min at room temperature and then transferred to 4 °C after the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride was ≤0.75m. After washes with binding buffer containing 0.1 mm ZnSO4 and then binding buffer with 20 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm ZnSO4, the protein was eluted by adding binding buffer with 200 mmimidazole and 0.1 mm ZnSO4. Dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 1 mm to the eluate. A complex of CDK7 and cyclin H (bipartite CAK) was prepared as follows. 20 flasks (150 cm2) of monolayer high five cells (Invitrogen), maintained in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 70–80% confluency, were infected simultaneously with recombinant baculoviruses that produce CDK7 or cyclin H for 48 h at 27 °C. To harvest, the cells were centrifuged at 180 × g for 12 min followed by washing one time with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 38,000 × gat 4 °C, the resulting supernatant (60 mg of protein) was directly loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.0 × 1.3 cm, 1.5 ml) preequilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin) plus 0.025 m NaCl. After washing the column with 30 ml of the equilibration buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 40 ml of a linear gradient from 0.025 to 0.4 m NaCl in buffer A. The peak of CDK7-cyclin H complex, monitored by silver staining following SDS-PAGE, was eluted around 0.18m NaCl. The pooled CDK7-cyclin H fractions were then diluted 2-fold with buffer A prior to chromatography onto a heparin-Sepharose column (1.0 × 2.5 cm, 2 ml) preequilibrated with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl. After washing the column with 100 ml of the equilibration buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 40 ml of a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 mNaCl in buffer A. The CDK7-cyclin H complex was eluted at around 0.35 m NaCl with a yield of ∼2 mg with more than 90% purity as judged by silver staining following SDS-PAGE. FLAG-Oct-1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS harboring pFOct-1 after induction by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed protein was purified as described by Chiang and Roeder (29Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). GST-CDK2 and cyclin A were expressed and purified from bacteria as described (32Connell-Crowley L. Solomon M.J. Wei N. Harper J.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition to the buffer components introduced by the addition of kinase and substrates, the components of the kinase buffer were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 μm ATP, and 30 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by adding EDTA. Phosphorylated proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For phosphopeptide analyses of 6HisPOU-1, reaction conditions were the same as above except for the use of 2.5 μm ATP and 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1.25 μm ATP). 20 ng of 6HisPOU-1 was phosphorylated by 15 ng of the bipartite CAK with 10 ng of MAT1 or 0.05 units of protein kinase A (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 30 °C. For phosphopeptide analyses of FLAG-Oct-1, 600 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μmATP) was used. 50 ng of FLAG-Oct-1 was phosphorylated by 15 ng of bipartite CAK with 10 ng of MAT1 or 2 units of Cdc2/cyclin B (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 30 °C. Quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 1.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphopeptide analysis was performed as described by Robertset al. (33Roberts S.B. Segil N. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 253: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To isolate possible cofactors modulating Oct-1 activity, screening with the yeast two-hybrid system was employed (34Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Since several cofactors are already known to interact with Oct-1 through the POU domain (POU-1), this domain was used as a bait for the screening. Yeast cells that express the GAL4-(1–147)-POU-1 fusion protein were transformed with a GAL4 activation domain-tagged human B cell cDNA library. Out of 11.3 × 107 transformants, about 150 were His+ and lacZ +. Out of these, 38 colonies were selected, and plasmids containing cDNAs were recovered by transforming E. coli. Four plasmids could reproduce the β-galactosidase activity by cotransforming the yeast with the GAL4-(1–147)-POU-1 plasmid. The inability of these plasmids to direct activation of the lacZ reporter gene by itself or with a GAL4-(1–147)-lamin plasmid (an unrelated control GAL4 plasmid) suggested that the interactions were specific. Therefore, these four plasmids were sequenced and were found to encode four different proteins (designated PIP-1, -2, -3, and -4 forPOU-interacting proteins). The nucleotide sequence of PIP-4 revealed that this clone contains a sequence encoding approximately 23 of the carboxyl terminus of the recently cloned CAK assembly factor, MAT1. MAT1 is also a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH (Fig.1 A; Refs. 15Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1995; 83: 47-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Tassan J.-P. Jaquenoud M. Fry A.M. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, and 35Yee A. Nichols M.A. Wu L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar). To show that the interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay is due to a specific interaction between MAT1 and the Oct-1 POU domain (POU-1), in vitro binding studies were performed. The POU domains of Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3 were fused to GST (GST-POU-1, GST-POU-2, and GST-POU-3, respectively), expressed in bacteria, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for analysis of MAT1 interactions. A full-length MAT1 clone was obtained from an expressed sequence tag clone and subcloned for expression in the reticulocyte lysate system. MAT1 was synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with the different POU domain affinity resins. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.2 A, MAT1 was preferentially retained by the GST-POU-1, GST-POU-2, and GST-POU-3 affinity resins, while no detectable MAT1 was retained by the resin containing GST alone. It has been argued that inclusion of ethidium bromide in the binding assay allows a distinction between a bona fide protein-protein interaction and interactions due to contaminating nonspecific bridging DNA (36Lai J.-S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Binding of MAT1 to GST-POU proteins was unaffected by the presence of up to 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide, strongly arguing in favor of bona fide direct protein-protein interactions between MAT1 and POU domains (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, the inability of a nonrelated control protein, luciferase, to be retained by any of the resin-bound GST proteins further indicates the specificity of these interactions (Fig. 2 A). Since MAT1 is a subunit of CAK, it was of interest to test whether CAK can phosphorylate interacting POU domains. For this purpose, bipartite CAK containing stoichiometric amounts of CDK7 and cyclin H was prepared from baculovirus-coinfected insect cells, and the influence of MAT1 on the phosphorylation of histidine-tagged POU-1 (6HisPOU-1) by bipartite CAK was examined. The addition of MAT1 to the bipartite CAK enhanced the kinase activity on 6HisPOU-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, up to 30-fold (Fig.3 A, lanes 7–10). Maximum phosphorylation was observed when an approximately stoichiometric amount (10 ng) of MAT1 was added to the bipartite CAK (Fig. 3 A, lane 10), suggesting that recombinant MAT1 is fully active and incorporated into the bipartite CAK. When MAT1 levels were increased above the stoichiometric amount, the kinase activity decreased (data not shown); this presumably reflects binding of free MAT1 to 6HisPOU-1 and sequestration of the substrate from the tripartite CAK containing CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. Control assays showed that phosphorylation of 6HisPOU-1 was dependent upon bipartite CAK (Fig. 3 A, lane 6 versus lane 10) as well as MAT1 and that autophosphorylation of CDK7 was only weakly stimulated by MAT1 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4, 5, and7–10). To examine whether bipartite CAK can also phosphorylate full-length Oct-1 and whether this activity is also enhanced by the addition of MAT1, bacterially expressed FLAG-tagged full-length Oct-1 (FLAG-Oct-1) was used as a substrate. The addition of a stoichiometric amount of MAT1 to the bipartite CAK enhanced phosphorylation of FLAG-Oct-1 approximately 300-fold (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that MAT1 is indispensable for CAK activity on full-length Oct-1. Consistent with the effect of MAT1 on phosphorylation of POU-1 and Oct-1 by CAK, as well as the physical interaction results in Fig. 2, A andB, MAT1 also enhanced phosphorylation of GST-POU-2 and GST-POU-3 by bipartite CAK (Fig. 3 C). GST alone was not phosphorylated by CAK under the same conditions (data not shown). Two other known substrates for CAK, the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and CDK2, were also tested. Phosphorylation of GST-CTD by bipartite CAK was increased about 12-fold by MAT1 (Fig. 3 D), while phosphorylation of GST-CDK2, the original substrate used to identify and purify CAK, was not further enhanced by the addition of MAT1 (Fig. 3 E). Consistent with this, MAT1 did not affect the bipartite CAK-mediated activation of cyclin A-CDK2 to phosphorylate histone H1 (data not shown). The observed effects of MAT1 on the phosphorylation of CTD and CDK2 by bipartite CAK agree with recent results reported by Yankulov and Bentley (37Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results indicate that although CAK can phosphorylate a variety of substrates, MAT1 can further stimulate this phosphorylation on only a subset of these targets. This indicates that MAT1 is acting in a substrate-specific manner. Earlier studies of Oct-1 during progression through the cell cycle revealed a complex temporal program of phosphorylation. In particular, Oct-1 is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis, and DNA binding of Oct-1 is blocked by mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Ser385 in the POU homeodomain by an unidentified cell cycle-regulated kinase (33Roberts S.B. Segil N. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 253: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine whether CAK can phosphorylate Ser385 in vitro. Since protein kinase A was shown to phosphorylate Ser385 in vitro (38Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), 6HisPOU-1 phosphorylated by protein kinase A was used as a marker in phosphopeptide analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 A, thermolytic peptide maps from 6HisPOU-1 phosphorylated by CAK clearly differ from those generated with protein kinase A, indicating that CAK does not phosphorylate Ser385 in vitro. Somewhat unexpectedly, the tryptic peptide map of FLAG-Oct-1 phosphorylated by CAK (Fig. 4 B, left panel) appeared very similar to the tryptic peptide map of FLAG-Oct-1 phosphorylated in vitro by a p13-associated Cdc2-related protein kinase (Fig. 4 B, middle panel; Ref. 33Roberts S.B. Segil N. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 253: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of a mixture of the two sets of tryptic phosphopeptides showed that six of the CAK-phosphorylated peptides comigrated with six of the Cdc2-phosphorylated peptides (Fig.4 B, right panel). The dependence on MAT1 of FLAG-Oct-1 phosphorylation by CAK (Fig. 3 B) rules out the possibility that the overlapping CAK and Cdc2 phosphopeptide maps result from contaminating Cdc2 kinase present in our CAK preparation. Significantly, a prior analysis of the Cdc2-labeled phosphopeptides showed that one of the six common phosphopeptides (indicated byhorizontal arrowheads in Fig. 4 B) comigrates with an in vivo labeled mitosis-specific phosphopeptide (33Roberts S.B.

In this study, we investigated this paradoxical effect of ACTH on cell proliferation in Y1 adrenal cells and have unmasked a growth-promoting effect of the hormone. Y1 cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation and monitored for progression through S phase by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and by measuring the number of nuclei labeled with bromodeoxyuridine. Y1 cells were stimulated to progress through S phase and to divide after a brief pulse of ACTH (up to 2 h). This effect of ACTH appeared to be cAMP independent, since ACTH also induced cell cycle progression in Kin-8, a Y1 mutant with defective cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The growth-promoting effect of ACTH in Y1 was preceded by the rapid activation of p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases and by the accumulation of c-FOS protein. In contrast, continuous treatment with ACTH (14 h) inhibited cell cycle progression in Y1 cells by a cAMP-dependent pathway. The inhibitory effect of ACTH mapped to the midpoint of G1. Together, the results demonstrate a dual effect of ACTH on cell cycle progress, a cAMP-independent growth-promoting effect early in G1possibly mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-FOS, and a cAMP-dependent inhibitory effect at mid-G1.

ACTH-induced inhibition of cell proliferation has been observed in the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (1Masui H. Garren L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3206-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as well as in normal adrenocortical cells isolated from a variety of species including rat, cow, and human (for review, see Ref. 2Hornsby P.J. Endocr. Res. 1985; 10: 259-281Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ACTH arrests dividing adrenal cells by interfering with progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (3Kimura E. Armelin M.C.S. Armelin H.A. Rev. Bras. Genet. 1983; 2: 211-227Google Scholar) and inhibits the initiation of DNA synthesis in G1-arrested cells following addition of serum or growth factors (4Weidman R.E. Gill G.N. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 90: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Armelin M.C.S. Gambarini A.G. Armelin H.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the growth-inhibitory effect of ACTH is mediated by cAMP with the most compelling data arising from studies of Y1 adrenal tumor cells harboring dominant inhibitory mutations in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that specifically disrupt cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (6Olson M.F. Krolczyk A.J. Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. Schimmer B.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These PKA mutants are resistant to the growth-inhibitory actions of ACTH and cAMP analogs (7Schimmer B.P. Schulz P. Endocr. Res. 1985; 11: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Armelin H.A. Lotfi C.F.P. Lepique A.P. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that cAMP and PKA are obligatory components of this effect of ACTH on cell proliferation. The inhibition of proliferation seen in isolated adrenocortical cells contrasts sharply with the growth-promoting effects of ACTH on the adrenal gland in vivo and has led to the widely held view that ACTH serves as an indirect mitogen for the adrenal cortex in intact animals (2Hornsby P.J. Endocr. Res. 1985; 10: 259-281Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, ACTH induces expression of genes often associated with enhanced cell proliferation such as ornithine decarboxylase (9Kudlow J.E. Rae P.A. Gutmann N.S. Schimmer B.P.

The MAP kinase cascade, an important regulator of cell cycle progression, has been used recently as a biochemical marker to evaluate the status of hormones and growth factors as mitogens. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway is involved in the mitogenic effects of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and FGF (13L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. Weber M.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), each acting through a G protein-coupled receptor. Conversely, inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade accompanies the growth-inhibitory effects of cAMP observed in fibroblasts and other cell types (for review, see Ref. 18Campbell J.S. Seger R. Graves J.D. Graves L.M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 131-159PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the regulation of the MAP kinase pathway in Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells to reconcile the growth-inhibiting effect of ACTH in vitro with the conflicting biochemical data that suggests an underlying mitogenic effect of the hormone. Although we expected that ACTH would inhibit MAP kinase activity in Y1 cells, consistent with the growth-inhibitory effects of the hormone, we find that ACTH activates the MAP kinase cascade via a signaling mechanism that is cAMP-independent. This effect of ACTH on MAP kinase prompted us to reexamine the effects of ACTH on Y1 cell proliferation. We find that ACTH promotes the transition of Y1 cells from G1 to S in a cAMP-independent manner and stimulates cell division when administered to Y1 cells as a short pulse early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, administration of ACTH later in the cell cycle inhibits the transition of cells from G1 to S. These results suggest that we have unmasked a cAMP-independent, growth-promoting effect of ACTH that has new implications for the mitogenic effects of the hormone on the adrenal cortex. The cells used in this study are the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (19Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar) and a cAMP-resistant, PKA-defective mutant of the Y1 cell line designated Kin-8 (20Rae P.A. Gutmann N.S. Tsao J. Schimmer B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells routinely were grown either in Ham's nutrient mixture F10 supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum as described in detail previously (21Schimmer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were arrested early in the G1phase of the cell cycle by incubation in serum-deficient medium for the times specified. All cultures were maintained at 36.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were replicate plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm tissue culture dish, cultured for 4 days in F10 growth medium plus serum, and then transferred to serum-free alpha minimal essential medium for 72 h to induce growth arrest. Cells then were treated with various reagents to modulate the MAP kinase cascade, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) (22Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C. Samples (10 μg of protein) were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 3–5 min, electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products) using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus. Phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase were detected by immunoblotting using a PhosphoPlus MAPK antibody kit (New England Biolabs, Missisauga, Ontario). The kit provides a primary rabbit antibody that specifically recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of p44 MAP kinase (Erk1) and p42 MAP kinase (Erk2) and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for chemiluminescent detection. The incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA was determined essentially as described previously (5Armelin M.C.S. Gambarini A.G. Armelin H.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Gill G.N. Weidman E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were replicate plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells per 6-cm tissue culture dish and cultured for 2 days in growth medium plus serum to ensure logarithmic growth. Cells were transferred to alpha minimal essential medium without serum for 72 h to arrest cells early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Cells then were rinsed and incubated for another 14 h in 2 ml of fresh alpha minimal essential medium with various additions as indicated. During the last 2 h of incubation, cells were pulsed with 2 μCi/ml of [methyl-3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products; 20 Ci/mmol) and collected on glass fiber discs by filtration. DNA was precipitated on the filters using 5% trichloroacetic acid; samples were washed with 95% ethanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Approximately 2 × 104 cells were seeded on coverslips in DMEM with serum and then serum-starved for 48 h. Cells were treated with various reagents to promote transition of cells from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle and then incubated with 100 μmBrdUrd to label S phase nuclei as described in the appropriate figure legends. Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min and stored. BrdUrd-labeled nuclei were estimated by indirect immunofluorescence. Coverslips with fixed cells were incubated in 1.5 n HCl for 30 min, inverted onto a 40-μl drop of mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and immune complexes were detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) using the same procedure. Next, the coverslips were incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 μg/ml) for 20 min to fluorescently stain total nuclei and then examined under a Nikon Fluophot microscope using two excitation filters: UV 330–380 to visualize 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained total nuclei and IF420–490 to visualize the BrdUrd-labeled nuclei stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The coverslips were randomly coded, and the fluorescent nuclei were counted blindly. Between 500 and 750 nuclei were counted per coverslip. Regulation of the MAP kinase pathway in Y1 cells was monitored by measuring the phosphorylation and activation of two MAP kinase isoforms, Erk1 and Erk2. Y1 cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 72 h to arrest cell growth early in G1. Cells were then transferred to medium that was fully supplemented with serum, harvested at different time periods, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2. As shown in Fig.1 a, serum rapidly and transiently stimulated the appearance of phosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2. These phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase were detectable within 1 min after serum addition, reached a maximum after 5 min, and declined toward control levels by 20 min. FGF, another mitogen for Y1 cells (25Gospodarowicz D. Handley H.H. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), also stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 but with somewhat delayed kinetics (Fig. 1 b). The appearance of phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase in response to serum or FGF reflected activation of MAP kinase as determined by direct measures of enzymatic activity (data not shown). To determine if the growth-inhibitory effects of ACTH and 8-Br-cAMP in Y1 cells were associated with inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade, Y1 cells were preincubated with porcine ACTH (Acthar; Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Canada Inc., Montreal, Quebec) or 8-Br-cAMP for 10 min and then treated with serum for varying periods of time. Although this same experimental paradigm had been used previously to correlate the growth-inhibitory effects of cAMP with an inhibitory effect on the MAP kinase pathway in rat and hamster fibroblasts (26Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 27McKenzie F.R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), pretreatment of Y1 adrenal cells with ACTH or 8-Br-cAMP failed to inhibit serum-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 1, c andd). To the contrary, the addition of ACTH to Y1 cells arrested by serum starvation rapidly stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 2 a) and increased MAP kinase activity (data not shown). The hormone was effective at concentrations as low as 0.1 microunits/ml. Synthetic human ACTH1–39 also stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 2 a) over a similar concentration range (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the observed effects were due to growth factors contaminating the pituitary-derived Acthar preparation. The concentrations of ACTH that effectively stimulated MAP kinase activity were 50-fold lower than the concentrations of hormone required to produce detectable changes in cAMP levels in these cells (28Schimmer B.P. Zimmerman A.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1976; 4: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ACTH exerted its effects on MAP kinase via a cAMP-independent pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of ACTH to stimulate MAP kinase phosphorylation in the cAMP-resistant, PKA-defective mutant Kin-8. As shown in Fig.2 b, ACTH effectively activated MAP kinase phosphorylation in the Kin-8 mutant over the same concentration range as seen in parent Y1 cells, supporting the hypothesis that activation of the MAP kinase cascade occurred through a cAMP-independent mechanism. In both parental Y1 cells and the PKA-defective mutant, Kin-8, the effect of ACTH was mimicked by the phorbol ester PMA (Sigma) but not by the inactive 4α-hydroxyl isomer of PMA, implicating a protein kinase C-dependent pathway of regulation (Fig. 2, c andd). Although MAP kinase phosphorylation also was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP, a similar effect was achieved with 5′-AMP (Fig. 2,c and d), suggesting that the action was not specific for the cyclic nucleotide and possibly involved signaling via purinergic receptors. The ability of serum-starved Y1 cells to progress from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to S phase was monitored by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA or by measuring the percentage of nuclei labeled with BrdUrd. Incubation of Y1 cells with serum for 14 h led to a 15-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (TableI). As determined from BrdUrd-labeling experiments, the changes in [3H]thymidine incorporation into Y1 cell DNA reflected the progression of cells from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to S phase. As shown in Fig.3, fetal bovine serum and FGF both stimulated the entry of Y1 cells into S phase with a lag of approximately 8 h and resulted in the labeling of approximately 80% of nuclei after 24 h. ACTH, 8-Br-cAMP, or PMA, when added together with serum during the entire incubation period, dramatically and significantly reduced the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated (Table I). Even when added alone for 14 h, ACTH caused a significant reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with growth-arrested Y1 cells.Table IProlonged incubation of Y1 cells with ACTH, 8-Br-cAMP or PMA inhibits incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNATreatmentThymidine incorporationStatistical significanceNone1.0Serum15.0 ± 3.25p = 0.0081-ap values for significance relative to serum-starved controls.ACTH0.2 ± 0.04p < 0.0011-ap values for significance relative to serum-starved controls.ACTH + serum2.6 ± 0.42p < 0.0011-bp values for significance relative to serum-treated samples.8-Br-cAMP + serum0.20 ± 0.01p= 0.00011-bp values for significance relative to serum-treated samples.PMA + serum6.1 ± 1.9p < 0.0011-bp values for significance relative to serum-treated samples.Y1 cells in the logarithmic phase of growth (approximately 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) were arrested in early G1 by serum starvation for 72 h.

The observation that ACTH rapidly activated the MAP kinase cascade when added to growth-arrested Y1 cells (Fig. 2) prompted us to reexamine the effects of ACTH on the cell cycle particularly when administered over a short period to coincide with the activation of MAP kinase. As shown in Fig.4, treatment of serum-starved Y1 cells with fetal bovine serum or FGF for varying periods of time caused a progressive increase in the percentage of nuclei labeled with BrdUrd, reaching a maximum stimulation of 3.5–5.5-fold (p < 0.05) after 24 h. At the end of this period, 80–90% of nuclei were labeled with BrdUrd. Using this experimental paradigm, we found that treatment with ACTH for short periods up to 2 h increased the labeling index of Y1 cells almost 2-fold (p < 0.05) and approached the effects of serum and FGF over the same periods (Fig.4). In contrast, treatments with ACTH for longer periods of time were inhibitory. A short pulse of ACTH also stimulated progression of Y1 cells from G1 to S as measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA (TableII). Treatment of serum-starved Y1 cells with ACTH for 5 min produced a 4-fold increase in thymidine incorporation over controls, which approached the effects obtained with FGF over the same interval. Similar results were obtained after a brief exposure of Y1 cells to synthetic ACTH1–39 in equimolar amounts (data not shown), ensuring that the transition of cells from G1 to S resulted specifically from the hormone and not from another contaminating growth factor in the pituitary-derived hormone preparation.Table IITreatment of Y1 or Kin-8 cells with short pulses of ACTH or PMA stimulates incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNACell lineTreatmentThymidine incorporationStatistical significanceY1None1.0Serum6.2 ± 0.45p = 0.0004FGF4.1 ± 0.30p = 0.007ACTH4.0 ± 0.95p = 0.001PMA2.1 ± 0.14p = 0.01Kin-8None1.0Serum5.0 ± 0.5p < 0.001FGF4.4 ± 0.35p < 0.001ACTH3.4 ± 0.5p = 0.005PMA4.3 ± 0.52p < 0.0006Cells were growth-arrested as described in Table I, incubated for 5 min with serum (15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum), human recombinant FGF (100 ng/ml), ACTH (Acthar; 0.1 milliunits/ml) or PMA (0.1 μm) as indicated and then transferred to serum-free medium for 14 h. During the last 2 h of incubation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml). Values for thymidine incorporation and determinations of statistical significance were as described in Table I. Open table in a new tab Cells were growth-arrested as described in Table I, incubated for 5 min with serum (15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum), human recombinant FGF (100 ng/ml), ACTH (Acthar; 0.1 milliunits/ml) or PMA (0.1 μm) as indicated and then transferred to serum-free medium for 14 h. During the last 2 h of incubation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml). Values for thymidine incorporation and determinations of statistical significance were as described in Table I. To determine if the cells that were stimulated by ACTH to undergo progression from G1 to S also underwent mitosis, serum-starved Y1 cells were pulsed with ACTH for 5 min and incubated in serum-free medium for an additional 32 h to allow for cell division. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted in a hemocytometer. Treatment with ACTH resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in cell number compared with cells maintained over the same period in the absence of ACTH (p = 0.04), thereby demonstrating that short pulses of ACTH are mitogenic. To evaluate the contribution of the cAMP-signaling pathway to the stimulatory effect of ACTH on cell cycle progression, PKA-defective Kin-8 cells were growth-arrested and monitored for incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA in the presence of different stimuli. Kin-8 cells responded to a brief pulse of serum as did parental Y1 cells and exhibited a 5- ± 0.5-fold increase in thymidine incorporation (Table II) and a 1.6-fold increase in cell number (p < 0.001). ACTH also stimulated thymidine incorporation into Kin-8 DNA with a 3.4-fold increase that compared favorably with the 4-fold increase seen in parental Y1 cells (Table II) and with a 1.4-fold increase in cell number (p < 0.001) that was not significantly different from the effect of serum. Together, these results indicate that ACTH stimulated adrenal cell proliferation through a cAMP- and PKA-independent mechanism. In both parent Y1 cells and mutant Kin-8 cells, PMA stimulated the transition from G1 to S (Table II), suggesting a possible role for protein kinase C as a mediator of ACTH action. To determine if the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of ACTH on cell cycle progression could be temporally dissociated, labeling indices were determined after incubating serum-starved Y1 cells with FGF together with ACTH added at two different intervals in G1. As shown in Table III, the addition of FGF or ACTH to serum-starved Y1 cells during the first 2 h of G1 increased labeling indices 3.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, over serum-starved controls. The addition of FGF together with ACTH for the first 2 h of G1 only modestly inhibited the increase in cell cycle progression (38%), whereas the addition of ACTH 2 h after the pulse with FGF inhibited cell cycle progression more dramatically (64%). These observations suggest that ACTH acts at a point early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle to stimulate progression to S phase and acts later in G1 to arrest cell cycle progression.Table IIITemporal effects of ACTH and FGF on cell cycle progression in Y1 adrenal cellsFirst treatmentSecond treatmentLabeled nucleiIncrement over control0–2 h4–6 h%%None9.40.0FGF34.024.6ACTH17.4*8.0*FGF + ACTH24.615.2FGFACTH18.3*8.9*Y1 cells were plated on coverslips, serum-starved for 48 h, and then treated with 100 milliunits/ml ACTH (porcine, Sigma), 20 ng/ml recombinant bovine FGF, or a combination of ACTH + FGF for 2 h as indicated.

ACTH and fetal bovine serum caused c-FOS to accumulate more rapidly than did FGF; however, the effects of ACTH and FGF on c-FOS accumulation were sustained over 6 h, whereas the effects of fetal bovine serum were transient and declined after 4 h. The results presented here demonstrate that ACTH, administered to Y1 cells as a short pulse early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, activates MAP kinase (Fig. 2), promotes the progression of cells from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to S phase (Table IIand Fig. 4), and ultimately stimulates cell division. These effects of ACTH appear to be independent of the cAMP-signaling cascade since ACTH also exerts these effects in the PKA-defective mutant, Kin-8, and may involve a PKC-dependent pathway since these actions of ACTH are mimicked by a pulse of PMA (Fig. 2 and Table II). ACTH is known to activate PKC in Y1 cells (33Widmaier E.P. Hall P.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1985; 43: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) 2C. Frigeri and H. A. Armelin, unpublished observations. lending further support to this latter hypothesis. There are, however, other potential pathways through which ACTH may activate the MAP kinase cascade and stimulate cell proliferation. For example, other hormones acting through G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate MAP kinasevia a pathway involving activation of G protein β/γ subunits, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and a src-like tyrosine kinase (34Garnovskaya M.N. van Biesen T. Hawes B. Ramos S.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13716-13722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relative contribution of the protein kinase C pathway to the proliferative effects of ACTH has yet to be established. ACTH also stimulates the rapid accumulation of c-FOS protein (Fig. 5). Although not rigorously established in our experiments, results from other systems suggest that this effect of ACTH is likely to be mediated by activation of the MAP kinase-signaling cascade (36Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ACTH-stimulated increase in c-FOS accumulation (Fig. 5) occurs subsequent to the activation of MAP kinase by ACTH (Fig. 2) and also appears to be mediated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway rather than by a cAMP-dependent mechanism (10Kimura E. Armelin H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3518-3521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kimura E. Sonobe M.H. Armelin M.C.S. Armelin H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The observations that ACTH and serum stimulate c-FOS accumulation more rapidly than does FGF (Fig. 5) is also consistent with this hypothesis since ACTH and serum activate the MAP kinase cascade more rapidly than does FGF (Fig. 1). 3B. P. Schimmer and Z. Todorovic, unpublished observations. The transient effect of serum on c-FOS accumulation (Fig. 5) suggests the presence of specific serum factors that control either the stability of the c-fos transcript or c-FOS protein but which appear not to have an impact on the generation of the mitogenic signal. Although Y1 cells are of tumor origin, the cell line behaves in many other respects like normal adrenocortical cells and has long been used as a model adrenocortical cell system (37Schimmer B.P. Sato G. Functionally Differentiated Cell Lines. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1981: 61-92Google Scholar, 38Schimmer B.P. Gupta R.S. Drug Resistance in Mammalian Cells. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 185-210Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that ACTH under appropriate circumstances can stimulate the proliferation of Y1 adrenal cells may be physiologically relevant. The results presented here suggest that the trophic effects of ACTH on the adrenal cortex may result from a direct mitogenic effect of the hormone rather than from an indirect effect as postulated previously (2Hornsby P.J. Endocr. Res. 1985; 10: 259-281Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, our results provide a rationale for the inductive effects of ACTH on genes associated with cell proliferation such as ornithine decarboxylase (9Kudlow J.E. Rae P.A. Gutmann N.S.

Biol. 1994; 50: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that were previously considered to be paradoxical effects of the hormone. Our results also may bear on the controversy regarding the origins of the proliferative cells of the adrenal cortex. According to one hypothesis, proliferative adrenal cells arise from a population of undifferentiated stem cells that expand and differentiate as they move through the distinct zones of the cortex, whereas an alternate hypothesis suggests that proliferative cells arise from differentiated zones of the gland (39Mitani F. Miyamoto H. Mukai K. Ishimura Y. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40Holzwarth M.A. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Engeland W.C. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our results that demonstrate proliferative effects of ACTH on a differentiated cell line would seem to be more consistent with the hypothesis that proliferating adrenal cells arise from differentiated zones of the gland rather than from an undifferentiated stem cell population. With prolonged treatment, ACTH inhibits G1 to S progression in Y1 cells (Table I). Our results indicate that the growth-inhibitory effect of ACTH does not result from inhibition of the MAP kinase isoforms Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 2). Instead, preliminary results suggest that growth inhibition may result from a posttranscriptional effect of ACTH leading to destabilization of c-myc transcripts (for discussion, see Ref. 8Armelin H.A. Lotfi C.F.P. Lepique A.P. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although cAMP analogs and phorbol esters both mimic the growth-inhibiting effect of ACTH, the hormone clearly acts through a cAMP-dependent pathway since the inhibitory effects of ACTH and cAMP analogs are abolished in PKA-defective Kin mutants, whereas the growth-inhibitory effects of phorbol esters persist (7Schimmer B.P.

Res. 1996; 22: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).3 The results presented here describe opposing effects of ACTH on Y1 cell proliferation. ACTH administered as a pulse early in the G1phase of the cell cycle stimulates progression to S phase and mitosis, whereas administration of ACTH near the midpoint of G1arrests cell cycle progression (Table III) and is growth inhibitory (7Schimmer B.P. Schulz P. Endocr. Res. 1985; 11: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On this basis we suggest that the growth-inhibitory effect of ACTH represents a checkpoint in mid-G1 that limits the mitogenic activity of the hormone. We further suggest that a mitogenic response to ACTH must involve other factors that overcome the growth-inhibitory influence of ACTH at or near the midpoint of G1.

In the presence of T3, the TR recruits coactivating proteins that both modulate and integrate the ligand response. We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the TR ligand-binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a cDNA sequence that encodes a protein of 920 amino acids with a size of 120 kDa (p120). Alignment with known sequences shows homology to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant protein. Interaction studies demonstrate that p120 interacts with the TR AF-2 domain in the presence of ligand through a 111-amino acid region. Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human tissues. Cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that p120 enhances TR-mediated transactivation on multiple T3 response elements in the presence of T3. In addition, CREB-binding protein synergizes with p120 to enhance this effect. When linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, p120 is an activator of transcription alone.

On positive TREs, the TR acts as a repressor in the absence of thyroid hormone (T3) through its ability to interact with the nuclear corepressor family of proteins, which bind to the TR hinge region (7Chen J.D.

Nuclear receptors, including the TR, have two distinct transcriptional activation domains, an AF-1 domain in the N terminus (18Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N.

A. 1995; 92: 5600-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and an AF-2 domain in the extreme C terminus, a well conserved region among nuclear receptors (NRs) that is believed to be essential for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (21Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Durand B. Saunder M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P.

Recently, x-ray crystallographic studies of the rat TRα1 ligand-binding domain revealed that a conformational change in the hormone-binding cavity is formed, exposing the AF-2 region when ligand binds to the receptor (24Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Mutation of the AF-2 region of the TR causes the receptor to lose its ability to activate transcription despite its ability to bind both ligand and DNA, suggesting that TR-associated coactivators require an intact AF-2 region to interact with the TR (25Barettino D. Ruiz M.D.V. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Uppaluri R. Towle H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, putative coactivators should interact with the TR AF-2 domain and be able to enhance ligand-dependent stimulation. The recently identified coactivators SRC-1, TIF2, and RIP140 all appear to bind the NR AF-2 domain, although one report suggests that SRC-1 may interact with other regions of the TR (12Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 14Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W.

Once bound to the coactivator, it is likely that other proteins are necessary for the TR to mediate transcriptional enhancement. Recently, it has been reported that activation by NRs can be enhanced by the CREB-binding protein-binding protein (CBP/p300) through a direct ligand-dependent interaction (13Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T.

Furthermore, CBP/p300 also interacts with SRC-1, suggesting that CBP/p300 may play a role as an integrator of NR-mediated activation of gene expression (28Yao T.-P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R.

While a number of possible proteins that mediate the response to thyroid hormone have been identified, it is likely that tissue-specific responses will depend on the existence of other coactivators whose regulation in certain tissues may be paramount in mediating the T3 response. To address this issue further, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate TR-interacting proteins (32Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). We have isolated a novel protein (p120) that contains a bromodomain in its C terminus and that interacts with the TR in a ligand-dependent manner both in yeast and in vitro. This ligand-dependent interaction is dependent upon an intact AF-2 domain. Furthermore, cotransfection studies in mammalian cells demonstrate that p120 enhances the AF-2 function of the TR. When linked to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, p120 is a significant activator of transcription. Taken together, these data indicate that p120 is a nuclear receptor coactivator. Further studies will be needed to address its physiologic role. A PstI-PstI cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 204–461 of the human TRβ1 isoform was ligated to the EcoRI-PstI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) using anEcoRI-PstI-BamHI adaptor. The yeast strain HF7c was cotransfected with the GAL4-TRβ1 construct and a human placenta cDNA library in pGAD10 (CLONTECH) as described previously (9Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated onto synthetic complete media plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Viable colonies were dissolved in 40 μl of Z buffer (0.06 mNa2HPO4, 0.04 mNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm KCl). The colonies were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and thawed at room temperature. This freeze-thaw step was repeated again. β-Galactosidase activity in yeast cells was measured by a chemiluminescent assay (Tropix Inc.). Identification of positive clones was performed by culturing His+Lac+ transformant yeast colonies in 3 ml of liquid synthetic medium (without Trp and Leu) in the presence or absence of 10−6m T3. For analysis of the interaction of p120 constructs with TRβ1, a sense oligonucleotide, p120 START (5′-GCGGGAATTCTCTTCTGTCATGAGAAGTGG-3′), and the pKCR2-end primer (5′-TAACCATTATAAGCTGCAAT-3′) in the antisense orientation were used to amplify the entire p120 cDNA and, at the same time, create a unique EcoRI site at the 5′ terminus. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with Asp-718, blunt-ended with Klenow polymerase, and then digested withEcoRI. The p120 cDNA was ligated into pGAD24 that had been digested with EcoRI and SmaI. p120 deletion mutants were created by using unique restriction sites and then ligated into pGAD10 or pGAD24 in frame. Interactions were studied in the yeast strain HF7c as described above by transforming with the appropriate pGBT9 and pGAD24 constructs. Transformants were plated onto synthetic complete media plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan that either lacked ligand or contained 1 μm T3. After 3–4 days, viable colonies were dissolved in 40 μl of Z buffer. The colonies were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and thawed at room temperature. This freeze-thaw step was repeated again. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the chemiluminescent assay. Each point is the result of between two and four separate transformations with between 6 and 12 colonies selected for β-galactosidase determination. The Uni-ZAP XR fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with the original 900-bp insert of pGAD10-p120 labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming under high stringency conditions. The largest hybridizing clone contained a 3.2-kilobase pair insert. No clones were identified that contained sequences 5′ to those found in the putative full-length clone. The cDNA was sequenced and shown to contain the entire 920-amino acid open reading frame. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a32P-labeled amino-terminal 0.8-kbEcoRI-SacI cDNA fragment of p120 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Restriction fragments of p120 cDNA were ligated in frame into pGEX4T1 or pGEX4T2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to yield GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH5α. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interaction assays were carried out with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated (TNT reticulocyte lysate, Promega) TRβ1 or TRβ1 E457A incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads in a total volume of 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol). The concentration of T3 used was 100 nm. After four washes with 500 μl of binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The positive TRE constructs each consist of two copies of a DR+4 element, a palindromic element, or a F2-Lys element ligated upstream of the TK109 promoter in the vector pA3Luc as described previously (9Hollenberg A.N.

MMTV-Luc contains the murine mammary tumor virus promoter in pA3Luc (33Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner M.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J.

TRβ1, human RARα, and the human ER were cloned into the SV40-driven expression vector pKCR2. The human AR was cloned into the SV40-driven expression vector pECE (a gift of S. Balk). All TR mutants were made by oligonucleotide selection (34Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and cloned into pKCR2. p120 was also cloned into pKCR2. The cDNAs encoding human F-SRC-1 (a gift of W. W. Chin (14Takeshita A.

UAS-TKLuc contains five copies of the 17-bp upstream activating sequence upstream of TK-Luc, and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain is in the pECE vector (36Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3945-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The p120 constructs (amino acids 1–920 and 1–297) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and placed in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. GAL4-VP-16 contains the VP-16 activation domain linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. All plasmids for transfection were prepared by column purification (QIAGEN Inc.) and were generally subjected to two separate plasmid preparations. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin, and amphotericin. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate technique in six-well plates with each well, unless otherwise indicated, receiving 1.7 μg of reporter, 20 ng of expression vector, and 500 ng of pKCR2 alone or with an equal amount of pKCR2-p120 or pKCR2-SRC-1. Each well also received 20 ng of a cytomegalovirus-driven β-galactosidase expression vector to control for transfection efficiency. 18–20 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% steroid hormone-depleted fetal bovine serum ± ligand (100 nm T3). To remove steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, fetal bovine serum was treated with 50 mg/ml activated charcoal (Sigma) and 30 mg/ml anion-exchange resin (type AG X8, analytical grade, Bio-Rad). 40–44 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in extraction buffer and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Tropix Inc.). Luciferase activities were corrected for β-galactosidase activity as indicated. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The data are the pooled results ± S.E. EMSA was carried out using 3–4 μl of in vitro translated nuclear receptors from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). GST-p120-(186–297) and GST alone were made as described above and eluted from glutathione-agarose beads in a Tris/glutathione buffer. 15 μg of GST-p120 or GST alone were used in the EMSAs. The proteins were incubated with 50,000–75,000 cpm of a 32P-radiolabeled probe in the presence of salmon sperm, poly-deoxy-inosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid, and dithiothreitol for 20 min at room temperature. Complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. The concentration of T3 used was 100 nm. The GenBank™ accession number for the cDNA sequence of p120 is AF016270. To identify proteins that interact with the TR, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. The hinge region and the ligand-binding domain of human TRβ1 (amino acids 204–461) were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the vector pGBT9. This GAL4 DNA-binding domain-TR construct was used to screen a human placenta cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain. We identified a number of positive clones, two of which showed a significant enhancement of interaction in the presence of T3 (Fig. 1). One of these clones was identified as TRIP1, which has been previously demonstrated to interact with the TR in yeast and mammalian cells (17Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the other showed a 900-bp clone that appeared to be a portion of a previously identified clone termed skeletal muscle abundant protein (SMAP; GenBank™/EMBL accession number X87613), which was identified randomly from a Jurkat cell library and felt to be a transcription factor based on the presence of a bromodomain in its C terminus (37Nielsen M.S. Petersen C.M. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To gain a full-length version of this protein, a human fetal brain cDNA library was screened using the cDNA recovered from the yeast two-hybrid screen. Two positive clones were identified. Both have similar 5′- and 3′-ends; however, one of the clones contains an internal deletion and is currently being evaluated. The other clone was found to be 3154 bp and to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 920 amino acids (Fig. 2). While the coding and amino acid sequences are similar to that of SMAP, an insertion of 5 nucleotides in the putative 5′-untranslated region of SMAP leads to the addition of 116 amino acids to the open reading frame such that homology to the 5′-end of SMAP begins at amino acid 117. A second insertion leads to a 40-amino acid insertion at amino acid 304, and a third insertion of 15 amino acids is present at amino acid 887 of this novel clone, which is not present in SMAP. Otherwise, the two proteins are identical. The relationship between this protein and SMAP is depicted in Fig. 2 A. The predicted molecular mass of this novel protein is 100 kDa, and that achieved with in vitrotranslation is 120 kDa; and we have termed the protein p120. The protein contains a number of putative nuclear localization signals present in the amino terminus and a conserved bromodomain between amino acids 772 and 857 (38Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is remote amino acid homology (14%) between amino acids 254–743 of p120 and amino acids 426–916 of TIF2. The initial placental clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen contains an additional 21 bp 5′ to the cDNA sequence isolated from the human fetal brain library. An in-frame ATG codon is present, but we could not identify this sequence in additional library screening. Interestingly, a mouse-expressed sequence tag (ma33eo1.r1) from brain of 294 bp, which is nearly homologous to p120, also contains a 20-bp extension from the cDNA identified. However, this extension is not homologous to the human sequence. Thus, the significance of further 5′-sequences remains to be determined. To determine whether p120 is expressed only in certain tissues, we performed Northern analysis on multiple human tissues using a probe encompassing the first 800 bp of the p120 cDNA sequence. Our results, shown in Fig. 3, are consistent with those of Nielsen et al. (37Nielsen M.S. Petersen C.M. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) from their analysis of SMAP expression and demonstrate widespread expression of a 3.5-kb isoform and more restricted expression of a larger isoform of 4.8 kb that is predominantly expressed in the placenta, liver, and pancreas. We also performed a similar analysis on a variety of human cell lines and found that the 3.5-kb species was present in all cell lines examined (data not shown). Thus, like other coactivators, p120 appears to be expressed ubiquitously. As the initial yeast clone contained the first 297 amino acids of p120, we chose to examine this region for a specific TR-interacting domain. We inserted the full-length p120 molecule and a number of its derivatives in frame with the GAL4 activation domain in vector pGAD24. Interactions were examined in yeast with the TR C terminus or TR mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. In the absence of ligand, each of the p120 constructs containing amino acids 186–297 had very little ability to interact with the TR C terminus (Fig. 4 A). The addition of T3 allowed the full-length construct and other constructs that contained amino acids 186–297 to interact strongly with the TR. Surprisingly, amino acids 1–187 alone have a significant ligand-independent ability to interact with the TR. These data suggest that amino acids 186–297 act as an interacting switch to promote interaction in the presence of ligand. Analysis of the sequence in this region of p120 shows a consensus NR box (LSELL, amino acids 240–244) that appears to be essential for mediating interactions with the nuclear hormone receptors and that is present in most of the other identified coactivating proteins (39Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 40Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). A second such motif exists outside of the identified interacting domain (amino acids 309–313), and its function has not been ascertained. To confirm these observations, we performed similar experimentsin vitro with bacterially expressed GST-p120 derivatives. As Fig. 4 B demonstrates, amino acids 1–297 promote a strong ligand-dependent interaction (lanes 2 and3), whereas deletion of amino acids 186–297 causes p120 to bind the TR in a ligand-independent fashion only (lanes 4and 5), similar to what was found in yeast. Finally, GST-p120-(186–297) was able to function independently to promote a very strong ligand-dependent interaction with the TR (lanes 6 and 7). Taken together, these data confirm the importance of a small region of p120 in being responsible for the ligand-dependent association between the TR and p120. We next examined the ability of the TR AF-2 mutant to interact with p120. We used the E457A mutant, which has been demonstrated to bind ligand normally yet be transcriptionally inactive (21Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid system, there was very little interaction between TR E457A and the amino-terminal portion of p120 (amino acids 1–297) as shown in Fig. 5 A. Similar data were found using GST-p120-(1–297), where no evidence of a ligand-dependent interaction was seen (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that these solution assays were in agreement with DNA binding studies, we performed EMSA with the p120 interacting domain andin vitro translated wild-type TR and TR E457A. As Fig.5 C demonstrates, the p120 fragment bound to the wild-type TR homodimer and heterodimer in the presence of T3 only. In contrast, the TR AF-2 mutant could not bind to p120 on this DR+4 element despite binding ligand normally. Thus, in agreement with the principle of coactivation, an intact AF-2 domain is essential for the TR to interact with p120. Further analysis of the domains of the TR necessary for interacting with p120 was also performed both in yeast and using GST fusion proteins. Our data demonstrate that an intact hinge region, which is necessary for binding corepressor proteins is not necessary to bind p120 (data not shown). Because p120 interacts strongly with the TR in the presence of ligand, we next examined its ability to functionally affect T3-mediated activation of gene expression. We cotransfected CV-1 cells with three separate positive TREs upstream of the TK109 promoter linked to luciferase. In each case, excess cotransfected p120 was able to augment ligand-dependent activation of reporter expression by 2–3-fold both in terms of overall luciferase expression and -fold activation over basal levels (Fig.6 A). p120 had little effect on basal activity (in the absence of T3) with each of the three reporters studied. The parental vector containing the TK109 promoter alone was not affected by cotransfected p120. Similar data were also obtained with single palindromic and DR+4 TREs linked to the SV40 promoter (data not shown). Thus, cotransfected p120 is able to function efficiently when cotransfect"
https://openalex.org/W1974078926,"Cell differentiation is determined by a certain set of transcription factors such as MyoD in myogenesis. However, transcription factors that play a positive role in phenotypic gene expression in skeletal cells are largely unknown, except the recently identified CBFA1. Scleraxis is a helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor whose transcripts are expressed in sclerotome and in a certain set of skeletal cells; however, nothing is known about its function with regard to the regulation of cell function. To examine possible roles of scleraxis, we overexpressed scleraxis in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells, which express low levels of scleraxis. Scleraxis overexpression enhanced expression of the aggrecan gene, which is not normally expressed at high levels in these osteoblastic cells. Overexpression of scleraxis also increased mRNA levels of type II collagen and osteopontin while suppressing expression of osteoblast phenotype-related genes encoding type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase. Transient transfection experiments indicated that scleraxis enhanced the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the reporter construct AgCAT-8, which contained an 8-kilobase pair (kb) fragment of the aggrecan gene including both the promoter and its first intron. Deletion analysis identified a 1-kb region that is responsive to scleraxis within the aggrecan gene. This region contains two adjacent E-box sequences. A 29-base pair DNA fragment (AgE) containing these E-box sequences bound to proteins in the ROS17/2.8 cell nuclear extracts as well as to in vitro translated scleraxis. This binding was competed with unlabeled AgE, but not with a mutated E-box DNA sequence (mAgE), indicating the specificity of the binding activity. The AgE binding activity in the ROS17/2.8 cell nuclear extracts was enhanced in the cells overexpressing scleraxis and was supershifted by the antiserum raised against scleraxis. Furthermore, AgE, but not mAgE, conferred responsiveness to scleraxis overexpression to a heterologous promoter. Finally, replacement mutation of the AgE sequence within the 2.5-kb AgCAT-1 construct significantly reduced its responsiveness to scleraxis. These results indicate that overexpression of a single helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor, scleraxis, enhances aggrecan gene expression via binding to the E-box-containing AgE sequence in ROS17/2.8 cells.

Determination of specific cell fate is under the control of a certain set of various types of transcription factors. Among these, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; FBS, fetal bovine serum; kb, kilobase pair(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; FBS, fetal bovine serum; kb, kilobase pair(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.-type transcription factor family is well known for its critical role in the transcriptional regulation of cellular differentiation in myogenesis, hematopoiesis, and neurogenesis (1Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Weintraub H.

In this machinery, tissue-specific gene transcription is positively regulated by formation of heterodimers between tissue-specific bHLH proteins and ubiquitous bHLH proteins such as E12/E47 (5Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar), whereas it is negatively regulated by another type of regulatory HLH protein lacking the basic DNA-binding domain, such as Id (6Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). These heterodimers interact withcis-acting elements (CANNTG) called E-boxes, which are located in the promoter/enhancer regions of tissue-specific genes (1Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Weintraub H.

Although no skeletal tissue-specific HLH transcription factors have yet been identified, E-box sites are present in the promoters of the genes encoding osteocalcin (7Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), osteopontin, 2M. Noda, unpublished observation. 2M. Noda, unpublished observation. and alkaline phosphatase,2 which are the markers of osteoblastic differentiation (9Rodan G.A. Noda M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar, 10Siddhanti S. Quarles D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that osteoblasts express ubiquitous type HLH transcription factors and that expression of such HLH transcription factors is under the control of calciotropic hormones and cytokines (7Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Kawaguchi N. Deluca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Scleraxis has recently been identified as a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its mRNA is expressed in mouse embryos between days 9.5 and 10.5 post-coitum in sclerotomes and in mesenchymal cells of the body wall and limb buds. Subsequently, scleraxis is expressed at high levels within mesenchymal precursors of the axial and appendicular skeletons and in cranial mesenchyme in advance of chondrogenesis (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scleraxis is also expressed in osteoblastic osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 cells, although at low levels, and its expression is regulated by transforming growth factor-β, which has been implicated in bone formation (13Liu Y Cserjesi P. Nifuji A. Olson E.N. Noda M. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 151: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, nothing was known about its functional role in the regulation of cell fate. To explore the roles of scleraxis in the regulation of skeletal cell functions, we overexpressed scleraxis in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells by establishing stably transfected cell lines. We found that scleraxis enhanced expression of the aggrecan gene and suppressed expression of the type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase genes in these osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells. Analysis of the aggrecan promoter showed that scleraxis enhanced aggrecan gene transcription via its E-box-containing sequence (AgE). These data suggest that scleraxis could be one of the key regulatory transcription factors that are involved in the positive regulation of genes encoding proteins of chondrogenic phenotype. ROS17/2.8 cells were provided by Dr. Gideon Rodan (Merck Research Laboratories) and were maintained in modified F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (14Noda M. Rodan G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All cultures were fed with fresh medium every 2–3 days. Stable transfections were carried out by employing the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described by Parker and Stark (15Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of expression vector plasmid containing scleraxis cDNA and 0.5 μg of neo expression vector. Other sets of cells were transfected with the neo vector alone. After a 4-h incubation, the cells were treated with 15% glycerol for 30 s. Approximately 24 h later, the cells were trypsinized, replated at 6 × 104 cells in a 56-cm2 dish, and fed with modified F-12 medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (16Davies J. Jimenez A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 29: 1089-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with 5% FBS. After 1 month of culture, individual clones were isolated. RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted according to the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was subjected to Northern analysis by fractionation on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.66 mformaldehyde. The RNAs were transferred to nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) by electroblotting for 18 h (18Thomas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5857) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kb scleraxis cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (New Life Science Products) using random primers and the Klenow fragment (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs for osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase were gifts from Dr. Gideon Rodan; α1(I) collagen cDNA was provided by Dr. Barbara Kream (University of Connecticut); and glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was provided by Dr. Sevgi Rodan. Filters were hybridized to the probes overnight at 42 °C in hybridization solution containing 50% formaldehyde, 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 mNaCl and 10 mm sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mg/ml sheared and denatured herring sperm DNA. Membranes were washed at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C using intensifying screens. Transfection of plasmid DNA into ROS17/2.8 cells was performed using DNA-lipid complexes (20Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Roman H. Roman W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of scleraxis expression vector (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 μg of aggrecan reporter plasmids (AgCAT-8, AgCAT-1, or AgCAT-6 containing a 8-, 2.5-, or 1-kb fragment of the promoter/exon 1 (encoding the 5′-untranslated region)/intron 1 segments of the mouse aggrecan gene, respectively) (21Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The scleraxis expression vector was also cotransfected with AgE-CAT or mAgE-CAT, which were constructed by inserting a 29-base pair double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a region (designated as AgE) from positions +219 to +247 into the BglII site of the pCAT™ promoter plasmid (Promega). The oligonucleotides contained either two E-boxes (AgE-CAT, 5′-gatctCGGCTAGCATCTGACGCAGGTGCCGAGGGa-3′; E-box, underlined) or two mutated E-boxes (mAgE-CAT, 5′-gatctCGGCTAGAAAAAAACGTTTTTTCCGAGGGa-3′). Bluescript SK+was used as a control (22Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, a Practical Approach. II. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 144-147Google Scholar). Another mutant construct (mAgCAT-1) was prepared by introducing a replacement mutation (mAg, 5′-AAAAAAACGTTTTTT-3′) in the context of the 2.5-kb aggrecan promoter (AgCAT-1) according to the method described (23Deng W. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The cells were exposed to the DNA solution for 3 h and then cultured in fresh F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. After 48 h, the cell extracts were prepared for analysis of CAT activity. Equivalent amounts of cellular proteins were incubated in the reaction buffer (0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm acetyl-CoA (Sigma), and 1.85 GBq/mmol [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Corp.)) overnight at 37 °C. The level of acetylation was examined by TLC followed by autoradiography of the TLC plates. Quantitation of acetylation ratios was performed with a Bioimaging Analyzer Bas 2000 (Fuji Film Inc., Tokyo, Japan). RNA was synthesized in a 25-μl reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C with a substrate of 1 μg of linearized DNA and Cap analog (Life Technologies, Inc.) and T7 polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of RNasin (Boehringer Mannheim). The RNA was phenol- and chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The ethanol precipitate was resuspended in 20 μl of water. In vitro translation of the RNA (2–6 μl) was done with a rabbit recticulocyte lysate (Amersham Corp.) in a 50-μl reaction mixture. Proteins were synthesized at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine. Translation efficiency was monitored by SDS-12% polyacylamide gel electrophoresis of the 35S-labeled proteins. For DNA binding assays, we prepared in vitro translated proteins as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) from ROS17/2.8 cells and scleraxis-overexpressing clonal cells. For EMSAs, a 29-base pair double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence (AgE) from positions +219 to +247 containing the E-boxes was used. A BglII site was attached to each end of the oligonucleotides (indicated by lower-case letters below). The AgE sequence of the upper strand of this oligonucleotide was as follows: top strand, 5′-gatctCGGCTAGCATCTGACGCAGGTGCCGAGGGa-3′; and bottom strand, 5′-gatctCCCTCGGCACCTGCGTCAGATGCTAGCCGa-3′ with E-box underlined). These oligonucleotides were annealed to form the AgE sequence probe and labeled by a filling-in reaction at their 5′-protruded ends using [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment. Unincorporated label was removed by passing the probes over Sephadex G-50 columns. Aliquots of 20,000 cpm of the probe were incubated with 15 μg of nuclear protein for 15 min at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of double-stranded unlabeled probes was included in the binding reactions. The competitors were either the unlabeled AgE sequence as described above or the mutated AgE sequence designated as mAgE. We also used scleraxis E-box oligonucleotides (ScxE) and mutated ScxE oligonucleotides (mScxE) as competitors since the ScxE oligonucleotide containing an E-box sequence (5′-CCGAACACATGTGCCCGC-3′; with the E-box underlined) was formerly reported (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be preferentially bound by scleraxis. Within the ScxE sequence, only the E-box was mutated to produce mScxE (from CATGTG to AATTTA). These double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min before the addition of the probe. The DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel as described (7Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the supershift experiments, 1-μl aliquots of 0.1 μg/μl IgG or antiserum raised against scleraxis were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min before electrophoresis. To examine functional roles of scleraxis in the regulation of skeletal cell phenotype expression, we transfected a scleraxis expression vector into several types of cell lines. Since C3H10T1/2 cells are known to be pluripotent and can give rise to several types of mesenchymal cells, we first tried scleraxis transfection into these cells. However, we did not find any alteration in their expression of genes related to skeletal phenotypes. Since we previously found that scleraxis is expressed in the osteoblastic cell line ROS17/2.8, although at low levels, we then tried to overexpress scleraxis in these cells. We generated permanent transfectant cell lines by introducing a scleraxis expression vector and a neo expression vector into ROS17/2.8 cells. Two G418-resistant transformant clones (S1 and S2) were isolated. Northern analysis of the RNA prepared from these cells is shown in Fig. 1. Scleraxis overexpression in the transfected cells was confirmed by the increased levels of the exogenous scleraxis mRNA in the S1 and S2 clones (Fig. 1, Scx panel). To our surprise, scleraxis overexpression in the osteoblast-like cells enhanced expression of mRNAs encoding cartilage-specific markers in the S1 and S2 clones (Fig. 1) compared with control neo-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig. 1,lane N). Aggrecan mRNA expression was most potently enhanced in the permanent scleraxis transfectants (Fig. 1, Agg panel). Interestingly, type II collagen mRNA was expressed at a low level in control neo-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig. 1), and scleraxis overexpression also enhanced type II collagen mRNA expression (Fig. 1, II Col panel). Furthermore, the enhanced expression of cartilage phenotype-related genes was accompanied by the suppression of the mRNA levels of type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1, I Col and AP panels). These data reveal that scleraxis functions in modulating expression of several skeletal phenotype-related genes. Scleraxis overexpression also enhanced mRNA expression of osteopontin, which has been known to be expressed both in osteoblasts and chondrocytes (Fig. 1, OP panel). Overexpression of scleraxis did not alter GAPDH message levels in these clones compared with control neo-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells, indicating the specificity of the scleraxis effect (Fig. 1,GAPDH panel). The levels of expression of the examined genes in the control neo-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells were comparable to those of the parental nontransfected ROS17/2.8 cells (data not shown). To examine whether scleraxis activates the transcriptional activity of the aggrecan gene, a CAT reporter gene construct (AgCAT-8) containing an 8-kb fragment of the mouse aggrecan gene including the promoter, the first exon, and a part of the first intron (Fig.2 A) (21Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with the scleraxis expression vector into ROS17/2.8 cells. Scleraxis overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the AgCAT-8 construct severalfold (Fig. 2 B, lanes 13 and14 versus lanes 15 and 16). To further determine whether any particular region of the aggrecan gene responds to scleraxis overexpression, we also examined the CAT activities of the two other deletion constructs, AgCAT-1 (2.5 kb) and AgCAT-6 (1 kb). The CAT activities of these constructs were also enhanced by cotransfection with the scleraxis expression vector (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 11 and 12, respectively). On the other hand, scleraxis overexpression did not affect the activity of the control pSV2CAT construct, indicating the specificity of the effect of scleraxis on the aggrecan promoter (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and4). Within the 1-kb aggrecan gene fragment, we identified a 29-base pair region, which we designated as AgE (5′-CGGCTAGCATCTGACGCAGGTGCCGAGGG-3′), containing two adjacently positioned E-box sequences (underlined) at positions +226 to +240. To examine whether AgE is the target site of scleraxis, we conducted EMSAs using AgE as a probe. As shown in Fig.3 (lane 1), AgE bound the proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells in the EMSA. This binding was competed with the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled AgE (Fig. 3, lane 2), but not with mAgE (lane 3), which contains substitution mutations (underlined) in the E-box sequences (5′-CGGCTAGAAAAAAACGTTTTTTCCGAGGG-3′), indicating the specificity of the binding activity. The binding activity was also competed with a 100-fold molar excess of the ScxE sequence (Fig. 3, lane 4), which is another E-box sequence (CATGTG) known to bind scleraxis preferentially (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not competed with the mScxE sequence, which contains substitution mutations in the E-box (from CATGTG to AATTTA) (lane 5). This is consistent with our previous observation that scleraxis is expressed in these cells, although at a low level (Fig. 1, Scx panel,lane N) (13Liu Y Cserjesi P. Nifuji A. Olson E.N. Noda M. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 151: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This band was supershifted when the antiserum raised against scleraxis was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated for 20 min before EMSA (Fig. 3, lane 6). IgG alone did not supershift the band (Fig. 3, lane 7), and the supershifted band was competed with the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled AgE (lane 8). To further examine whether the AgE sequence directly binds scleraxis, scleraxis protein was synthesized in vitro and subjected to EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, AgE bound scleraxis protein (lane 1), and this band was competed with AgE or ScxE (lanes 2 and 4, respectively), but not with mAgE or mScxE (lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Antiserum against Scx, but not IgG, supershifted the band (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively), and the supershifted band was also competed with AgE (lane 8). For confirmation, the in vitrotranslation product was visualized by labeling the protein and analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which showed two bands, and the apparent molecular size of the top band was ∼20 kDa (Fig. 4 B), which is slightly smaller than the estimated size of scleraxis (22 kDa), possibly due to truncation during in vitrotranslation. AgE binding to nuclear proteins was increased in the nuclear extract prepared from scleraxis-overexpressing ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig. 5, lane 3, thick arrow) compared with the control cells (lane 2). Furthermore, an additional slower mobility band was observed in scleraxis-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, lane 3, thin arrow). The addition of the antiserum against scleraxis supershifted these bands to yield the one major slowest mobility band (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5,arrowhead).Figure 5AgE binding activity is enhanced in the nuclear extract prepared from S1 clonal cells. EMSAs were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The AgE sequence corresponding to the region of the aggrecan gene from positions +219 to +247 containing two E-boxes (CATCTG and CAGGTG) was synthesized as a double-stranded oligonucleotide and used as a probe.Lane 1, free AgE probe alone; lanes 2 and4, nuclear extract prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells (C); lanes 3 and 5, nuclear extract prepared from S1 clonal cells (S).

To do this, AgE and mAgE were inserted in front of the heterologous SV40 promoter to yield two constructs, AgE-CAT and mAgE-CAT, respectively (Fig. 6 A). Each construct was cotransfected into ROS17/2.8 cells with the scleraxis expression vector or Bluescript SK+ as a control. As shown in Fig.6 B, (lanes 1 and2 versus lanes 3 and 4), scleraxis cotransfection enhanced the transcriptional activity of AgE-CAT severalfold. This scleraxis activation was no longer observed when mAgE-CAT and the scleraxis expression vector were cotransfected (Fig. 6 B,lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 7 and 8). The transcriptional activity of pSV2CAT in these cells was not affected by cotransfection with the scleraxis expression vector (Fig.6 B, lanes 9 and 10 versus 11 and12), indicating the specificity of the scleraxis effects on the E-box-containing sequence (AgE) in the aggrecan gene. To further confirm that the AgE sequence is critical to mediate scleraxis-dependent regulation in the context of the aggrecan gene, we introduced mutations into AgE in Ag-1, which contains a 2.5-kb fragment of the aggrecan gene. This 2.5-kb aggrecan gene fragment with a mutation in AgE was ligated in front of CAT to yield mAgCAT-1 (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig. 7 B (lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 7 and 8), scleraxis overexpression enhanced AgCAT-1 expression, whereas the effect of scleraxis overexpression was significantly reduced by introducing a mutation in AgE in the context of the 2.5-kb fragment. These data indicate that the AgE sequence is the scleraxis target site in the aggrecan gene. This study indicates for the first time that overexpression of a single type transcription factor induces expression of the aggrecan gene in osteoblastic osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 cells. Members of the helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor family have been previously implicated in differentiation of muscle cells or nerve cells (1Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Weintraub H.

However, nothing has been implicated in the positive regulation of the transactivation of skeletal tissue-specific gene expression except the recently identified CBFA1, which plays a crucial role in osteoblast differentiation (25Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar, 26Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

This report identifies scleraxis, a recently cloned member of the helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor family, as a regulator of chondrocyte-specific gene expression. In support for our observation, we also found that scleraxis is expressed at a high level in chondrocytes, such as TC6, which express the aggrecan and type II collagen genes.2 Overexpression of scleraxis enhanced expression of at least two cartilage-specific genes encoding aggrecan and type II collagen. Furthermore, our analysis of the aggrecan gene showed that the scleraxis effect was mediated by an 8-kb fragment. Further analysis of the 8-kb fragment identified that a 29-base pair region (AgE) located from positions +219 to +247, which contains two adjacent E-box sequences (positions +226 to +240), is responsible for the scleraxis binding and enhancement of aggrecan promoter activity. These results clearly indicate that the aggrecan gene is a direct target of scleraxis and that scleraxis exerts its effect via binding to E-box sequences in the aggrecan gene. Differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes is characterized by expression of markers specific to cartilage (28Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In the initial attempts to examine scleraxis function, we overexpressed scleraxis in C3H10T1/2 cells, but these experiments failed to show any alteration in expression of skeletal tissue-specific genes in these fibroblasts. Therefore, we examined ROS17/2.8 cells, which, as we reported (13Liu Y Cserjesi P. Nifuji A. Olson E.N. Noda M. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 151: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), expressed relatively low levels of scleraxis. In ROS17/2.8 cells, the effect of scleraxis overexpression is most potent in the activation of aggrecan gene expression. In addition, the type II collagen mRNA level is also increased. We have isolated three additional G418-resistant clones, and in all of the three additional clones, aggrecan mRNA levels were enhanced, but GAPDH mRNA levels were not altered (data not shown). Based on these observations, we assume that scleraxis may act as a regulatory transcription factor for expression of cartilage-specific genes, although further analyses of other cartilage-specific genes should follow. There is a certain difference in the levels of induction by scleraxis on the aggrecan gene and those on the type II collagen gene. The reasons for this are not clear at this point. The effect of scleraxis on expression of the aggrecan and type II collagen genes appears to be specific to this bHLH transcription factor since we did not see such change in stable overexpression of another related but distinct bHLH transcription factor, paraxis (29Burgess R. Cserjesi P. Ligon K. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which served as as control, in either C3H10T1/2 or ROS17/2.8 cells. (Paraxis mRNA was undetectable in these cells.) It is also intriguing to identify the reason(s) why scleraxis could enhance the aggrecan gene in ROS17/2.8 cells, but not in C3H10T1/2 cells. Since scleraxis did not induce chondrocyte-specific gene expression in C3H10T1/2 cells, it is likely that scleraxis acts as a downstream transcription factor, with a particularly strong effect on aggrecan gene expression. Another feature of scleraxis-overexpressing osteoblastic cells is the suppression of the osteoblast phenotype, i.e. suppression of type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression (Fig. 1). Osteocalcin mRNA expression was suppressed in one scleraxis-overexpressing clone, but was not affected in the other (data not shown). Osteopontin expression is enhanced strongly by scleraxis in ROS17/2.8 cells. It is, however, known that osteopontin is expressed in both cartilage and bone (8Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Positive and negative functions are known in myogenic differentiation factors such as MyoD and myogenin (1Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) in the case of muscle differentiation. In this case, MyoD enhances muscle-specific gene expression and at the same time suppresses nonmuscle phenotype expression. Similar to these observations, scleraxis could have a dual function; one is to enhance expression of chondrogenic phenotypes and the other is to suppress that of nonchondrogenic (in our case, osteoblastic) phenotypes. Basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors are known to bind tocis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions of target genes, and scleraxis/E12 heterodimers have been reported to bind to the E-box sequence (CANNTG), with a preference for the middle two nucleotides as TG or CA. The AgE region in the first exon of the aggrecan gene contains two E-boxes gapped by three nucleotides at positions +226 and +240. The middle two nucleotides in these E-boxes are TC and GG. This difference could be related to our observation that the AgE sequence binds in vitro translated scleraxis in the absence of E protein. Alternatively, the presence of two E-boxes in tandem could also facilitate scleraxis binding without E protein. It is noteworthy that the previously reported E-box sequence (ScxE) that requires heterodimers of scleraxis and E protein for binding (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is not from skeletal tissue-specific genes. This E-box sequence was actually derived from the promoter in a muscle-specific gene (muscle creatinine kinase). Cserjesi et al. (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not know any scleraxis target genes at that time; they screened only E-boxes that were known at that time. Since the aggrecan gene is the first gene to be identified as a scleraxis target, our AgE sequence is the first authentic E-box for scleraxis binding. These features could be the possible reason for the scleraxis binding to AgE without E protein. In summary, we found that scleraxis overexpression enhanced aggrecan gene expression in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells while it modulated osteoblastic phenotype expression. These features support the hypothesis that scleraxis is one of the key regulatory transcription factors in the modulation of chondrogenic and/or osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2129750326,"Cell-permeant peptidyl aldehydes and diazomethylketones are frequently utilized as inhibitors of regulatory intracellular proteases. In the present study the specificities of several peptidyl inhibitors for purified human μ-calpain and 20 S proteasome were investigated. Acetyl-LLnL aldehyde, acetyl-LLM aldehyde, carbobenzyloxy-LLnV aldehyde (ZLLnVal), and carbobenzyloxy-LLY-diazomethyl ketone produced half-maximum inhibition of the caseinolytic activity of μ-calpain at concentrations of 1–5 × 10−7m. In contrast, only ZLLnVal was a reasonably potent inhibitor of the caseinolytic activity of 20 S proteasome, producing 50% inhibition at 10−5m. The other inhibitors were at least 10-fold less potent, producing substantial inhibition only at near saturating concentrations in the assay buffer. Further studies with ZLLnVal demonstrated that its inhibition of the proteasome was independent of casein concentration over a 25-fold range. Proteolysis of calpastatin or lysozyme by the proteasome was half-maximally inhibited by 4 and 22 μm ZLLnVal, respectively. Thus, while other studies have shown that ZLLnVal is a potent inhibitor of the hydrophobic peptidase activity of the proteasome, it appears to be a much weaker inhibitor of its proteinase activity. The ability of the cell permeant peptidyl inhibitors to inhibit growth of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae was studied because this organism expresses proteasome but not calpains. Concentrations of ZLLnVal as high as 200 μm had no detectable effect on growth rates of overnight cultures. However, yeast cell lysates prepared from these cultures contained 2 μm ZLLnVal, an amount which should have been sufficient to fully inhibit hydrophobic peptidase activity of yeast proteasome. Degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins in yeast extracts by endogenous proteasome was likewise sensitive only to high concentrations of ZLLnVal. The higher sensitivity of the proteinase activity of calpains to inhibition by the cell permeant inhibitors suggests that calpain-like activities may be targets of these inhibitors in animal cells.

Over the last several years, it has become increasingly apparent that regulated intracellular proteolysis plays a key role in diverse cell functions including signal transduction (1Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

Cell-permeant peptidyl protease inhibitors have been extensively employed in attempts to identify which intracellular proteases participate in these cell physiologic and pathologic functions. In some cases, the results have been readily interpretable. For example, the development of selective inhibitors of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme-like proteases have helped to established the central importance of these enzymes in apoptosis (5Na S.

On the other hand, interpretation of results obtained with other inhibitors is less clear cut. Most notably, CI-1, 1The abbreviations used are: CI-1, acetyl-Leu-Leu-nLeu aldehyde; CI-2, acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met aldehyde; ZLLY-DMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone; ZLLnVal, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-nVal aldehyde. which was developed as an inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases calpains, has been shown to also inhibit the hydrophobic peptidyl hydrolase activity of the proteasome (6Rock K.L.

Lu Q. Xie Z.-J. Mellgren R.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently reported that CI-1 and ZLLY-DMK inhibit progression of WI-38 fibroblasts through G1 phase, and this appears to be the result of inhibition of p53 degradation in late G1. The results of this investigation indicated that a calpain-like protease was involved in triggering p53 degradation. On the other hand, a concurrent, independent study utilizing FH109 fibroblasts concluded that p53 degradation in late G1 was catalyzed by the proteasome, based largely on its inhibition by CI-1 (11Dietrich C. Bartsch T. Schanz F. Oesch F. Wieser R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10815-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The claimed specificity of hydrophobic peptidyl inhibitors like CI-1 for the proteasome is largely based on their potency in inhibiting hydrolysis of small hydrophobic fluorogenic peptides (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). The present investigation was conducted to determine the relative potencies of the peptidyl inhibitors for the proteinase activities of purified human μ-calpain and 20 S proteasome. Since the relevant intracellular substrates for these enzymes are proteins, this seemed like a reasonable basis for comparison. CI-1 and CI-2 were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. ZLLY-DMK was a kind gift from Dr. Elliott Shaw, Friedrich Miescher Institut, Basel. ZLLnVal and leupeptin were obtained from Sigma. Lactacystin was generously provided by Dr. Satoshi Omura, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo. The 20 S proteasome (20Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), μ-calpain (21Mellgren R.L. Song K. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calpastatin (22Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were purified from human red blood cells to near homogeneity as described previously. Calpain activity was measured by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides from14C-methylated casein as described previously (23Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain, radiolabeled casein, and protease inhibitors were preincubated together at 25 °C for 1–5 min, and the reaction was started by addition of CaCl2. Calpain was present at 10 nm; CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and radiolabeled casein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. Duration of the assay was 10 min at which time trichloroacetic acid was added to the reaction mixture, and the soluble radioactive casein peptides were processed for counting as described (23Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the purified 20 S proteasome was assessed by including peptidyl inhibitors in the previously described caseinolytic assay (20Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proteasome was first activated by incubation with 0.2 mg protamine/ml for 2 min at 37 °C. It was then diluted 10-fold to a final concentration of 20 nm in substrate solution ± inhibitor for further incubation at 37 °C. The duration of the assay was 30–60 min, and14C-methylated casein substrate was present at 0.5 mg/ml, except where noted. The generation of radiolabeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble casein peptides was monitored (20Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In some experiments, human erythrocyte calpastatin or chicken egg lysozyme was used as the proteasome substrate, utilizing assay conditions similar to those described above. Degradation of the native protein bands was assessed by densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Calpains and 20 S proteasome activity was measured in the same buffer system (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 7.8) at 37 °C. Both proteases were preincubated with lactacystin for 5 min before initiation of the assay (by addition of Ca2+ for calpain or casein for the proteasome). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RFY 231 was obtained from Dr. Robert Trumbly (Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio). Yeasts were cultured at ambient temperatures (23–26 °C) in YPD medium for a minimum of 4 h to overnight (16–18 h) in the presence of the various protease inhibitors or an equivalent volume of the solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide, for control cultures. Because the protease inhibitors were sometimes used at almost saturating concentrations, culture medium containing inhibitors was precleared of potential insoluble inhibitors by centrifugation for several minutes at top speed in a clinical centrifuge before inoculation with yeast. Cultures were seeded with 0.02–0.1 A 600 units of yeast from a fresh culture, and the final A 600 of the cultures varied from 0.4–10 depending upon the inoculum and time in culture. Overnight cultures of yeast (5 ml) were centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge at top speed through a 3-ml 0.25 m sucrose cushion for 2 min at ambient temperature. Culture medium was aspirated along with approximately 0.5 ml of the sucrose layer. The walls of the centrifuge tube were then washed with 5 ml of 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, utilizing a Pasteur pipette and taking care not to disturb the sucrose layer. The wash was aspirated along with a small amount of sucrose layer. This wash procedure was repeated twice more. Finally the sucrose layer was removed, and the tube was inverted for drainage over Kimwipe® laboratory wipers. After several minutes, liquid remaining on the sides of the tubes was removed by inserting a Kimwipe®, and the yeast pellets were placed on ice. Pellets were suspended in approximately 4 pellet volumes (0.32 ml) of yeast lysis buffer (5 mm EGTA, 10 μmpepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0), and homogenized in a chilled, frosted glass homogenizer for 20 ascents. The homogenates were centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatants saved for inhibitor analysis. Concentrations of inhibitor in medium or lysates was usually assessed by assay as described above for μ-calpain. Generally 5 μl of lysate or 0.5 μl of medium was included in the routine calpain assay. Controls comprised lysates or medium from cultures carried out in the absence of inhibitors, but containing an equivalent volume of the solvent used for inhibitor stock solutions, dimethyl sulfoxide. The percent inhibition by inhibitor was taken as the difference between inhibitor-containing and control assays, the result being divided by the control assay value and multiplied by 100. The concentration of inhibitor was then estimated by reference to a standard curve generated with pure inhibitors (see Figs.1 and 2). In other controls, inhibitors were incubated in medium without yeast, and subjected to the entire isolation and lysis protocol described above. At concentrations of inhibitor used in the experiments reported in this communication, these controls did not produce inhibition of calpain activity within the limits of detection of the standard assay (at least 10% inhibition).Figure 2Inhibition of the proteinase activity of proteasome by hydrophobic peptidyl protease inhibitors. Purified human erythrocyte 20 S proteasome was assayed in the presence of various inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Symbols are the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In some experiments, ZLLnVal concentration in lysates was assayed by inhibition of caseinolytic activity of the proteasome. Since the latter is relatively insensitive to inhibition by ZLLnVal, it was necessary to add a larger volume of lysate. Yeast lysate was heated to 90 °C for 5 min to precipitate proteins and inactivate yeast proteases and then centrifuged to produce a supernatant. 20 μl of the supernatant was included in the standard proteasome assay mixture (total volume, 50 μl), and the volumes of the other assay component stock solutions were adjusted to ensure that their final concentrations in the assay would be the same as for the routine method. Yeast lysates were prepared from overnight cultures as described above. A Tris-HCl buffer was added to 50 mm to adjust the pH to 8.0, and iodoacetamide was added to 10 mm to inhibit polyubiquitin isopeptidase T activity (24Hadari T. Warms J.V.B. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various concentrations of ZLLnVal were added to aliquots of the lysate, and proteolysis was initiated by adding 15 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm ATP and placing the samples in a 37 °C heat block. In one experiment, an ATP regenerating system comprised of ATP, phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase (25Mahaffey D. Yoo Y. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21205-21211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added without qualitatively altering the outcome of the experiment. After 120 min of incubation, the samples were heated to 100 °C in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, electrophoresed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunostained utilizing a polyclonal antibody against bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) at 0.25 mg/ml as first antibody. Alkaline phosphatase second antibody was used, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using a phosphoindolyl substrate and nitroblue tetrazolium (26Blake M.S. Johnstone K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Relative loss of immunoreactive bands was determined by densitometry using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 densitometer and the accompanying Molecular Analyst software. The caseinolytic activity of human μ-calpain, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was potently inhibited by all of the inhibitors tested (Fig.1). ZLLY-DMK and CI-1 were nearly equipotent, producing half-maximum inhibition under standard assay conditions at 1 to 2 × 10−7m. ZLLnVal was nearly as potent as the latter two inhibitors. As previously noted (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), CI-2 was somewhat less potent than CI-1 as an inhibitor of μ-calpain by approximately a factor of 3. In contrast, the caseinolytic activity of purified human 20 S proteasome was markedly resistant to inhibition by CI-1, CI-2, or ZLLY-DMK (Fig.2). Full dose response curves could not be obtained with these inhibitors, because their solubility limits were reached in the assay buffer as evidenced by noticeable cloudiness in the solutions. Just as for inhibition of μ-calpain, there was a 2–3-fold difference in relative potencies of CI-1 and CI-2 as inhibitors of caseinolytic activity of the proteasome. ZLLnVal was much more potent than the other inhibitors; half-maximum inhibition being achieved at 10−5m. In contrast, hydrolysis of succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr aminomethylcoumarin by the 20 S proteasome assayed, as described previously (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), was fully inhibited by 2.5 × 10−7m ZLLnVal (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation that ZLLnVal is a very potent inhibitor of hydrophobic peptidase activity associated with either the 20 S or 26 S proteasome (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). The Streptomyces antibiotic lactacystin, a recently described proteasome-specific inhibitor (27Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), was found to be a potent inhibitor of the caseinolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome (Fig.3). Its potential as a proteasome inhibitor is probably underestimated by experiments like the one depicted in Fig. 3, since it spontaneously hydrolyzes to form the active inhibitory component, lactacystin β-lactone, and the latter achieves peak concentrations well below the initial concentration of lactacystin in the assay buffer (28Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Unlike the peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors used in this study, and in agreement with previous results (27Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), addition of lactacystin to the assay buffer did not significantly inhibit calpain activity (Fig. 3). To investigate the possibility that protein substrate concentration plays a role in the decreased sensitivity of proteasome to the inhibitors, as previously suggested (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), titrations with ZLLnVal were carried out over a 25-fold range of casein concentration. All assays were conducted under conditions which ensured initial rate measurements, and casein concentrations both above and below theK m (80 μg casein/ml, see Ref. 20Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were used. There was no significant influence on the potency of this inhibitor at any of the casein concentrations tested (Fig.4). To ensure that the low potency of ZLLnVal was not a phenomenon specifically associated with utilization of casein as a protein substrate, its inhibitory effect was investigated using lysozyme or calpastatin as substrates for the 20 S proteasome (Fig.5). Half-maximum inhibition of proteolysis was evident at 22 and 4 μm ZLLnVal using lysozyme and calpastatin, respectively, as substrates. Thus, ZLLnVal is a relatively weak inhibitor of proteasome-catalyzed cleavage of at least three different protein substrates. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae do not contain calpains but express the proteasome and other components of the ATP and ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system (29Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). They therefore represent a natural model system for investigating the roles of the inhibitors in blocking proteasome activity without potential influences on calpain activity. Since the ATP-ubiquitin system is an established component of the cell cycle regulatory machinery (3King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), proteasome inhibitors should effectively arrest growth of yeast cells. Including as much as 200 μm, CI-1, CI-2, ZLLY-DMK, or ZLLnVal in medium of overnight yeast cultures produced no detectable inhibition of yeast cell growth as assessed by A600 of the cultures (data not shown). Similar results have previously been reported, and at least part of this lack of effect on proliferation has been attributed to instability of the inhibitors in yeast culture medium (30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the present studies, 100 μm ZLLnVal was found to be relatively stable after overnight exposure to yeast in culture; 72 ± 1.7 μm (n = 3 culture tubes) remained in the medium after overnight incubation with an initial yeast inoculum of approximately 0.1 A600 unit. Other inhibitors used in the present studies were also relatively stable except for CI-1, which was depleted by approximately two-thirds. S. cerevisiae are believed to be relatively impermeant to the peptidyl inhibitors, and this might account for their tolerance toward high concentrations of the latter in culture medium (30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To estimate uptake of inhibitors by yeast cells, the washing procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” was employed. After 16 h of exposure to 200 μm ZLLnVal or ZLLY-DMK in the medium of triplicate yeast cultures, the inhibitors were detected in lysates from washed yeast cells at concentrations of 1.96 ± 0.36 and 1.34 ± 0.56 S.D. μm, respectively, using the calpain inhibitory assay. Taking into consideration the dilution of the inhibitor by the homogenization buffer, this would represent approximately 10 μm ZLLnVal and 7 μmZLLY-DMK in yeast cytosolic fraction. To ensure that ZLLnVal was not metabolically converted by yeast to a form that inhibits calpains but not the proteasome, the assay for ZLLnVal in yeast lysate was repeated using purified 20 S proteasome as described under “Experimental Procedures.” By proteasome assay, the content of this inhibitor in the yeast lysate was 1.92 ± 0.56 S.D. μm. In similar experiments, the positively charged and hence impermeant calpain inhibitor leupeptin was not detectable in yeast lysates. Within the limits of the calpain assay for this inhibitor, this means that less than approximately 0.5 μm leupeptin was present in lysates derived from yeast cells exposed overnight to 200 μm leupeptin in the medium. Incubation of yeast lysates in the presence of ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in the disappearance of high molecular mass ubiquitin immunoreactivity (Fig.6). This probably reflects digestion of polyubiquitinylated proteins and not disassembly of polyubiquitin to ubiquitin monomers by isopeptidases, since no free ubiquitin was detected after incubation (Fig. 6). Including ZLLnVal in the incubation mixture resulted in protection against loss of ubiquitin immunoreactivity but only at high concentrations of the inhibitor (Fig.6). ZLLnVal, CI-1, and structurally related hydrophobic peptide aldehydes have been shown to be very potent inhibitors of the hydrophobic peptidohydrolase activity of both the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it is tempting to speculate that their intracellular target is the proteasome. Indeed, much evidence has been provided supporting their ability to allow accumulation of polyubiquitinylated forms of proteins in mammalian cells and to suppress proteolysis of known proteasome substrates (11Dietrich C. Bartsch T. Schanz F. Oesch F. Wieser R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10815-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,12Zhou M. Wu X. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, in a more limited body of studies, it has been noted that hydrophobic peptide aldehydes are much poorer inhibitors of the proteasome when protein substrates are employed (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). In addition, the structurally related inhibitor, ZLLY-DMK, a diazomethyl ketone with little activity against proteasomal caseinolytic (21Mellgren R.L. Song K. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or hydrophobic peptidohydrolase (33Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Angliker H. Shaw E. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) activities, shares at least one anticipated property of cell permeant proteasome inhibitors; it is a highly potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression through G1 phase, and it leads to stabilization of p53 tumor suppressor protein in late G1 (9Zhang W. Lu Q. Xie Z.-J. Mellgren R.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present report, effects of the inhibitors on the proteinase activities of purified μ-calpain and 20 S proteasome have been studied concurrently. The results demonstrated that μ-calpain is much more sensitive than the proteasome to inhibition by the hydrophobic peptidyl aldehydes and ZLLY-DMK. However, the selectivity of another proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, was confirmed in the present investigation. It was capable of inhibiting the caseinolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome at micromolar concentrations while producing no apparent inhibition of calpain. Insensitivity of the proteasome to the peptidyl inhibitors was not uniquely associated with use of the usual assay substrate, casein, since half-maximum inhibition of the proteasome by ZLLnVal required greater than micromolar concentrations using lysozyme or calpastatin as substrates (Fig. 5). Moreover, high concentrations of ZLLnVal appeared to be required to inhibit degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins by endogenous proteasome in yeast lysates (Fig. 6). To test the idea that the proteinase activity of the proteasome is relatively insensitive to cell-permeant peptidyl protease inhibitors, the influence of the latter on yeast cell growth was studied. While these experiments were in progress, it was reported that wild-typeS. cerevisiae are resistant to the effects of ZLLnVal and CI-1 on protein degradation and cell proliferation (30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This appeared to be related to an inability to penetrate into the yeast cells since a mutant yeast strain with altered permeability characteristics was affected by ZLLnVal. However, no attempt was made in these latter studies to estimate the uptake of inhibitors into yeast. Results from the present study indicate that greater than micromolar concentrations of ZLLnVal or ZLLY-DMK accumulate in yeast exposed to 200 μm inhibitor overnight. There are, of course, caveats regarding extrapolation of inhibitor concentrations in lysates relative to intracellular cytosolic concentrations. The potential problem of compartmentalization in cells cannot be addressed, and it is conceivable that a fraction of the inhibitor in lysates is derived from a noncytosolic pool. However, it should be noted that the potential for extraction from membranes was minimized in the present studies by use of a hypotonic lysis buffer lacking detergents. Furthermore, the cells were homogenized in a minimum volume of lysis buffer to minimize redistribution to the soluble phase by dilution. It seems unlikely that a large fraction of ZLLnVal or ZLLY-DMK in lysates was derived from extracellular bound inhibitor; exposure of yeast to 200 μm leupeptin, a structurally related inhibitor that does not permeate cell membranes well, did not result in its detectable accumulation in lysates. Although the precise intracellular distribution of the inhibitors is problematic, it seems likely that sufficient ZLLnVal would have accumulated to inhibit the hydrophobic peptidohydrolase activity of the yeast proteasome since this inhibitor has been reported to half-maximally inhibit 20 S proteasome at 21 nm and 26 S proteasome at 35 nm (6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). The observations reported herein have significant bearing on interpretation of the effects of the hydrophobic peptidyl protease inhibitors, especially in animal cells where calpains and proteasome coexist. Among the possibilities that must be considered is that calpain-like proteases are the direct targets for these inhibitors in animal cells. The influence of CI-1, ZLLnVal, and related inhibitors on proteasome function where apparent might be downstream from their direct inhibition of calpains, suggesting that members of these two protease families may share common signal-transduction pathways. A less likely but nonetheless intriguing possibility is that animal cells possess unique intracellular protein substrates for the proteasome containing regions that mimic the substrate properties of the small hydrophobic peptides. Proteolysis of these proteins should be specifically inhibited by low concentrations of the cell-permeant inhibitors, aiding in their identification and isolation. Lactacystin was selective for the proteasome, having no apparent calpain inhibitory activity (Fig. 3), and it should be useful for establishing intracellular proteolytic events requiring the proteasome. Lactacystin has recently been employed in [3H]tyrosine pulse-chase studies to demonstrate that proteolysis of the short-lived protein fraction in several cell types is dependent on participation of the proteasome (34Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The utilization of lactacystin in combination with more calpain-selective inhibitors should provide a valuable approach for assessing the involvement of these two proteinase systems in various cellular processes requiring discrete proteolysis of specific regulatory proteins. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that lactacystin had a modest peak effect on inhibition of WI-38 fibroblast progression through late G1 phase, and that addition of saturating concentrations of lactacystin had no apparent influence on the ability of ZLLY-CHN2 to further inhibit progression (35Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, a calpain-like proteolytic activity appears to be involved in this important cell cycle transition. I thank Dr. Elliott Shaw for the gift of ZLLY-DMK, Dr. Satoshi Omura for providing lactacystin, and Martha Heck for preparation of the final typescript."

Import of nuclear encoded mitochondrial preproteins into the mitochondria is a multistep process (1Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. North-Holland Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 791-822Google Scholar). To reach the mitochondrial matrix, precursor proteins are translocated across the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes. Biochemical and morphological studies revealed that protein import into the matrix proceeds through proteinaceous channels at so-called translocation contact sites (2Schleyer M. Neupert W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the electron microscope, regions of close proximity of the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane have been observed (5van der Klei I. Veenhuis M. Neupert W. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1994; 27: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These areas are particularly conspicuous in mitochondria in which the matrix space has been shrunk and the inner membrane is pulled away from the outer membrane. They are often referred to as morphological contact sites. Contact sites may be the preferred location where translocation contacts of the Tom and Tim complexes are formed, but this issue has not been finally settled. With biochemical means, contact sites between Tom and Tim complexes were only detected in the presence of a translocating polypeptide chain (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Horst M. Hilfiker-Rothenfluh S. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Components of the Tom machinery and Tim23, Tim17, as well as mt-Hsp70 and Tim44 were found in such super-complexes. For import of members of the mitochondrial carrier family, such as the ADP/ATP carrier, the Tom machinery cooperates with Tim22 (8Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This pathway does not require functional Tim23 and mt-Hsp70 (8Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The translocation machinery of the outer membrane can also act independent of the translocases of the inner membrane (9Meyer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mitoplast preparations, preproteins are imported directly via Tim23 into the matrix (10Hwang S. Jascur T. Vestweber D. Pon L. Schatz G. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how the Tom machinery interacts with the inner membrane translocases Tim23·Tim17 and Tim22 and how the translocases are related stoichiometrically. In this study, chemical amounts of a matrix-targeted precursor protein were incubated with isolated mitochondria under conditions optimal for import. The effect of accumulation of this precursor in a membrane-spanning fashion on the subsequent import of preproteins into the different mitochondrial subcompartments was analyzed. In this situation, import of preproteins into the matrix is blocked. The results demonstrate that translocation contact sites for import of preproteins into the matrix can be saturated. However, functional Tom machinery is still available for import of proteins into the outer membrane and the intermembrane space, suggesting that Tom complexes are in excess over Tim23·Tim17 complexes. Tom machinery is also available for cooperation with Tim22 to facilitate import of members of the mitochondrial carrier family into the inner membrane. A quantification of the mitochondrial content of Tom40, Tim23, and Tim22 supports the notion that translocases of the mitochondrial outer membrane are present in excess over inner membrane import machinery. The data suggest that a preprotein associates with the Tom complex and then recruits the appropriate machinery required for its sorting to mitochondrial subcompartments. The c-DNA encoding the precursor of the β-subunit of the F1F0ATPase (pF1β) fromNeurospora crassa (11Rassow J. Harmey M.A. Müller H.A. Neupert W. Tropschug M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. AnNdeI restriction site was introduced in front of the start codon by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated into pJLA503 (12Schauder B. Blöcker H. Frank R. McCarthy J.E.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which was cleaved with NdeI andEcoRI. The plasmid was used for transformation ofEscherichia coli DH1. A single colony of the transformed E. coli strain was grown overnight at 28 °C in M9 minimal medium (0.4% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% NaCl, 6% Na2HPO4, 3% KH2PO4, 1% NH4Cl, 1 mmMg2Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/liter thiamin) containing 0.4% (w/v) casamino acids and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. This culture was diluted to an A 578of 0.1 into M9 medium containing 40 mg/liter of each amino acid (except methionine and cysteine), 25 μm MgSO4, and 50 mg/liter ampicillin. At A 578 = 1.0, the cells were reisolated in the same volume M9 medium (containing 40 mg/liter of each amino acid except methionine and cysteine), prewarmed to 42 °C, and supplied with 50 μCi of [35S]sulfate at a final concentration of 10 μm. Incubation at 42 °C was continued for 2 h. Cells were reisolated in 2% of the original volume in buffer A (25% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the volume was adjusted to 20% of the original culture volume with buffer A supplied with 25 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated in a Branson sonifier (3 × 10 pulses, 40% duty, maximal setting), and inclusion bodies of pF1β were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended by sonication in buffer B (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged as above. Finally, the pellet was washed twice as above in buffer B lacking Triton X-100. The final pellet was solubilized in buffer C (7 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mmhistidine, pH 6.0). The pF1β protein was purified from these inclusion bodies by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer C. The column was developed with a gradient of buffer C from 0 mm to 200 mm NaCl. The protein eluted at 50 mm NaCl. Precursor proteins were synthesized by coupled transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham) as described (13Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). Wild-typeSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain MC3:YIPGALOTC (14Pollock R.A. Hartl F.-U. Cheng M.Y. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was grown overnight in lactate medium, cells were harvested atA 578 = 1–1.5, and mitochondria were isolated (15Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import reactions were carried out at 25 °C in 200 μl of import buffer (600 mm sorbitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm NADH, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 20 μg of mitochondria and 5–10% reticulocyte lysate with radiolabeled precursor. Where indicated, the membrane potential was dissipated with 50 μm carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone. Import was assayed by treating the mitochondria with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min on ice, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PK, proteinase K. and fluorography. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]sulfate (300 mCi/mol). Mitochondria were prepared, and aliquots corresponding to 50 μg of protein were solubilized in TBS containing 0.05% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Tom40 IgG (10 μg), with affinity-purified anti-Tim23 IgG (0.5 μg) and affinity-purified anti-Tim17 IgG (0.5 μg), respectively. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified with a phosphorimaging system. The precursor of the β-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (pF1β) (11Rassow J. Harmey M.A. Müller H.A. Neupert W. Tropschug M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (0.1 μg) was diluted out of urea into an import assay containing S. cerevisiae mitochondria (30 μg). When the import reaction was carried out for 30 min at 10 °C, the preprotein was efficiently processed to the mature form; however, only about one-third of the processed species was resistant to externally added proteinase K (PK) (Fig.1). This indicates that the kinetics of translocation of the polypeptide chain were slow at low temperature, and a significant fraction of the protein was present in a membrane-spanning configuration, with the N terminus processed in the matrix and the C terminus on the outside and accessible to externally added PK. To saturate the mitochondrial import sites with membrane-spanning translocation intermediates, import reactions with pF1β were performed at 10 °C, and antibodies directed against the mature F1β (mF1β) were added. The amount of precursor recovered with the mitochondrial pellet increased with increasing amounts of anti-F1β IgG. This may reflect cross-linking of the preprotein by the antibody. In the presence of 10–100 μg of anti-F1β IgG, about 30 ng of F1β were processed. This was slightly more than without IgG, suggesting that the antibodies might help to maintain the preprotein in a translocation-competent form after dilution out of denaturant. However, the majority of the processed form was degraded by added PK, indicating that the protein was arrested in a membrane-spanning fashion. In the presence of 100 μg of anti-F1β IgG, more than 95% of the processed form were present as a membrane-spanning translocation intermediate. About 0.5 μg of F1β per mg of mitochondrial protein was arrested in a membrane-spanning fashion. Assuming all mitochondria are active in translocation, this corresponds to approximately 9 pmol of import sites per mg of mitochondrial protein. The arrested translocation intermediate remained sensitive to PK treatment for at least 2 h, indicating that the membrane-spanning F1β was arrested in a stable manner (not shown). We investigated whether the accumulation of F1β across the membranes blocked subsequent import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into the different mitochondrial subcompartments. In a first stage import reaction, mitochondria were saturated with the F1β translocation intermediates in the presence of anti-F1β IgG. Control reactions received pF1β together with preimmune IgG. Subsequently, mitochondria were reisolated and used in a second stage import reaction at 25 °C. Second stage import of radiochemical amounts of the matrix-targeted chimeric preprotein pb2Δ19(167)DHFR (16Arretz M. Schneider H. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into mitochondria with accumulated F1β protein was inhibited by more than 90% (Fig. 2), whereas import into mock-treated mitochondria was as efficient as into untreated mitochondria. Similarly, second stage import of the matrix-targeted fusion protein pSu9(1–69)DHFR (17Pfanner N. Müller H.K. Harmey M.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was efficiently inhibited. This indicates that accumulation of F1β in a membrane-spanning fashion blocks the sites for protein import into the mitochondrial matrix. The precursor of cytochrome b 2 and the precursor of cytochrome c 1, which are sorted to the intermembrane space, are synthesized with a bipartite presequence. The N-terminal matrix-targeting signal is cleaved after import into the matrix by the matrix-processing peptidase before sorting of these proteins to the intermembrane space (18Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Import of pb2(167)-DHFR, a chimeric preprotein that contains the first 167 amino acid residues of cytochromeb 2 was strongly inhibited by accumulated F1β translocation intermediates (Fig. 2). Also, import of cytochrome c 1 was inhibited by more than 95%. The import of the precursor of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (pFe/S), which becomes imported into the matrix, processed, and subsequently sorted to the intermembrane space (19Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), was inhibited by 85% after accumulation of F1β. Second stage import of the outer membrane protein porin and of cytochrome c heme lyase into the intermembrane space was inhibited by about 40% (Fig. 2). Both proteins are synthesized without cleavable presequence and imported via the Tom complex of the outer membrane (10Hwang S. Jascur T. Vestweber D. Pon L. Schatz G. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These data suggest that despite saturation of translocation contact sites for protein import into the matrix, functional Tom machinery is available for import of proteins into the outer membrane and the intermembrane space. The integral inner membrane proteins ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) and inorganic phosphate carrier (PiC) are synthesized without a cleavable presequence. Their import into the inner membrane requires the membrane potential ΔΨ and is facilitated by Tim22 in a reaction that does not need functional Tim23 and mt-Hsp70 (8Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). When F1β was accumulated in a membrane-spanning fashion, the subsequent import of AAC and PiC was inhibited by 40 and 50%, respectively. These observations demonstrate that accumulation of F1β in a membrane-spanning fashion efficiently blocks the import of other mitochondrial preproteins with an N-terminal matrix-targeting signal. Import of proteins, however, without matrix-targeting signals into the inner membrane, the intermembrane space, and into the outer membrane is only partly affected. Thus, functional outer membrane import sites seem to be present in excess over components required for the formation of translocation contact sites for protein import into the matrix. Outer membrane import sites that are not engaged in contact site formation are available for import of members of the mitochondrial carrier family via Tim22. To estimate the stoichiometry of mitochondrial protein translocases in the outer and inner membrane, Tom40 (21Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), a component of outer membrane import machinery, Tim23 (22Dekker P.J.T. Keil P. Rassow J. Maarse A.C. Pfanner N. Meijer M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a component of the inner membrane translocase for matrix-targeted proteins, and Tim22 (8Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), a component for import of members of the mitochondrial carrier family, were quantified from immunoprecipitates. Yeast cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate. Mitochondria were prepared and lysed with Triton X-100 and SDS, and the antigens were depleted from detergent extracts by immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated antigens were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified with a phosphorimaging system (Fig. 3). Tom40 comprised 0.2% of the total radioactivity incorporated into mitochondrial protein. Tim23 comprised 0.04%, and Tim22 comprised about 0.025% of the total radioactivity. Considering differences in the specific activity of these proteins due to the number of incorporated [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, the molar ratio of Tom40:Tim23:Tim22 is about 5:1:0.22. This corresponds to approximately 85 pmol of Tom40, 17 pmol of Tim23, and 3.7 pmol of Tim22 per mg of mitochondrial protein. The ratio of Tom40 to Tim23 was not affected when yeast cells were grown on fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources (not shown). Translocation contact sites for import of preproteins into the matrix can be saturated with chemical amounts of a preprotein, pF1β. Accumulation of this preprotein in a membrane-spanning fashion specifically blocked subsequent import of preprotein with a matrix-targeting signal, whereas import of precursors without such a signal into the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, and into the inner membrane was only partly blocked. This suggests that Tim23·Tim17 complexes, which mediate translocation of matrix-targeted preproteins across the inner membrane, are less abundant than Tom complexes, which constitute the general insertion pore for preproteins in the outer membrane (23Pfaller R. Steger H.F. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2483-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have determined that mitochondria contain about 85 pmol of Tom40, 17 pmol of Tim23, and 3.7 pmol of Tim22 per mg of mitochondrial protein. The molar ratio of these components seems to be independent of the functional state of the mitochondria. Although the stoichiometry of the quantified components within functional Tom and Tim translocases is not known, it is likely that Tom complexes are in excess over Tim23·Tim17 complexes. The native molecular mass of the Tom complex is about 400 kDa (24Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Dekker P.J.T. Müller H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1996; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the Tom complex could contain about five copies of Tom40 if the other Tom components (26Pfanner N. Douglas M.G. Endo T. Hoogenraad N.J. Jensen R.E. Meijer M. Neupert W. Schatz G. Schmitz U. Shore G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are present in only single copies. Accordingly, mitochondria should contain at least 17 pmol of Tom complexes per mg of protein. The Tim23·Tim17 complex functions as a dimeric or higher oligomeric species (27Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), corresponding to 8.5 pmol/mg. Tom complexes should therefore be present in at least 2-fold molar excess over Tim17·23 complexes. In agreement with this estimation, saturation of contact sites between Tom complexes and Tim17·23 complexes by matrix-targeted pF1β almost completely blocked subsequent protein import into the matrix. The remaining Tom complexes that are not engaged in formation of contact sites are obviously available for import pathways that are independent of Tim23·Tim17 complexes. These are pathways for import of proteins into the outer membrane and the intermembrane space as well as the pathway for import of proteins into the inner membrane via the Tim22 complex. Protein import via these pathways was reduced by about 40% when translocation contact sites were saturated by pF1β. This reduction could reflect an accumulation of a fraction of the precursors at receptors of Tom complexes that are blocked by membrane-spanning F1β. In conclusion, the interaction of the Tom machinery with translocases in the inner membrane is highly dynamic: a preprotein initially binds to a Tom complex and then recruits the appropriate machinery required for its further import and submitochondrial sorting.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 cip1 is a potential candidate mediating the PDBu-induced delayed entry of the cells into S-phase (by ∼10 h when compared with cells stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)). Levels of p21 cip1 (protein and mRNA) rapidly rise (within ∼2 h) in endothelial cells treated with the active isomer β-PDBu, but not with α-PDBu; this effect is blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (Mek1) inhibitor PD098059 and by the protein kinase C (PKC) antagonists GF109203X and rottlerin (selective for PKC-δ), but not Gö 6976 (selective for Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms). Rapamycin blocks the PDBu-induced accumulation of p21 cip1 (but not of the cognate mRNA), indicating an action of PKC on p21 cip1 mRNA translation. If endothelial cells are recruited into the cell cycle by bFGF, p21 cip1 mRNA and protein levels rise initially (within 2 h) and decline subsequently such that p21 cip1 drops to a minimum prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis (i.e. after ∼12 h). In bFGF-stimulated cells, changes in p21 cip1 mRNA and protein are strictly linked. In contrast, the levels of p21 cip1 mRNA decline substantially (>10 h) before the protein decreases in PDBu-stimulated cells. Thus, PKC (presumably PKC-δ) regulates the amounts of p21 cip1 in endothelial cells at the level of mRNA accumulation and translation, leading to a rapid and robust induction; following persistent PKC activation, p21 cip1 remains elevated despite reduced mRNA levels, indicating an enhanced stability of the protein. The bFGF-mediated increase in p21 cip1 is blocked by the Mek1 inhibitor, but not by GF109203X; hence, in endothelial cells, induction of p21 cip1 by PKC- and growth factor-dependent signaling is achieved by distinct pathways that converge and require activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The β-PDBu-induced delayed S-phase entry and drop in p21 cip1 are reversed if GF109203X is added 4 h after β-PDBu to prevent persistent PKC activation. These observations indicate a cause and effect relation between sustained p21 cip1 elevations and the delay in S-phase entry induced by β-PDBu.

The addition of phorbol esters to the culture medium inhibits the growth of endothelial cells (1Moodie S.A. Martin W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This observation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that stimulation of the cellular targets of phorbol esters, i.e. the isoforms of protein kinase C, leads to sustained activation of several signaling pathways that are required for the recruitment of quiescent cells into the cell cycle. These include activation of the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; HUVECs, human umbilical venous endothelial cells; FCS, fetal calf serum. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; HUVECs, human umbilical venous endothelial cells; FCS, fetal calf serum. kinase cascade, which results in stimulation of gene transcription (2Cobb M.H.

Previous studies have addressed this paradox and have shown that the PKC activator PDBu exerts a bidirectional effect on growth of human vascular endothelial cells; short-term application of phorbol esters efficiently recruits quiescent endothelial cells into the G1-phase of the cell cycle, whereas persistent activation of protein kinase C subsequently slows the progression though G1 and thereby delays entry of the cells into S-phase (6Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23041-23048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); thus, the net effect of continuous treatment with phorbol esters is a suppression of endothelial cell proliferation (1Moodie S.A.

Angiogenesis,i.e. the de novo formation of blood vessels from preexisting capillaries, is a prerequisite for the growth of solid tumors and their metastases (8Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hanahan D. Folkman J.

Simmling-Ahnenfeld M. J. Pathol. 1983; 139: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tumor cells, hypoxic tissue, and leukocytes secrete several endothelial mitogens in a paracrine manner. These growth factors (e.g. fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, adenosine, interleukin-8, and adhesion molecules) stimulate the growth of endothelial cells by recruiting them from G0-phase to G1-phase via the stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors and G protein-coupled receptors (8Folkman J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The ideal antiangiogenic regimen ought to block the action of all endothelial mitogens in a reversible fashion. In theory, this may be achieved by inhibiting a signaling pathway onto which all receptor-generated intracellular stimuli converge to drive the cells through the cell cycle, i.e. the components of the cell cycle machinery that are required for progression through G1. The delay in S-phase entry induced by phorbol esters in endothelial cells is thus of interest, as persistent application of phorbol esters results in delayed activation of cyclin-dependent kinases in G1 (5Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 6Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23041-23048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore compared the effects of phorbol esters and of a physiological stimulus, i.e. bFGF, on regulatory components that impinge on the cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for G1-phase progression. Here, we report that in primary cultures of human endothelial cells, continuous protein kinase C activation leads to a sustained elevation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 cip1 . This effect is likely to account for the delayed S-phase entry and the resulting growth inhibition. [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]thymidine were obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Cells were used in the second and third passages. HUVECs were synchronized in G0-phase by contact inhibition of the confluent monolayers. Synchronization was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells. Cells were detached as described above and replated in medium 199, 2.5% FCS, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 5 units/ml heparin for at least 5 h, an interval cells need to adhere. The cells were stimulated with bFGF or β-PDBu in the absence and presence of various compounds as indicated in the respective figure legends. At the time points indicated on the respective figures, the cells (∼5 × 105) were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer A preheated to 80 °C and containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 immunoblots. Lysates were vortexed for 30 s, and DNA and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. For p53 immunoblots, the cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After 30 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation as described above. For immunoblot analysis, lysates (20 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against p21 cip1 , p27 kip1 , and p53 were used at dilutions of 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:1000, respectively. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using a second antibody that was directed against mouse IgG and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. HUVECs were synchronized in G0-phase and stimulated as described above. At each time point, 5 × 106 cells were harvested in 0.8 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer C (pH adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH) containing 50 mm Hepes, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were vortexed for 10 min; DNA and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Thereafter, the lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose (Oncogene Science Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C; subsequently, 2 μg of affinity-purified cyclin D1 antiserum or pRb antibodies were added for 2 h, followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein G-agarose. After six washes in lysis buffer C, the immunoprecipitated material was released by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and antibodies against p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 (see above) or antisera against cyclin D1 (1:300), CDK4 (1:300), and pRb (1:1000) were used for immunostaining. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized as described above. HUVECs were synchronized in G0-phase and stimulated as described above. At each time point, 5 × 106 cells were harvested by scraping them off in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer D (pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) containing 20 mm Hepes, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were vortexed for 10 min; DNA and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Samples were incubated with 2 μg of cyclin E antiserum at 4 °C for 2 h and subsequently with 20 μl of protein G-agarose for 2 h. After three washes with lysis buffer D and three washes with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mmATP, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml histone H1, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the same buffer with the addition of 2 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample. Thereafter, the samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were also withdrawn for immunoblots with the cyclin E antiserum. The affinity-purified antiserum against cyclin E was used at a dilution of 1:2000 for immunostaining. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized as described above. The effect of bFGF, FCS, β-PDBu, and GF109203X on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined as described previously (17Sexl V. Mancusi G. Höller C. Gloria-Maercker E. Schütz W. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5792-5799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, confluent growth-arrested endothelial cells were detached with EDTA and seeded in 96-well plates (1–2 × 104 cells/well) in the presence of medium containing 2.5% FCS, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 5 units/ml heparin. After 5 h, cells were treated with various compounds as indicated in the respective figure legends. At each time point, 0.1 ml of medium 199 containing [3H]thymidine (0.3–0.5 μCi) was added for 3 or 4 h. At the end of each incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were detached by trypsinization and lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle. The particulate material was trapped onto glass-fiber filters using a Skatron cell harvester, and the radioactivity retained was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The blank level of [3H]thymidine retained on the filters in the absence of DNA synthesis (determined in the presence of aphidicolin) was <50 cpm. Assays were done in sextuplicate. Total cellular RNA was prepared by homogenizing the cells (4–6 × 106 cells) in guanidinium isothiocyanate, followed by extraction of the homogenate with phenol/chloroform/3-methylbutan-1-ol. Aliquots (20–25 μg) of each RNA sample were applied to a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N® nylon membranes by vacuum blotting. The coding sequence of p21 cip1 was excised from the plasmid pCMVexSdi1 by digestion with BamHI (18Noda A. Ning Y. Venalble S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar); the p21 cip1 and p53 probes were labeled using the Amersham Megaprime labeling kit. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in a solution containing 6 × SSC (SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and the labeled cDNA probe. Blots were washed with 2 × SSC, twice with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, and twice with 0.1 × SSC for 15 min each at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR5 films at −80 °C. Each experiment was carried out at least three times on different primary cultures of human endothelial cells. When applied to quiescent (G0) endothelial cells in a pulsatile manner (1.5 h), the sole addition of β-PDBu suffices to promote the entry of 40–60% of the total cell population into the cell cycle as assessed by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). However, if β-PDBu is applied continuously, the subsequent onset of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA,i.e. S-phase entry, is delayed by ∼10 h compared with cells that have been treated with physiological stimuli such as bFGF or FCS (Fig. 1 A). This phenomenon has been attributed to a phorbol ester-dependent delay in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases in G1-phase. To identify the relevant upstream signaling events that may regulate cell cycle progression, we evaluated the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 . Quiescent endothelial cells were stimulated with either bFGF or PDBu; the expression pattern of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors was assessed at the level of the protein in the subsequent cell cycle (Fig. 1 B) and compared with the onset of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 A). In G0, endothelial cells contain abundant amounts of p27 kip1 , but only low levels of p21 cip1 (cf.Fig. 2 A). At the earliest time point that was assessed after mitogenic stimulation (4 h), the cellular levels of p21 cip1 were elevated in cells treated with bFGF or β-PDBu, whereas the levels of p27 kip1 remained essentially unaltered (Fig. 1 B; see also Fig. 2 A); the increase in p21 cip1 was maintained throughout G1-phase and dropped as cells incorporated [3H]thymidine. In bFGF-stimulated cells, the drop in p21 cip1 was observed after 12 h; as the incorporation of [3H]thymidine started to decline, p21 cip1 reaccumulated (Fig. 1 B, lanes labeled bFGF 20+ and 24+) and dropped again as DNA synthesis resumed (lane labeled bFGF 28+). In β-PDBu-treated cells, p21 cip1 remained elevated up to 24 h, and the subsequent decline coincided again with the entry into S-phase (Fig.1 B, lane labeled PDBu 28+). In contrast, stimulation of endothelial cells with β-PDBu did not defer but rather accelerated the decline in p27 kip1 (Fig.1 B). Although we have attempted to optimize the synchronization of the cells in G0, there was some variability in individual cell batches with respect to the onset (i.e. 11–14 and 25–30 h for bFGF and β-PDBu, respectively) and the duration of [3H]thymidine incorporation (cf. also Figs. 1 and 6, A andB). This variation is not unexpected in experiments with primary cell cultures. However, we stress that irrespective of this variation, the decline in p21 cip1 always occurred prior to the onset of DNA synthesis. The changes in the p21 cip1 protein levels of bFGF-stimulated cells were paralleled by appropriate changes in the p21 cip1 mRNA (Fig. 1 C); this finding is consistent with a previous report that showed that in a human fibroblast cell line, serum stimulation resulted in an oscillation of the p21 cip1 mRNA along the cell cycle (19Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). In bFGF-stimulated cells, the decline in the protein levels of p21 cip1 and of its cognate mRNA coincided, indicating that the protein turned over rapidly (Fig. 1, compare B andC). In contrast, if the cells had been stimulated with β-PDBu, p21 cip1 mRNA declined substantially (>12 h) before the drop in the protein (Fig. 1, compare B andC). This discrepancy between the p21 cip1 mRNA and protein levels can only be accounted for by a β-PDBu-induced stabilization of the protein.Figure 2Induction of p21cip1 and p53 protein expression and mRNA by bFGF and β-PDBu. For the analysis of p21 cip1 protein levels, quiescent endothelial cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were stimulated with 1 μm β-PDBu or vehicle (A and C) or 20 ng/ml bFGF + 10% FCS (B) and were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer A for p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 or lysis buffer B for p53 at the indicated time points. After removal of insoluble proteins, lysates were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis, and the blots were analyzed using a mixture of monoclonal antibodies against p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 (A andB) or against p53 (C).

At the indicated time points, cells were harvested, and total RNA was prepared as outlined under “Experimental Procedures”; an aliquot thereof (20 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane, which was probed with p21 cip1 (A andB) or p53 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6GF109203X reverses the β-PDBu-induced delay in S-phase onset and sustained p21cip1 protein expression.

At the time points indicated, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) was added for 3 h. Thereafter, the medium was removed, and the cells were detached and lysed. The particulate material was trapped onto glass-fiber filters, and the radioactivity retained was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were done in sextuplicate.

The addition of the phorbol ester to quiescent cells led to a rapid accumulation of p21 cip1 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the levels of p27 kip1 , which were readily detectable in quiescent cells, remained unaffected by the short-term incubation with β-PDBu. However, an appropriate stimulus did regulate the levels of p27 kip1 in endothelial cells. Incubation of endothelial cells with transforming growth factor-β, which is known to redistribute cellular levels of p27 kip1 (20Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), led to the accumulation of p27 kip1 (data not shown). We stress that a virtually identical increase in p21 cip1 was also observed if asynchronously growing cells were stimulated with β-PDBu and irrespective of whether total cellular protein or a detergent extract was used for analysis (data not shown). The accumulation of p21 cip1 was paralleled by a rise in the cognate mRNA, which reached a maximum within 2–4 h (Fig.2 A). The levels of p21 cip1 protein and mRNA also increased if quiescent endothelial cells were stimulated with bFGF (Fig. 2 A), albeit to a lesser extent than following the addition of β-PDBu (cf. Fig. 1 B). In contrast, we did not detect any β-PDBu-induced change in the levels of p53 irrespective of whether the determination was done by immunoblotting cellular lysates or by RNA blots (Fig. 2 C). The experiments depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 suggested that direct activation of protein kinase C by β-PDBu resulted in an initial rapid increase in p21 cip1 . Growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity are capable of recruiting phospholipase Cγ via the interaction of the SH2 domain with autophosphorylated tyrosine residues; the resulting activation of phospholipase C is expected to trigger PKC activation (21Pazin M.J. Williams L.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 374-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have therefore assessed whether the bFGF-induced increase in p21 cip1 resulted from the activation of a PKC isoform. This was clearly not the case as GF109203X did not block the response to bFGF while blunting th"
https://openalex.org/W2012082177,"We have previously shown that maximal expression of the rat smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) gene in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) required the presence of a highly conserved domain (nucleotides −1321 and −1095) that contained two positive-acting serum response factor (SRF) binding elements (CArG boxes 1 and 2) and a negative-acting GC-rich element that was recognized by Sp1 (Madsen, C. S., Hershey, J. C., Hautmann, M. B., White, S. L., and Owens, G. K. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6332–6340). In this study, to better understand the functional role of these three ciselements, we created a series of SM-MHC reporter-gene constructs in which each element was mutated either alone or in combination with each other and tested them for activity in transient transfection assays using primary cultured rat aortic SMCs. Results demonstrated that the most proximal SRF binding element (CArG-box1) was active in the absence of CArG-box2, but only upon removal of the GC-rich repressor. In contrast, regardless of sequence context, CArG-box2 was active only when CArG-box1 was present. We further demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that Sp1 binding to the GC-rich repressor element did not prevent SRF binding to the adjacent CArG-box2. Thus, unlike other proteins reported to inhibit SRF activity, the repressor activity associated with the GC-rich element does not appear to function through direct inhibition of SRF binding. As a first step toward understanding the importance of these elementsin vivo, we performed in vivo footprinting on the intact rat aorta. We demonstrated that both CArG boxes and the GC-rich element were bound by protein within the animal. Additionally, using the rat carotid injury model we showed that Sp1 protein was significantly increased in SMCs located within the myointimal lesion, suggesting that increased expression of this putative repressor factor may contribute to the decreased SM MHC expression within SMCs found in myointimal lesions. We have previously shown that maximal expression of the rat smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) gene in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) required the presence of a highly conserved domain (nucleotides −1321 and −1095) that contained two positive-acting serum response factor (SRF) binding elements (CArG boxes 1 and 2) and a negative-acting GC-rich element that was recognized by Sp1 (Madsen, C.

Vascular lesions resulting from either atherosclerotic disease or restenosis are characterized by the significant presence of SMCs 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; SM-MHC, smooth muscle myocin heavy chain; SRF, serum response factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; TE, Tris-EDTA buffer; LMPCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). that are phenotypically distinct from fully differentiated medial SMCs (2Ross R.

Major modifications include decreased expression of smooth muscle isoforms of contractile proteins, increased matrix production, altered growth regulatory properties, altred lipid metabolism, and decreased contractility (5Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The process by which SMCs undergo such changes is referred to as “phenotypic modulation” (6Chamley-Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 40: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Importantly, these alterations in SMC protein expression patterns cannot simply be viewed as a consequence of vascular disease, but rather are likely to contribute to its progression. The identification of the molecular mechanisms that regulate protein expression in the normal SMC should provide for a better understanding of how these processes are altered in phenotypically modified SMCs. SM-MHC represents one of the best studied markers of the SMC (5Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Four SM-MHC isoforms (SM-1A, SM-1B, SM-2A, and SM-2B) have been identified (7Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9734-9737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8White S. Martin A.F. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1252-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kelley C.A.

Periasamy M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), that is exclusively expressed in SMCs (11Miano J. Cserjesi P. Ligon K. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Expression of the SM-MHC gene has been shown to be regulated in a manner that exquisitely “marks” the differentiated state of the SMC both during normal vascular development and in vascular disease. In humans and rabbit, SM-1 is expressed during early fetal development with SM-2 appearing only after birth in what is thought to be the fully differentiated or mature SMC (12Aikawa M. Sivam P.N.

Moreover, several studies have shown that SM-MHC expression is significantly decreased in vascular lesions (12Aikawa M. Sivam P.N. Kuro Kimura K. Nakahara K. Takewaki S. Ueda M. Yamaguchi H.

Thus, SM-MHC represents an excellent gene for delineating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that define the differentiated state of the SMC. The 5′-flanking regions of SM-MHC genes cloned from rat (18White S.L. Low R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15008-15017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), rabbit (19Katoh Y. Loukianov E. Kopras E. Zilberman A. Periasamy M. J. Biol.

Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that this domain was required for maximal SM-MHC promoter activity in vascular SMCs, and that present within this domain were two positive-acting CArG boxes that were specifically recognized by SRF, and a negative-acting GC-rich element that was recognized by Sp1 (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In a separate investigation of the rabbit SM-MHC promoter, transient transfection studies and analysis of protein-DNA interactions revealed that an approximately 100-bp segment of the conserved domain, located just upstream of CArG-box2, contained multiple enhancer elements each interacting with unidentified factors, two of which were thought to be SM-specific (21Kallmeier R.C. Somasundaram C. Babij P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30949-30957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An additional study of rat SM-MHC promoter activity in a variety of cell types, revealed that the region spanning nucleotides −1317 to −1249 was important for the restriction of gene expression to SMCs (18White S.L. Low R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15008-15017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, this very complex and highly active domain appears to contain a multitude of cis elements that interact with multiple factors, of which only a few have been putatively identified. In addition to this conserved 227-bp domain, two tandemly oriented CCTCCC elements, located proximal to the transcriptional start site, have been identified and also shown to be important for SM-MHC expression (20Wantanabe M. Sakomura Y. Kurabayashi M. Manabe I. Aikawa M. Kuro-o M. Suzuki T. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 978-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CArG box motif has been demonstrated to be important for expression of multiple SM-specific genes including SM-MHC (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), SM α-actin (22Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), SM-22α (23Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and telokin (24Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 41: C1394-C1404Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, a better understanding of CArG-dependent regulation for any one of these genes could lead to the identification of an important common transcriptional mechanism. In the present study, we generated a series of combinatorial mutants to better understand how CArG boxes 1 and 2 functioned within the SM-MHC promoter in vascular SMCs and how a GC-rich element, which is located between the two CArGs and which is specifically recognized by Sp1, influenced their activity. These data revealed that, upon removal of the GC-rich repressor, CArG-box1 could sustain activity in the absence of CArG-box2. In view of the fact that both CArGs in the SM α-actin promoter were absolutely required for activity (22Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that activation through the CArG motif may involve different gene-specific mechanisms. Furthermore, unlike other factors shown to inhibit SRF activity, gel-shift analysis of Sp1 and SRF binding to the juxtaposed GC-rich repressor and CArG-box2 elements, revealed that the mechanism of repression was not likely to be mediated through direct inhibition of SRF binding. To assess their likely importance for SM-MHC expression in the fully differentiated vascular SMC, we performed in vivo footprinting on the intact rat aorta to demonstrate that protein-DNA interaction occurred at both CArG boxes and the GC-rich repressor element. Finally, we found that Sp1 presence was increased in myointimal SMCs in a rat carotid injury model, suggesting that the GC-rich repressor element may contribute to reduced SM-MHC protein expression in dedifferentiated myointimal SMCs. The cloning, determination of the +1 start site, and sequencing of the rat SM-MHC promoter have been previously described (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18White S.L. Low R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15008-15017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The construction of pCAT-1346, pCAT-1182, and pCAT-1102 promoter-chloramphenicol reporter plasmids containing progressive deletions of rat SM-MHC 5′-flanking DNA was described previously (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the pCAT-1346 construct was performed using the Ex-site mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The integrity of each mutated construct was determined by dideoxy sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). SMCs from rat thoracic aorta were isolated and cultured under conditions that result in retention of expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker proteins including SM1 (26Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). SMCs (passage 10–22) were seeded for transient transfection assays into six-well plates at a density of 2 × 104. These densities were chosen so that the cells would be at 70–80% confluence at the time of transfection (24 h after plating). Transfections of the CAT-reporter gene constructs, subsequent growth conditions of the SMCs, and determination of CAT activities, were all done as described previously (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The promoterless-pCAT construct was transfected into triplicate wells to serve as the base-line indicator of CAT activity, and the activity of each promoter construct is expressed relative to the promoterless construct set to one. Additionally, a SV40 promoter-CAT construct with enhancer (Promega) served as a positive control of transfection and CAT activity. All SMC CAT activity values represent at least three independent experiments with each construct tested in triplicate per experiment. Relative CAT activity data are expressed as the means ± S.D. computed from the results obtained from each set of transfection experiments. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls's multiple range test were used for data analysis. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Recombinant SRF was generated using anin vitro transcription and translation kit (Stratagene) as described previously (27Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide affinity-column purified Sp1 was obtained from a commercial source (Santa Cruz). The oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were purchased commercially (Operon Technologies, Inc.) and included the following: C2 oligo, 5′-cctggcctttttgggttgtt-3′; GC oligo, 5′-ggttgtttcccgcccaggcc-3′, and C2 + GC oligo, 5′-cctggcctttttgggttgttcccgcccaggcc-3′. EMSAs were performed with 20 μl of binding reaction that included ∼30 pg of32P-end-labeled annealed oligonucleotides, SRF and Sp1 as indicated, and 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 1 × binding buffer (12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were subjected to electrophoreses on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, which had been pre-run at 170 V for 1 h. Electrophoresis was performed at 170 V in 0.5 × 0.45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed to film for 24–48 h. The anti-Sp1 and anti-SRF antibodies used for EMSA supershift experiments were all purchased commercially (Santa Cruz). EMSA binding reactions were set up as described above and incubated for 20 min; 2 μl of the antibody were added to the mixture; and the reaction was incubated for another 15 min at room temperature and then loaded onto the gel for electrophoresis. The thoracic aortas from eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected individually from each animal and immediately placed in 5 ml of 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The aortas were incubated for 2 min with constant gentle shaking and rinsed three times in 50 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Aortas were stored in this same solution until all dissections were completed. The adventitial and endothelial layers of the aortae were mechanically removed to minimize contribution of non-SMC DNA in the subsequent polymerase chain reactions. The aortae were then cut into small pieces, pooled, and placed in a lysis solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.3 mg of proteinase K per ml. Following an overnight room temperature incubation, chromosomal DNA was isolated by extraction with phenol (pH 8.0) (twice), phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (twice), and chloroform (once) with gently mixing by inversion. After adjusting the NaCl concentration to 0.2 m, the DNA was precipitated with the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol, and the precipitate was transferred to 0.5 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer (TE) in a new tube, redissolved, and precipitated again with ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.4 ml of TE, and the concentration was measured by optical density at 260 nm. For the in vitro methylated controls, 100 μg of Sprague-Dawley rat kidney DNA was extensively deproteinized as described above with phenol and chloroform, modified with 0.5% DMS, and precipitated with ice-cold DMS stop solution. A plasmid containing the SM-MHC promoter (pCAT-1346) was also subjected to DMS treatment and used as an additional in vitro control and also for sequence verification. An approximate equivalent amount ofin vivo methylated DNA was also precipitated with DMS stop solution. The samples were dissolved in 180 μl of H2O, adjusted to a concentration of 10% piperidine, and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were cooled on ice and precipitated with the addition of 0.2 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and ethanol. After two more rounds of ethanol precipitation, the samples were dried overnight, precipitated again, and resuspended in TE to 0.4 mg/ml. The ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) performed on the DMS-treated DNA samples was as described previously (28Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), with minor exceptions. First strand synthesis and subsequent PCRs were performed with Taq polymerase using the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Following the first strand synthesis step and prior to the ligation reaction, samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. This added extraction step seemed to increase ligation efficiency. Three sets of oligonucleotide primers (nine total) were utilized to analyze the CArG-box2-, GC-rich-, and CArG-box1-containing regions of the 227-bp conserved element. These were as follows: MHCP1, 5′-gaatcccttttctctaagga-3′; MHCP2, 5′-ttctctaaggacgcaggatctgggt-3′; MHCP3, 5′-aggatctgggtggctgcagggagcgagg-3′; MHCP4, 5′-aggcagagttggcctcatg-3′; MHCP5, 5′-caggccgggggacgcctcgctc-3′; MHCP6, 5′-gacgcctcgctccccgcgcacggac-3′; MHCP7, 5′-agggaggaccagctcagga-3′; MHCP8, 5′-ctcaggacctcgagggtccgtgcg-3′; MHCP9, 5′-ctcgagggtccgtgcgcggggagcga-3′. To evaluate the potential for reaction variability, multiple LMPCRs were performed on the in vivo aortic, in vitrocontrol kidney, and SM-MHC plasmid DNAs. All samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% sequencing gels along with an additional32P-end-labeled molecular weight ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) and exposed to film. We observed that band intensities were highly consistent between individual LMPCRs, and that the in vitro control kidney DNA and the SM-MHC plasmid DNA both yielded essentially identical patterns of methylation reactivity (not shown). Quantitation and identification of protected or hypermethylated guanine residues was as described previously (29Ghivizzani S.C. Madsen C.S. Hauswirth W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8675-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat carotid arteries injured by balloon catheterization were prepared by Zivic-Miller Laboratories. Fourteen days after injury the left injured and the right uninjured carotid vessels were perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for routine histology. Six-mm sections were cut and placed on ProBond slides (Fisher). Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with xylene (three changes, 10 min each) and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series of 100, 95, and 70% (two changes each at 3 min per change). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treating with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Blocking of nonspecific binding was accomplished with a 1-h incubation in 2.0% goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The slides were incubated overnight in the primary anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Binding of the primary antibody was detected with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody that was subsequently detected with an avidin-biotin complex with horseradish peroxidase (Vectostain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) using diaminobenzinide tetrahydrochloride as the peroxidase substrate. The SM-MHC, SM-22α, and SM α-actin promoters all contain a set of paired CArG boxes each of which has been demonstrated to specifically bind SRF (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For all three promoters, both CArG elements were shown to be required for maximal transcriptional activity in cultured vascular SMCs. However, in contrast to the SM-MHC and SM α-actin promoters where mutation of either CArG element resulted in complete abrogation of all CArG-dependent activity, the most proximal CArG box in the SM-22α promoter was capable of sustaining activity on its own, albeit at a reduced level. Thus, although the transcriptional mechanisms that utilize this dual-CArG motif are likely to have several features in common, other gene-specific differences may also exist. To better understand CArG-dependent regulation of the SM-MHC gene and to gain insight regarding the role of the GC-rich repressor element, we analyzed the activity of these elements in a variety of sequence contexts. From our previous deletion analysis (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we determined that a SM-MHC reporter-gene construct containing nucleotides −1346 to +88 (pCAT-1346), that included the entire 227-bp conserved domain, was sufficient for maximal transcriptional activity in vascular SMCs. Using this pCAT-1346 construct as a template, both CArG boxes and the GC-rich repressor element were mutated either alone or in combination with each other, and tested for alterations of transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays using cultured vascular SMCs (Fig. 1). For comparative purposes wild-type deletion constructs pCAT-1102, pCAT-1182, and pCAT-1346 were also included in the analysis. For ease of reference we refer to activity levels at or below 20-fold over promoterless pCAT (the level of pCAT-1102 construct which does not contain the 227-bp domain) as minimal. The activity levels of pCAT-CArG1Mut, pCAT-CArG2MutA, and pCAT-GC-richMutA were previously described (1Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), however, because CArG-box2 (CCTTTTTGGG) does not conform to the classic CArG consensus site (CC(A/T)6GG) (30Wynne J. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we generated a different mutation within this element (pCAT-CArG2MutB) that was previously shown to be important for SRF binding (22Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Also for verification purposes, we created an additional mutant construct that targeted the GC-rich repressor element (pCAT-GCrichMutB) at nucleotide positions known to be required for Sp1 binding (32Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 the activity levels of the pCAT-CArG2MutA and pCAT-CArG2MutB constructs were approximately equal (20- and 17-fold over promoterless pCAT, respectively). This similar decrease in activity levels suggests that both mutations equally inhibited binding of the same positive acting factor, most likely SRF. Likewise, the similar increases in activity levels observed for pCAT-GCrichMutA (87-fold over promoterless pCAT) and pCAT-GCrichMutB (94-fold over promoterless pCAT), indicated the abrogation of binding of a common negative-acting factor, potentially Sp1 or a related family member. Based on the juxtapositioning of the GC-rich repressor element and CArG-box2, we originally hypothesized that the primary mechanism of repression was likely to be mediated through factor binding to the GC-rich sequence leading to inhibition of SRF binding to CArG-box2. However, the combinatorial mutation data strongly suggests that the presence of the GC-rich element can also negatively regulate CArG-box1 activity. As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of pCAT-1182 which contains CArG-box1 was greater than that of pCAT-1102 (34- versus20-fold over promoterless pCAT). This finding suggested that CArG-box1 contained within the pCAT-1182 construct was capable of enhancing transcription above the 20-fold minimal level in the absence of CArG-box2. However, when CArG-box2 was mutated (pCAT-CArG2MutA and -MutB) within the context of the pCAT-1346 construct, transcriptional activity decreased to the 20-fold level of pCAT-1102 and not the expected 34-fold level observed for the pCAT-1182 construct, even though CArG-box1 remained intact. These data suggested that a repressor element located between nucleotides −1182 and −1346 negatively influenced CArG-box1 activity. To test if the previously identified GC-rich repressor element was responsible for the putative decrease in CArG-box1 activity, we generated a construct in which both CArG-box2 and the GC-rich repressor element were mutated (pCAT-CArG2/GC-richMut). Mutation of CArG-box2 along with the GC-rich element allowed us to rule out the possibility that any noted increases in activity could be due to alleviation of repressor effects on CArG-box2 activity. The activity level of this construct was determined to be 35-fold over that of promoterless-pCAT, essentially identical to the 34-fold activity level of the pCAT-1182 construct. Activity returned to a minimal level when CArG-box1 was mutated along with the CArG-box2 and GC-rich elements (pCAT-CArG1/CArG2/GC-richMut). These data strongly suggest that the GC-rich element, located greater"

The three separate species (heterodimer, 70-kDa subunit, and 83-kDa subunit homodimer) all have ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity. The Ku autoantigen was originally isolated as a nuclear protein recognized by the sera of lupus erythematosus patients (1Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar); it is a heterodimer made of two subunits that have been ascribed slightly different molecular masses in different labs; in this work we shall define them by the molecular masses calculated from the straight amino acid sequence, namely 83 and 70 kDa. Ku has the ability to bind specifically to the ends of duplex DNA and then slide into the duplex to form a structure similar to beads on a string (2Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule is essential for the recombination events necessary for the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes (V(D)J recombination) as well as for the repair of double strand DNA breaks caused by x-ray damage. Cell lines bearing mutations affecting the 83-kDa subunit appear to be deficient in both of these properties as well as in the duplex DNA end-binding ability of the extracted nuclear proteins (3Zhu C. Bogue M.A. Lim D.-S. Hasty P. Roth D.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Ku83-deficient mice exhibit severe combined immunodeficiency due to T and B lymphocyte arrest at early progenitor stages (3Zhu C. Bogue M.A. Lim D.-S. Hasty P. Roth D.B.

Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ku has also been reported to be a substrate as well as a cofactor of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, which is also essential for the V(D)J recombination and x-ray repair processes (5Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

In the past, we showed that Ku is also endowed with an ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity denominated human DNA helicase II (HDH II) 1The abbreviations used are: HDH II, human DNA helicase II; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; NDSB, dimethyl ethylammonium propane sulfonate. , probably located on a different moiety of the molecule than the one involved in duplex DNA binding (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A.

Furthermore, after cloning of the cDNAs of the separate subunits, we could obtain the proteins in pure form and renature the heterodimer, partially reconstituting both DNA binding and DNA unwinding activities. Under those conditions, it was not possible to separately renature the two subunits, since the 73-kDa one could not be solubilized in the absence of the other one. In this work, we used a novel molecule designed to facilitate protein solubilization (9Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Leberman R. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Vuillard L. Braun-Breton C. Rabilloud T. Biochem.

Des. 1996; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This has allowed the separate refolding of either subunit; it was thus possible to study on which subunit(s) the two measurable functions of Ku reside. All the buffers except buffer G contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μmleupeptin, and 1 mm sodium metabisulfite. Buffer G contained 6 m guanidinium hydrocloride, 100 mmsodium dihydrogen phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Buffer R contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Buffer C contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The cloning of the cDNAs of the HDH II/Ku subunits was described previously (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S.

Escherichia coli cells (strain BL 21 (DE3)(pLysS)) transformed with the respective plasmids for the 70- or 83-kDa subunits of HDH II/Ku were grown in LB medium (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cultures were shaken for a further 2.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA). After two freeze-thaw cycles, the extremely viscous solution was fluidified by sonication and centrifuged. The pelleted inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer G (denaturing buffer) and purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S300 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C in the same buffer to eliminate possible low molecular mass contaminants of bacterial origin and renatured in the presence of dimethylethyl ammonium propane sulfonate (see “Results”). The refolded separate subunits were adjusted to the composition of buffer C and applied separately onto a MonoQ HR5/5 (1 ml) column equilibrated on fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia) in buffer C. Purification of the refolded structures was followed by monitoring the DNA unwinding activity for the 70-kDa subunit and by DNA binding and helicase assays for the recombinant heterodimer, whereas for the 83-kDa subunit, purification was followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. DNA gel retardation experiments were performed on a32P-5′ end-labeled duplex of 25 base pairs (5′-GATCTCGCATCACGTGACGAAGATC-3′ and its complementary sequence when appropriate) essentially as described (13Tribioli C. Biamonti G. Giacca M. Riva S. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10211-10232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The 20-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) sucrose, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, ∼0.05 pmol of32P-labeled DNA probe (generally 10,000–30,000 cpm) and the enzyme fractions. After incubation of the reaction mixture for 30 min at room temperature, the products were separated on a 5% nondenaturing PAGE in buffer containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified after excision in a β counter. We define 1 unit of DNA binding activity as the amount of enzyme that retards 1 fmol of DNA probe in a gel retardation assay. The helicase assay contained the same components as the gel shift assay in a 10-μl reaction mixture except for the DNA substrate, which was a32P-5′ end-labeled 47-mer oligonucleotide annealed to M13 ssDNA in its central 17 nucleotides, yielding a partial duplex with 5′ and 3′ tails of 15 nucleotides each. The sequence of this oligonucleotide as well as the structure of the substrate has already been reported (14Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Skopac D. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). About 0.005 pmol of the substrate (generally ∼5000 cpm) was used in each reaction mixture. After incubation with the enzyme fractions for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.3% SDS, and 0.3% bromphenol blue (final concentrations). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% nondenaturing PAGE in buffer containing 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, and helicase activity was visualized as described earlier (15Tuteja N. Ochem A. Taneja P. Tuteja R. Skopac D. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We define 1 unit of helicase activity as the amount of enzyme that unwinds 1% of the substrate in 1 min at 37 °C (30% in 30 min) in the linear range of enzyme concentration dependence. ATPase assays were performed as already described (14Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Skopac D. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with minor modifications in the final concentrations of ATP (100 μm) and γ-32P (33 nCi) used. The cloning and expression of the separate subunits of HDH II/Ku in E. coli were carried out as already described (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies were isolated by standard methods (Ref. 16Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar; see also “Experimental Procedures”) and further subjected separately to gel filtration on Sephacryl S300 resin. Earlier attempts to renature the 70-kDa subunit separately by dialysis were unsuccessful, since it showed an intrinsic tendency to precipitate. However, when the separate subunits of HDH II/Ku (50 ml of Sephacryl S300-purified fractions in buffer G) as well as an equimolar mixture of these were treated individually by the addition of the nondetergent solubilizing and stabilizing agent NDSB 195 (dimethylethyl ammonium propane sulfonate) (9Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Leberman R. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Vuillard L. Braun-Breton C. Rabilloud T. Biochem.

Des. 1996; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 0.2 m and dialyzed at 4 °Cversus eight changes of 2,000 ml of buffer R, each of the separate subunits remained in solution during dialysis, and renaturation could thus be achieved. (An earlier attempt at refolding using NDSB 195 at a final concentration of 0.1 m had resulted in slight precipitation of the separate subunits during dialysis). NDSB is a nondetergent zwitterionic molecule and hence dialyzes easily; it is, however, a significantly larger molecule than guanidine, and one might then expect that the latter will dialyze out before NDSB. The dialyzed samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C in Sorvall superspeed 34 rotor for 20 min, and the supernatants were used either directly or after one further purification step for DNA binding and helicase assays. The refolded separate subunits were individually subjected to a further purification step by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography. After extensive washing of the column, bound material was eluted in each case with 20 column volumes of 0.1–1 m NaCl linear gradient. In each case the subunit eluted at approximately 0.25 msalt. The reconstituted heterodimer was further purified by double strand DNA-Sepharose affinity chromatography as already described (17Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 18Csordas-Toth E. Marusic' L. Ochem A. Patthy A. Pongor S. Giacca M. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, panel A, shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the noninduced and induced bacterial strains before gel filtration, panel B shows the SDS-PAGE, andpanel C shows the Western blot analyses of the various refolded recombinant HDH II/Ku species before and after their final steps of purification. The renatured separate subunits of HDH II/Ku were assayed for the in vitro activities (band shift and helicase) to determine whether these could be associated with either subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, the 70-kDa subunit possesses a helicase activity comparable to that of the heterodimer, whereas the 83-kDa subunit shows no detectable helicase activity. Neither subunit shows any appreciable capacity to retard the mobility of duplex DNA, indicating that neither of them alone has the ability of the native Ku to bind to the duplex ends (Fig. 2,panel B). Conversely, the 70-kDa subunit alone maintains a measurable affinity for ssDNA comparable to that of native and recombinant Ku (Fig. 2, panel C), in agreement with the maintenance of the helicase activity in this subunit, since most known helicases bind initially to the single strand portion of the substrate. These findings suggest that, whereas the helicase activity ascribed to HDH II/Ku resides only in the 70-kDa subunit, the DNA end-binding capacity requires the presence of both subunits in the heterodimeric form. A comparative quantitation of the activities of the different forms of HDH II/Ku is reported in TableI. Before analyzing in detail the catalytic and binding constants for functional properties of the different molecular forms, we investigated their subunit composition.Table IQuantitation of the in vitro activities of recombinant HDH II/Ku heterodimer and subunits and comparison with those of HeLa-purified heterodimerSpecies assayedDNA bindingHelicase activityssDNA-dependent ATPase25-mer duplex25-mer single strandunits/mg 1-a1 unit of DNA binding activity is the amount of enzyme that retards 1 fmol of DNA probe in a gel shift assay.% relative to HeLa Kuunits/mg 1-a1 unit of DNA binding activity is the amount of enzyme that retards 1 fmol of DNA probe in a gel shift assay.% relative to HeLa Kuunits/mg 1-b1 unit of helicase activity is the amount of enzyme that unwinds 1% of substrate in 1 min (30% in 30 min) at 37° C in the linear range of enzyme concentration dependence.% relative to HeLa Kuunits/mg 1-c1 unit of ATPase activity is the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 mmol of ATP per min.% relative to HeLa KuHeLa HDH II/Ku3.6 × 1061001.9 × 1041001.7 × 10510037.3100recombinant HDH II/Ku6.5 × 1041.81.4 × 104721.5 × 10588.230.080recombinant Ku 83<10<0.013 × 1021.4<10<0.053.69.6recombinant Ku 70∼780∼0.021.4 × 104727.6 × 10444.710.0271-a 1 unit of DNA binding activity is the amount of enzyme that retards 1 fmol of DNA probe in a gel shift assay.1-b 1 unit of helicase activity is the amount of enzyme that unwinds 1% of substrate in 1 min (30% in 30 min) at 37° C in the linear range of enzyme concentration dependence.1-c 1 unit of ATPase activity is the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 mmol of ATP per min. Open table in a new tab We determined the native molecular mass of the refolded separate subunits of HDH II/Ku as well as that of a post-refolding equimolar mixture of these by a combination of glycerol gradient sedimentation (15–35%) and gel filtration in buffer C as described by Siegel and Monty (19Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 12: 346-362Google Scholar). We also determined whether the heterodimer could be reconstituted by mixing equimolar amounts of the separately refolded subunits. As shown in Figs. 3 and4, the helicase activity of the renatured 70-kDa subunit alone showed a native molecular mass correspondent to the one observed in SDS-PAGE; in the post-refolding equimolar mixture, the same molecular mass was measured for helicase activity, whereas in the reconstituted heterodimer, the activity showed a molecular mass corresponding to that of the sum of the molecular mass values of the two subunits (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE analysis of the gel filtration experiments showed that the 83-kDa subunit, whether renatured alone or in the post-refolding mixture, eluted at a volume close to that of the reconstituted heterodimer (Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that the refolded 70-kDa subunit of HDH II/Ku remains as a monomer in solution, even in the presence of equimolar amounts of the other subunit and that the heterodimer cannot be reconstituted by mixing and incubating equimolar amounts of the renatured subunits; furthermore, the 83-kDa subunit, when renatured alone, forms homodimers that do not spontaneously exchange with the renatured 70-kDa subunit added subsequently (see Fig. 4).Figure 4Molecular weight determination by gel filtration chromatography. The refolded separate subunits of HDH II/Ku as well as a post-refolding equimolar mixture of these were separately subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 (Pharmacia) 24-ml column (fast protein liquid chromatography) as shown in the figure; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. a, selected mass markers (Mr) (aldolase, bovine serum albumin (BSA), cytochrome c (Cytochr.C);b, rKu 83 alone; c, rKu 70 alone; d, post-refolding mixture of the separate subunits.

The various forms of HDH II (HeLa-purified heterodimer, reconstituted recombinant heterodimer, and recombinant 70-kDa subunit) were assayed for helicase activity in the presence of increasing amounts of substrate. Fig.5, panel A shows a direct plot of DNA unwinding against substrate concentration. Fig. 5, panel B, shows the double-reciprocal plot to determine theK m values relative to these enzyme species. It appears that these three enzyme species have the same affinity for the helicase substrate (K m of 0.5 nm) but different V max values when expressed as mmol of substrate unwound × mol−1 of enzyme × min−1 (namely, 2.1 for the natural Ku form, 1.7 for the recombinant form, and 0.4 for the 70-kDa subunit). The DNA binding ability, as assayed by electrophoretic mobility gel retardation, is essentially observed only for the native heterodimeric form of HDH II/Ku and, albeit at a markedly reduced level, for the recombinant heterodimer. The 70-kDa subunit exhibits only traces of DNA binding at very high protein/DNA ratios, whereas the 83-kDa subunit shows no detectable DNA binding in the range of assayed protein concentrations. Conversely, the ability to bind ssDNA, that in the native form is approximately one-hundredth that for duplex DNA, is reconstituted almost completely in the recombinant heterodimer and (not suprisingly, as seen above) in the 70-kDa subunit, i.e. the moiety where the unwinding capacity resides. We then determined the protein concentration dependence for the DNA binding activity of the two heterodimeric forms (HeLa-purified and recombinant) of HDH II/Ku. Fig. 6 shows a linear dependence of DNA binding on protein concentration of up to 5 ng for the HeLa-purified enzyme, with an apparent K d for this species of approximately 1.0 nm. The recombinant heterodimer showed, as pointed out earlier, only 1.8% of the DNA binding activity observed for the HeLa-purified enzyme, and the estimated value of K d for the reconstituted molecule is about 0.05 μm. The amount of DNA unwound in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP in the standard assay condition is shown in Fig. 7 and reported in double-reciprocal form in Fig.8. We can estimate K m values for ATP of 11.7 mm for the HeLa-purified enzyme, 7.7 mm for the recombinant heterodimer, and 4.4 mmfor the 70-kDa subunit. The observed differences in the affinities of these enzyme species for ATP are in agreement with the above reported differences in the V max of their respective DNA helicase activities.Figure 8Determination of the K m for ATP for the helicase activity of the various forms of HDH II/Ku. Panel A, direct plot of dependence of helicase activity on ATP concentration determined from the data of the results shown in Fig.6. The K m values that these enzymes species exhibit for ATP are calculated from the double-reciprocal plot in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The various species of HDH II/Ku as well as the separate subunits were assayed for ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 100 μm ATP. For all the species tested, ATP hydrolysis was observed in the assay conditions, namely at the level of 1.12 μmol of ATP/mg for HeLa-purified Ku, 0.9 μmol/mg for recombinant Ku heterodimer, 0.3 μmol/mg for recombinant Ku 70, and 0.11 μmol/mg for recombinant Ku 83 (see also Table I). As shown above, ATP-dependent DNA-unwinding ability had been observed for all these species except the 83-kDa subunit. The presence of this functionally unexplained ATPase activity in the large subunit agrees with the described presence of a putative ATP binding site in the same molecule (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The results obtained by this work show the possibility of uncoupling the two in vitro activities of HDH II/Ku described earlier (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The properties of the refolded HDH II/Ku and of the two separate subunits show that the DNA-unwinding activity ascribed to the heterodimer resides in fact exclusively in the 70-kDa subunit. The DNA end-binding capacity, however, remains a prerogative of the HDH II/Ku heterodimer, suggesting that the presence of this molecular form is required to perform the reactions necessary for repair of double-strand breaks and V(D)J recombination. Whether this scenario represents the situation in vivo is hard to say from this study but certainly raises the speculation of a possible differentialin vivo expression of these subunits according to the circumstantial cellular requirements for Ku. It should be remembered here that the genes for the Ku subunits are localized on different chromosomes (20Cai Q.-Q. Plet A. Imbert J. Lafage-Pochtaloff M. Cerdan C. Blanchard J.-M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1994; 65: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that a number of reports have attributed different properties to either subunit of Ku, suggesting that the enzyme may not always exist in its heterodimeric form (21Messier H. Fuller T. Mangal S. Brikner H. Igarashi S. Gaikwad J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Le Romancer M. Reyl-Desmars F. Cherifi Y. Pigeon C. Bottari S. Meyer O. Lewin M.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17464-17468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the heterodimer has always been isolated from proliferating nuclei, not much is known about the nature and structure of this protein in other phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the 70-kDa subunit alone has been immunologically localized to the nucleoli and periphery of interphase nuclei (23Higashiura M. Shimizu Y. Tanimoto M. Morita T. Yagura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presence of helicase activity in the 70-kDa subunit alone therefore offers additional circumstantial evidence of the possible independent in vivo existence of this subunit in certain conditions and of possible additional roles for this molecule in DNA metabolism. The observation that the unwinding activity resides in the small subunit whereas the heterodimeric structure is required for duplex DNA end-binding confirms our previous inference (based on the lack of reciprocal inhibition of either activity by the substrate of the other one) that these two properties are located in two different moieties of the Ku heterodimer (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the DNA unwinding at different substrate concentrations gave a K m value of 0.5 nm for the three active species of HDH II/Ku. Thus, the three species have the same affinity for the helicase substrate notwithstanding their relative conformational and supramolecular differences. The differences in the observed V max values are parallel with the different affinities for ATP, which is not a surprising observation considering that helicase activity strictly depends on ATP hydrolysis. The fact that the ATPase activity of the 83-kDa subunit is not associated to any appreciable helicase activity leaves unexplained its possible functional significance, although similar cases have been reported (24Pereira S. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30401-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that in the heterodimeric form, the intrinsic ATPase function of the 83-kDa subunit may be the basis for the higher V max of the heterodimer as helicase (more than 4-fold) with respect to the 70-kDa Ku subunit alone. The likely absence of a helicase active center in the 83-kDa subunit makes its ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity a futile one, at least at first sight. Contrary to the situation with the unwinding activity, the DNA binding capacity was restored by the renaturation procedure rather poorly for the heterodimer as well. In fact, in different preparations, we observed a significant variability in the extent of reconstitution of DNA end-binding capacity of Ku, reaching in some cases 20% that of the activity of the native Ku heterodimer purified from HeLa cells. Furthermore, this capacity proved also very labile upon storage at 4 °C, much more than for native Ku. The reasons for this discrepancy (with respect to the satisfactory reconstitution of unwinding activity) may lie on the fact that 1) the helicase active center (and the ssDNA binding moiety) resides on a distinct position of the molecule with respect to the duplex DNA end-binding domain and 2) post-translational modifications of Ku operating in vivo may enhance and stabilize the duplex end-binding capacity. The separate subunits showed only minimal or no duplex DNA binding ability, even with respect to the reduced reconstituted property of the heterodimer; in fact, only the small subunit showed a binding capacity of the order of 1% that of the reconstituted recombinant dimer. From our data it appears that the formation of a dimeric structure per se is not enough to confer the property of binding DNA, since the large subunit can form homodimers without reacquiring the ability to bind DNA. It appears therefore that the duplex DNA binding ability is an intrinsic property of a specific molecular environment produced by the formation of the heterodimer. This observation may appear in contrast with previous reports from different laboratories including ours (18Csordas-Toth E. Marusic' L. Ochem A. Patthy A. Pongor S. Giacca M. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that the separate subunits show ability to bind DNA probes in a South-Western type of assay, the 70-kDa subunit having greater affinity than the large one (25Chou C.-H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the assay for electrophoretic gel retardation is a much more stringent one than the South-Western, and it is likely that this discrepancy is purely apparent. In fact, if the interaction of the small subunit with DNA is measured also (see e.g. Wanget al. (26Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.-H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) with other methods that, like the South-Western assay, do not allow a precise determination of theK d value, this molecule shows indeed a certain capacity of binding duplex DNA. The same authors, on the other hand, confirm that the 70-kDa subunit does not cause any appreciable band shift on duplex DNA. Wu and Lieber (27Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), by a completely different approach (two- hybrid and biochemical analyses of the interactions of Ku 70 and 83 and of truncated forms of these molecules), arrive in fact to the same conclusions as this report. In their work, neither the 70- nor the 83-kDa subunit, when translated alone, is able to bind DNA in band-shift assay, whereas they do so when translated jointly. These authors are also able to ascribe to C-terminal regions of the two subunits the properties of heterodimer formation and DNA binding. It seems reasonable to conclude at this stage that neither subunit alone can efficiently bind duplex DNA. These considerations do not apply to the ability to bind ssDNA, which is in all probability related (functionally and physically) to the unwinding capacity of Ku. In fact, the affinities of the recombinant heterodimer and of the 70-kDa subunit for ssDNA are quantitatively comparable to the reconstituted DNA-unwinding capacity of the same molecular forms (see Tables I and II). Also, the 83-kDa subunit homodimer maintains a trace (small but significant) of ssDNA affinity that probably sustains the trace of ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity observed for this molecular form. Structural data on Ku are not yet available, but the properties measured by biochemical means would favor the presence of some form of ring structure in the heterodimer able to bind to ends and then slide along the duplex DNA in a nearly irreversible way. This observation is in agreement with the wealth of data indicating a strong but promiscuous requirement of Ku for binding DNA ends, since the heterodimer can bind them irrespective of their DNA sequence or their chemical-detailed structure (5′ protruding, 3′ protruding, phosphorylated, or nonphosphorylated, hairpin, etc.). This contention is further strengthened by the demonstrated inability of Ku antigen to bind to circular duplexes (18Csordas-Toth E. Marusic' L. Ochem A. Patthy A. Pongor S. Giacca M. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and by the inability of Ku bound to a duplex to be removed when the loaded duplex is closed into a circle (28Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to this observation, are the results reported by Giffin et al. (29Giffin W. Terrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Haché R.J.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) of a sequence specificity for Ku that apparently allows the binding of the molecule even to a circular DNA duplex. Whereas this binding (whose mechanism remains to be described) may be related to the proposed function of Ku also as a transcription factor (30Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the most popular model for the Ku interaction with DNA duplex remains that of binding at the end and sliding along the duplex to form beads on a string with a 25-base pair periodicity. The ability of Ku to bind frayed ends would fit very well with the function of Ku in the illegitimate recombination processes required for immunoglobulin gene maturation and for x-ray damage repair. Obviously, the presence of a helicase activity (active only on DNA partial duplexes and not on RNA-containing structures (8Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.-W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)) could fit very well also with these events, even though no evidence has been available so far in this sense. The production of mutations and deletions in either subunit and the study of the functional effects of these mutations on those cellular processes will shed more light in the future on thein vivo mode of action of this important molecule and on its possible involvement in other cellular processes. Also, the relatively low capacity of DNA end-binding of the recombinant Ku (as well, of course, as the helicase activity itself) may be modified (in different ways in different moments of the cell cycle) by the phosphorylation of this molecule operated in vivo by the DNA-dependent protein kinase. Studies of the properties of partially deleted 70-kDa subunits and of the effect of in vitro phosphorylation of Ku on its functional activities are in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2062154472,"Insulin receptor substrates-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and -2) are important substrates of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have focused upon the role of IRS-1 in mediating the actions of insulin. In the present study, we demonstrate that IRS-2 can mediate translocation of the insulin responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in a physiologically relevant target cell for insulin action. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on cell lysates derived from freshly isolated rat adipose cells incubated in the presence or absence of insulin indicated that twice as much phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was associated with endogenous IRS-1 as with IRS-2 after insulin stimulation. When rat adipose cells in primary culture were transfected with expression vectors for IRS-1 or IRS-2, we observed 40-fold overexpression of human IRS-1 or murine IRS-2. In addition, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting experiments confirmed that the recombinant substrates were phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation. To examine the role of IRS-2 in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4, we studied the effects of overexpression of IRS-1 and -2 on translocation of a co-transfected epitope-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4-HA). Overexpression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 in adipose cells resulted in a significant increase in the basal level of cell surface GLUT4 (in the absence of insulin). Interestingly, at maximally effective concentrations of insulin (60 nm), the level of cell surface GLUT4 in cells overexpressing IRS-1 or -2 significantly exceeded the maximal recruitment observed in the control cells (160 and 135% of control, respectively; p < 0.003). Our data directly demonstrate that IRS-2, like IRS-1, is capable of participating in insulin signal transduction pathways leading to the recruitment of GLUT4. Thus, IRS-2 may provide an alternative pathway for critical metabolic actions of insulin. Insulin receptor substrates-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and -2) are important substrates of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have focused upon the role of IRS-1 in mediating the actions of insulin. In the present study, we demonstrate that IRS-2 can mediate translocation of the insulin responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in a physiologically relevant target cell for insulin action. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on cell lysates derived from freshly isolated rat adipose cells incubated in the presence or absence of insulin indicated that twice as much phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was associated with endogenous IRS-1 as with IRS-2 after insulin stimulation. When rat adipose cells in primary culture were transfected with expression vectors for IRS-1 or IRS-2, we observed 40-fold overexpression of human IRS-1 or murine IRS-2. In addition, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting experiments confirmed that the recombinant substrates were phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation.

Our data directly demonstrate that IRS-2, like IRS-1, is capable of participating in insulin signal transduction pathways leading to the recruitment of GLUT4. Thus, IRS-2 may provide an alternative pathway for critical metabolic actions of insulin. One of the major metabolic functions of insulin is to stimulate glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (1Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Taylor S.I. Trends Endocrinol.

IRS-2 is a protein homologous to IRS-1, originally identified as a protein phosphorylated in response to interleukin-4 (22Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H.

When the gene for IRS-1 was inactivated by gene targeting in transgenic mice, the IRS-1-deficient mice had reduced growth, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport, but retained significant residual response to insulin (8Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag 3rd, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 9Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H.

Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the existence of parallel pathways with the ability to mediate the metabolic actions of insulin and led to the identification and cloning of IRS-2 (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In vivo studies with IRS-1-deficient mice demonstrated that IRS-2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, and associates with and activates PI 3-kinase in liver and muscle following insulin stimulation (24Patti M.-E. Sun X.J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, both the phosphorylation of IRS-2 and the association of PI 3-kinase activity with IRS-2 are enhanced in IRS-1-deficient mice. Furthermore, it appears that the IRS-2 pathway may be sufficient to compensate for IRS-1 deficiency in liver because insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase is not significantly impaired in livers of IRS-1 deficient mice (25Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Sonenberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, IRS-1 deficiency impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport in isolated soleus muscle. This raises the provocative question of whether IRS-2 can substitute effectively for IRS-1 in mediating the activity of insulin to stimulate glucose transport. Although functional similarities between IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been suggested based on their structural similarities, some data suggest that the two molecules may not be totally interchangeable. For example, the two proteins are not identical with respect to distribution and level of expression in various tissues. Furthermore, Brüninget al. recently reported that IRS-2 cannot substitute for IRS-1 in mediating the mitogenic action of insulin-like growth factors (26Brüning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In light of these important questions, we addressed the issue of whether IRS-2 can participate in a similar fashion to IRS-1 in mediating the metabolic actions of insulin. We have used a previously described transient transfection system (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to directly demonstrate the ability of recombinant IRS-2 to mediate the translocation of GLUT4 in rat adipose cells, a physiologically relevant target cell for insulin action in vivo. It is likely that this activity of IRS-2 is explained by its ability to bind and activate PI 3-kinase. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (mouse monoclonal), anti-rat carboxyl-terminal IRS-1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal), anti-rat IRS-2 antibody (rabbit polyclonal), and anti-rat PI 3-kinase antibody (rabbit polyclonal) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-HA antibody HA-ll (mouse monoclonal) was purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). The mouse IRS-2 gene was cloned from a mouse P1 genomic DNA library ES 129/ola (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) that was screened using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed using two sequence-specific oligonucleotides (sense primer, 5′-CTTAGGAGTGGTGGTCCCAATAGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-AAGCGTGGCTGCAGGATCT -3′) under the following PCR conditions: denaturation, 95 °C for 5 min, for the first cycle, and 1 min in later cycles; annealing, 55 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 2 min (extended to 10 min in the last cycle). The PCR amplified a 98-base pair band. Ten P1 clones were identified in the first screening. DNA was prepared from three clones and analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting. In two clones, the restriction pattern was identical. In Southern blot analysis, the oligonucleotide probes (identical to the PCR primers listed above) hybridized to a 6.4-kbBamHI fragment. This genomic DNA fragment was then subcloned into pBK-CMV (Stratagene), and analyzed by restriction mapping. The nucleotide sequence was determined, and we identified a 3963-base pair open reading frame spanning the entire coding sequence of murine IRS-2 (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In addition, the clone contained 1.2-kb of 5′-flanking sequence and 1.2-kb of 3′-flanking sequence. The BamHI fragment was excised, blunt-ended, and ligated into the pCIS2 expression plasmid. pCIS2, an expression vector that generates high expression levels in transfected rat adipose cells (28Quon M.J.

Expression vectors for GLUT4-HA and hIRS-1 were constructed as described previously (7Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

For experiments where cell surface epitope-tagged GLUT4 was measured, cells from 15 cuvettes were pooled for each of four groups transfected with pCIS2, pCIS2/GLUT4-HA, hIRS1/GLUT4-HA, and mIRS2/GLUT4-HA. A total DNA concentration of 9 μg/cuvette was used for all groups (3 μg/cuvette of GLUT4-HA and 6 μg/cuvette of the co-transfected plasmid). 20 h after electroporation, adipose cells were processed as described (27Quon M.J.

Cell surface epitope-tagged GLUT4 was determined by using the anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody HA-11 in conjuction with 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG as described (30Chen H. Wertheimer S.J.

Cells transfected with the parent vector (pCIS2) alone were used to determine nonspecific binding of the antibodies. The lipid weight from a 200-μl aliquot of cells was determined as described (31Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used to normalize the data for each sample. Adipose cells were co-transfected with GLUT4-HA and either pCIS2 or expression vectors for hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 as described above. 20 h after electroporation, cells were treated without or with insulin (60 nm) for 2 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed once and resuspended in an equal volume of TES buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 8.73% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) at 18 °C. The cells were homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge needle three times. The total time elapsed from the beginning of insulin stimulation to homogenization was approximately 4 min. Total membrane fractions were isolated as described previously (30Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation, untransfected rat adipose cells were homogenized as described (32Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L.X. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J. Klinghoffer R. Kazlauskas A. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After normalization for protein concentration, equal volumes of whole cell lysates were mixed with 2 × immunoprecipitation buffer, (100 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). The resulting cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose during 60 min of incubation at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer. The samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis was carried out with the indicated antibody (1:3000 dilution). For blotting with HA-ll antibody (final concentration 5 μg/ml), samples were not boiled. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) was used to visualize the bands. For quantitative studies, we adjusted the exposure time for the x-ray films in an effort to ensure that the intensities of the bands would be linearly related to the quantity of protein contained in the bands. In fact, when we analyzed multiple films that had been obtained with different exposure times, we obtained nearly identical estimates of the relative intensities of the bands. These observations support the conclusion that the exposures were indeed in the linear range. Paired Student t tests were used to compare individual points where appropriate. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. To understand the physiological significance of IRS-2 in insulin signaling, we compared IRS-2 with IRS-1 in rat adipose cells with respect to their ability to associate with the downstream signaling molecule PI 3-kinase. Isolated rat adipose cells were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin, and aliquots of cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated by anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody. We did not detect coimmunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by either anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody when lysates were derived from cells that had not been treated with insulin (data not shown). In contrast, insulin stimulation resulted in PI 3-kinase association with both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Fig. 1). We detected approximately 50% more p85 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-1 as compared with IRS-2. To interpret these observations, we compared the efficiencies of both antibodies in immunoprecipitating their respective targets. Using immunoblotting, we quantitated the amount of IRS-1 or IRS-2 in the cell lysate before and after the immunoprecipitation (data not shown). We estimated that anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibodies immunoprecipitated approximately 75 and 90% of their respective antigens. After correcting for the relative efficiencies of immunoprecipitation, these data suggest that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 participate in mediating the ability of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase and that IRS-1 may account for approximately two thirds and IRS-2 approximately one-third of the effect of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase. Previously, we have demonstrated that overexpression of hIRS-1 can stimulate the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in rat adipose cells (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have used the same approach to inquire whether IRS-2 has similar biological activity. Therefore, we transfected adipose cells with expression vectors for either hIRS-1 or mIRS-2. Because previous studies demonstrated that hIRS-1 and mIRS-2 were located almost exclusively in total membrane fractions prepared from transfected rat adipose cells, 2L. Zhou and S. I. Taylor, unpublished observations. we used immunoblotting of total membrane fractions to quantitate the levels of expression of these two proteins in our experiments. Transfection of cells led to ≈3-fold increase in the total cellular content of IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively (Fig.2 A). (Note that it is not possible to directly compare the quantities of the two recombinant proteins (IRS-1 and IRS-2) since two different antibodies are used in the immunodetection.) Because only ≈5% of the electroporated cells are actually transfected under our experimental conditions (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), recombinant IRS-1 and IRS-2 were likely overexpressed by ≈40-fold in the sub-population of cells that were actually transfected. We then tested the ability of insulin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of overexpressed hIRS-1 and mIRS-2. In control cells (transfected with empty expression vector pCIS2), insulin increased the phosphotyrosine content of endogenous insulin receptor substrates. In groups of cells transfected with IRS-1 or IRS-2, we observed a 1.7- or 1.5-fold increase, respectively, in insulin-stimulated phosphotyrosine content in the IRS-1/2 band, consistent with the level of overexpression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Fig. 2 B). In this experiment, we did not resolve IRS-1 and IRS-2 as separate bands with different electrophoretic mobilities. We next examined the ability of IRS-2 to mediate insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in rat adipose cells. The effect of IRS-2 was also compared with that of IRS-1, which we used as a positive control. Rat adipose cells were co-transfected with GLUT4-HA together with either “empty” control expression vector (pCIS2) or expression vectors for hIRS-1 or mIRS-2. The use of epitope-tagged GLUT4 enabled us to monitor translocation selectively in the small fraction of transfected cells. When control cells were co-transfected with pCIS2 and GLUT4-HA, insulin treatment (60 nm) led to a 3-fold increase in the quantity of tagged GLUT4 located on the cell surface (Fig. 3). Half-maximal translocation of GLUT4-HA was elicited at an insulin concentration of ≈0.07 nm. Overexpression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 in adipose cells resulted in a doubling of the basal level of cell surface GLUT4 even in the absence of insulin (to 2.3- and 2.0-fold of basal levels, respectively). In fact, the effects of overexpression of IRS-1 or -2 in the absence of insulin were comparable with that seen in control cells stimulated with 0.07 nm insulin, the half-maximally effective concentration of insulin. Interestingly, at maximally effective concentrations of insulin (60 nm), the level of cell surface GLUT4 in cells overexpressing IRS-1 or IRS-2 significantly exceeded the maximal recruitment observed in the insulin-stimulated control cells (160 and 135% of control, respectively;p < 0.003). At an intermediate concentration of insulin (0.07 nm), IRS-1 and IRS-2 increased the quantity of GLUT4-HA on the cell surface by 90% and 60%, respectively. Thus, like IRS-1, IRS-2 has the ability to mediate the effect of insulin to recruit GLUT4 from intracellular membranes to the cell surface. Under all of our experimental conditions, IRS-1 appeared to have a larger effect than IRS-2 on translocation of GLUT4. However, it is not clear whether this apparent difference reflects a difference in the intrinsic biological activities of the two proteins or, alternatively, other factors such as the relative levels at which the two recombinant proteins were expressed. As a control experiment, we inquired whether overexpression of hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 altered the expression of recombinant GLUT4-HA directed by our expression vector. When total membrane fractions derived from transfected cells were immunoblotted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, we observed comparable levels of GLUT4-HA in cells co-transfected with pCIS2, hIRS-1, or mIRS-2 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the increase in GLUT4-HA detected at the surface of cells co-transfected with either hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 could not be explained by a change in the level of expression of GLUT4-HA. Rather, the effects of overexpressed IRS-1 and IRS-2 are most likely explained by their ability to stimulate translocation of GLUT4. The identification and cloning of IRS-1 represented a major advance in the understanding of the mechanism of insulin action (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Insulin binding to its receptor activates intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity resulting in phosphorylation of cellular substrates which, in turn, bind to downstream effector molecules containing SH2 domains. This leads to the activation of multiple downstream pathways, among which PI 3-kinase appears to be the most important for mediating metabolic actions of insulin (17Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When the IRS-1 gene was inactivated by gene targeting in mice, it was observed that the mice were insulin resistant but retained a partial ability to respond to insulin. Thus, there must be parallel pathways available to mediate the metabolic actions of insulin. The discovery of IRS-2, a protein with close homology to IRS-1, led to the suggestion that IRS-2 might provide one such parallel pathway. Although the overall amino acid sequence identity between IRS-1 and IRS-2 is 43%, these two molecules share domains of high homology (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The greatest sequence identity is found in the N-terminal portion of the molecules in the pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs identified in IRS-1 are well conserved in the IRS-2 molecule (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarities, several observations suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 might not be entirely interchangeable from a functional point of view. First, whereas IRS-2 appears to compensate for the absence of IRS-1 in liver, inactivation of the IRS-1 gene leads to insulin resistance in soleus muscle despite the presence of IRS-2 in that tissue (25Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Sonenberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Second, there are some differences in the sequences surrounding tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRS-1 and IRS-2 so that it is possible that they may interact with a different collection of SH2 domain-containing proteins. Indeed, it has been suggested that IRS-2 cannot substitute for IRS-1 in mediating the mitogenic actions of IGF-I (26Brüning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This may help to explain the growth retardation observed in mice deficient in IRS-1. Third, there are other structural differences between IRS-1 and IRS-2. For example, at least two laboratories (33He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,34Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have identified a domain in IRS-2 (but not in IRS-1) that participates in the binding interaction between IRS-2 and the insulin receptor. Finally, there are other candidate substrates that might be responsible for mediating parallel pathways of insulin action:e.g. IRS-3, a 60-kDa protein that has been shown to bind to PI 3-kinase in adipose cells (35Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, direct interaction of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor C terminus may provide an alternative pathway to activate PI 3-kinase that does not require IRS-1 (36Van Horn D.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Levy-Toledano R. Taouis M. Blaettler D.H. Gorden P. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have used a transient transfection system to study the role of IRS-2 in insulin-elicited translocation of GLUT4 in primary cell cultures (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since our adipose cell transfection system has only ∼5% efficiency in transfecting cells, it was not possible to directly assess the translocation of GLUT4 by measuring the cell surface levels of GLUT4. Instead, we used an epitope-tagged GLUT4 as a reporter for GLUT4 translocation to monitor GLUT4 translocation exclusively in the fraction of cells that are transfected. Since the total levels of GLUT4-HA expressed in the co-transfected cells are comparable for all groups of cells, changes in cell surface GLUT4-HA are presumably related to changes in the translocation process. In the co-transfection experiments, we used twice as much DNA for the IRS constructs as we did for GLUT4-HA to increase the likelihood that cells transfected with GLUT4-HA were also transfected with the vector of interest. If some fraction of cells were transfected only with GLUT4-HA, our results would underestimate the difference between control and experimental groups. According to previous studies (using an identical protocol) where we demonstrated nearly complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4-HA by co-expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant of PI 3-kinase, we believe that at least 95% of cells expressing GLUT4-HA also express the co-transfected second plasmid under our experimental conditions (19Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The levels of overexpression for hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 constructs in transfected adipose cells are similar to what have been observed with other recombinant genes in this system (7Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27920-27924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L.X. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J. Klinghoffer R. Kazlauskas A. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that overexpressed hIRS-1 and mIRS-2 were tyrosine phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation is comparable with levels of hIRS-1 and mIRS-2 overexpression. Overexpressing hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 increased insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 as compared with control cells. The effect of hIRS-1 on GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin stimulation is in good agreement with the results reported previously (7Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27920-27924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 caused an increase in the levels of cell surface GLUT4 even in the absence of insulin. It is likely that the insulin receptor exhibits a low level of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity even in the absence of a ligand that is capable of signaling recruitment of GLUT4 in adipose cells (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 presumably amplified this basal signal. The fact that overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B in fat cells decreases basal cell surface GLUT4 is also consistent with this idea (30Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to increasing signaling in the presence of insulin, it is possible that overexpression of hIRS-1 or mIRS-2 is amplifying the small signal generated by unoccupied insulin receptors. In the present study, we have obtained direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that IRS-2 can mediate insulin's ability to stimulate translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. When we overexpressed IRS-2 in rat adipose cells, we observed the recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. This observation demonstrates that IRS-2 possesses the intrinsic capacity to mediate this metabolic action of insulin. Nevertheless, to evaluate the physiologic significance of this observation, it is necessary to determine whether IRS-2 is capable of serving this function when expressed at physiological levels. The tissue distributions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins have been extensively studied by Sun et al. (38Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Differential expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 has been observed; for example, IRS-2 is predominant in hematopoietic cells, while IRS-1 is absent from several lymphoid cell lines and cells of the myeloid lineage. Nevertheless, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. Comparable amounts of IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been detected in liver, muscle, and adipocytes. This indicates that they may be essential for maintaining cell growth and metabolic regulation. As has been proposed for IRS-1, it is likely that the ability of IRS-2 to associate with and activate PI 3-kinase may provide a mechanism for it to mediate insulin-stimulated recruitment of GLUT4 in adipose cells. To determine whether there is sufficient IRS-2 to contribute to insulin action in rat adipose cells, we have investigated the function of IRS-2 in freshly prepared rat adipose cells. Insulin stimulated the association of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. While more molecules of PI 3-kinase were associated with IRS-1, IRS-2 bound approximately half the quantity of PI 3-kinase that was bound to IRS-1. There are at least two possible explanations for our observation that endogenous IRS-1 binds more PI 3-kinase than does endogenous IRS-2. First, it is possible that there is simply more IRS-1 than IRS-2 in the relevant intracellular compartment. Second, IRS-1 might be intrinsically more efficient than IRS-2 at activating PI 3-kinase. If one assumes that the recombinant molecules (hIRS-1 and mIRS-2) are expressed at equal levels in the transfected cells, our observation that hIRS-1 has a larger effect upon translocation of GLUT4-HA is consistent with the hypothesis that IRS-1 may be intrinsically more active in mediating this metabolic action of insulin. Interestingly, in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were barely detectable by immunoblotting before differentiation. However, after differentiation the amount of IRS-1 increased dramatically, while IRS-2 was barely detected (38Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, 3T3-L1 adipocytes appear to be an imperfect model for fat cells in that, unlike freshly prepared adipocytes, they do not express significant quantities of IRS-2. In conclusion, we have used a physiologically relevant target cell for insulin action to directly demonstrate that overexpression of IRS-2 is sufficient to recruit GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the surface of adipose cells. This suggests that IRS-2, together with IRS-1, participates in insulin signal transduction pathways related to the metabolic actions of insulin. Furthermore, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that IRS-2 can partially compensate for deficiency of IRS-1 in mediating the activation of PI 3-kinase (26Brüning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2067597530,"Characterization of the phosphohydrolytic activities of recombinant reovirus λ1 protein demonstrates that, in addition to the previously reported nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase and helicase activities, the protein also possesses RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity. This activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of a divalent cation, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and specifically removes the 5′-γ-phosphate at the end of triphosphate-terminated RNAs. Kinetic competition analysis showed that nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase reactions are carried out at a common active site. These results strongly support the idea that, in addition to its role as an RNA helicase during transcription of the viral genome, λ1 also participates during formation of the cap structure at the 5′ end of newly synthesized reovirus mRNAs. The λ1 protein represents only the third RNA triphosphatase whose primary structure is known and the first described in a double-stranded RNA virus.

The λ1 protein represents only the third RNA triphosphatase whose primary structure is known and the first described in a double-stranded RNA virus. The genome of mammalian reoviruses is made of 10 double-stranded RNA segments and is enclosed in a capsid made of two concentric layers of viral proteins (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 691-730Google Scholar). Considering their genome structure and because reoviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, they must encode their own transcriptional and replicative enzymes. Reovirus cores contain enzymes that modify the 5′ end of newly synthesized mRNAs by adding a cap structure similar to the one found on cellular mRNAs (m7GpppGmpC) (2Faust M. Hastings K.E.M.

This cap structure includes the 5′-terminal guanosine present on all reovirus mRNAs (2Faust M. Hastings K.E.M. Millward S.

The formation of the 5′ cap structure on reovirus mRNAs proceeds via a well characterized mechanism schematized as shown in 1-4 (where SAM isS-adenosyl-l-methionine and SAH isS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine). pppG+pppC→pppGpC+PPi(RNA polymerase,λ3)pppGpC→ppGpC+Pi(RNA triphosphatase,?)pppG+ppGpC↔GpppGpC+PPi(guanylyltransferase,λ2)GpppGpC+SAM→m7GpppGpC+SAH(methyltransferase,λ2?)REACTIONS 1–4Following the start of transcription, an RNA triphosphatase (polynucleotide phosphohydrolase) removes the 5′ end γ-phosphate of the nascent RNA molecule, generating a 5′-diphosphate end. Guanylyltransferase then donates a GMP moiety derived from GTP to form a 5′-5′-triphosphate linkage typical of cap structure. The cytidine residue, present on all reovirus mRNAs, can also undergo 2′-O-methylation by a cytoplasmic methyltransferase (6Langberg S.R. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10054-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies indicate that the minor core protein λ3 contains the catalytic site of the reovirus RNA polymerase, whereas the λ2 protein has been defined as the reovirus guanylyltransferase (7Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Cleveland D.R. Zarbl H. Millward S. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 307-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical evidences are lacking for the protein acting as methyltransferase to produce the methylated 5′ cap structure (m7GpppGpC), although a role has been suggested for the reovirus λ2 protein (9Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the nature of the core protein involved in the RNA triphosphatase activity has remained unknown. The λ2 and λ3 proteins were shown to interact with λ1 of the reovirus core (7Starnes M.C.

Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an activity postulated to be involved in the RNA triphosphatase reaction (17Kapuler A.M. Mendelsohn N. Klett H. Acs G. Nature. 1970; 225: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Banerjee A.K. Ward R. Shatkin A.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 230: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This idea is still controversial (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no direct evidence was available to support or rule out the hypothesis.In this report, recombinant λ1 produced in yeast cells and previously used to demonstrate NTPase/helicase activity (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was examined for RNA triphosphatase activity. Results obtained indicate that the reovirus λ1 protein does possess the ability to remove exclusively the 5′-γ-phosphate at the end of a triphosphorylated mRNA molecule. This finding strongly supports the idea that λ1 participates as an RNA triphosphatase during formation of the cap structure on newly synthesized reovirus mRNAs. Competitive inhibition analysis also demonstrated that the RNA triphosphatase and NTPase activities are carried out at a common active site of the λ1 protein. The λ1 protein represents only the third RNA triphosphatase whose primary structure is known and the first RNA triphosphatase, which is described in a double-stranded RNA virus.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that a NTPase activity is present in reovirus cores, and recent reports have established that the λ1 protein is associated with this activity (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol.

It has been postulated that the NTPase activity can also be responsible for the RNA triphosphatase reaction (18Banerjee A.K. Ward R. Shatkin A.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 230: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of our recent analysis of yeast-expressed λ1 NTPase/helicase activity to definitely demonstrate that λ1 can hydrolyze the β-γ bond at the 5′ terminus of triphosphorylated RNA molecules. Kinetic analysis of these two phosphohydrolytic activities, NTPase and RNA triphosphatase, showed marked differences. The two activities differ in the MgCl2 concentration at which maximal catalysis is achieved; the ATPase reaction reached a maximal catalysis at 2.5 mmMgCl2 (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity is maximal at 0.2 mm MgCl2. This situation is similar to the vaccinia virus capping enzyme, a protein that hydrolyzes the γ-phosphate of triphosphate-terminated RNAs and can also cleave the γ-phosphate out of free nucleoside triphosphates; with vaccinia enzyme, the ATPase activity also requires a 10-fold higher concentration of MgCl2 compared with the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity (20 mm versus 2 mm) to reach maximal catalysis (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The NTPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities of λ1 also exhibit important binding differences for their respective substrates. ApparentK m values of 1 μm and 2 μm were respectively determined for the ATPase and GTPase reactions (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) compared with 0.26 μm measured for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity reported in this study. RNA 5′-triphosphatases have been isolated from a variety of cellular and viral sources, but few detailed biochemical studies have been performed. However, the reported K m value of 0.26 μm for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity of λ1 is in the same range as the K m of other characterized RNA 5′-triphosphatases from vaccinia virus (1 μm),Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.4 μm), and rat liver nuclei (0.15 μm) (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13923-13929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yagi Y. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Gene reassortment analysis and biochemical studies of a recombinant λ1 protein have both demonstrated that λ1 exhibits a preference for ATP, whereas the 5′-terminal nucleotide in each of the reovirus mRNAs is a guanosine (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was therefore intriguing that a putative RNA triphosphatase would exhibit a preference for ATP and not GTP found as reovirus mRNA 5′-terminal residue. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that λ1 exhibits an approximately 4-fold lower K m for GTP-terminated RNAs (0.26 μm) compared with the K m for ATP (1 μm). Thus, the λ1 protein has a greater affinity for GTP-terminated RNAs than for any other free nucleotides. Interaction of λ1 with nucleic acids can occur in the absence of a triphosphorylated end (12Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and it is thus quite possible that additional interactions with the rest of the nucleic acid molecule stabilize the triphosphorylated RNA-enzyme complex.The ability of the λ1 protein to hydrolyze NTPs and triphosphate-terminated RNAs raised the question of whether these reactions are carried out at a common or independent phosphohydrolysis active site. Based on kinetic competition analysis, it clearly appeared that the two reactions are carried out at a common active site. Similarly, competitive inhibition and simultaneous mutational inactivation of RNA triphosphatase and NTPase functions of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme have also suggested that both reactions occur at a single active site (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an RNA triphosphatase activity has also been assigned to the NS3 protein of the West Nile flavivirus, a protein that possesses NTPase activity (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this case, differences in optimal reaction conditions for NTPase and 5′-RNA triphosphatase activities have been presented as an indication that hydrolysis occurs at different sites, although no kinetic competition analyses have been performed to support this idea (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When additional examples of RNA triphosphatases are identified, it will become possible to determine if the ability to remove the γ-phosphate from both free NTPs and triphosphorylated RNAs can be considered as a common property exhibited by these enzymes.The λ1 protein is a major component of the viral core and appears as a multifunctional protein; in addition to 5′-RNA triphosphatase activity, it possesses NTPase and helicase activities (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Other viral RNA 5′-triphosphatases can also catalyze additional enzymatic reactions. The D1 subunit of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme has both RNA 5′-triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9690-9695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shuman S. Morham S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11967-11972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The West Nile Virus NS3 protein is also a multifunctional protein; it contains a protease activity in its amino-terminal part, a helicase in the central region, and the RNA triphosphatase tentatively assigned to the carboxyl-terminal domain (23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol.

Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although very few primary structures of RNA 5′-triphosphatases are actually known, it has been noted that the LRIR amino acid sequence found in the reovirus λ1 protein (30Bartlett J.A. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1988; 167: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is similar to the West Nile Virus NS3 protein (LRPR) (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and vaccinia virus D1 subunit sequence LKPR (23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the only two other RNA triphosphatases whose primary structure is known. Because no actual structure-function studies have been performed, the importance of this motif remains purely speculative. Furthermore, another somewhat degenerate motif also seems to be present on the reovirus λ1 protein (RDETGLM), vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1 subunit (RPNTSLE), and West Nile virus NS3 (RTNTILE). These motifs are also found on various putative 5′-RNA triphosphatases of other flaviviruses and DNA viruses. Interestingly, a substitution of the glutamate residue in this latter motif of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme inactivated the triphosphatase but did not affect the guanylyltransferase activity (23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that these consensus motifs may have a functional significance, although further studies will be needed to firmly establish their exact nature and importance. The genome of mammalian reoviruses is made of 10 double-stranded RNA segments and is enclosed in a capsid made of two concentric layers of viral proteins (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 691-730Google Scholar). Considering their genome structure and because reoviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, they must encode their own transcriptional and replicative enzymes. Reovirus cores contain enzymes that modify the 5′ end of newly synthesized mRNAs by adding a cap structure similar to the one found on cellular mRNAs (m7GpppGmpC) (2Faust M. Hastings K.E.M. Millward S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 197: 1329-1343Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Furuichi Y. Morgan M. Muthukrishnan S. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); capping increases the stability and translation efficiency of reovirus mRNAs (4Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1977; 266: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 5Muthukrishnan S. Both C.W. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1975; 255: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This cap structure includes the 5′-terminal guanosine present on all reovirus mRNAs (2Faust M. Hastings K.E.M. Millward S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 197: 1329-1343Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Furuichi Y. Morgan M. Muthukrishnan S. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The formation of the 5′ cap structure on reovirus mRNAs proceeds via a well characterized mechanism schematized as shown in 1-4 (where SAM isS-adenosyl-l-methionine and SAH isS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine). pppG+pppC→pppGpC+PPi(RNA polymerase,λ3)pppGpC→ppGpC+Pi(RNA triphosphatase,?)pppG+ppGpC↔GpppGpC+PPi(guanylyltransferase,λ2)GpppGpC+SAM→m7GpppGpC+SAH(methyltransferase,λ2?)REACTIONS 1–4Following the start of transcription, an RNA triphosphatase (polynucleotide phosphohydrolase) removes the 5′ end γ-phosphate of the nascent RNA molecule, generating a 5′-diphosphate end. Guanylyltransferase then donates a GMP moiety derived from GTP to form a 5′-5′-triphosphate linkage typical of cap structure. The cytidine residue, present on all reovirus mRNAs, can also undergo 2′-O-methylation by a cytoplasmic methyltransferase (6Langberg S.R. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10054-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the minor core protein λ3 contains the catalytic site of the reovirus RNA polymerase, whereas the λ2 protein has been defined as the reovirus guanylyltransferase (7Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Cleveland D.R. Zarbl H. Millward S. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 307-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical evidences are lacking for the protein acting as methyltransferase to produce the methylated 5′ cap structure (m7GpppGpC), although a role has been suggested for the reovirus λ2 protein (9Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the nature of the core protein involved in the RNA triphosphatase activity has remained unknown. The λ2 and λ3 proteins were shown to interact with λ1 of the reovirus core (7Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Xu P. Miller S.E. Joklik W.K.

Virol. 1994; 145: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a protein that exhibits an affinity for nucleic acids (12Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This λ1 protein was recently shown to be responsible for the nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase (NTPase) 1The abbreviation used is: NTPase, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase. 1The abbreviation used is: NTPase, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase. activity present in reovirus cores (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 3341-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an activity postulated to be involved in the RNA triphosphatase reaction (17Kapuler A.M. Mendelsohn N. Klett H. Acs G. Nature. 1970; 225: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Banerjee A.K. Ward R. Shatkin A.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 230: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This idea is still controversial (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no direct evidence was available to support or rule out the hypothesis. In this report, recombinant λ1 produced in yeast cells and previously used to demonstrate NTPase/helicase activity (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was examined for RNA triphosphatase activity. Results obtained indicate that the reovirus λ1 protein does possess the ability to remove exclusively the 5′-γ-phosphate at the end of a triphosphorylated mRNA molecule. This finding strongly supports the idea that λ1 participates as an RNA triphosphatase during formation of the cap structure on newly synthesized reovirus mRNAs. Competitive inhibition analysis also demonstrated that the RNA triphosphatase and NTPase activities are carried out at a common active site of the λ1 protein. The λ1 protein represents only the third RNA triphosphatase whose primary structure is known and the first RNA triphosphatase, which is described in a double-stranded RNA virus. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that a NTPase activity is present in reovirus cores, and recent reports have established that the λ1 protein is associated with this activity (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kapuler A.M. Mendelsohn N. Klett H. Acs G. Nature. 1970; 225: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the NTPase activity can also be responsible for the RNA triphosphatase reaction (18Banerjee A.K. Ward R. Shatkin A.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 230: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of our recent analysis of yeast-expressed λ1 NTPase/helicase activity to definitely demonstrate that λ1 can hydrolyze the β-γ bond at the 5′ terminus of triphosphorylated RNA molecules. Kinetic analysis of these two phosphohydrolytic activities, NTPase and RNA triphosphatase, showed marked differences. The two activities differ in the MgCl2 concentration at which maximal catalysis is achieved; the ATPase reaction reached a maximal catalysis at 2.5 mmMgCl2 (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity is maximal at 0.2 mm MgCl2. This situation is similar to the vaccinia virus capping enzyme, a protein that hydrolyzes the γ-phosphate of triphosphate-terminated RNAs and can also cleave the γ-phosphate out of free nucleoside triphosphates; with vaccinia enzyme, the ATPase activity also requires a 10-fold higher concentration of MgCl2 compared with the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity (20 mm versus 2 mm) to reach maximal catalysis (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The NTPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities of λ1 also exhibit important binding differences for their respective substrates. ApparentK m values of 1 μm and 2 μm were respectively determined for the ATPase and GTPase reactions (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) compared with 0.26 μm measured for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity reported in this study. RNA 5′-triphosphatases have been isolated from a variety of cellular and viral sources, but few detailed biochemical studies have been performed. However, the reported K m value of 0.26 μm for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity of λ1 is in the same range as the K m of other characterized RNA 5′-triphosphatases from vaccinia virus (1 μm),Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.4 μm), and rat liver nuclei (0.15 μm) (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1983; 2: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Gene reassortment analysis and biochemical studies of a recombinant λ1 protein have both demonstrated that λ1 exhibits a preference for ATP, whereas the 5′-terminal nucleotide in each of the reovirus mRNAs is a guanosine (13Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was therefore intriguing that a putative RNA triphosphatase would exhibit a preference for ATP and not GTP found as reovirus mRNA 5′-terminal residue. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that λ1 exhibits an approximately 4-fold lower K m for GTP-terminated RNAs (0.26 μm) compared with the K m for ATP (1 μm). Thus, the λ1 protein has a greater affinity for GTP-terminated RNAs than for any other free nucleotides. Interaction of λ1 with nucleic acids can occur in the absence of a triphosphorylated end (12Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and it is thus quite possible that additional interactions with the rest of the nucleic acid molecule stabilize the triphosphorylated RNA-enzyme complex.The ability of the λ1 protein to hydrolyze NTPs and triphosphate-terminated RNAs raised the question of whether these reactions are carried out at a common or independent phosphohydrolysis active site. Based on kinetic competition analysis, it clearly appeared that the two reactions are carried out at a common active site. Similarly, competitive inhibition and simultaneous mutational inactivation of RNA triphosphatase and NTPase functions of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme have also suggested that both reactions occur at a single active site (20Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an RNA triphosphatase activity has also been assigned to the NS3 protein of the West Nile flavivirus, a protein that possesses NTPase activity (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this case, differences in optimal reaction conditions for NTPase and 5′-RNA triphosphatase activities have been presented as an indication that hydrolysis occurs at different sites, although no kinetic competition analyses have been performed to support this idea (24Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When additional examples of RNA triphosphatases are identified, it will become possible to determine if the ability to remove the γ-phosphate from both free NTPs and triphosphorylated RNAs can be considered as a common property exhibited by these enzymes.The λ1 protein is a major component of the viral core and appears as a multifunctional protein; in addition to 5′-RNA triphosphatase activity, it possesses NTPase and helicase activities (14Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Other viral RNA 5′-triphosphatases can also catalyze additional enzymatic reactions.

Although very few primary structures of RNA 5′-triphosphatases are actually known, it has been noted that the LRIR amino acid sequence found in the reovirus λ1 protein (30Bartlett J.A. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1988; 167: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is similar to the West Nile Virus NS3 protein (LRPR) (24Wengler G. Wengler G.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the only two other RNA triphosphatases whose primary structure is known. Because no actual structure-function studies have been performed, the importance of this motif remains purely speculative. Furthermore, another somewhat degenerate motif also seems to be present on the reovirus λ1 protein (RDETGLM), vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1 subunit (RPNTSLE), and West Nile virus NS3 (RTNTILE). These motifs are also found on various putative 5′-RNA triphosphatases of other flaviviruses and DNA viruses. Interestingly, a substitution of the glutamate residue in this latter motif of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme inactivated the triphosphatase but did not affect the guanylyltransferase activity (23Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that these consensus motifs may have a functional significance, although further studies will be needed to firmly establish their exact nature and importance.

https://openalex.org/W2133363318,"Hydrogen ions reduce ion flux through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by binding to a single protonation site with an unusually high pK a . Recent evidence localizes the protonation site to the same locus that supports high affinity Ca2+ binding and selectivity, a set of four conserved glutamate residues near the external mouth of the pore. Remaining controversy concerns the question of whether the protonation site arises from a single glutamate, Glu-1086 (EIII), or a combination of Glu-1086 and Glu-334 (EI) working in concert. We tested these hypotheses with individual Glu → Asp substitutions. The Glu → Asp replacements in repeats Iand III stood out in two ways. First, in both EID and EIIID, protonation was destabilized relative to wild type, whereas it was unchanged in EIID and stabilized in EIVD. The changes in affinity were entirely due to alterations in H+ off-rate. Second, the ratio of protonated conductance to deprotonated conductance was significantly closer to unity for EID and EIIID than for wild-type channels or other Asp mutants. Both results support the idea that EI and EIII act together to stabilize a single titratable H+ ion and behave nearly symmetrically in influencing pore conductance. Neutralization of EIII by alanine replacement clearly failed to abolish susceptibility to protonation, indicating that no single glutamate was absolutely required. Taken together, all the evidence supports a model in which multiple carboxylates work in concert to form a single high affinity protonation site.

The pore of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is capable of high affinity interactions with either calcium or hydrogen ions (1Hess P. Tsien R.W.

Under such experimental conditions, half-maximal block by H+ occurs at pH∼ 8.5, three to four pH units greater than the pK a of an individual glutamate carboxylate (3Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P.

All evidence supports the idea that block by protons occurs at the same locus where selectivity for Ca2+ takes place, where carboxylic acid side chains of a set of conserved glutamate residues come into close proximity (8Chen X.-H.

Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) proposed that the protonation site consisted of only a single glutamate, Glu-1086, in repeatIII (here designated simply as EIII). This conclusion was based on a series of glutamate to alanine replacements in which only EIIIA appeared to abolish the ability of protons to cause flickering block of unitary flux. In contrast, Chenet al. (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggested that the protonation site arises from multiple glutamate side chains, acting in concert (Fig.1 A). In one particular version of this hypothesis, carboxylate groups from EI and EIII were proposed to share the titratable H+, in a stable hydrogen-bonding configuration (Fig. 1 B). Although more complex than that of Klöckner et al.(10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this model readily accounts for the existence of only a single binding site for H+, not one for each Glu or Glu pair. It also provides an explanation for the finding of half-block at pH >8, in line with the well documented properties of carboxylic acid-carboxylate complexes (15Sawyer L. James M.N.G. Nature. 1982; 295: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Honig B. Gunner M.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2469-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), not at pH <5, characteristic for a single carboxylate. Aspartate substitutions for glutamate offered a useful approach for testing these conflicting models (e.g. Refs. 17Carrasco N. Puttner I.B. Antes L.M. Lee J.A. Larigan J.D. Lolkema J.S. Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 18Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10166-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unlike Glu → Gln replacements, which alter side chain charge, or Glu → Ala mutations, which change both charge and side chain bulk, Glu → Asp substitutions preserve the acidity of the relevant groups while merely decreasing side chain length. Thus, aspartate substitutions would be expected to perturb the protonation of the channel in relatively subtle yet informative ways. Indeed, we found that each of the four aspartate mutants displayed a unique phenotype distinct from the wild-type channel and that their behavior in all cases conformed closely to the predictions of the model in Fig. 1. Therefore, this study provides new evidence for the coordinated interaction of multiple glutamates in forming the protonation site of L-type Ca2+channels. The cDNAs for rabbit α1C and α2-δ subunits of L-type Ca2+ channels were kindly provided by Dr. T. Tanabe (University of Tokyo), and the cDNA for rabbit β2b subunit was a gift from Drs. V. Flockerzi and F. Hofmann (Technische Universität, München, Germany).

Wild-type and mutant L-type channels were expressed in the subunit combination α1Cβ2bα2 inXenopus oocytes, as described previously (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Expression of the L-type Ca2+ channels was confirmed by the appearance of FPL64176-sensitive Ba2+ current in whole oocyte recordings using the two-electrode voltage clamp. The single glutamate to aspartate mutations in the P-region of L-type Ca2+ channels were generated as described previously (12Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In all mutant channels, the 5′-untranslated region of α1CcDNA was truncated to increase the expression level (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Unitary currents carried by WT and mutant L-type channels were recorded as described previously (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,20Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.-F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were performed on stripped oocytes bathed in 100 mm K+ solution (in mm, 100 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 11 MgCl2, pH 7.2 with KOH). All the recordings were performed with high KCl solution (in mm, 150 KCl, 5 EDTA, 5 HEPES) prepared in2H2O. Under these conditions, the average time in the protonated state was 2–3-fold longer than that measured in K+-H2O and >5-fold longer than that found with Na+-H2O (2Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Chen X.-H.

The choice of recording conditions proved essential for resolving the rapid kinetics of the protonation events in some mutant channels (e.g.EIIIA), in which the mean dwell time in the protonated state was reduced more than 5-fold compared with WT channels. In all experiments, the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist FPL 64176 (5 μm) was included in both pipette and bath solutions to prolong channel openings. The unitary currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 5 kHz, and sampled at 25 kHz. Membrane potential was held at −100 mV and stepped to various test voltages ranging from −40 to −120 mV. In some experiments, a brief prepulse to a strongly positive voltage was applied prior to the test pulse to facilitate channel opening. Single channel records were leak subtracted off-line. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (21–23 °C). Single channel traces were analyzed as described previously (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, long channel openings from multiple sweeps were manually selected and pooled together for generation of the open-state all-points amplitude histograms (bin size 0.2 pA). The resulting peaks on the histogram were fitted with Gaussian functions. For kinetic analysis, current records were idealized using a two-point crossing criterion with the threshold set halfway between hand l conductance levels. Dwell time distributions of deprotonated (h) and protonated (l) states were generated based on idealized records and fit with a single exponential. Corrected time constants for the conductance states were calculated from the mean dwell times using a method to correct for missed events and instrumental dead-time (80 μs) (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 397-482Google Scholar). We carried out a systematic analysis of the effects of Glu → Asp substitutions on each of the four P-region glutamates as a critical test of the hypothesis that the protonation site in L-type Ca2+ channels is formed by multiple P-region glutamates working in concert. This approach capitalizes on the ability of single channel recordings to resolve even modest changes in on- or off-rates for protonation or in the conductance of protonated and deprotonated conductance states. Fig. 2 compares the interaction of H+ ions with wild-type Ca2+channels (Fig. 2 A) and channels where an aspartate is substituted for the conserved glutamate in repeat I(EID) (Fig. 2 B). For openings of single wild-type channels, individual protonation/deprotonation events were detected as abrupt changes in the unitary current signal between a high conductance level corresponding to the deprotonated channel (γh = 132 ± 10 pS, n = 6) and a low conductance level representing the protonated channel (γl = 47 ± 4 pS, n = 6). These conductance levels appeared as two distinct peaks in the accompanying open-state all-points histogram (Fig. 2 A, right panel). The peaks were roughly the same size with K+-2H2O recording solution at pH 8.5, indicating that the open channel divided its time nearly equally between being deprotonated and protonated. The balance was shifted toward the high conductance state (∼85%) at pH 9.75 and away from the high conductance state (17%) at pH 7.5, as expected for a protonation reaction with pK a ∼8.5 (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The behavior of the EID mutant differed from WT in several respects (Fig. 2 B). Although transitions between high and low conductance states were retained, both levels of unitary current were increased relative to their WT values, as illustrated in the all-points histograms (Fig. 2 B, right panel) and in analysis of the unitary current-voltage relationships. Over the range between −50 to −120 mV, the slope conductance of the protonated state (γl) was significantly increased in the EID mutant relative to WT (94 ± 10 pS, n = 4versus 46 ± 9 pS, n = 6,p < 0.001). As for the deprotonated state (γh), unitary currents were consistently greater in EID than in control over the same voltage range. The slope conductances also may have increased slightly relative to WT, although not in a statistically significant way (150 ± 5.3 pS,n = 3 in EID versus 132 ± 10 pS, n = 6 in WT, p > 0.05). In addition to the increase in single channel current levels, the EID mutation also altered the balance between protonated and deprotonated states (Fig. 2 B, right). In the case of the mutant channels, the proportion of time spent in the protonated state was only 31 ± 1.5% (n = 3) at pH 8.5, significantly less than the ∼50% observed in WT channels (49.5 ± 3%, n = 6, p < 0.001). This change in the EID mutant corresponded to a ∼2-fold reduction in the affinity of H+ ions for the protonation site relative to WT. The decrease of pK a in the EID mutant was due primarily to acceleration of the off-rate for protons, as revealed by kinetic analysis of single channel records (Fig.2 D). The time constant for the protonated state was reduced significantly, from 0.50 ± 0.001 ms in WT to 0.23 ± 0.001 in EID (p < 0.001). On the other hand, the time constant for the deprotonated state remained unchanged in EID compared with WT (τ h = 0.42 ± 0.03 ms in EID versus 0.48 ± 0.005 ms in WT,p > 0.05, unpaired t test). The present data establish that protonation can be destabilized without altering the charge of the side chain, merely by shortening it by a methylene group (∼1.4 Å), in strong support of the importance of EIin the formation of the native protonation site. Since the Glu → Gln mutants in both repeats I andIII displayed a very similar phenotype (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it was of great interest to compare the behavior of EID to that of the Glu → Asp mutation in repeat III (EIIID) (Fig.3). In EIIID, bothh and l current levels were increased relative to control. Once again, the slope conductance of the low conductance state (γ l = 95 ± 2.1 pS, n = 3) was more than double the WT value, whereas the high conductance of EIIID (γ h = 161 ± 4.5 pS, n = 3) was only slightly increased if at all relative to WT (p > 0.05). The percent blockade at pH 8.5 was 33 ± 2.7% (n = 5), corresponding to a 2-fold reduction in proton affinity relative to WT. The altered pK a was due to an accelerated rate of deprotonation (k off, Fig.3 D, right). In all respects, the properties of the EIIID mutant were very much like those of EID, suggesting that the side chains at these positions play similar roles in the formation of the protonation site. The Glu to Asp substitution in repeat II generated more modest changes in channel behavior. On the one hand, γ l for EIID was 86 ± 3.2 (n = 5), approximately twice the WT value, much the same as in EID and EIIID. In addition, γ h was 196 ± 6 (n = 5), a significant increase compared with WT (p < 0.05, unpaired t test). On the other hand, EIID did not differ from WT in either the degree of proton block or in the kinetics of protonation and deprotonation. The proportion of channels in the l-state (49.5% ± 0.7,n = 5, pH 8.5) (Fig.4 B) was close to that found in WT, and the histograms of unblocked or blocked times (Fig.4 D) coincided perfectly with WT distributions. Evidently, shortening the side chain length of EII does not perturb the proton binding affinity, even though it can certainly influence the flux rates through high and low conductance states. Replacement of the pore glutamate in repeat IV also produced changes in single channel behavior, some significantly different from the other Glu to Asp substitutions (Fig.5). In EIVD, the slope conductances of protonated and deprotonated states were both increased compared with the wild-type channel. Estimates of the slope conductances γ l (74 ± 7.3 pS, n = 4) and γ h (174 ± 16 pS, n = 4) were ∼60 and ∼30% greater than WT values, respectively (p < 0.05 for both). More unusual was the finding that the EIVD mutation increased the proton affinity rather than weakening it. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, the percentage of time spent in the protonated state at pH 8.5 was 61 ± 1.5%, corresponding to approximately 50% increase in affinity relative to WT. The increased proton affinity was well accounted for by prolongation of the intervals in the protonated state (Fig. 5 D, right). The time constants for τ l in EIVD was 0.75 ± 0.01 ms (n = 7), an increase of 50% above WT (0.5 ± 0.001 ms, p < 0.001). In contrast, τ h was 0.51 ± 0.005 ms (n = 7), no different than WT (0.48 ± 0.005 ms, p > 0.46). Our observations with the Glu to Asp mutations support the idea that both EI and EIII act in concert to form a single proton binding site. This conclusion seems at odds with Klöckneret al. (10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), who reported that replacement of EIII with alanine completely abolished susceptibility to proton block and concluded that EIII was the sole determinant of the proton binding site. Accordingly, we re-examined the behavior of the EIIIA mutant, using2H+ instead of H+ as blocking ion to slow deprotonation rates and improve resolution of current transitions (Fig. 6). At pH 8.5, EIIIA displayed flickery transitions between two conductances (Fig. 6 A, left), a predominant hlevel and less frequent l level. The transitions were seen more clearly on an expanded time scale (lower left trace, Fig. 6 A). Increasing the external proton concentration to pH 7.5 shifted the balance toward the lower conductance but left theh and l current levels unchanged. More quantitative analysis with all-points histograms indicated that occupancy of the protonated state was ∼20% at pH 8.5 and ∼50% at pH 7.5. These results are perfectly consistent with a conventional protonation reaction with the low conductance level corresponding to the protonated state. The pK a of the reaction was ∼7.5, about 1 log unit more acidic than that of WT channels under the same experimental conditions. Thus, the behavior of EIIIA is actually quite similar to that of EIA (pK a 7.4 in K+-H2O (10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), corresponding to an expected value of 7.8 in K+-2H2O). In both cases, the Glu → Ala mutation spares the susceptibility to protonation while reducing the H+ affinity by 5–10-fold relative to WT. The conductance of the protonated state of the EIIIA mutant was 112 ± 10 pS, a ∼2.5-fold increase relative to native α1C channels, whereas the conductance of the deprotonated state (∼150 pS) was little changed relative to WT. This sharply narrowed the difference between h and lconductances and may have contributed to the initial difficulties in detecting proton block in EIIIA. Transitions were more readily identified in our experiments because the transitions were slowed by use of 2H2O rather than H2O, and the recordings from the EIIIA mutant were performed at a more negative potential (−70 mV rather than −40 mV) to increase driving force and unitary current size. The previously published records for EIIIA (10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) display a significant degree of flickering in the open channel current, hinting at the existence of transitions between a predominant h level and a less prevalent l level, as is evident in our recordings (Fig. 6). We have carried out critical tests of two different models of the protonation site within the pore of L-type Ca2+ channels. One model identified EIII (Glu-1086) as the unique proton acceptor site, solely responsible for the appearance of the low conductance state (10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has become untenable since it is now clear that replacement of this residue by alanine actually spares responsiveness to H+ block (Fig. 6). When our results are considered along with previous evidence (10Klöckner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is evident that each of the four Glu → Ala substitutions shares the ability to destabilize the titratable proton. Estimated shifts in the pK a of the Glu → Ala mutants relative to wild-type ranged from ∼0.9 to ∼0.3 pH units, in the order EIII > EII ≈ EI > EIV. The differences between the various Glu → Ala constructs are subtle enough to make it difficult to decipher the roles of the individual glutamates on the basis of these mutants alone. The glutamate to aspartate mutations provided new perspectives on the protonation site. They are particularly useful in providing relatively subtle changes in the positions of key side chains without altering their net charge. Thus, Glu → Asp replacements provide information complementary to that derived from glutamine substitutions, which alter net charge with little change in geometry, thereby highlighting the importance of electrostatic effects on permeation (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We used the aspartate mutants to test another model in which EI and EIII jointly coordinate the titratable H+ ion (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Shortening an amino acid side chain by a single methylene group (∼1.4 Å), while maintaining its carboxylic acid terminus, must be regarded as a relatively mild structural alteration. Yet, each of the Glu → Asp replacements was sufficient to cause a significant alteration in channel behavior. These effects took the form of changes in the balance between protonated and deprotonated states in some cases and changes in their conductance levels in all cases. Fig.7 summarizes equilibrium and kinetic data for the protonation reaction, studied at pH 8.5. Of all the Glu → Ala constructs, only EID and EIIID displayed a significant reduction in the degree of H+ inhibition, indicating a weakening of proton affinity (Fig. 7 A). This supports the hypothesis that EI and EIII play essential roles in formation of the protonation site (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The alteration in proton affinity is entirely accounted for by a doubling of the off-rate (Fig. 7 B), with no detectable change in on-rate (Fig. 7 C). The constancy ofk on is not surprising since this rate is thought to be dominated by bulk aqueous diffusion of H+ and its interaction with the negative charge of the protonation site (23Kuo C.C. Hess P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 657-682Google Scholar), neither of which are expected to change with the Glu → Asp mutation. The speeding of k off also makes good sense in terms of a protonation site formed by oxygen atoms of opposing carboxylate groups. Shortening either side chain would sharply restrict the set of configurations consistent with retention of the H+, thereby hastening deprotonation. Along these lines, one would expect that protonation would be further destabilized in the construct EID-EIIID. This in fact was observed. The protonated state in the double mutant became even briefer than in EID or EIIID, to the point where dwell times were not completely resolved (data not shown). In contrast to the very similar behavior of EID and EIIID, aspartate replacements in repeats II andIV each produced a different effect. EIID displayed the same degree of proton block as WT (Fig. 7 A), with no changes in either k on ork off (Fig. 7, B and C). This seems compatible with the previous hypothesis, which proposed that EII has no direct interaction with the titratable H+, only an indirect effect through hydrogen bonding with EI and EIII. Since the Glu → Asp replacement caused no alteration of side chain charge, it is not surprising that it gave a very different effect from the Glu → Gln mutation at the same position, which resulted in a ∼10-fold reduction in proton affinity. One might have expected that shortening the carboxylate side chain in domain II would cause some change in pK a , merely through disturbance of the positioning of EI and EIII. On the other hand, it is possible that a slight tilting of EI and EIII would be sufficient to accommodate the Glu → Asp substitution or that other compensatory rearrangements take place, leaving the configuration of the proton binding site essentially unaltered. Unlike the other three constructs, the EIVD mutant displayed the striking property of accentuating the inhibition at pH 8.5, indicating an increase in proton affinity. This arose from a slowing ofk off but, once again, no change ink on (Fig. 7). The stabilization of the bound proton might be partly attributed to a through-space electrostatic interaction of bound H+ ions with the carboxylate side chain of EIV, if it has been correctly pictured as projecting toward the cytoplasmic end of the pore (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Shortening the side chain would tend to bring the negative charge of its head group closer to the bound proton, thus promoting its retention. The conductances of the deprotonated (h) and protonated (l) states provided valuable information about the local environment within the channel pore (Fig.8). In general, conductances of the aspartate mutants significantly exceeded those of WT channels. The low conductance was increased by Glu → Asp replacements at each of the four positions. A simple interpretation is that the various side chains protrude into the pore and thereby influence the energetic profile that a permeating ion encounters. Replacing a glutamate side chain with a smaller aspartate side chain would tend to widen the aperture for passage of monovalent ions. The Glu → Asp substitutions can be contrasted with the Glu → Gln replacements, which did not significantly increase γ l relative to the protonated state of WT (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This makes sense since glutamine is isosteric with glutamate and the Glu → Gln substitution may be expected to leave the geometry of the permeation path unchanged. Similar considerations may apply to the high conductance state. Since glutamine replacements in domains I and IIIcompletely eliminate the high conductance state, these can only be directly compared for Glu → Asp and Glu → Gln replacements in domains II and IV (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here again, Glu → Asp replacements caused a clear increase in γ h relative to WT (Fig. 8 B), and the corresponding glutamine substitutions left γ h unaltered (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To focus specifically on the incremental effects of protonation on channel conductance, we compared the ratio of low to high conductance values (γ l /γ h ) for the various mutants (Fig.8 C). In EID and EIIID, this ratio was significantly closer to unity than in WT or the other aspartate mutants. The similarity between EID and EIIID provides further support for the idea that EI and EIII act as nearly equal partners in coordinating the titratable proton (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For example, one might imagine that binding of H+ stabilizes EI and EIII side chains in a symmetrical carboxyl-carboxyl configuration, thereby impeding monovalent ion flux. The high value of γ l /γ h indicates that shortening the side chain of either EI or EIII has a disproportionate effect on the conductance of the protonated state. If the protonated EI-EIIIcomplex posed the most severe impediment to monovalent ion flux (e.g. in forming the narrowest aperture), Glu → Asp replacement would be expected to yield a relatively large degree of relief (e.g. in widening such an aperture). On the other hand, aspartate substitution at the EII and EIV positions increases γ l and γ h to nearly the same degree, suggesting a more general effect in favoring current flow. In the case of EIV, this fits well with the proposal that its side chain is positioned downstream of the point of greatest pore constriction (8Chen X.-H. Bezprozvanny I.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Biophys.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is interesting to compare the properties of L-type Ca2+channels with the behavior of other systems where multiple carboxylates are involved in H+ titration. The pore of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel also contains four glutamates, one from each of four monomers, which appear to cluster in pairs to form two independent protonation sites (pK a ∼7.6) (11Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although mutagenesis has not yet been reported at the level of individual glutamates, replacement of all four glutamates with aspartate was found to greatly weaken the H+ affinity and to obscure the appearance of discrete conductance levels (11Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Another interesting case is the photosynthetic reaction center of the purple bacterium, a well characterized H+ transporter, whose QB cluster contains a tightly coupled set of three glutamates. The carboxylate side chains of these residues strongly interact, giving a pK a as basic as 8.2 depending on oxidation state (16Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Honig B. Gunner M.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2469-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the QB cluster, two Glu residues seem to share the titratable proton, whereas a third remains fully protonated over a wide experimental range, very much similar to the behavior of L-type Ca2+ channels described here. In both of these systems, as in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the protonation site arises from multiple glutamate residues, each originating from a distinct region of the transmembrane protein. The effects of the aspartate mutations in L-type channels provide a compelling basis for further clarification of how such carboxylate head groups might work in concert. We are grateful to I.

It is demonstrated that the kinetic distinction among these protein family members lies primarily in the rate of breakdown of the mixed disulfide intermediate. The conserved buried acid group serves as a proton transfer catalyst for the buried active site cysteine in the formation and breakdown of the mixed disulfide. The reduction rate of Escherichia coli thioredoxin by dithiothreitol is directly proportional to the fraction of Asp-26 in the protonated form over the pH range of 6–9. The kinetic role of Asp-26 is further probed via differential solvent kinetic isotope effect measurements versus a D26N variant. The differential solvent isotope effect of 0.6 is consistent with a direct proton donation to the thiolate leaving group (Cys-35) via an enforced general acid catalysis by trapping mechanism.

Such a donation necessitates a structural rearrangement as these two buried side chains are separated by 6 Å in both the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein. Despite substantial sequence variability, the mammalian and bacterial protein disulfide isomerases, as well as the ubiquitous thioredoxins, appear to share a common structural motif (1Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and are generally assumed to utilize a common enzymatic mechanism to achieve their accelerated reactivities in both dithiol oxidation and disulfide reduction (Fig. 1). Although the conformation of the active sites are markedly similar (2Katti S. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 3Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), there is a 105-fold variation in redox equilibria between Escherichia coli thioredoxin (E′0 = −260 mV (4Gleason F.K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) and the E. coliprotein disulfide isomerase protein DsbA (E′0 = −0.1 mV (5Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). Within the thioredoxin/protein disulfide isomerase family the active site disulfide (-CXXC-) sequence spans the top of the first turn of an a-helix (thea 2 helix in E. coli thioredoxin) with the sulfur of the first cysteine exposed for reaction with exogenous thiols and disulfides while the second cysteine is buried within the protein interior. Much of the research into the mechanism has focused on the reactions of the solvent exposed thiol (Cys-32 in E. coli thioredoxin). Particularly noteworthy is the quantitative correlation between the redox potential and the pK of this solvent exposed thiol observed for a series of protein disulfide isomerase variants (6Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This correlation is also proposed to extend to the E. coli thioredoxin (7Kortemme T. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14503-14511Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since K eq equals (k 1/k −1)·(k 2/k −2) for Fig. 1, the large differences in redox equilibria between the protein disulfide isomerases and the thioredoxins must be manifested in the individual rate constants. E. coli thioredoxin exhibits a k 1 reaction rate of 120m−1 s−1 with oxidized glutathione under the conditions reported for human PDI 1The abbreviation used is: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase. α domain in Fig. 1(8Takahashi N. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8342-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the similarity in the rate constants observed for this step, the major difference in kinetics exhibited by these two enzymes does not lie primarily in the reaction of the protein thiol with the target disulfide substrate. Hence, a fuller understanding of the factors determining the differential reactivities within the thioredoxin/protein disulfide isomerase family necessitates a more detailed analysis of the structural elements influencing the other three reaction steps. Thioredoxins of all phyla as well as both the human and E. coli protein disulfide isomerases have a conserved buried acidic residue located behind the solvent inaccessible active site cysteine (1Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In a recent analysis of the structural determinants of the catalytic reactivity of the buried Cys-35 of E. colithioredoxin, we proposed that the buried Asp-26 serves as a proton transfer catalyst for the Cys-35 thiol in the formation and breakdown of the mixed disulfide intermediate (9LeMaster D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14876-14881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It should be noted that such a proton transfer necessitates a concomitant structural rearrangement. The present manuscript provides direct evidence for the proton transfer function of Asp-26 apparently via an “enforced general acid catalysis by trapping” (10Gilbert H.F. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7931-7947Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for the Cys-35 thiolate. DNA encoding wild type E. colithioredoxin from the plasmid pDL59 (11LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) was amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (Amplitaq kit from Applied Biosystems Inc.) (12Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 230: 1350-1354Crossref Scopus (6817) Google Scholar). The primers introduced NdeI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene which were used to subclone the fragment into the PET 3a vector (Novagen, Inc.). Asn codon AAC was introduced at position 26 via site-directed mutagenesis (13Mullis K. Faloona F. Scharf S. Saiki R. Horn G. Erlich H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 1986; 51: 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D26N expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21-ΔtrxA. The ΔtrxA307 deletion was transduced into BL21 (14Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) by linkage tometE163::Tn10 from strain JH22 (kindly provided by M. Russel, Rockefeller University). Expression plasmid pDL59 in MG1655 (Coli Genetic Stock Center) was used to produce the wild type protein. Protein samples were purified as described previously (11LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Fluorescence stopped flow experiments utilized an OLIS RSM spectrophotometer (On Line Instrument Systems, Inc.). The average of at least six mixing experiments were determined for each set of reagent conditions. The pH value of the mixing effluent are reported in all cases. For fluorescence experiments 40 μm oxidized protein in 0.2m HEPES buffer was mixed 1:1 with dithiothreitol in 0.5 mm EDTA, disodium salt. Constant ionic strength for the HEPES buffer solution with a [Na+] of 0.2 mwas achieved by varying the proportion of 2 m NaOH and 2m NaCl added to a solution of HEPES in free acid form. The dithiothreitol concentrations used ranged from 5 to 320 mmdepending on the pH of the protein solution. An excitation wavelength of 285 nm and emission signals above 325 nm were used. Due to the kinetic instability of the mixed disulfide intermediate, the rate constant k −2for reduction of E. coli thioredoxin with glutathione cannot be obtained via the experimental approach used to obtain the individual rate constants of the human PDI α domain (8Takahashi N. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8342-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The rate for reduction by excess glutathione is as follows (15Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rate=k−2[glutathione]·{k−1[glutathione]/ (k2+k−1[glutathione])}·[enzyme]Equation 1 For experimentally accessible glutathione concentrations the rate is proportional to [glutathione]2, indicating thatk 2 ≫k −1[glutathione]. Under these conditions observed rate constant (k app) equalsk −2 k −1/k 2. Since the mixed disulfide intermediate was not trapped, the individual rate constants could not be deconvoluted. Direct determination of k −2 can be obtained via the reduction of E. coli thioredoxin with dithiothreitol. In this case the breakdown of the mixed disulfide intermediate involves a rapid intramolecular cyclization of the dithiothreitol. The rate for reduction by excess dithiothreitol is shown as follows. Rate=k−2[dithiothreitol]·{k−1/(k2+k−1)}·[enzyme]Equation 2 The ΔE′0 for the reduction of E. coli thioredoxin by dithiothreitol is 50 mV (via NAD(P)H couple) (4Gleason F.K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Hence K eq = (k 1/k −2)·(k 2/k −1) = 1/46. As is evident from Equation 2, k appprovides a lower bound estimate of k −2. Given the value of 120 m−1 s−1 fork 1 and 400 m−1s−1 for k app (see below), (k 2/k −1)appis 1/14. Equation 2 indicates that k app is at most a 7% underestimate of k −2. Implicit in this analysis is the assumption that the intrinsic reactivities for the initial step of attack (k 1and k −2) are similar for both glutathione and dithiothreitol. Mercaptoethanol and glutathione reduce the protein disulfide isomerases at similar rates (15Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Likewise reduced protein disulfide isomerase reacts with oxidized glutathione only 4-fold faster than it does with the disulfide form of mercaptoethanol (17Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with model redox kinetics measurements demonstrating that both the thiols and the disulfide bonds of glutathione are a factor of two more reactive than the thiol and disulfide forms of mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol at neutral pH (16Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 18Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Selective enzymatic binding of substrate would distort this simple reactivity comparison. The thioredoxin/protein disulfide isomerase enzymes show no signs of substrate saturation up to several millimolar for both glutathione (19Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7937-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and dithiothreitol (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting minimal binding interactions. In the present study the linear dependence of the dithiothreitol reaction was found to extend to above 100 mm. Reduction of E. coli thioredoxin is accompanied by an increase of tryptophan fluorescence which can be used to monitor the reaction (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the D26N mutant is reduced by dithiothreitol for a series of pH values from 6 to 9, the apparent rate constant is linearly dependent on [OH−] as illustrated in the log-log plot of Fig. 2 A. This is the standard behavior observed in model thiol-disulfide reactions indicating the limiting diffusion kinetics of the reactive thiolate. In marked contrast, the wild type enzyme is substantially more reactive at the lower pH values, while its reactivity becomes nearly independent of [OH−] above pH 8. The nature of this kinetic distinction is clarified by normalizing the rate constants to the concentration of the reactive dithiothreitol thiolate species (Fig. 2 B). The enhanced reactivity of the wild type enzyme clearly follows a simple proton titration behavior with a pK value of 7.23 similar to that previously reported for Asp-26 in the oxidized protein (21Dyson H.J. Tennant L.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4262-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Langsetmo K. Fuchs J.A. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7603-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this form of the protein there is no other ionizable group in the active site region which could account for this behavior. At pH 7.4 the apparent rate constant for reduction of E. coli thioredoxin by dithiothreitol (400m−1 s−1) agrees quite well with the k −2 reported for reduction of the human protein disulfide isomerase α domain with glutathione (145–434m−1 s−1, Fig.1). As discussed above, the intramolecular cyclization of the dithiothreitol in the mixed disulfide intermediate appears to be sufficiently rapid so that the rate constants of Fig. 2 can be reliably identified with k −2. Experiments analogous to those of Fig. 2 were repeated using a 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer over the same pH range. These experiments yielded quite similar results suggesting the absence of a significant specific ion effect. Linearity was verified at each pH using four different dithiothreitol concentrations. For both buffer systems the reactivity of the wild type enzyme converged to a value near that of the mutant around pH 9. Likewise reproducible is the modest increase in reactivity of D26N mutant at lower pH (Fig.2 B), which may reflect the decreasing negative charge of this acidic protein and its effects on diffusion of the dithiothreitol thiolate. These data strongly suggest the presence of two distinct mechanisms for the wild type enzyme. At pH values below 9 the reactivity of E. coli thioredoxin is proportionate to the fraction of protonated form of Asp-26, while at higher pH values a mechanism not involving protein ionization becomes dominant. The convergence of the reactivities of both the wild type and D26N enzymes at high pH argues for a common enzymatic catalysis mechanism, which for the D26N enzyme involves no net protein ionization over the pH range examined. Although combined acid and base catalyzed reactions are quite common in enzymology, these generally give rise to the familar bell shaped pH profile reflecting the pH ranges for which either the acid or based catalyzed steps are rate-limiting. In the present case the reaction rate is proportionate to both [DTT−] and [Asp-26°] over at least a 3 pH unit range, indicating that both species contribute directly to the rate-limiting process. Kinetic isotope measurements provide one of the most sensitive experimental monitors of proton transfer mechanisms (23Schowen R.L. Prog. Phys. Org. Chem. 1972; 9: 275-332Google Scholar,24Scheppele S.E. Chem. Rev. 1972; 72: 511-532Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, enzyme reactions rarely allow for the systematic variation of both substrates and catalytic groups often necessary to obtain unambiguous mechanistic interpretations. Hence interpretation often draws heavily upon analogy to small molecule studies. The differential solvent kinetic isotope effect for the wild type and D26N enzymes (( kH2O/ kD2O)WT/( kH2O/ kD2O)D26N) were determined based on the expectation that the wild type mechanism differs from the mutant reaction by introduction of an additional Asp-26-dependent step. Hence the differential solvent kinetic isotope effect is anticipated to reflect only the isotope selectivity of this Asp-26-dependent step. This differential analysis also offers the practical benefit of increased precision as inaccuracies in the matching of the H2O and D2O buffers cancel out. The ratio of the solvent kinetic isotope effects for the wild typeversus D26N mutant as a function of pH are given in Fig.3. From pH 6 to pH 9 the kinetic isotope effect for the Asp-26-dependent step is constant at 0.6. These values can not arise from a simple solvent isotope dependent pK shift of the aspartate as they are constant across the range of that pK. The differential kinetic isotope measurements clearly demonstrate a qualitative difference in mechanism between the wild type and D26N mutant. The upturn of the differential kinetic isotope effect above pH 9 suggests a change in the dominant kinetic mechanism consistent with a shift toward a D26N-like mechanism as inferred from the data of Fig. 2. Any satisfactory model for the mechanism of the wild type enzyme must account for both the proportionality of the rate to [DTT−]·[Asp-26°] and the pH-insensitive differential solvent kinetic isotope effect. In principle, protonation of Asp-26 could function indirectly via an activating conformational transition, which is energetically inaccessible to either the carboxamide or carboxylate forms of the enzymes. In this case the kinetic isotope effect would reflect changes in hydrogen bond strengths and hydration interactions in H2O versusD2O. Although as discussed in more detail below, the separation of the Asp-26 and Cys-35 side chains appear to necessitate some conformational rearrangement, the role of Asp-26 as a general acid in a direct proton transfer appears to offer a more plausible explanation of the isotope effects. SN2 reactions are notoriously insensitive to solvent isotope effects. The reason is apparent from consideration of Fig. 4 A. The model thiolate-disulfide reaction is initiated by diffusion of a thiolate ion to the active site followed by the attack on the disulfide. The leaving thiolate ion diffuses away to react with water. As no proton transfer occurs during the rate-limiting step of disulfide attack, a small solvent isotope effect (∼1.2) is commonly observed reflecting the lower diffusion rates resulting from the higher viscosity of the D2O solution (25Mills R. Harris K.R. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1976; 5: 215-231Crossref Google Scholar). A mechanism consistent with the differential kinetic isotope effect can be derived by noting that in Fig. 4 A, for the case of theE. coli thioredoxin reaction the leaving Cys-35 thiolate is not free to diffuse away from the Cys-32 sulfur. Indeed the cysteine sulfurs remain in van der Waals contact in the reduced state (26Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure (Lond .). 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the initially released Cys-35 thiolate is removed from contact with the aqueous phase. If the protonation of the thiolate is appreciably slower than the typical diffusion limited reaction, it must compete with the reverse Cys-35 thiolate attack on the mixed disulfide linkage. Such kinetics offer a formal analogy to the thiolate reaction with aldehydes (Fig. 4 B). In their analysis of the thiolate reaction with acetaldehyde, Gilbert and Jencks state “enforced general acid catalysis by trapping must appear whenever the rate constant for the breakdown of T− [hemithioacetal anion] to reactants, k −1, becomes larger than the rate constant for conversion of T− to TH by proton abstraction from water, k h“ (10Gilbert H.F. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7931-7947Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using dilute weak acid catalysts they observed up to a 100-fold increase in trapping efficiency. For E. coli thioredoxin it is proposed that the requisite kinetics are achieved by the decrease in the rate of reaction with water, k h, due to the solvent inaccessibility. Note that for the D26N mutant both the water catalyzed quenching of the thiolate and the reversal of the mixed disulfide formation would be pH-independent, consistent with the simple kinetic behavior of Fig. 2. These internal return kinetics would merely lead to a decrease in the observed rate constant. In this model, the Asp-26 carboxyl of the wild type protein serves to quench the Cys-35 thiolate more rapidly thus markedly decreasing the amount of internal return. As the pKof Cys-35 is over 11 (9LeMaster D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14876-14881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), at physiological pH the quenching of the thiolate is expected to reduce the reactivity by 104. Asp-26 must, of course, catalyze the reverse reaction with equal efficiency. Thus in the equilibrated mixed disulfide state, the Asp-26 carboxylate will serve to remove the Cys-35 thiol proton facilitating the attack on the mixed disulfide linkage. Support for this model comes from the solvent kinetic isotope effect observed in the Gilbert and Jencks study on the thiolate reaction with acetaldehyde (10Gilbert H.F. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7931-7947Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the isotope effect depends of the proton source. For catalysis by weak general acids versus water, kH2O/ kD2Owas observed to be ∼1.0 and 1.8, respectively. The ratio of these solvent kinetic isotope effects corresponds closely to the value of 0.6 observed for the wild type and D26N enzymes. The Asp-26-dependent proton transfer mechanism provides a 10-fold rate acceleration. Yet the Asp-26 and Cys-35 side chains are separated by 6 Å in the interior of the protein thus apparently necessitating a conformational rearrangement to allow the proton transfer to occur. Although a direct hydrogen bond between these two side chains would surely facilitate the proton transfer reaction, it would come at the cost of a severely reduced nucleophilicity. Polar coordinating interactions are well known to be a dominant determinant of nucleophilicity. In the case of the thiolate-disulfide reaction a switch from aqueous to a polar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide results in a 104-fold increase in rate (27Singh R. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6304-6309Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The interior of the enzyme surrounding the Cys-35 sulfur is markedly devoid of potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The low effective dielectric constant in this region of the protein deduced from analysis of the chemical shift behavior (9LeMaster D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14876-14881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) may serve not only to enhance the nucleophilicity of the Cys-35 thiolate, it may also help propagate the electrostatic field interactions among the active site charged groups and the helix dipoles which appear to influence both the transition state stabilities and the pK values of the active site groups (2Katti S. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 28Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hence formation of a transient hydrogen bond to facilitate the proton transfer at a rate competitive with the internal return kinetics provides a means of satisfying the various kinetic requirements. As discussed previously (9LeMaster D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14876-14881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an internal cavity lying between Cys-35 Sγ and Asp-26 Oδ2 should allow for a χ1 dihedral angle rotation of Cys-35 to bring these side chains into contact with minimal structural rearrangement. All of the protein disulfide isomerases and thioredoxins share a common mixed disulfide intermediate formed between the solvent exposed cysteine and the exogenous thiol. The kinetic data presented herein indicates that the rate constant for formation of the mixed disulfide from the oxidized protein occurs at a similar rate for both E. coli thioredoxin and the human PDI α domain, analogous to the results observed for the mixed disulfide formation via the reduced protein discussed above. Hence, the kinetic differentiation of these proteins must occur primarily in the breakdown of the mixed disulfide intermediate. Modulation of the branching ratio for this intermediate determines the operational behavior of the enzyme. If the rate of attack by the buried cysteine on the proximal (i.e. protein) sulfur of the mixed disulfide is kinetically dominant, the enzyme will operate primarily as a reducing agent. If instead the rate of attack by an exogenous thiol on the distal sulfur of the mixed disulfide is kinetically dominant, the enzyme will function primarily as an oxidant/thiol-disulfide exchange catalyst. Indeed site-directed mutation of the buried cysteine still allows for protein disulfide isomerase activity (29Wunderlich M. Otto A. Maskos K. Mucke M. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For protein substrates that bind efficiently to the protein disulfide isomerase, kinetically unproductive mixed disulfide intermediates can form. Attack on the mixed disulfide by the buried cysteine can provide an escape mechanism to allow for effective catalysis (30Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The variation in branching ratios can be estimated from equilibrium stability measurements for the reaction of mercaptoethanol withE. coli thioredoxin. Using high concentrations of mercaptoethanol, equilibrium values of K 1 =k 1/k −1 = 1.95 andK 2 =k 2/k −2 = 2.13m were obtained (31Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given the similar redox potentials of the glutathione and mercaptoethanol redox couples, similar values for the glutathione mixed disulfide are anticipated. When combined with thek 1 and k −2 values forE. coli thioredoxin discussed herein and compared with the rate constants for the human PDI α domain summarized in Fig. 1, one concludes that the attack of the buried cysteine on the mixed disulfide intermediate (k 2) is ∼50-fold faster forE. coli thioredoxin (i.e. ∼1000 s−1) than for the PDI α domain. Conversely, the attack of exogenous glutathione on the mixed disulfide (k −1) is predicted to be ∼1000-fold faster for the PDI α domain than for E. coli thioredoxin (i.e. ∼60 m−1 s−1). The internal consistency of these estimates is independently verified by the predicted k app for glutathione reduction of E. coli thioredoxink −1 k −2/k2∼25 m−1 s−1 in reasonable agreement with the reported value of ∼10 m−1s−1 (8Takahashi N. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8342-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The most readily apparent sequence difference between the protein disulfide isomerases and the thioredoxins is the substitution of histidine for proline in the active site (i.e. -CGHC- for the human PDI α domain versus -CGPC- for E. coli thioredoxin). The present kinetic analysis combined with the evolutionary conservation of these residues suggests that the active site histidine likely serves to facilitate the attack of an exogenous thiol on the protein disulfide isomerase mixed disulfide intermediate. Similarly, the thioredoxin Pro-34 may enhance the internal attack of Cys-35 on the mixed disulfide via its effect on the helical twist of the active site sequence (32LeMaster D.M. Kushlan D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9255-9264Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar)."

Efficient oncogenic transformation of cells by Ras requires cooperation of different Ras-dependent signaling pathways of which the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is essential (10White M.A. Nicolette C.

The activation of Raf appears to be a complex multistep process (13Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The regulatory N terminus of Raf contains two regions that are highly conserved between different members of the Raf family. A part of the first conserved region (CR1) encompassing amino acids 51–131 is responsible for Ras binding and has therefore been termed Ras binding domain (RafRBD). 1The abbreviations used are: RBD, Ras binding domain; mant-Gpp(NH)p, fluorescent analogue of guanylyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate labeled with the mant group, 2′,3′-(N-methylanthroniloyl); CR, conserved region; CRD, cysteine rich domain; wt, wild-type; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; MEK, mitogen-activated protein or extracellular signal-related kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase.

Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the interaction between Ras and RafRBD demonstrated that the mutation of Raf-Arg89 is sufficient to abrogate Ras-dependent Raf activation completely and that the activation of Raf correlates quantitatively with the binding affinity between Ras and RafRBD (21Fabian J.R.

Whereas the role of RafRBD in Ras binding is understood in great detail, the contribution of other domains in the Raf regulatory domain to Ras-Raf interaction and signaling is far from clear. A number of reports have suggested that the cysteine-rich domain (RafCRD) and the RafCR2 domain also might be involved in Ras-Raf interaction and Ras-dependent Raf activation (10White M.A. Nicolette C.

As to the role of the RafCR2 domain, it was found that the interaction of the Ras effector mutant Ras-E37G with Raf was restored by the Raf-S257L mutation that is localized within the Ser/Thr-rich RafCR2 domain, using the two-hybrid system (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In addition, transformation by Ras-G12V/E37G could be achieved by cotransfection of Ras-G12V/E37G with Raf-S257L. These results suggested that the Raf-S257L mutation is capable to restore the binding of Raf to Ras-E37G and as a consequence Ras-dependent transformation was proposed to be achieved due to the activation of Raf-S257L by Ras-G12V/E37G (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This further suggested that the RafCR2 domain might be involved in Ras-dependent Raf binding and activation. In addition, the RafCR2 region was shown to mediate interaction of Raf with 14–3-3 proteins that require phosphorylation of Raf-Ser259 (28Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutation of Raf-Ser259 to alanine leads to constitutive activation of Raf demonstrating that the RafCR2 region plays an important role in the control of Raf activation (29Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Since no structural data are yet available, functional analysis of the RafCR2 domain provides the primary tool to investigate its role in Ras-Raf protein-protein interaction and Raf activation. Mutational analysis has successfully identified functional epitopes in protein-protein interaction (30Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar), such as the Ras effector domain (32Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Since mutations of multiple residues within a protein-protein interface lead to additive effects on binding affinity (33Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), this effect has been utilized to analyze interacting protein interfaces by the double mutant approach to identify complementary interacting amino acids (34Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the double mutant approach to identify amino acids in Raf that participate in interaction with Ras and especially to probe the role of Raf-Ser257 in Ras-Raf interaction. In contrast to biochemical analysis of mutations within the RafRBD with respect to binding affinity (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), analysis of the interaction of large parts of the Raf regulatory N terminus has been prevented by a strong tendency these proteins have to aggregate when expressed in E. coli, preventing equilibrium affinity measurements (35Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2C. Herrmann and C. Block, unpublished obervations In this study, we circumvented these problems by investigation of protein-protein interaction using the yeast two-hybrid system, which has been shown to discriminate between high, intermediate, and low-affinity interactions (36Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We developed a quantitative two-hybrid system to measure the effect of RafCR2 mutations on Ras-Raf binding affinity. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Ras-E37G and RafCR2 mutations on Ras-dependent Raf activation using a reporter gene assay. Using this combined approach, we thoroughly dissected the role of Raf-Ser257 and the RafCR2 domain by measuring Ras-Raf binding and activation. The construction of the expression vector for GST-Raf-RBD and expression and purification of wild-type and mutant RafRBD have been described previously (18Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). H-Ras protein was prepared as described before (37John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RafRBD acts as a nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Ras (18Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The affinity of wild-type RafRBD and RafRBD mutants for Ras was therefore determined by titrating Ras loaded with fluorescent mant-Gpp(NH)p nucleotide with RafRBD proteins. The dissociation rate constants of nucleotide dissociation from Ras were used to determine the Ras-RafRBD interaction. Dissociation constants were determined in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. For measurement of the Ras-RafRBD interaction, 25 nm Ras-mant-Gpp(NH)p complex was incubated with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotide and different concentrations of RafRBD, and the dissociation was measured as the decrease of fluorescence. The dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the data to single exponentials. Details of this procedure have been described (18Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). RSV-Ras-G12V and pcDNA3-Raf plasmids were constructed as described (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mutant RSV-Ras-G12V/E37G construct was generated by PCR mutagenesis using two subsequent PCR amplifications (38Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcàrel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As template, RSV-Ras-G12V was used to generate the megaprimer in the first step using a 5′-oligonucleotide matching the vector sequence and a 3′-oligonucleotide introducing the mutation. The second step was performed using the same template which was cut by restriction digestion immediately 5′ of the Kozak sequence to prevent amplification of the wild-type product. Mutations were introduced into the RafCR2 domain using the same PCR mutagenesis scheme. To facilitate PCR mutagenesis, a MfeI and a AgeI site were introduced 5′ and 3′ of the RafCR2 domain. After the two-step PCR mutagenesis, the mutant CR2 domain was introduced into the full-length Raf using these restriction sites. The two-hybrid Ras constructs were generated by PCR amplification of Ras residues 1–166 of the Ras-G12V or the Ras-G12V/E37G templates, respectively. The Ras C terminus was deleted in these constructs to prevent association with the plasma membrane. Ras constructs (aa 1–166) were cloned into the pPC97 DNA binding domain fusion vector (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The Raf regulatory domain (aa 1–275) and mutations thereof were PCR amplified and cloned into the pPC86 GAL4 activation domain fusion vector. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The construction of the E743-tk80-luc and tk80-luc reporter constructs was described previously (40Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Rabbit kidney epithelial-like RK13 cells were grown to 25% confluency on 6-cm dishes and then transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. 2 μg of reporter constructs (E743-tk80-luc or tk80-luc), 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector (pEQ176), 1.5 μg of ERK-1 expression vector (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), 1.5 μg of an Ets protein expression vector (41Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and 1.5 μg of pcDNA3 expression plasmid alone or pcDNA3 expression plasmid containing a respective Raf construct were used for each transfection. Where indicated, 80 ng of the RSV-Ras-G12V or the indicated amount of RSV-Ras-G12V/E37G plasmid was additionally transfected. 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (40Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalizing luminescence to β-galactosidase activity. The two-hybrid system employed in this study was developed by Chevray and Nathans (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and modified here by using the yeast strain Y190. For binding studies with Raf and Ras-G12V1–166, competent yeast cells prepared according to Klebe (42Klebe R.J. Harriss J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.D. Gene. 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) were cotransformed with 1 μg of each of the two-hybrid vectors and grown on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (Sigma) to monitor interaction between the fusion proteins. Glucose was used as the carbon source. β-Galactosidase activity was detected by filter lifting cells grown on selective medium and staining the yeast colonies by incubation in 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) at 37 °C for 1 h. Original transformants were restreaked on selective plates. From these plates single colonies were picked and inoculated in 15-ml synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. The liquid cultures were incubated at 30 °C until they reached an A 600 of about 1. The β-galactosidase activity was measured according to Miller (43Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Sedimented cells were resuspended in 800 μl of Z-buffer, permeabilized by addition of 30 μl of chloroform, and 20 μl of 0.1% SDS, followed by vortexing the cell suspension for 10 s and incubating for 10 min at 30 °C. Afterward 160 μlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7) was added, and cells were incubated at 30 °C until the yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped with 400 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. The suspension was centrifuged for 4 min in a microfuge to pellet the cell debris. The β-galactosidase activity was measured at 420 nm, and the activity units were calculated according to the following formula: (A 420·1000)/(V[ml]·t[min]·A 600). We have previously determined the contribution of individual amino acids to Ras-Raf binding in vitro by analyzing the effect of single mutations within RafRBD on the Ras-Raf binding affinity (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the effect of a second mutation within in a protein-protein contact surface adds to the effect of the first mutation, complementary interacting amino acids can be identified by the lack of this additive behavior (34Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To identify interacting residues in RafRBD that are complementary to Ras-Glu37 we have measured binding affinity between Ras-E37G and various RafRBD mutants in vitro. The assay to measure Ras-RafRBD binding exploits the fact that RafRBD behaves as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Ras (18Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Ras-E37G bound about 100-fold weaker to RafRBD than did Ras-wt (TableI). Amino acid exchanges at the position of Raf-K65 decreased the binding of RafRBD to Ras-E37G and to wild-type Ras only very weakly. The mutation of Raf-T68A moderately decreased the affinity to Ras-wt and to Ras-E37G 10- and 6-fold, respectively. Mutations of Raf-Gln66 and Raf-Arg89 had strong effects on the binding of Ras; however, as in the cases before, it affected both mutant Ras-E37G and Ras-wt strongly. In marked contrast, the mutation Raf-R67A and Raf-R59A reduced only the binding to Ras-wt drastically, whereas the interaction to Ras-E37G remained largely unaffected. The dissociation constant of Raf-R67A and Raf-R59A upon binding to Ras-wt increased by 16- and 29-fold respectively, while it only led to a 2.5-fold increase in K D upon binding to Ras-E37G. These results indicate that Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 bind directly to Ras-Glu37, as Raf-R59A and Raf-R67A have no additional effect on the interaction with Ras-E37G. These data show that the double mutant approach is suitable to identify amino acids in Ras effector proteins that bind to specific residues within the Ras effector region.Table IDissociation constants for the complexes between RafRBD or RafRBD mutants and wild-type and mutant mant-Gpp(NH)p-RasRaf constructsRas-wtRas-E37GKD(μM)1-aDissociation constants between wild-type Ras and mutant RafRBD proteins are taken from Ref. 22.ratio mutant/ wild-typeKD(μM)ratio mutant/ wild-typeWild-type0.131131.0K65E0.675201.5K65M0.413201.5T68A1.3010776.0R67A2.1016322.5R59A3.8029332.5Q66A7.4057>100>7K84A14.0108>100>7Dissociation constants between recombinant purified Ras and RafRBD proteins were determined using the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition method, which measures inhibition of dissociation of mant-Gpp(NH)p from Ras as a function of the RafRBD concentration as described under “Experimental Procedures” (18Herrmann C.

Open table in a new tab Dissociation constants between recombinant purified Ras and RafRBD proteins were determined using the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition method, which measures inhibition of dissociation of mant-Gpp(NH)p from Ras as a function of the RafRBD concentration as described under “Experimental Procedures” (18Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The error of the dissociation constants is below 10%. Since the mutation of Ras-E37G increased the dissociation constants between Ras and RafRBD to micromolar concentrations in vitro, we measured the effect of this mutation on Raf activation in vivo. To this end, we used a transient transfection assay in RK13 cells. This assay utilizes a luciferase reporter gene driven by three E74 binding sites (40Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), which are high affinity sites for ETS transcription factors shown to mediate transcription upon activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (44Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of Ras-G12V/E37G with Raf reduced the luciferase activity to 30% of the activity observed upon activation of Raf by Ras-G12V (Fig.1 A). This level of luciferase activity was insufficient to measure the effects of additional mutations within RafRBD since even mutations in RafRBD that modestly decrease Ras-Raf binding affinity led to a decrease in reporter gene activity to almost background values (data not shown). To establish conditions that would allow us to test the effect of mutations within RafRBD on stimulation of Raf by Ras-G12V/E37G, we increased the amount of Ras-G12V/E37G transfected. The 2- or 4-fold amount of Ras-G12V/E37G plasmid led to an equivalent increase in luciferase activity in the presence of Raf (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of Raf no increase of reporter gene activity was observed upon stimulation with Ras-G12V/E37G. This demonstrated that the transactivation induced by Ras-G12V/E37G was clearly mediated by the activation of Raf and that Ras-G12V/E37G could not bypass Raf to activate the reporter gene. The signal intensity achieved by increasing the amount of Ras-G12V/E37G plasmid 4-fold even exceeded that originally obtained by activation of Raf by Ras-G12V. This yielded conditions suitable to test the effect of RafRBD mutants on activation by Ras-G12V/E37G. The double mutant approach identified complementary interacting residues measuring the interaction of Ras with RafRBD in vitro. To test the activation of Raf by Rasin vivo, we analyzed the effect of RafRBD mutations within the full-length Raf protein on the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by Ras-G12V/37G. We have shown previously, that Ras/Raf-induced transactivation correlates quantitatively with the binding affinity between Ras and RafRBD (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using experimental conditions which result in a maximum of Raf activation by Ras-G12V/E37G (Fig. 1 B) we tested RafRBD mutants for activation by Ras-G12V/E37G. Mutations of Raf-K65M, R67A, R59A, and T68A, which resulted in slight to moderate decrease in affinity of RafRBD to Ras-E37G (Table I), also led to an equivalent decrease of Raf activity in the presence of the activator Ras-G12V/E37G (Fig. 2 A). Although the affinity of the Raf-Q66A mutant was strongly reduced, it still showed a significant activation of residual transcription of 5% as compared with the wild-type. Furthermore, the Raf-R89L mutant, which cannot be activated by Ras-G12V, was unable to induce transcription of the reporter gene upon cotransfection with Ras-G12V/E37G. The small effect of the Raf-R59A and the Raf-R67A mutation on the activation by Ras-G12V/E37G is in marked contrast to the effect of these mutations on the activation by Ras-G12V which is decreased by 60–70% (22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of various mutations within RafRBD on Ras-dependent activation, we plotted the amount of activation of Raf mutants by Ras-G12V/E37G versus activation by Ras-G12V (Fig. 2 B). The plot demonstrates that residues Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 in RafRBD contribute strongly to activation of Raf by Ras-G12V, whereas they do not play a significant role in activation by Ras-G12V/E37G. These results clearly identify Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 as interacting residues complementary to the Ras-Glu37 effector residue in the Ras-dependent activation of Raf. Ras-G12V/E37G was found to be unable to interact with Raf in the two-hybrid system (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of Raf-S257L within the RafCR2 domain had been reported to restore binding of Raf to the Ras-G12V/E37G mutant, suggesting that the RafCR2 domain and in particular Raf-Ser257 plays a role in Ras-Raf interaction (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Since bacterially expressed Raf fragments comprising the complete regulatory domain have a strong tendency to aggregate (35Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1987643802,"Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) can both bind to and link DNA. Dimers of EBNA1 bind specific sites, two clusters of which, the FR and DS, comprise the necessarycis-acting elements of the Epstein-Barr viral origin of plasmid replication. EBNA1-dimers can link FR and DS, looping out the intervening DNA. EBNA1 can also intermolecularly link DNAs to which it binds. Residues of EBNA1 that can mediate linking have been mapped to at least three, non-overlapping domains. These domains, when fused to the dimerization and DNA-binding domain of GAL4, can self-associate and thereby link DNAs bound site specifically by GAL4. Two disparate mechanisms could underlie self-association of linking domains: 1) linking domains could associate with other linking domains directly, or 2) linking domains could associate indirectly by binding to a common nucleic acid intermediate. We have found that EBNA1 can link DNA by each of these mechanisms, however, the linking domains associate directly with a greater apparent affinity than through a nonspecific nucleic acid intermediate."

Homeodomains (HDs) 1The abbreviation used are: HD(s), homeodomain(s); HMG, high mobility group; En, Engrailed; GST, glutathione S-transferase. are 61-amino acid-long structures that are able to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). They represent the DNA binding domain of a large number of transcription factors that control cell fate decisions in a wide range of organisms, including yeast, insects, and vertebrates (2Gehring W.J.

The structure of HDs and their mode of DNA interaction are conserved (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 4Pabo C.O.

Though recognizing similar DNA sequences, when expressed in the same temporal and spatial context, distinct HD-containing proteins may show different biological activities (9Chan S.K. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 796-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Sreenath T. Pollock R.A. Bieberich C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9636-9640Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins cannot be the only molecular event that determines their biological effect. In fact, some other molecular mechanisms have been identified, in addition to the DNA binding specificity, that allow the selection of different target genes by distinct HD-containing proteins (11Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Chan S.K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). One of these mechanisms is based on the differential interaction of HD-containing proteins with accessory factors that mediate the contacts with the basal transcriptional machinery. For example, the Pou-domain-containing proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to the same DNA sequence, yet only the former is able to interact with the acidic transcriptional activator VP16 (11Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Another mechanism is based on specific protein-protein interactions with other factors that bind to DNA tracts located near the sequences recognized by an HD-containing protein. A clear example of this phenomenon is the interaction between Ultrabithorax and Extradenticle proteins (12Chan S.K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A simple molecular mechanism to control the binding of HD-containing transcription factors to a DNA regulatory element could be the presence of competitors for the interacting DNA sequence. In this paper we show that the high mobility group I proteins (HMGI, HMGY, and HMGI-C) may have this function. The HMGI proteins are a family of low molecular mass non-histone nuclear proteins rich in both basic and acidic residues, which comprise an important component of the active chromatin structure (reviewed in Ref. 13Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that have been shown to bind in the minor groove of AT-rich sequences of DNA through a DNA binding motif called AT-hook (14Solomon M. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This family includes three polypeptides: HMGI and HMGY derived from alternative splicing of the same gene and differing from each other by 11 amino acids (18Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a third protein called HMGI-C that is the product of a separate gene (19Manfioletti G.

The human interferon β gene provides a particularly well characterized example of how HMGI(Y) could interact with specific DNA sequences on the promoter and cooperate with other proteins such as ATF-2, NF-κB, and c-Jun in activating this gene by stimulating the binding of these transcription factors to their target sites (28Thanos D.

An elevated expression of all these proteins has been correlated with malignant phenotypes in epithelial and fibroblastic rat thyroid cells, and in many experimental carcinomas (30Giancotti V.

In addition, at least one of them, HMGI-C, has been found to be important for the retrovirally induced transformation of rat thyroid cells (33Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and many groups have recently reported a correlation between rearrangements of the HMGI-C gene and some benign human mesenchymal tumors (34Ashar H.R.

Furthermore, the inactivation of the Hmgi-c gene has been demonstrated to cause the pygmy phenotype in the mouse (36Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), postulating an important role of this protein in cell proliferation and differentiation. The DNA binding specificity of HMGI proteins (preference for AT-rich sequences) would suggest that these molecules may interact with the 5′-TAAT-3′-containing sequences, specific HDs target sequences. In this way, HMGI proteins might interfere with the DNA binding function of HD-containing transcription factors and therefore influence the biological effect of these proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that HMGI proteins are indeed able to interact with some HD binding sequences. Specifically, we show that the binding of HDs and HMGI proteins to 5′-TAAT-3′ motif-containing sequences is mutually exclusive. In particular, the presence of HMGI proteins blocks HDs from binding to 5′-TAAT-3′ sequences. Apparently this effect is mediated by structural modifications of the DNA induced by HMGI proteins and not only by a simple competition for the same target sequence. As a model to study the functional role of these interactions, we utilize the transcriptional activation of HOXD9 on an autoregulatory element (37Zappavigna V. Renucci A. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Urier G. Peschle C. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We show that HMGY is able to compete for the binding of HOXD9 to the DNA in vitro and to reduce the target-specific transcriptional activation of HOXD9 in transfected cells. The following oligonucleotides were used in gel-retardation assay experiments (only upper strand sequence shown): CAnt1, 5′-CACTGCCCAGTTAATTGTTCTTGA-3′; PRDII, 5′-GGGAAATTCCGTGGGAAATTCCGAGCT-3′; NP, 5′-TGATATTTAATTGATTTT-3′; CAnt4, 5′-CACTGCCCAGTTAAGTGTTCTTGA-3′; T109, 5′-GCACGCTAATTGAGACGC-3′; HCRII, 5′-GACACATTAATCTATAATCAAATAC-3′ The plasmid coding for Engrailed (En) has been already described (38Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In this plasmid the transcription of the HD-coding sequence is driven by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The murine HMGI-C and HMGY coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the appropriate primers deduced from the amino and carboxyl termini, and cloned between theNdeI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pAR3038 under the bacteriophage T7 promoter (39Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). The resulting clones were verified by sequencing. All proteins were expressed using the BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli strain, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5 promoter control (39Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to A 600 = 0.6, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, grown overnight, and harvested. EnHD used for DNA-binding assays was partially purified by using Econo Pac S cartridges (Bio-Rad). The concentration of the active protein was measured by oligonucleotide saturation assay. A gel-retardation assay (see below) was performed with increasing amounts of oligonucleotides (from 0.3 to 50 nm), then the protein-bound and free oligonucleotide concentration values were subjected to a Scatchard plot analysis. The value of the active protein percentage over the total amount was usually 40–80%. HMGI proteins were selectively extracted from bacterial cells with 5% (v/v) perchloric acid and precipitated with acetone-HCl as described previously (30Giancotti V. Berlingieri M.T. DiFiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Crane-Robinson C. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6051-6057PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Bio-Rad RP304 column using a Waters apparatus as elsewhere described (32Giancotti V. Buratti E. Perissin L. Zorzet S. Balmain A. Portella G. Fusco A. Goodwin G.H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 184: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The consistency between purified recombinant HMGI proteins and calculated molecular mass from sequence was checked by mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer API 1 spectrometer). The construct encoding GST-HOXD9 was described previously (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the GST fusion protein was expressed and purified according to standard procedures (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with 32P and used as probes in the gel-retardation assays. Gel-retardation assay was performed incubating protein and DNA in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 55 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 13% glycerol for 30 min at room temperature. Protein-bound DNA and free DNA were separated on native 7.5% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA), 300 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried, exposed to x-ray films, and bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram using a LKB laser densitometer. The monoclonal antibody against GST protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Jacketed cells of 2–5 mm were used, and typically 10 spectra were accumulated, averaged, and base line-corrected with a spectrum of buffer alone on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter interfaced to an Olidata personal computer. Calibration of the instrument was performed withd(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 290 nm. All spectra were collected at 10 ± 0.1 °C. Thermostability was controlled by a Haake F3 water bath. Spectra were recorded in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, KCl 50 mm. The expression construct producing HOXD9, as well as pT81luc and pTHCR reporter constructs, were described elsewhere (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The pSVHMGY expression construct was obtained subcloning a 1.7-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment containing the full-length murine HMGY cDNA (18Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the polylinker of pGDSV7 expression vector (42Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Gustincich S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 134-138PubMed Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure (43Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106/60-mm diameter culture dish. Precipitates, containing 1 μg of reporter plasmid, 7 μg of expression constructs, and 0.5 μg of pTK β-galactosidase expression vector as internal control, were applied to subconfluent cells for 16 h before changing medium. Total amounts of each plasmid were kept constant in all experiments, by adding the corresponding empty vectors. 48 h after transfection cells were harvested and lysed with Promega's lysis buffer. Luciferase enzyme assays were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, EG & G Berthold) according to manufacturer's instructions; fluorimetric β-galactosidase assays were performed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside (MUG-Sigma) as substrate (44Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity of the reporter vectors was then normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. To test whether HMGI proteins are able to interact with sequences recognized by HDs, the binding activity of recombinant HMGI-C and HMGY to several oligonucleotides containing the 5′-TAAT-3′ motif was evaluated. Results are shown in Fig. 1. The oligonucleotide PRDII contains two copies of the human interferon β promoter HMGI(Y) binding sequence (28Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and therefore provided a positive control. Both HMGI-C and HMGY efficiently recognize the oligonucleotide CAnt1, which is a dominant interaction site for both Antennapedia and EnHDs (45Damante G. Pellizzari L. Esposito G. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Fabbro D. Tell G. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding activity of both proteins requires the integrity of the 5′-TAAT-3′ motif. In fact, the oligonucleotide CAnt4, in which the 5′-TAAT-3′ motif has been changed to 5′-TAAG-3′, is no longer bound by either HMGI-C or HMGY. Both proteins are also able to interact with the NP oligonucleotide, which is a binding site for several HD-containing proteins (Ref. 46Hayashi S. Scott M.P. Cell. 1990; 63: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar and references therein). HMGI proteins may recognize only a subset of HDs binding sequences. In fact, neither HMGI-C nor HMGY are able to establish an efficient interaction with the oligonucleotide T109, which is recognized by both Antennapedia and EnHDs (data not shown). The evidence that HMGI proteins interact with some HD binding sequences would predict that this class of proteins and HDs may influence each other during the interaction to common sites. We have evaluated this possibility incubating together HDs and HMGI proteins with CAnt1 oligonucleotide. Results are shown in Fig.2. The presence of either HMGI-C or HMGY completely blocks the binding of EnHD. It has been demonstrated recently that HMG1, another member of the HMG family, is able to interact with HOX proteins in absence of DNA binding (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have tested whether the effect of HMGI proteins on HD binding requires HMGI/DNA interaction. As shown in Fig.3, HMGI-C is able to prevent the EnHD/CAnt1, but not the EnHD/T109 interaction. These data, along with our experimental observation that HMGI-C is not able to efficiently recognize the T109 oligonucleotide (see Fig. 1), indicate that the HMGI/DNA interaction is necessary to block the EnHD binding to DNA. These results indicate that the effect of HMGI proteins on HD/DNA binding is not due to direct protein-protein interactions. It is important to note that the inhibitory effect is observed at a HMGI-C protein/EnHD molar ratio of 1.8. Since HMGI proteins are present in the cell in large amounts (47Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the HMGI/EnHD molar ratio used should be lower than in the nucleus. This estimation suggests that the interference that we observe may occur in vivo. HDs contact DNA both in the major groove (by the recognition helix) and in the minor groove (by the NH2-terminal arm). The inhibitory effect of HMGI proteins, which interact with DNA only by minor groove contacts, could occur through a complex mechanism comprised of two molecular events. First, HMGI proteins gain access to DNA competing with the HDs NH2-terminal arm for the establishment of contacts in minor groove. Subsequently, the interaction of HMGI proteins modifies the DNA structure so that the HD/major groove interaction is less efficient, leading to the release of the whole HD from the DNA. The structural modifications of DNA which occur upon interaction with HMGI proteins could support the existence of the second mechanism (48Nissen M.S. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4355-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 49Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 50Brown D.G. Sanderson M.R. Skelly J.V. Jenkins T.C. Brown T. Garman E. Stuart D.I. Neidle S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis several experiments were performed. The gel, shown in A of Fig.4, demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of HMGI-C on the EnHD binding to CAnt1 occurs with the same efficiency when HMGI-C is added before or after the formation of the EnHD·DNA complex. Kinetic experiments revealed that HMGI-C inhibits EnHD binding in less than 10 s (data not shown). Panel B of Fig. 4 shows that when HMGI-C protein is used at a concentration in which the EnHD·CAnt1 oligonucleotide complex is still detectable, the half-life of the EnHD·CAnt1 complex is greatly reduced relative to that observed in the absence of HMGI-C protein. These data are compatible with a mechanism in which HMGI-C binds to the minor groove more efficiently than the NH2-terminal arm of EnHD, which is repelled by the presence of HMGI-C. Consequently, we hypothesize that the HMGI-C binding to the minor groove influences the structure of the major groove in a way that EnHD is no longer able to bind to the DNA. The drug berenil (Sigma) is able to interact with DNA into the minor groove but is not able to induce structural modifications on the bound DNA (51Gray D.M. Taylor T.N. Lang D. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that, even at very high concentrations, this drug is not able to affect HDs/DNA interactions (52Dorn A. Affolter M. Muller M. Gehring W.J. Leupin W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, berenil should compete with HMGI-C for the minor groove interaction and reduce the inhibitory effect of this protein on HD binding to DNA. The effect of berenil on the inhibition of EnHD binding to DNA by HMGI-C protein is shown in Fig.5. When used at a concentration of 800 μm, berenil determines only a modest reduction of EnHD binding to the CAnt1 sequence (compare lanes 2 and4). However, the abolition of EnHD-binding by HMGI-C protein is significantly reduced by the presence of berenil (comparelanes 3 and 5). These results indicate that the establishment of a minor groove interaction without modification of the DNA structure (such as what occurs with berenil treatment) is not able to prevent HDs from binding to DNA, supporting the model that structural changes of DNA mediate the inhibitory effect of HMGI proteins on HD-DNA interaction. To verify the structural modifications of DNA that could occur as a result of interaction with HMGI proteins, CD spectra of the HMGI-C·CAnt1 complex were recorded and compared with those of the CAnt1 oligonucleotide alone. Results are shown in Fig.6. Following the interaction with HMGI-C the long-wavelength positive CD band of DNA decreases with a shift in the 258 nm crossover to longer wavelength. These modifications are likely due to significant structural alterations of the CAnt1 oligonucleotide, since the CD spectrum of the protein shows no bands of absorption in the region above 240 nm (data not shown). Similar CD changes have been observed in compaction of the DNA into particlesin vitro, into phage heads or into nucleosomes (53Dorman B.P. Maestre M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 54Ivanov V.I. Minchenkova L.E. Minyat E.E. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Schyolkina A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 817-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 55Mandel R. Fasman G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). While we have demonstrated that structural modifications of the CAnt1 sequence occur upon HMGI-C binding, a more complete understanding of the reaction mechanism involved will necessitate higher resolution structural studies. Nevertheless, our CD data are compatible with the binding data shown in Figs. 4 and 5, suggesting that part of the HMGI-C inhibition of the EnHD-CAnt1 interaction is due to a structural modification of the DNA. To test whether the inhibitory effect of HMGI proteins on the HD-DNA interaction could have an in vivo relevance, we measured the effect of expression of HMGY on transcriptional activation induced by a HOX protein by co-transfection assay. As reported by Zappavigna et al. (37Zappavigna V. Renucci A. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Urier G. Peschle C. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the HOXD9gene product activates transcription binding to an autoregulatory element (HCR) deriving from its own promoter. The ∼100-base pair HCR element contains several 5′-TAAT-3′ motifs, which are binding sites for HOXD9 protein, possibly representing a target for a positive autoregulatory expression of HOX gene products. The oligonucleotide HCRII contains a 5′-TAAT-3′ motif whose mutation reduces the transcriptional effect of HOXD9 (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A of Fig.7 demonstrates that HMGY protein is able to interact with HCRII (lane 4). The retarded band shows a mobility higher than that due to the interaction of the GST-HOXD9 fusion protein with the HCRII oligonucleotide (lane 2). When both HMGY and GST-HOXD9 proteins are incubated with the oligonucleotide HCRII, only the high mobility band due to HMGY protein is detected (lane 5). To exclude that the retarded band observed in the presence of both HMGY and GST-HOXD9 is due to a trimeric complex containing both proteins, a co-incubation with a monoclonal antibody raised against the GST protein was performed. This antibody, which is able to induce a supershift when only the GST-HOXD9 protein is present (lane 3), is not able to produce any supershifted band in the presence of both GST-HOXD9 and HMGY proteins (lane 6). This result demonstrates that the retarded band, observed in the presence of both HMGY and GST-HOXD9 proteins, is due only to the former. To test if there could be a functional effect of HMGY binding to the 5′-TAAT-3′ motifs toward HOXD9-mediated activation of HCR, we then used an HCR-containing luciferase reporter: pTHCR (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), where the HCR element is fused to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. When pTHCR was co-transfected with different amounts of a construct expressing HOXD9 under the control of SV40 promoter, pSGD9, transcriptional activity was enhanced 4–5-fold over the basal level. Co-transfection of increasing amounts of pSGD9 in the presence of a fixed amount of pSVHMGY expressor construct, which produces HMGY protein under control of SV40 promoter, led to an inhibition, up to 50%, of HOXD9-mediated activation of HCR (Fig. 7 B), while transfection of pSVHMGY alone did not significantly reduce the basal activity of pTHCR. The control reporter pT81luc, lacking HCR sequence, was not affected by transfection of HOXD9 and HMGY constructs, alone or in combination. HMGI proteins do not require a precise sequence to efficiently interact with DNA, but they do require the presence of an AT-rich stretch (14Solomon M. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Geierstanger B.H. Volkman B.F. Kremer W. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5347-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This functional flexibility in terms of DNA binding could be explained by the evidence that HMGI proteins contact DNA in the minor groove, where the steric/electrostatic differences between base pairs are much less evident than those existing in the major groove (56Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Due to this DNA binding flexibility, it is not surprising that HMGI proteins are able to interact with DNA sequences that are binding sites for other DNA-binding proteins. Therefore, some of the effects of HMGI proteins on gene expression may be due to binding interference with other DNA-binding proteins, through a competition for common sites. Based on our results, the inhibitory effect of HMGI proteins on HD-DNA interaction could be described by a model in which three essential events occur: (i) HMGI proteins are able to interact with a DNA sequence already occupied by a HD-containing protein, displacing the NH2-terminal arm of the HD from the minor groove; (ii) during the interaction, HMGI proteins induce conformational changes to the DNA; (iii) these conformational changes are not compatible with an efficient HD/DNA interaction in the major groove, therefore the whole HD-containing protein is released from the DNA. A similar model has been suggested to explain the effect of distamycin A on the Antennapedia HD·DNA complex (52Dorn A. Affolter M. Muller M. Gehring W.J. Leupin W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has already been proposed that distamycin A and HMGI DNA binding domains have a similar planar crescent-shaped structure and can compete for the binding in the minor groove of AT-rich sequences (16Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that berenil, although interacting in minor groove, is not able to induce structural modifications to DNA and is not efficient in inhibiting the HD-DNA interaction, further supports our model. Crystallographic or NMR studies on HMGI proteins-DNA complexes are required to definitively prove the existence of HMGI protein-induced DNA modifications and to further test the validity of the model. Although several experimental results indicate HMGI proteins as factors able to enhance the DNA binding of other DNA-interacting proteins (28Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 29Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), some data have been published showing an inhibitory effect of HMGI proteins on DNA binding of other factors. A clear example of this phenomenon occurs in T cells at the level of the interleukin-4 promoter (57Klein-Henling S. Schneider C. Heinfling A. Chupvilo S. Serfling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15311-15316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, a high HMGI(Y) concentration, typical of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, is able to displace NF-AT factors from interleukin-4 promoter, reducing both its constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity. A negative effect of HMGI(Y) on the Ig heavy chain ε germ line RNA promoter has been also reported (27Kim J. Reeves R. Rothman P. Boothby M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 798-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this case, the inhibitory effect induced by HMGI(Y) appears to be mediated by the interaction of these proteins with a binding sequence for a STAT-like factor. A direct inhibition of Oct-1 protein DNA binding by HMGI(Y) has been also described (22Abdulkadir S.A. Krishna S. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Strominger J.L. Ono S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HMGI(Y) appears to exert distinct effects on the interaction of Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins with the octamer sequence. In fact, while Oct-1 binding is inhibited, the presence of HMGI(Y) enhances the Oct-2/octamer sequence interaction. Such a difference may suggest that the final outcome of HMGI proteins on the transcriptional activity of factors interacting with the same or nearby sequences is due to a combination of protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions. With regard to HD-containing proteins, Zappavigna et al. (40Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Catterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have recently reported that HMG1 is able to interact with HOX proteins, enhancing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This effect is mediated only via protein-protein interaction, since HMG1 alone is not able to bind to the HOX target sequence. We instead, using the same cellular system and the same vectors, show that HMGY is able to compete with HOXD9, hence mediating repression. Therefore, although opposite effects of HMG proteins on the DNA binding activity of transcriptional regulators have been reported, taken together these data point out the relevance of these architectural factors in the regulation of gene transcription. Several studies indicate that HD-containing proteins require regulatory events for a proper action. For instance, Castelli-Gair and Akam (58Castelli-Gair J. Akam M. Development (Camb .). 1995; 121: 2973-2982PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the Ultrabithorax protein elicits distinct effects in different spatial-temporal contexts of Drosophilaembryos. The ability of HMGI proteins to negatively affect the HD binding to some DNA target sequences could be one of the mechanisms by which the same HD-containing proteins are able to induce different effects depending on the context. One intriguing possibility is that HMGI proteins provide HD-containing proteins with a sort of regulatory switch. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the binding of HMGI proteins to DNA is regulated by phosphorylation (59Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of HMGI proteins induced by p34 cdc2 kinase greatly reduces their binding to DNA. Based on our experimental results, we hypothesize that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of HMGI proteins controls the access of HD-containing proteins to their DNA target sequences. We are grateful to Vincenzo Zappavigna (DIBIT, Milano, Italy) for kindly providing the HOXD9 expression vectors as well as the reporter constructs. We thank Luca Cattarossi for assistance with computer work and Wayne Newhauser and Andrea Keane-Mayers for their editorial comments."
https://openalex.org/W1984540730,"Vitamin D promotes differentiation of cells either by simply enhancing phenotypic gene expression and/or by suppressing expression of inhibitors of differentiation. Previously, we reported that expression of a gene encoding Id1, a negative type helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was transcriptionally suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) (1). To identify the sequence required for the negative regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3, a 1.5-kilobase 5′-flanking region of murine Id1 gene was examined by transiently transfecting luciferase reporter constructs into ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells. The transcriptional activity of this construct was repressed by 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3. Deletion analysis revealed that a 57-base pair (bp) upstream response sequence (URS) (−1146/−1090) was required for the suppression by 1,25(OH)2D3. This sequence conferred negative responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 to a heterologous SV40 promoter. The 57-bp URS contained not only Egr-1 consensus sequence (2) but also four direct repeats of a heptamer sequence (C/A)CAGCCC. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed that the 57-bp URS formed specific nuclear protein-DNA complexes, which were neither competed by previously known positive and negative vitamin D response elements nor supershifted by anti-vitamin D receptor antibody, suggesting the absence of vitamin D receptor in these complexes. These results indicate the involvement of the novel 57-bp sequence in the vitamin D suppression of Id1 gene transcription. Vitamin D promotes differentiation of cells either by simply enhancing phenotypic gene expression and/or by suppressing expression of inhibitors of differentiation. Previously, we reported that expression of a gene encoding Id1, a negative type helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was transcriptionally suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) (1).

Electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed that the 57-bp URS formed specific nuclear protein-DNA complexes, which were neither competed by previously known positive and negative vitamin D response elements nor supershifted by anti-vitamin D receptor antibody, suggesting the absence of vitamin D receptor in these complexes. These results indicate the involvement of the novel 57-bp sequence in the vitamin D suppression of Id1 gene transcription. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3; calcitriol), 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; LUC, luciferase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay(s); URS, upstream regulatory sequence(s); OPN, osteopontin; VDR, nuclear vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; PTH, parathyroid hormone; BSP, bone sialoprotein; kb, kilobase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; LUC, luciferase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay(s); URS, upstream regulatory sequence(s); OPN, osteopontin; VDR, nuclear vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; PTH, parathyroid hormone; BSP, bone sialoprotein; kb, kilobase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is not only a major calcitrophic hormone that controls systemic calcium metabolism but also a potent modulator of differentiation in several types of cells including osteoblasts (2Tournay O.

The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Many studies have revealed that the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D actions, including its promotion of cell differentiation, could be explained mainly by its genomic actions via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (4Haussler M.R.

VDR binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) within the promoter regions of the target genes to activate or suppress their expression. Several types of differentiation-related genes are regulated through this type of vitamin D action during cell differentiation. In addition, recent studies also showed the involvement of the nongenomic action of vitamin D in regulation of cell differentiation (9Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Vollberg T.M. Jetlen A.M. Mol.

For instance, monocyte differentiation was reported to be mediated by vitamin D without requiring binding to VDR (9Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and keratinocyte differentiation-related genes were shown to be stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 without the presence of VDRE (6Bouillon R.

Therefore, vitamin D could promote cell differentiation via both genomic and nongenomic actions (3Minghetti P.P. Norman A.W. The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 6Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W Endocr.

Norman A.W. The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Similarly to other types of cells, expression of various phenotype-related genes is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in osteoblasts (11Bikle D.D. Pillais S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 13-19Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prhal J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In parallel to its direct control of the genes encoding phenotype-related proteins in osteoblasts, we hypothesized that vitamin D may regulate higher order regulatory genes to modulate osteoblastic differentiation. We have shown that Id1, a dominant negative regulator of helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors (15Benezra R. Yan W. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), is expressed in osteoblasts and that its level is transcriptionally suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 (1Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because Id1 has been shown to be a negative modulator of positive regulatory transcription factor(s) that modulate cell differentiation, 1,25(OH)2D3could exert its effects on osteoblasts by suppressing expression of Id1. In the previous study, we have also shown that the suppression was specific to 1,25(OH)2D3 and was mediated at the level of gene transcription without requiring new protein synthesis (1Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism with which 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses Id1 gene transcription was still unknown.Ligand-dependent or -independent repression by nuclear hormone receptor superfamilies has been investigated (8Beato M.

However, the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression appear to be more complicated than those of transcriptional activation (22Hörlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B.

In some cases, to suppress expression of the target genes, hormones utilize the same or similar response elements as those used for transactivation (18Carr F.C. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, sequences different from the classical hormone response elements are utilized for negative regulation (16Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Johnson A.D.

Five cases of negative VDRE sequence were reported such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene, parathyroid hormone-related protein gene, interleukine-2 gene, bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene, and vitamin D receptor binding fragment-5, a negative vitamin D responsible gene isolated from rat genomic DNA (24Liu S.M.

However, because these repressive sequences are quite variable, consensus sequences have not been defined yet. Furthermore, molecular mechanisms of vitamin D repression of the genes encoding key molecules such as transcription factors involved in cell differentiation has not yet been clarified. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of Id1 gene expression, which could be an important step in cell differentiation, we investigated the 1,25(OH)2D3 effect on the transcriptional activity of the 1.5-kb promoter region of the Id1 gene and identified a sequence that is required for the 1,25(OH)2D3action.DISCUSSIONWe found that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerted its suppressive effect on Id1 gene transcription via the 57-bp upstream sequence of this gene (−1147/−1090, URS), which was able to confer the repressive response to 1,25(OH)2D3 to a heterologous SV40 promoter. This 57-bp URS shares its upstream boundary with the −1147/−1037 sequence (111 bp), which was reported to be fully active in mediating positive response to serum (2Tournay O. Benezra R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the 57-bp URS is 54 bp shorter than the −1147/−1037 fragment, and serum concentration did not alter the responsiveness of Id1 promoter to 1,25(OH)2D3, suggesting that the responsiveness of the 57-bp URS to 1,25(OH)2D3 is independent from the serum responsiveness, which requires the downstream 53-bp (−1089/−1037) sequence.The 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of Id1 promoter activity via the 57-bp URS represents a novel type of repressive vitamin D regulation, because it was completely different from all the six cases of 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent transcriptional repression (16Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Johnson A.D.

Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), especially in that it does not require direct binding of VDR. The absence of the direct binding of VDR to the 57-bp URS was supported by three different lines of observations on EMSA. First, the L and H complexes, which were formed by the binding of the 57-bp URS to the nuclear extracts prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells, were not competed out by any of the eight known VDREs. Secondly, the bands formed by the 57-bp URS and pig intestine nuclear extracts, which contain VDR and 9-cis retinoic acid receptor proteins, were not competed out by OPN-VDRE or PTH-VDRE. And thirdly, the patterns of these bands did not change in the presence of the two different types of anti-VDR antibodies, 10C6 (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) and 8C12 (data not shown). It may be possible that conformational changes of VDR might have occurred to abolish or mask the antibody recognition site by interacting with unknown cofactor proteins. However, the mobility of the DNA-protein complex formed by the 57-bp URS appeared to be faster than those formed by OPN-VDRE (Fig.7 B, lane 1 versus lane 7), suggesting that the components in the DNA-protein complex bound to the 57-bp URS would be different from those bound to OPN-VDRE.It has been also reported that the promoter DNA fragment of 24-hydroxylase gene does not bind to VDR to participate in vitamin D activation. However, coexistence of VDR binding site (classic type VDRE) in its proximity is necessary to be functional in this case (43Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M. Shinki T. Kato S. Suda T. Yamamoto O. Noshiro M. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In analogy to this type of regulation by vitamin D, we also tested the possibility that some kind of sequences that bind to VDR might also be involved in the case of transcriptional repression of Id1 gene. We found a VDRE-like consensus sequence (5′-GGTTCAgaaCGTTCA-3′) in a reverse direction at the position −66 to −52 in the Id1 promoter, which bound to VDR as confirmed by anti-VDR-antibody supershift experiments and OPN-VDRE competition assay in EMSA (data not shown). However, neither of the promoter constructs containing this sequence responded to 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2 A; see 5′-del3, 5, 6, 7, and 8), nor did the construct linking the two sequences (57-bp URS and −66/−52) together to the SV40 promoter-luciferase construct (PGV-P) indicate any sign of synergism (data not shown). In this regard, the 57-bp URS should be regarded as a novel type of DNA sequence, which by itself can confer responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 without association with VDRE consensus sequence. The vitamin D effect on Id1 gene could be regarded as a novel type of genomic action that is exerted without requiring new protein synthesis (1Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that does not require binding of VDR to the 57-bp sequence.The next problem to be solved is how vitamin D represses the Id1 gene expression via this sequence. Several possibilities could be proposed to be the candidate mechanism(s) to mediate vitamin D suppression. The first one is the involvement of additional nongenomic action of vitamin D. It has been reported that 1,25(OH)2D3 and other metabolites of vitamin D exert some part of their effects by binding to yet unidentified receptor(s) on the cell surface and by utilizing the phosphorylation pathway via activating protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which might cause changes in the transcriptional regulation of some genes (45Beno D.W.A. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Larkin J.D. Yeager M.D. Ho C. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6639-6643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This type of pathway might be involved in nongenomic action to regulate cell differentiation as reported in the case of monocyte differentiation (9Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 57-bp URS might also be utilized in a similar way to mediate vitamin D suppression of the expression of Id1 gene, although whether this is the case or not is still to be determined.The second possibility is the involvement of GC-rich region as a binding site for repressor protein(s). The mid-portion of the 57-bp URS, containing a Egr-1 consensus sequence (2Tournay O. Benezra R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a core region of Sp1 binding consensus sequence (38Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and a 12-bp sequence resembling the consensus sequence for WT1 (39Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was indicated to be required for vitamin D-mediated repression (57M, Table I). Because Egr-1, YY1, and WT1 are known to be able to act as repressor proteins (23Yen P.M. Liu Y. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this region might bind some of these repressor proteins to suppress Id1 gene expression. However, despite the requirement of the Egr-1 binding sequence for forming the L complex in EMSA (Fig. 5 A), preliminary experiments using anti-Egr-1, 2, 3, and 4 antibodies failed to show the presence of Egr-1 in the L complex (data not shown). This observation was consistent with the result of EMSA using nuclear extract with or without treatment of 1,25(OH)2D3 (data not shown), which is known to enhance Egr-1 expression (45Beno D.W.A. Brady L.M. Bissonnette M. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3642-3647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that other kinds of protein(s), which probably resemble Egr-1 or a novel member of Egr family proteins, might bind to this sequence to suppress the Id1 gene.The third possibility is the involvement of the heptamer sequences, Hep1–Hep4, located in the 57-bp URS. The sequence, (C/A)CAGCCC, which is assumed to be a consensus sequence for these heptamers, does not correspond to any known consensus sequences for transcription factors reported before. However, because we showed that the full-length 57-bp URS containing all of these heptamers was required for the formation of the L complex and for the vitamin D suppression (Table I), not only the GC-rich region but also the four repeated heptamer sequences, Hep1–Hep4, might be involved in binding of unknown nuclear proteins to exert 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent repression.Another possibility with regard to the mechanism of vitamin D suppression could be the presence of co-activator(s) or co-repressor(s), which do not bind firmly and thus could not be detected by EMSA. This speculation is based on the fact that no enhancement or shift of the bands was observed in EMSA using nuclear extracts regardless of the treatment of the cells with vitamin D (data not shown).In analogy to myogenesis (47Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1461-1479Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and neurogenesis (48Lee J.E. Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), Id1 has been hypothesized to be an inhibitor of a putative master gene, which might regulate expression of multiple target genes important for osteoblastic cell differentiation. However, it is not clear to what extent the vitamin D effect on the induction of cell differentiation is mediated by its suppressive effect on Id1 gene expression. Vitamin D also activates or suppresses quite a variety of genes related to the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation. Vitamin D enhances expression of c-fos, which is also related to osteoblastic differentiation (49Candeliere G.A. Jurtka P.W. Haussler M.R. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 584-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin D activates genes encoding growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein, insulin-like growth factor-I, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (3Minghetti P.P. Norman A.W. The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 50Wang D.S. Yamazaki K. Nohtomi K. Shizume K. Ohsumi K. Shibuya M. Demura H. Sato K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which have been reported to increase bone formation. However, these factors alone would not be sufficient to support complete differentiation process of osteoblasts. On the contrary, if the target of Id1, possibly a member of helix-loop-helix type transcription factor family, has a potential to support or activate differentiation of osteoblasts as a master regulatory molecule, the impact of the vitamin D suppression of Id1 would be significant in the differentiation of osteoblasts. Investigation is in progress in our laboratory to identify a repertoire of transcription factors in osteoblastic cells, which could be the targets of Id1 suppression (51Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 774-782Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

Many studies have revealed that the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D actions, including its promotion of cell differentiation, could be explained mainly by its genomic actions via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (4Haussler M.R.

VDR binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) within the promoter regions of the target genes to activate or suppress their expression. Several types of differentiation-related genes are regulated through this type of vitamin D action during cell differentiation. In addition, recent studies also showed the involvement of the nongenomic action of vitamin D in regulation of cell differentiation (9Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Vollberg T.M. Jetlen A.M. Mol.

For instance, monocyte differentiation was reported to be mediated by vitamin D without requiring binding to VDR (9Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and keratinocyte differentiation-related genes were shown to be stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 without the presence of VDRE (6Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Vollberg T.M. Jetlen A.M. Mol.

Therefore, vitamin D could promote cell differentiation via both genomic and nongenomic actions (3Minghetti P.P. Norman A.W. The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 6Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have been interested in the molecular mechanism of the differentiation of osteoblasts as one of the target cells of 1,25(OH)2D3 (3Minghetti P.P. Norman A.W. The FASEB Journal. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Similarly to other types of cells, expression of various phenotype-related genes is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in osteoblasts (11Bikle D.D. Pillais S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 13-19Google Scholar, 12Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prhal J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In parallel to its direct control of the genes encoding phenotype-related proteins in osteoblasts, we hypothesized that vitamin D may regulate higher order regulatory genes to modulate osteoblastic differentiation. We have shown that Id1, a dominant negative regulator of helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors (15Benezra R. Yan W.

https://openalex.org/W2056079442,"The promoter regions of both the interferon regulatory factor (IRF1) and p53 antioncogenes contain a previously unidentified sequence denoted IRF1 p53 common sequence (IPCS), which markedly increases the transcriptional activity of a reporter gene placed under the control of an heterologous promoter in transfected U937 cells. In contrast, transfection of U937 cells with reporter vectors containing p53 and IRF1 promoters with mutated IPCS sites resulted in a 4-fold reduction in the constitutive expression of those two genes. The transcriptional activity of IPCS is strictly correlated with the binding of a novel nuclear factor, IPCS-binding factor (IPCS-BF). IPCS-BF, which is composed of a single polypeptide of 26 kDa, is present constitutively in nuclear extracts of both U937 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. The finding that the pattern of binding of IPCS-BF to the IPCS is unlike that of any known transcription factor and that the IPCS sequence does not exhibit any significant homology with any known binding site present in the data base, strongly suggest that IPCS-BF is a novel transcription factor which, by virtue of this ability to regulate the expression of the p53 and IRF1 genes, could play a central role in the control of cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.

Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently detected in a number of different types of human tumors, and the results of numerous studies suggest that inactivation or alteration in the expression of p53 gene is a critical step leading to neoplastic transformation (1Ditmer D.

Sato S. Cancer Lett. 1994; 82: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of p53 protein remains unclear, the results of recent studies suggest that it plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of the genome (3Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). This function includes the induction of growth arrest at the G1/S check point of the cell cycle and the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to various DNA damaging agents (4Kastan M.B. Onyekwere 0. Sidransky D. Voglestein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 5Demers G.W. Foster S.A. Halbert C.L. Galloway D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The wild-type p53 protein acts as a transcriptional activator (7Field S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) that binds to and stimulates promoters containing the p53 binding site. Thus, p53 induces the expression of various cellular genes involved in cell cycle control (8el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.T. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

The interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRF1, interferon regulatory factor 1; IFN, interferon; GAS, γ-interferon-activating sequence; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyrudine; IR, IFN response element; IPCS, IRF1 p53 common sequence; BF, binding factor; PBL, peripheral blood leukocyte; luc, luciferase; bp, base pair(s). gene was described initially as a positive transcription factor involved in the regulation of the expression of both the IFN-α/β genes (12Fujita T. Sakakibara J. Sudo Y. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and IFN-inducible genes (13Pine R. Decker D. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2448-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and hence in the cellular response to virus infections. More recently, it has been suggested by several authors that IRF1 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene (15Harada H. Takahashi E.I. Itoh S. Harada K. Hori T.A. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IRF1 belongs to the IRF family of transcription factors, which includes IRF2, ICSBP, IRF3, and ISGF3γ (17Au W.C. Moor P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The IRF1 DNA binding motif is present in at least two different transcriptional regulatory sequences, the positive regulatory domain I involved in the regulation of the expression of the IFN-β gene and the interferon-stimulated responsive element, present in the promoters of genes the expression of which is induced by the type I IFNs (13Pine R. Decker D. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2448-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Among the genes which contain a binding site for IRF1 in their promoter region, increased transcription of none of these genes can adequately explain the antioncogenic effects of IRF1, with the possible exception of the increase activity of protein kinase R gene, which is involved in the activation of NFkB and the inhibition of cell proliferation (18Kirchhoff S. Kormomilas A.E. Schaper F. Grashoff M. Sonenberg N. Hauser H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 439-445PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown experimentally, however, that IRF1 plays a role in apoptosis (19Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T.

Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and in cell cycle control (16Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, chromosomal deletion or inactivation of one of both copies of the IRF1 gene is frequently detected in human leukemias or in the preleukemic syndrome (22Taniguchi T. Harada H. Lamphier M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and more recently the presence of IRF1 has been shown to be essential for “DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest” (23Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Nozawa H. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Aizawa S. Tokino T. Oren M. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1996; 382: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The expression of p53 is inducible by a number of different stimuli. This property is due to the presence of several different regulatory elements within the p53 promoter. In particular the p53 promoter contains a genotoxic stress response sequence, extending from −70 to −40 (24Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), c-Myc-Max heterodimers binds to a basic helix-loop-helix site (25Roy B. Beamon J. Balint E. Reisman D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7805-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and a putative binding site for IRF1 (26Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). More recently, two overlapping binding sites for NF1 and YY1 have been identified in the region which spans positions −227 to −194 of the p53 promoter, indicating that this region is also implicated in the constitutive expression of the p53 gene (27Furlong E.E.M. Rein T. Martin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5933-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Expression of the IRF1 gene is strongly induced by both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ. This property is due to the presence of a regulatory element called IR (inverse repeat) within the IRF1 promoter (28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This sequence includes a GAS element (γ-interferon-activating sequence), which binds the homodimer STAT1/STAT1 following activation by IFN-γ. In addition, the IR can bind the heterodimer STAT1/STAT2 following induction with IFN-α (29Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell J.E. Stark G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, both the STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer and the STAT1/STAT1 homodimer can bind the IR sequence and strongly transactivate IRF1 expression (15Harada H. Takahashi E.I. Itoh S. Harada K. Hori T.A. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several putative Sp1 sites have been identified in the IRF1 promoter, which could be involved in the basal transcriptional activity of this gene (21Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar,28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The p53 and IRF1 promoters also contain NFkB sites (28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Wu X.W. Levine L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), conferring upon each gene inductibility by a variety of different agents such as oxidative stress, cytokines such as interleukin-1β, or tumor necrosis factor-α. In addition, expression of these two genes is constitutive and ubiquitous in the quasi-totality of untransformed tissues (22Taniguchi T. Harada H. Lamphier M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Another common feature of the two genes is the absence of TATA boxes (28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Lamb P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the p53 and IRF1 genes possess a certain number of similarities both in the manner in which their expression is regulated and in their functions, suggesting that under certain circumstances the products of both genes may be required simultaneously within the cell. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the promoter regions of both genes for the presence of common putative regulatory sequences. We have identified a sequence within the promoter region of the p53 gene which exhibits a strong homology with a sequence overlapping the IR element of the IRF1 promoter. The results of the experiments presented herein show that the sequence contained within the p53 promoter is not inducible, however, by either IFN-α/β or IFN-γ. These studies have led to the identification of a new transcription factor, denoted IPCS-BF (IRF1 p53 common sequence binding factor), which is present constitutively under physiological conditions in normal cells, and the presence of which is necessary for the basal and induced transcriptional activity of both the p53 and IRF1 genes. U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593) derived from a human hystiocytic lymphoma (33Sundström C. Nilson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were treated with recombinant human IFN-α2 (IntronA), a generous gift from Schering-Plow, or IFN-γ purchased from R&D Systems, at the concentrations indicated in the text. Human PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the procedure described by Osborn et al.(34Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 20 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and antipain). Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice, and the cellular lysate was vortexed briefly and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, together with the same protease inhibitors as described above), and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, mixed briefly, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then added to an equal volume of storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, together with the same protease inhibitors as described above) and then stored at −70 °C. Synthetic double stranded oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) by “filling-in” with Sequenase, and then purified on Sephadex G-50. The protein-DNA binding reactions for the identification of STAT1/STAT1 or STAT1/STAT2 complexes were carried out using 5 μg of nuclear extract and 0.1 fmol of probe in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 20 min at 20 °C. The other EMSAs shown in this study were carried out using the same conditions except that the KCl and the poly(dI-dC) concentration used were 25 mm and 25 μg/ml, respectively. The reaction mixture was then electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Competition experiments were carried out using a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probe. The following oligonucleotides (and their complementary strands) were used in these studies: IPCS-IRF1, 5′-AGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGCACGCAGCC-3′; IPCS-p53, 5′-AATGCAGGATTCCTCCAAAATGATTTCCAC-3′; p53-A, 5′-AAAATGATTTCCAC-3′; IRF1-A, 5′-GAAATGACGGCACG-3′; M-385, 5′-AGAATGATTTCCAC-3′; M-384, 5′-AAGATGATTTCCAC-3′; M-383, 5′-AAAGTGATTTCCAC-3′; M-382, 5′-AAAACGATTTCCAC-3′; M-381, 5′-AAAATAATTTCCAC-3′; M-380, 5′-AAAATGGTTTCCAC-3′; and M-376, 5′-AAAATGATTTACAC-3′. The IPCS-p53-luc, IPCS-p53-A-luc, and M382-luc were constructed by cloning, respectively, the following synthetic double stranded oligonucleotides: 5′-AATGCAGGATTCCTCCAAAATGATTTCCAC-3′, 5′-AAAATGATTTCCAC-3′, and 5′-AAAACGATTTCCAC-3′ in the XhoI/BglII site of the pGL2-promoter vector (Promega). The p53-luc and IRF1-luc constructs plasmids were produced by PCR amplification from human genomic DNA (CLONTECH) using the following primers: p53S(−950), 5′-taccctcgagTTCCCATCAAGCCCTAGG-3′; p53-AS(−89), 5′-ggatccagatctGCTCTAGACTTTTGAGAAGC-3′; IRF-1S(−609), 5′-taccctcgaGCTTTCTGCCTCCTTCACTTCC-3′; and IRF-1AS(+7), 5′-acgtaagatctGCCAGGGCAGCGGCGCCACCGA-3′. The products of amplification were then cloned in theXhoI/BglII site of the pGL2-basic vector (Promega). The integrity of each construct was verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of the p53 and IRF-1 promoters was undertaken using a modification of the procedure described by Ho et al. (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping fragments of one promoter subcloned in pGL2-basic vector were amplified in two separate PCRs. The first reaction used a flanking primer that hybridized on the vector at the 5′ end of the insert sequence, and one internal primer that hybridized at the site of the mutation and contained the mismatched base. The second reaction employed one flanking primer that hybridized on the vector at the 3′ end of the insert sequence, and an internal primer that overlapped the site mutation and also contained the mismatched base. The primers on the vector are: pGL2S, 5′-TTCCGATTTAGTGCTTTACGGCAC-3′; pGL2AS and 5′-CTTCCATTTTACCAACAGTACCGG-3′. The following primers were used for the mutagenesis of the p53 promoter: p53MS 5′-CCAAAAGTCGTTCCACCAATTCTGC-3′ and p53MAS 5′-GGTGGAACGACTTTTGGAGGAATCCTGC-3′ and for the mutagenesis of the IRF-1 promoter: IRF-1MS, 5′-CCGAATTCACGGCACGCAGC-3′ and IRF-1MAS 5′-CGTGAATTCGGGGAAATCAG-3′. As the two fragments generated by the first PCR are overlapping, they are “fused” by denaturing and annealing them in a subsequent primer extension reaction. Finally the “fusion” product was amplified by PCR using the flanking primers pGL2S and pGL2AS. The product of this PCR was then digested withXhoI and BglII and subcloned in an empty pGL2-basic vector at the XhoI and BglII site. The integrity of all these constructs was verified by sequencing. U937 cells were transfected with DNA by electroporation. Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Each sample contained 10 μg of DNA with 5 × 106 cells in a volume of 800 μl. Cells were electroporated in a 1-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 960 μF. Cells were cultivated in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Alternatively, cells were treated with recombinant human IFN-α2 or IFN-γ, at the concentrations and the time indicated in the text. The cells were harvested 8 h after transfection, and the level of luciferase activity was determined. Ten ml of cell suspension were centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm, and the cell pellet was then lysed with 100 μl of luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). The lysate was then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, and 30 μl of this supernatant were then assayed for luciferase activity in the presence of 70 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mmTricine, 1 mmMgCO3Mg(OH)25H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm DTT, 470 μm luciferin (Sigma), and 530 μm ATP (Pharmacia). The chemioluminescence produced during the first 10 s of the reaction was determined using a luminometer (Luminometer 1250, BioOrbite). The luciferase activity of each extract was then normalized with respect to protein concentration determined by the Coomassie assay (Pierce). All the data presented in the text represent the mean of at least three independent transfections. The UV cross-linking experiment was performed with minor modifications of a procedure reported previously (36Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reaction were first set up as described above, with two probes IPCS-p53, one differing from the other on the strand where all the T residue were substituted with BrdUrd. The mixture of U937 cell nuclear extract and probes were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was covered with Saran Wrap and irradiated on ice with a UV-B source for 30 min. The bound and free DNAs were located by autoradiography, excised, and added to SDS-sample buffer. The sample were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% gel. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the IRF1 and p53 promoters led to the identification of a 24-bp sequence present within each promoter exhibiting a common sequence homology of approximately 70%. This sequence, denoted IPCS (IRF-1 p53 common sequence), is located at positions −399 to −376, relative to the transcription start site, within the promoter of the p53 gene (IPCS-p53) (32Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and at positions −130 to −107 within the IRF1 promoter (IPCS-IRF1). The IPCS encompasses the previously defined IR sequence present within the IRF1 promoter (28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although the consensus binding sequence of IR has not been precisely defined, the degree of sequence homology shared by the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 sequences is such that IPCS-p53 would be expected to be able to bind the STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer and/or STAT1/STAT1 homodimer, the dimerization of which is induced respectively by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (29Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell J.E. Stark G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was also supported by the fact that IPCS-p53 strictly respects the GAS consensus sequence (TTNCNNNAA). To test this assumption, EMSAs were carried out using two probes derived from the IPCS element of the p53 and IRF1 genes, termed IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1, respectively. This study was carried out using the IFN-sensitive U937 promonocytic cell line, which constitutively expresses both the IRF1 (37Beretta L. Gabbay M. Berger R. Hanash S. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1593-1596PubMed Google Scholar) and p53 gene products (38Hawker K.L. Vass J.K. Ozanne B.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 283-292PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of untreated U937 cells, or U937 cells treated with 1000 IU of IFN-α or IFN-γ, for 1 h, were tested in an EMSA for the presence of complexes able to bind the 33-bp IPCS-IRF1 probe derived from the sequence present within the IRF1 promoter. The IPCS-IRF1 probe was found to bind proteins induced by IFN-α or IFN-γ which, on the basis of the low mobility of the protein-DNA complexes formed (28Sims S.H. Ch Y. Romine M. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), are likely to represent STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer and STAT1/STAT1 homodimer respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 3). In contrast, the 30-bp IPCS-p53 probe, derived from the homologous sequence present within the p53 promoter, was unable, however, to bind any induced complex (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and6). These results clearly eliminate the hypothesis that the IPCS-p53 sequence acts as an IFN-responsive element. The high degree of similarity between the electrophoretic pattern of two constitutive complexes (denoted complex A and complex B in Fig. 2) detected by the two probes suggests, however, the existence of constitutive transcription factors common to both genes. Thus, nuclear extracts from untreated U937 cells were analyzed by EMSA in an attempt to identify nuclear factors that could bind to both the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes. Competition experiments indicated that only complex B, detected with the labeled IPCS-p53 probe, is displaced by a 50-fold excess of either the IPCS-p53 or IPCS-IRF1 unlabeled probes (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and3). Similar results were obtained using the labeled IPCS-IRF1 probe (Fig. 3, lane 5 and 6). We therefore denoted complex B the IPCS-binding factor. Complex A detected by both the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes was found to be nonspecific, as it was not displaced by a 50-fold excess of either the IPCS-p53 or IPCS-IRF1 unlabeled probes. To increase the efficiency of binding of IPCS-BF to the probes, the incubation buffer of EMSA shown in Fig. 3was modified relative to the previous experiment (Fig. 2), the decrease in the concentration of poly(dI-dC) did, however, result in increased nonspecific binding at the top of the gel (Fig. 3). Thus, the constitutive IPCS-BF complex, is the only complex present in the nuclear extracts of U937 cell, which is formed specifically, with both the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes. To determine the minimal binding site of IPCS-BF, the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes were radiolabeled and used in EMSA competition experiments with unlabeled probes from the two conserved regions shared by the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 sequences (Fig. 4 A). The first region contains 16 or 14 bp which encompass the GATTNC motif and which are present in the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes, respectively (these fragments are termed IPCS-p53B and IPCS-IRF1B). The second region contains 14 or 13 bp, comprising the AAATGA motif, which are present in the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes, respectively. These sequences are denoted p53-A and IRF1-A. The IPCS-BF complex formed on the IPCS-p53 or IPCS-IRF1 probes, with nuclear extracts from U937 cells, is displaced by an excess of the unlabeled p53-A and IRF1-A probes, respectively (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 6). Neither the p53B nor IRF1B elements competed, respectively, with the IPCS-p53 and IPCS-IRF1 probes for binding of IPCS-BF (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and5). These results indicate that IPCS-BF binds to a sequence containing the AAATG motif, which is shared by the p53-A and IRF1-A probes. This motif overlaps the 3′ end of the IR sequence within the IRF1 promoter, and consequently constitutes a DNA binding sequence independent of IR. To further characterize the binding of IPCS-BF to IPCS, we synthesized a set of probes containing point mutations (TableI) for use in competition experiments. EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from U937 cells using either the p53-A or IRF1-A sequences as a probe. Each position within p53-A was mutated. Unlabeled probes containing point mutations were used as competitors for the binding of IPCS-BF to the p53-A or IRF1-A labeled probes in EMSA reactions (Fig. 5,A and B). Point mutations that compete little or not at all with the labeled p53-A or IRF1-A probes were considered to represent important positions for binding of IPCS-BF to its recognition sequence. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. Mutations of any one nucleotide in the AAATG motif significantly decreased the ability of the sequence to compete for the binding of IPCS-BF to either the p53-A or IRF1-A wild type probes (Fig. 5,A and B). The results of competition analysis show that the adenine at position −384 within the AAATG motif appears to be less important than the other residues for the binding of IPCS-BF. The cytidine at position −376, which is shared by both wild type probes, is also implicated in the binding of IPCS-BF to the p53-A or IRF1-A sequences, albeit in a less critical manner. The results of competition experiments between the p53-A and IRF1-A sequences showed that nucleotides, which are not common to both the p53-A and IRF1-A probes, had no significant effect on the binding of IPCS-BF. Mutation of the nucleotide at position −380 had no effect in competition experiments on the binding of IPCS-BF to the wild-type probes. In addition, none of the wild or mutated probes displaced any of the nonspecific complexes, confirming the high degree of specificity of the binding of IPCS-BF to DNA.Table ICharacterization of the binding of IPCS-BF to IPCSProbeSequencesCompetition bindingp53-AAAAATGATTTCCAC+M-385AGAATGATTTCCAC−M-384AAGATGATTTCCAC+/−M-383AAAGTGATTTCCAC−M-382AAAACGATTTCCAC−M-381AAAATAATTTCCAC−M-380AAAATGGTTTCCAC+IRF1-AGAAATGACGGCACG+M-376AAA"

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; G-protein, GTP-binding regulatory protein; GIRK, G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel; carbachol, carbamylcholine chloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. 1The abbreviations used are: mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; G-protein, GTP-binding regulatory protein; GIRK, G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel; carbachol, carbamylcholine chloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate multiple effector molecules such as the GIRK family of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and the enzymes adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. Acetylcholine released from parasympathetic neurons binds to mAChRs in the heart, resulting in a negative chronotropic response. There are five subtypes of mAChR, which are the products of different genes; the decrease in heart rate is caused by the activation of m2 subtype of mAChR in mammalian heart and both m2 and m4 subtypes in chick heart (1Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 2Tietje K.M. Goldman P.S. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

The negative chronotropic response is due in part to the activation of IKACh, an outward K+ current that hyperpolarizes the cell in the sinus node of the atrium. IKACh is activated directly by pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G-proteins coupled to m2 and m4 muscarinic receptors without the mediation of second messengers (4Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B. Nature. 1985; 317: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). IKACh is due to an assembly of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels comprising two subunits, GIRK1 and GIRK4 (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar).The number of mAChRs expressed in cardiac cells can be regulated by the continued presence of agonist. Persistent activation of cardiac mAChRs leads to receptor sequestration (6Galper J.B. Dziekan L.C. O'Hara D.S. Smith T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10344-10356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduction in total receptor number (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and decreased transcription of the mAChR genes (8Habecker B.A. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5030-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequestration of mAChRs occurs within seconds to minutes and involves internalization of receptors from the cell surface (9Klein W.L. Nathanson N.M. Nirenberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Prolonged agonist exposure (hours) results in a decrease in mAChR number and recovery requiresde novo protein synthesis (10Harden T.K. Petch L.A. Traynelis S.F. Waldo G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13060-13066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taylor J.E. El-Fakahany E. Richelson E.

Another consequence of continued mAChR activation is a decrease in transcription of mAChR genes. In chick heart, both m2 and m4 mAChR mRNA are decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner (8Habecker B.A. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5030-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This regulation of mAChR mRNA is dependent on both the activation of phospholipase C and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (13Habecker B.A. Wang H. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These decreases in receptors at the cell surface and in gene expression result in a reduced physiological response to subsequent receptor stimulation.Although many G-protein-coupled receptors exhibit agonist-induced decreases in expression, little information is available on the consequences of receptor stimulation on effector expression. In this study, we determined the effects of mAChR activation in vivoon the expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNA and GIRK1 protein in chick atria and ventricles.DISCUSSIONThe chick embryo is a convenient system for studying the regulation of the mAChR and effector molecules in vivo. At day 9, the embryonic chick heart beats spontaneously but has not developed functional parasympathetic or sympathetic innervation (20Pappano A. Loffelholz K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1974; 191: 468-478PubMed Google Scholar). The atria have functional mAChRs and respond to cholinergic agonists. Drugs administered to the embryo on the embryonic membrane are readily absorbed and do not disrupt the embryonic membranes or vascular system. This system has been used previously to demonstrate agonist induced decreases in mAChR number and function in vivo (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used this system to demonstrate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are differentially expressed in atria and ventricles and that activation of mAChRs in the heart leads to decreased GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNAin vivo.Both solution hybridization and immunoblot analysis demonstrate that GIRK1 is expressed at higher levels in atria than in ventricles, consistent with previous Northern blot analysis (14Gadbut A.P. Riccardi D. Wu L. Hebert S.C. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6398-6402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). GIRK4, as in mammalian heart (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), is only detected in chick atria. This differential expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 is consistent with cardiac physiology; muscarinic agonists cause activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels in atria but not in ventricles. Native mAChR-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels in heart are heteromultimers of GIRK1 and GIRK4 (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Expression of cloned GIRK1 alone does not produce functional channels, and expression of GIRK4 alone results in currents unlike native atrial inwardly rectifying K+ channels (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The lack of mAChR-activated K+currents in chick ventricles is thus most likely a result of the inability of the low level of GIRK1 polypeptide to form a functional mAChR-gated K+ channel without its partner, GIRK4.We have shown here that sustained activation of atrial mAChR in vivo can decrease the expression levels of GIRK1 mRNA and GIRK4 mRNA in a time and dose-dependent manner. These decreases are reversible when further mAChR stimulation is blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. In addition, GIRK1 protein levels are also decreased in atria upon activation of mAChRs in vivo. This is the first direct demonstration of the down-regulation of a G-protein-coupled effector molecule by receptor activation in ovo. Although a preliminary report in abstract form (21Gadbut A.P. Wu L. Pan C.C. Wang G.K. Fadous S. Galper J.B. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1022Crossref Google Scholar) has reported a transient decrease in GIRK1 mRNA in cultured atrial cells after carbachol treatment, the results here demonstrate large and long lasting decreases in the levels of GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNA as well as GIRK1 polypeptide levels after persistent mAChR activation in vivo. Interestingly, no decrease is detected in GIRK1 mRNA expression in ventricles after prolonged agonist treatment.The differential regulation of GIRK1 mRNA expression in atria but not ventricles could be explained by a lack of activation of mAChRs expressed in ventricles. The data presented here contradict this explanation. The number of mAChR binding sites decreases in both atria and ventricles after in ovo carbachol treatment of chick embryos (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary heart cell cultures, comprising both atrial and ventricular cells, display a decrease in mAChR gene expression with carbachol treatment (8Habecker B.A. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5030-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, in this paper, we show similar decreases in m2 mAChR mRNA expression in both atria and ventricles after in ovo treatment with muscarinic agonist. These results indicate that carbachol can activate both atrial and ventricular muscarinic receptors after in ovo administration as measured by a decrease in receptor number (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a decrease in m2 mAChR mRNA. Combined with the previous data, our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying regulation of mAChR and GIRK1 mRNA are different and that the regulatory mechanisms necessary for GIRK1 mRNA down-regulation in atria are not present in ventricles.The mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of GIRK expression are not yet known. The decreases in levels of mRNAs encoding GIRK1 and GIRK4 could be caused by either a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional mechanism. The regulation of GIRK1 expression in atria but not ventricles could be caused by differential activation of the appropriate signal transduction pathway by muscarinic receptors in these cell types. However, muscarinic agonists cause both inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase C activities to similar extents in embryonic chick atria and ventricles (22Martin J.M. Subers E.M. Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 240: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, 23Barnett J.V. Shamah S.M. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Galper J.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that this possibility may not be likely. Because, as indicated above, muscarinic agonists cause activation of GIRK channel activity only in atria but not ventricle, it is possible that channel activation leads by an as yet unknown mechanism to decreased channel expression. Other possibilities that could be responsible for the tissue-specific differences in channel regulation include differences in the start sites of transcription in atria and ventricles, rendering the GIRK1 promoter sensitive or resistant, respectively, to muscarinic agonists, or differential expression of a second messenger-regulated protein, which regulates the rate of degradation of GIRK1 mRNA.These decreases in GIRK mRNA and protein represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of cellular responses after chronic receptor stimulation. There are no reports to date demonstrating the regulation of the mRNAs encoding other effectors after activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Persistent activation of the Gq-coupled m3 mAChR in HT-29 cells caused down-regulation of mAChR number without changing NaF-mediated activation of phospholipase C, suggesting that the expression of phospholipase C was not altered by agonist treatment (24Kopp R. Mayer P. Pfeiffer A. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Long term activation of Gi-coupled receptors on neural or other cell types, including cardiac cells, can lead to increased activity (“supersensitization”) of adenylyl cyclase (25Linden J. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This increased adenylyl cyclase activity has also been shown to occur using transient transfection of cloned adenylyl cyclase expressed in COS-7 cells (26Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but the mechanism responsible for this supersensitization remains unknown.GIRK1 and GIRK4 are also expressed in the brain (27Karschin C. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. Lester H. Davidson N. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Spauschus A. Lenters K.U. Wischmeyer E. Dissman E. Karschin C. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 930-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may form heteromultimers with other members of the GIRK family, GIRK2 and GIRK3 (29Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), to produce receptor-mediated changes in K+conductance. Other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as opioid (30Henry D.J. Grandy K.S. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar), cannabinoid (31Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and serotonin (27Karschin C. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. Lester H. Davidson N. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) receptors, have been demonstrated to couple to the activation of GIRK1-containing potassium channels. This G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated down-regulation of GIRK1 and GIRK4 could represent an important pathway for regulating physiological responses in the heart and the nervous system. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; G-protein, GTP-binding regulatory protein; GIRK, G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel; carbachol, carbamylcholine chloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. 1The abbreviations used are: mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; G-protein, GTP-binding regulatory protein; GIRK, G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel; carbachol, carbamylcholine chloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate multiple effector molecules such as the GIRK family of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and the enzymes adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C.

In this study, we determined the effects of mAChR activation in vivoon the expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNA and GIRK1 protein in chick atria and ventricles. DISCUSSIONThe chick embryo is a convenient system for studying the regulation of the mAChR and effector molecules in vivo. At day 9, the embryonic chick heart beats spontaneously but has not developed functional parasympathetic or sympathetic innervation (20Pappano A. Loffelholz K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1974; 191: 468-478PubMed Google Scholar). The atria have functional mAChRs and respond to cholinergic agonists. Drugs administered to the embryo on the embryonic membrane are readily absorbed and do not disrupt the embryonic membranes or vascular system. This system has been used previously to demonstrate agonist induced decreases in mAChR number and function in vivo (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used this system to demonstrate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are differentially expressed in atria and ventricles and that activation of mAChRs in the heart leads to decreased GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNAin vivo.Both solution hybridization and immunoblot analysis demonstrate that GIRK1 is expressed at higher levels in atria than in ventricles, consistent with previous Northern blot analysis (14Gadbut A.P. Riccardi D. Wu L. Hebert S.C. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6398-6402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). GIRK4, as in mammalian heart (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), is only detected in chick atria. This differential expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 is consistent with cardiac physiology; muscarinic agonists cause activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels in atria but not in ventricles. Native mAChR-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels in heart are heteromultimers of GIRK1 and GIRK4 (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Expression of cloned GIRK1 alone does not produce functional channels, and expression of GIRK4 alone results in currents unlike native atrial inwardly rectifying K+ channels (5Krapavinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman D. Velimirovic B. Krapavinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The lack of mAChR-activated K+currents in chick ventricles is thus most likely a result of the inability of the low level of GIRK1 polypeptide to form a functional mAChR-gated K+ channel without its partner, GIRK4.We have shown here that sustained activation of atrial mAChR in vivo can decrease the expression levels of GIRK1 mRNA and GIRK4 mRNA in a time and dose-dependent manner. These decreases are reversible when further mAChR stimulation is blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. In addition, GIRK1 protein levels are also decreased in atria upon activation of mAChRs in vivo. This is the first direct demonstration of the down-regulation of a G-protein-coupled effector molecule by receptor activation in ovo. Although a preliminary report in abstract form (21Gadbut A.P. Wu L. Pan C.C. Wang G.K. Fadous S. Galper J.B. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1022Crossref Google Scholar) has reported a transient decrease in GIRK1 mRNA in cultured atrial cells after carbachol treatment, the results here demonstrate large and long lasting decreases in the levels of GIRK1 and GIRK4 mRNA as well as GIRK1 polypeptide levels after persistent mAChR activation in vivo. Interestingly, no decrease is detected in GIRK1 mRNA expression in ventricles after prolonged agonist treatment.The differential regulation of GIRK1 mRNA expression in atria but not ventricles could be explained by a lack of activation of mAChRs expressed in ventricles. The data presented here contradict this explanation. The number of mAChR binding sites decreases in both atria and ventricles after in ovo carbachol treatment of chick embryos (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary heart cell cultures, comprising both atrial and ventricular cells, display a decrease in mAChR gene expression with carbachol treatment (8Habecker B.A. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5030-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, in this paper, we show similar decreases in m2 mAChR mRNA expression in both atria and ventricles after in ovo treatment with muscarinic agonist. These results indicate that carbachol can activate both atrial and ventricular muscarinic receptors after in ovo administration as measured by a decrease in receptor number (7Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7941-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a decrease in m2 mAChR mRNA. Combined with the previous data, our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying regulation of mAChR and GIRK1 mRNA are different and that the regulatory mechanisms necessary for GIRK1 mRNA down-regulation in atria are not present in ventricles.The mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of GIRK expression are not yet known. The decreases in levels of mRNAs encoding GIRK1 and GIRK4 could be caused by either a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional mechanism. The regulation of GIRK1 expression in atria but not ventricles could be caused by differential activation of the appropriate signal transduction pathway by muscarinic receptors in these cell types. However, muscarinic agonists cause both inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase C activities to similar extents in embryonic chick atria and ventricles (22Martin J.M. Subers E.M. Halvorsen S.W. Nathanson N.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 240: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, 23Barnett J.V. Shamah S.M. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Galper J.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that this possibility may not be likely. Because, as indicated above, muscarinic agonists cause activation of GIRK channel activity only in atria but not ventricle, it is possible that channel activation leads by an as yet unknown mechanism to decreased channel expression. Other possibilities that could be responsible for the tissue-specific differences in channel regulation include differences in the start sites of transcription in atria and ventricles, rendering the GIRK1 promoter sensitive or resistant, respectively, to muscarinic agonists, or differential expression of a second messenger-regulated protein, which regulates the rate of degradation of GIRK1 mRNA.These decreases in GIRK mRNA and protein represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of cellular responses after chronic receptor stimulation. There are no reports to date demonstrating the regulation of the mRNAs encoding other effectors after activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Persistent activation of the Gq-coupled m3 mAChR in HT-29 cells caused down-regulation of mAChR number without changing NaF-mediated activation of phospholipase C, suggesting that the expression of phospholipase C was not altered by agonist treatment (24Kopp R. Mayer P. Pfeiffer A. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Long term activation of Gi-coupled receptors on neural or other cell types, including cardiac cells, can lead to increased activity (“supersensitization”) of adenylyl cyclase (25Linden J. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This increased adenylyl cyclase activity has also been shown to occur using transient transfection of cloned adenylyl cyclase expressed in COS-7 cells (26Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but the mechanism responsible for this supersensitization remains unknown.GIRK1 and GIRK4 are also expressed in the brain (27Karschin C. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. Lester H. Davidson N. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Spauschus A. Lenters K.U. Wischmeyer E. Dissman E. Karschin C. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 930-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may form heteromultimers with other members of the GIRK family, GIRK2 and GIRK3 (29Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), to produce receptor-mediated changes in K+conductance. Other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as opioid (30Henry D.J. Grandy K.S. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar), cannabinoid (31Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and serotonin (27Karschin C. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. Lester H. Davidson N. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) receptors, have been demonstrated to couple to the activation of GIRK1-containing potassium channels. This G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated down-regulation of GIRK1 and GIRK4 could represent an important pathway for regulating physiological responses in the heart and the nervous system.

The binding of proteins to the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been reported to occur mainly after they are tyrosine-phosphorylated following receptor activation. Using an in vitro binding assay, immunoprecipitation, and Far Western techniques, we report that in quiescent cells a 75-kDa protein binds directly to the SH2 domain of Grb2. All of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p75 protein co-localizes with Grb2·Sos complex in the cytosolic fraction of the cell in vivo and undergoes tyrosine dephosphorylation when cells are treated with mitogenic ligands such as epidermal, platelet-derived, and fibroblast growth factors, endothelin-1, and bombesin but not tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-α and -γ, interleukein-6, and leukemic inhibitory factor, which are either cell growth inhibitory or not significantly mitogenic. The dephosphorylation of p75 and the ensuing dissociation from Grb2 is rapid, occurring within 30 s following mitogenic stimulation by ligands such as epidermal growth factor, suggesting p75 to be an early component in the signal transduction pathways involving Grb2.

Many of the proteins that bind to the Grb2(SH2) domain are so-called “scaffold” or “docker” proteins, and it is believed that Grb2 recruits other proteins to these to form multimeric complexes that propagate various signals. Apart from its role as an adaptor, Grb2 has been shown to have a role as a regulator. In unstimulated cells the binding to Grb2 was proposed to inhibit the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase RPTP-α (18den Hertog J. Hunter T.

These proteins may have important functions in signaling pathways activated by growth factors. On the other hand it may be possible, given the central role of Grb2 in cellular signaling, that its SH2 domain may be sequestered, via an association with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, in unstimulated cells. We report, in unstimulated cells, a 75-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein specifically binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 in vivo. In contrast to most proteins that bind Grb2 upon cellular activation, p75 undergoes dephosphorylation and concomitant dissociation from Grb2 upon stimulation of different cell types by various growth factors such as FGF, EGF, and PDGF.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL 92, Rockville, MD), NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL 92), mouse E5 thymic epithelial cells (a kind gift from Dr. E. F. Potworoski, Institut Armand-Frappier, Canada), human 293 kidney epithelial cells, and rat L6 myoblasts transfected with FGFR-1 (L6-R1) (a kind gift from Dr. D. Ron, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa) were grown in 150-mm culture dish and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Primary human foreskin fibroblast (MRHF) was from Whittaker Biotechnology (Walkersville, MD) and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with non-essential amino acids, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mmglutamine, bicarbonate (0.85 g/liter), and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. When all the cell types were 80–90% confluent, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed and maintained for another 18–24 h in serum-free medium. Various agonists were added to the quiescent cells prior to the medium being aspirated, and the cells were rapidly washed in cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysate was spun at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for subsequent analysis. The protein concentrations of all cell lysates were normalized after estimation of the protein content using a BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. After the cells were lysed, an equal volume of 2 × precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) was added to the cell lysate. 30 μg of GST fusion proteins containing either SH2 or SH3 domains of Grb2 conjugated to agarose beads were added to the diluted cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 × Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. Quiescent cells were lysed as described above and an equal volume of 2 × precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) was added to the cell lysate. 15 μg of the appropriate antibodies were added to the diluted cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of secondary antibodies conjugated to agarose were added to capture the immunocomplex for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 × Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. Quiescent cells were pretreated with pervanadate, generated by mixing 2.4 μl of 10 mmsodium vanadate and 11 μl of H2O2 (30% v/v) per 15 ml of cell medium, for 1 min and followed by stimulation with the appropriate ligands. Stimulated or unstimulated cells were washed once with cold PBS and aspirated. The cells were scraped in 1 ml of fractionation buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were lysed by 15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the lysate was then layered on fractionation buffer with 1 m sucrose and spun at 1,500 × g for 10 min. About 1 ml of the supernatant above the sucrose cushion was removed and spun at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The membrane pellet was washed once with fractionation buffer, resuspended with the same buffer with the addition of 0.5% Nonidet-P40, and spun again at 150,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept as the membrane fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed once with fractionation buffer, resuspended, layered on lysis buffer with 1m sucrose, and spun at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear proteins were eluted by incubating the nucleus in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl) for 2 h at 4 °C and spun at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant represented the nuclear fraction. Two tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides with sequences within the IRS-1 protein were employed. pY939 (SEEpYMNMDLGP) and pY1222 (LSTpYASINFQK) were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The competition experiments were carried out as described previously (19Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X.M. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After Grb2 immunoprecipitation, the precipitates were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was Western blotted, and the polyvineylidene difluoride membrane soaked in denaturing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride) for 5 min. This was followed by soaking the membrane in renaturation buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Igepal (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v)) for another 5 min. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with Grb2(SH2)-GST fusion proteins at a concentration of 0.25 μg/ml for 1 h, the blot was washed 2 × 15 min. The bound GST fusion protein was detected by incubation with polyclonal anti-GST antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. After washing for 2 × 15 min, the binding proteins were visualized using ECL kit from Amersham. Five plates (150 mm) of quiescent Swiss 3T3 were either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF. The cells were lysed in a total of 3 ml of lysis buffer. The cell lysates were concentrated to about 300 μl using a Savant speed vac model SC100. The concentrate was applied to two tandemly connected HR 10/30 columns, prepacked with preparative grade Superose-12, and run on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted with lysis buffer which should keep protein-protein complexes intact. 1 ml fractions were collected and each fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb2. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Grb2 antibodies. After revealing the Grb2 proteins with ECL and exposure to x-ray film the amount in each fraction was quantitated using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). It was assumed that the density of the image on the film was proportional to the amount of protein in each fraction. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p75 was revealed in a parallel gel filtration run where three fractions were pooled and subjected to immunoprecipitation of Grb2 prior to Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The adaptor protein Grb2 has been shown to be an important link between activated receptors of various growth factors and cytokines, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (3Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). We and others have been characterizing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind to Grb2 in FGF-stimulated cells (20Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Ong S.H. Siak C.B. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A novel 90-kDa protein was seen to bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2, and this protein, FGF receptor substrate 2 has recently been sequenced (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling T. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). During the course of studying the binding of p90 to Grb2 we observed a protein of around 75 kDa that displayed greater tyrosine phosphorylation in unstimulated cells in comparison to stimulated cells. An experiment was therefore performed to see whether this effect was seen with other growth factors. Serum-deprived Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with various concentrations of EGF, PDGF, or FGF and lysed, and immunoprecipitations of Grb2 were carried out using these lysates. The immunoprecipitates were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted, and the membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. All three growth factors induced a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of p75 from Grb2 eluates, the most potent being EGF, in which a concentration as low as 2 ng/ml could trigger the effect (Fig.1 A). The diminution of p75 signal was very rapid, occurring within 30 s of EGF addition (data not shown), suggesting that p75 might play an early role in the signal transduction of growth factors. There are a number of previously characterized tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that have a molecular mass of about 75 kDa. Experiments were performed to investigate whether p75 corresponded to any of these known proteins. SLP-76, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein shown to bind Grb2 in T cells, was a potential candidate for p75. However, SLP-76 is not expressed in fibroblast cells and also lacks the Grb2(SH2) consensus binding motif (22Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses with antibodies against SLP-76 as well as other known tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling proteins of 65 to 85 kDa, including SHP-2, Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), paxillin, and cortactin were all negative (data not shown), suggesting that p75 is a novel protein. Other factors and cytokines whose cognate receptors are known to be present in Swiss 3T3 were tested for their ability to reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation signal of the Grb2-associated p75. The neuropeptides bombesin, endothelin-1, and vasopressin, which signal through G protein-coupled receptors, induced a diminution of p75 signal in Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B, data shown only for endothelin-1). Other cytokines, such as IL-6, LIF, TNF-α, IFN-α, and IFN-γ did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p75 (data not shown). To determine whether the diminution of p75 phosphotyrosine signal could be observed in other cell types, rat L6 myoblasts transfected with FGFR-1 (L6-R1) were treated with FGF while mouse E5 thymic epithelial cells, MRHF, and human 293 kidney epithelial cells were treated with EGF. Fig. 1 C shows that tyrosine-phosphorylated p75 was also present in these diverse cell types and was similarly affected by the two growth factors (data not shown for 293 and MRHF cells). The above data demonstrated that certain agonists induced a change in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p75 while others did not. It is interesting that the effective ligands are those that either activate the receptor tyrosine kinases or G protein-coupled receptors but not other receptor families. These ligands also share a common feature in that they are mitogenic for Swiss 3T3 cells (23Virdee K. Brown B.L. Dobson P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 24Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell.

Grb2 is an adaptor composed entirely of one SH2 domain flanked by an N and C terminus SH3 domain. An experiment was performed to show which domain precipitated p75. Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-deprived before subsequent binding studies. The cell lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 or the N- or C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. The associated proteins were eluted and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Western blotted, and the membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig.2 A shows that p75 can be precipitated by the SH2, but neither SH3 domain of Grb2 (lanes 3 and 4). While there were several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the quiescent cells (Fig.2 A, lane 1), p75 is the major one that bound to Grb2. To demonstrate that the Grb2(SH2)-p75 association is specific, peptide competition experiments were carried out using two phosphotyrosyl peptides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A competitor peptide, denoted pY939, was derived from the IRS-1 sequence and contained the phosphorylated Grb2(SH2) consensus binding motif, Tyr(P)-X-Asn-X. The other peptide (pY1222), also derived from the IRS-1 sequence, did not contain the above consensus binding motif and was used as a control. Grb2(SH2)-GST fusion proteins were preincubated with either of the peptides at various concentrations before the addition of lysates from quiescent cells. The result of the peptide competition experiment is shown in Fig. 2 B. There was a dose-dependent diminution of p75 phosphotyrosine signal when the concentration of the specific competitor peptide (pY939) increased from 0 to 25 μm to 50 μm(lanes 1–3). The control peptide, in contrast, did not affect p75 binding to Grb2 (lane 4). To investigate whether p75 could bind to the SH2 domain of other signaling proteins, the respective SH2-GST fusion proteins from phospholipase C-γ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP-2, and Shc were employed in parallel binding studies. None of these SH2 domains was found to associate with p75 (data not shown). Grb2 appears to be constitutively complexed to Sos via its SH3 domains (5Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 6Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether p75 was in a trimeric complex with Grb2·Sos. Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-deprived before subsequent EGF treatment. The cell lysates were incubated with anti-Sos antibodies, and the associated proteins were eluted and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. The membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 2 C (upper panel) shows that p75 can be co-precipitated with Sos and that the tyrosine phosphorylation decreases upon EGF stimulation. The membrane was sequentially stripped and probed with anti-Sos antibodies (middle panel) to demonstrate that equal amounts of Sos protein were precipitated. The membrane was further stripped and probed with anti-Grb2 antibodies (lower panel) to show the presence of Grb2 in the trimeric complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate the specific in vitroassociation of the SH2 domain of Grb2 with a novel protein, p75, in serum-deprived cells. It appears that tyrosine-phosphorylated p75 is in a ternary complex with Grb-2 and Sos. As the binding of p75 to Grb2 occurs via tyrosine phosphorylation, any stimulated reduction of this phosphorylation would lead to dissociation of p75 from Grb2·Sos. The observed reduction of p75 phosphotyrosine signal could conceivably arise from one or more events, subcellular translocation, proteolytic degradation, competitive displacement, or dephosphorylation. Experiments were performed to ascertain the possible contribution of these processes. To assay for changes in subcellular location, both unstimulated and FGF-stimulated cells were partitioned (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), and the tyrosine-phosphorylated p75 was located using full-length Grb2-GST fusion proteins followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The results are shown in Fig.3 A (upper panel). The p75 protein could be detected only in cytosol (lanes 1and 4) and not in membrane (lanes 2 and5) or nuclear fractions (lanes 3 and6). The level of phosphotyrosine signal of p75 in the cytosol was significantly diminished after FGF stimulation (comparelanes 1 and 4). The purity of the defined cellular compartments was assessed by probing the various fractions with antibodies against proteins deemed to be confined to either cytosol (Erk 2, lane 1), membrane (SIRP,lane 2), or nucleus (c-myc, lane 3) in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). The data shown in Fig. 3 A suggest that subcellular translocation was not responsible for the diminution of p75 signal. To assess the involvement of proteolytic degradation in the decrease of p75 signal, cells were pretreated (or not) with a mixture of cell-permeable protease inhibitors containing 20 μm TPCK, 20 μm DCIC, 200 μm TAME, and 5 mm EGTA for 30 min prior to EGF stimulation. The cells were lysed, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb2 antibodies before the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. A reduction of p75 signal was observed both without (lanes 1 and 2) and with (lanes 3 and 4) protease inhibitor pretreatment (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), implying that proteolysis is not likely to be involved in the loss of phosphotyrosine signal. The effectiveness of this protease inhibition protocol was verified by its ability to abolish the previously well characterized proteolysis of IκB following TNF-α addition (27Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 28Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). In any cell there is a finite number of Grb2(SH2) domains available to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins bearing the appropriate binding motif. The binding affinity would differ for each protein. It is possible that in stimulated cells an excess number of phosphotyrosyl proteins with higher affinities may displace p75 from the SH2 domain. In this case the"
