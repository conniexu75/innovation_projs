https://openalex.org/W3045770213,"Development of novel approaches for regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is becoming increasingly important within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic since these enzymes play a crucial role in cell infection. In this work we searched for putative ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression regulation networks mediated by various miRNA isoforms (isomiR) across different human organs using publicly available paired miRNA/mRNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. As a result, we identified several miRNA families targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in multiple tissues. In particular, we found that lysine-specific demethylase 5B (JARID1B), encoded by the KDM5B gene, can indirectly affect ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression by repressing transcription of hsa-let-7e / hsa-mir-125a and hsa-mir-141 / hsa-miR-200 miRNA families which are targeting these genes."
https://openalex.org/W3035828702,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in inflammation, which is attributable at least, in part, to the conversion of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin (Ang) II peptide into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a peptide which opposes the actions of AngII. ACE2 and AngII are present in many tissues but information on the cornea is lacking. We observed that mice deficient in the Ace2 gene (Ace2−/−), developed a cloudy cornea phenotype as they aged. Haze occupied the central cornea, accompanied by corneal edema and neovascularization. In severe cases with marked chronic inflammation, a cell-fate switch from a transparent corneal epithelium to a keratinized, stratified squamous, psoriasiform-like epidermis was observed. The stroma contained a large number of CD11c, CD68, and CD3 positive cells. Corneal epithelial debridement experiments in young ACE2-deficient mice showed normal appearing corneas, devoid of haze. We hypothesized, however, that these mice are “primed” for a corneal inflammatory response, which once initiated, would persist. In vitro studies reveal that interleukins (IL-1a, IL-1b), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL8), and TNF-α, are all significantly elevated, resulting in a cytokine storm-like phenotype. This phenotype could be partially rescued by treatment with the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, losartan, suggesting that the observed effect was mediated by AngII acting on its main receptor. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes human ACE2 as the receptor for entry with subsequent downregulation of ACE2, corneal inflammation in Ace2−/− mice may have a similar mechanism with that in COVID-19 patients. Thus the Ace2−/− cornea, because of easy accessibility, may provide an attractive model to explore the molecular mechanisms, immunological changes, and treatment modalities in patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3045678530,"Adipose tissue is essential for metabolic homeostasis, balancing lipid storage and mobilization based on nutritional status. This is coordinated by insulin, which triggers kinase signaling cascades to modulate numerous metabolic proteins, leading to increased glucose uptake and anabolic processes like lipogenesis. Given recent evidence that glucose is dispensable for adipocyte respiration, we sought to test whether glucose is necessary for insulin-stimulated anabolism. Examining lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, glucose was essential for insulin to stimulate the synthesis of fatty acids and glyceride–glycerol. Importantly, glucose was dispensable for lipogenesis in the absence of insulin, suggesting that distinct carbon sources are used with or without insulin. Metabolic tracing studies revealed that glucose was required for insulin to stimulate pathways providing carbon substrate, NADPH, and glycerol 3-phosphate for lipid synthesis and storage. Glucose also displaced leucine as a lipogenic substrate and was necessary to suppress fatty acid oxidation. Together, glucose provided substrates and metabolic control for insulin to promote lipogenesis in adipocytes. This contrasted with the suppression of lipolysis by insulin signaling, which occurred independently of glucose. Given previous observations that signal transduction acts primarily before glucose uptake in adipocytes, these data are consistent with a model whereby insulin initially utilizes protein phosphorylation to stimulate lipid anabolism, which is sustained by subsequent glucose metabolism. Consequently, lipid abundance was sensitive to glucose availability, both during adipogenesis and in Drosophila flies in vivo. Together, these data highlight the importance of glucose metabolism to support insulin action, providing a complementary regulatory mechanism to signal transduction to stimulate adipose anabolism.

Adipose tissue represents a key metabolic hub, with dysregulated adipose lipid metabolism being common in the etiology of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance (1Lotta L.A. Gulati P.

Adipose metabolism responds dynamically to the nutritional milieu, storing energy as lipid under nutrient replete conditions and mobilizing lipid stores during fasting. This balance is tightly regulated by insulin, which, in response to rising blood glucose levels, suppresses lipolysis and promotes glucose uptake and utilization. Importantly, adipose glucose uptake becomes impaired early in the progression of insulin resistance in both rodents and humans (3Garvey W.T. Kolterman O.G.

Furthermore, adipose-specific knockout of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 reportedly causes whole-body insulin resistance in mice (6Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O.

Therefore, how adipocytes metabolize glucose is essential to organismal metabolic homeostasis. Upon insulin stimulation, the adipocyte markedly adapts its metabolism to cater for the substantial influx of glucose (7Quek L.E. Krycer J.R. Ohno S. Yugi K. Fazakerley D.J. Scalzo R. Elkington S.D.

To achieve this, insulin engages kinase signaling cascades to alter the phosphorylation of numerous metabolic proteins (8Ma D.K. Stolte C. Krycer J.R. James D.E. O'Donoghue S.I. SnapShot: insulin/IGF1 signaling.Cell. 2015; 161 (25957692): 948-948.e110.1016/j.cell.2015.04.041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Krycer J.R. Yugi K. Hirayama A.

In adipocytes, this rapidly activates anabolic enzymes before glucose is taken up (9Krycer J.R. Yugi K. Hirayama A. Fazakerley D.J. Quek L.E. Scalzo R. Ohno S. Hodson M.P. Ikeda S. Shoji F. Suzuki K.

This pulls glucose flux down specific metabolic pathways because of an increase in substrate demand. A corollary of this model is that glucose metabolism fuels anabolism in adipocytes. This is supported by studies in rodent adipose explants and adipocytes, which demonstrated that lipogenesis occurs in the presence of glucose, which acts as a carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (10Rodbell M. Metabolism of isolated fat cells: I. Effects of hormones on glucose metabolism and lipolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239 (14169133): 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and facilitates fatty acid esterification for lipid storage (11Bally P.R. Cahill Jr., G.F. Leboeuf B. Renold A.E. Studies on rat adipose tissue in vitro: V. Effects of glucose and insulin on the metabolism of palmitate-1-C14.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235 (13796287): 333-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies were typically performed in minimal media containing only glucose and/or fatty acids as substrates. Thus, the quantitative contribution of glucose to these lipogenic processes is unclear under more physiological circumstances, such as in the presence of other substrates like amino acids. This raises the possibility that glucose is sufficient, but not necessary, for insulin-stimulated lipid anabolism in adipose tissue. In support of this, branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) also contribute substantially as lipogenic substrates in cultured adipocytes, as well as primary adipocytes and adipose tissue from rodents and humans (12Feller D.D.

Biol. 2016; 12 (26571352): 15-2110.1038/nchembio.1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Likewise, we previously observed that glucose is not required for insulin to stimulate respiration in adipocytes (16Krycer J.R. Elkington S.D. Diaz-Vegas A. Cooke K.C. Burchfield J.G. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Cooney G.J. Fazakerley D.J. James D.E. Mitochondrial oxidants, but not respiration, are sensitive to glucose in adipocytes.J. Biol.

Thus, although anabolic processes such as lipogenesis may serve as a means of glucose storage in adipocytes, it is unclear whether glucose per se is necessary for insulin action. Insulin may stimulate anabolism predominantly by kinase signaling to activate key metabolic enzymes, with the adipocyte using alternate substrates (e.g. amino acids) in the absence of glucose. This is an important question to address given that insulin-resistant adipocytes have a selective impairment in glucose uptake (17Tan S.X. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Fazakerley D.J. Ng Y. Pant H. Li J. Meoli C.C. Coster A.C. Stöckli J. James D.E. Selective insulin resistance in adipocytes.J. Biol.

Thus, we sought to clarify the role of glucose in insulin-stimulated anabolism and lipid storage in cultured adipocytes. We found that kinase signaling per se was unaffected by glucose availability, but glucose was required to be present for insulin to stimulate lipogenesis as an end point of kinase signaling. Metabolic tracing revealed that glucose metabolism provided both substrates and metabolic control to enable insulin to promote fatty acid and glyceride–glycerol synthesis. Importantly, glucose had no impact on lipogenesis in the absence of insulin, suggesting that basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis use distinct carbon sources. Furthermore, insulin could inhibit lipolysis independently of glucose, demonstrating that only a subset of insulin's actions was sensitive to glucose metabolism. This presents a model whereby protein phosphorylation occurs rapidly before glucose uptake (9Krycer J.R. Yugi K. Hirayama A. Fazakerley D.J. Quek L.E. Scalzo R. Ohno S. Hodson M.P. Ikeda S. Shoji F.

Consistent with a key role for glucose in lipid storage, lipid accumulation was sensitive to glucose availability in both adipocytes and Drosophila flies in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that kinase signaling alone is insufficient, requiring glucose metabolism as a complementary regulatory mechanism to enable insulin to increase lipid anabolism in adipocytes. In this study, we aimed to address the importance of glucose in insulin-stimulated lipid metabolism in adipocytes. Glucose metabolism can fuel anabolic processes through provision of carbon substrate, ATP, and NADPH (18Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Science. 2009; 324 (19460998): 1029-103310.1126/science.1160809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10213) Google Scholar) via specific pathways in central carbon metabolism. Thus, we initially assessed how metabolites in these pathways responded to insulin, with or without glucose. To achieve this, we utilized galactose, a hexose that enters glycolysis via a different pathway (Fig. 1A) and is metabolized more slowly than glucose, such that flux through anabolic pathways becomes dependent on nonglucose sources such as amino acids (19Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennell D. Evidence that glutamine, not sugar, is the major energy source for cultured HeLa cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254 (429309): 2669-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that substituting glucose for galactose in adipocytes abolished the increase in lactate production, but not respiration, in response to insulin (16Krycer J.R. Elkington S.D. Diaz-Vegas A. Cooke K.C. Burchfield J.G. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Cooney G.J. Fazakerley D.J. James D.E. Mitochondrial oxidants, but not respiration, are sensitive to glucose in adipocytes.J. Biol.

We anticipated that if glucose was required for anabolism, flux through anabolic pathways would increase in response to insulin stimulation, but the metabolites in these pathways would become depleted if glucose was substituted with galactose. Cultured adipocytes were incubated with either (i) glucose alone, (ii) insulin and glucose, or (iii) insulin and galactose. Following treatment, cell lysates were subjected to targeted metabolomics analysis. Visualizing the variation in total metabolite abundance by principal-component analysis revealed that the samples from the glucose/insulin condition were clustered away from the glucose/control condition (Fig. 1B), implying that insulin causes substantial variation in the metabolome when glucose was available. Replacing glucose with galactose (galactose/insulin) generated a cluster closer to glucose/control, in the opposite direction to glucose/insulin, demonstrating that glucose availability altered the effect of insulin on the metabolome. Focusing on individual metabolites in central carbon metabolism revealed that insulin increased the total abundance of most nonamino acid metabolites (Fig. 1C, x axis), but these changes were dependent on the presence of glucose (Fig. 1C, y axis). This glucose dependence was exemplified by metabolites in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and lipogenesis (Fig. 1D, top panel). In these experiments, glucose and galactose were 13C-labeled to allow us to determine whether these sugars were a direct substrate for metabolites or glucose acted indirectly via metabolic control (e.g. influencing mass action or the levels of an allosteric regulator) to support insulin-stimulated metabolism. These labeled sugars did not alter total metabolite abundances when compared with incubation with naturally labeled sugars (Fig. S1A). To demonstrate the utility of substrate labeling, we initially used these labeled sugars to verify the metabolism of galactose. We considered glucose 6-phosphate, the entry point of both sugars into glycolysis (Fig. 1A). The dominant isotopologue for glucose 6-phosphate was m6 (all six carbons are 13C-labeled) for insulin-treated adipocytes incubated with either sugar (Fig. S1B), confirming that both sugars are taken up by adipocytes and enter glycolysis. However, 13C-labeled levels of glucose 6-phosphate (Fig. S1B) and other metabolites (Fig. 1D, bottom panel) were substantially lower with galactose, confirming that galactose served as a poor substrate for central carbon metabolism (Fig. 1A). This concurs with previous observations in isolated rodent adipocytes, which showed that insulin stimulated the uptake of galactose similarly to glucose, but not downstream galactose metabolism (20Vega F.V. Kono T. Effects of insulin on the uptake of d-galactose by isolated rat epididymal fat cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 512 (698215): 221-22210.1016/0005-2736(78)90232-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We more closely examined isotopologue patterns to understand how glucose facilitated insulin-responsive metabolism (Fig. 1E). For instance, we observed that insulin required the presence of glucose to increase metabolites in glycolysis (Fig. 1D, top panel). For these metabolites, like glucose 6-phosphate, the dominant isotopologue in the glucose/insulin condition was maximally labeled (e.g. m6 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and m3 for phosphoenolpyruvate) (Fig. 1E, top left panel). Thus, glucose contributed most of the carbon to metabolites in glycolysis under insulin-stimulated conditions. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites also increased with insulin, but this was not dependent on glucose (Fig. 1E, bottom right panel). Furthermore, although these metabolites were substantially labeled in the glucose/insulin condition, the dominant isotopologue was m0 (unlabeled) in the galactose/insulin condition, indicative of the use of nonglucose carbon. This suggests that glucose can facilitate the insulin-stimulated increase in TCA cycle metabolites, but alternate substrates such as amino acids (15Green C.R. Wallace M. Divakaruni A.S. Phillips S.A. Murphy A.N. Ciaraldi T.P. Metallo C.M. Branched-chain amino acid catabolism fuels adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis.Nat. Chem.

This corroborates our previous observations that insulin-stimulated respiration did not require glucose (16Krycer J.R. Elkington S.D. Diaz-Vegas A. Cooke K.C. Burchfield J.G. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Cooney G.J. Fazakerley D.J. James D.E. Mitochondrial oxidants, but not respiration, are sensitive to glucose in adipocytes.J. Biol.

Interestingly, this did not apply to fumarate and malate, which, like glycolytic metabolites, increased with insulin treatment in a glucose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E, bottom left panel). Malate also participates in the pyruvate–malate cycle: pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase, oxaloacetate to malate by malate dehydrogenase, malate to pyruvate by malic enzyme (Fig. 1E, blue arrows). This cycle generates the m3 isotopologue of malate, which was dominant only in the glucose/insulin condition (Fig. 1E). Thus, our data imply that the pyruvate–malate cycle responds to glucose metabolism, corroborating our previous observations that this cycle is tightly coupled to glycolysis (7Quek L.E. Krycer J.R. Ohno S. Yugi K. Fazakerley D.J. Scalzo R. Elkington S.D. Dai Z. Hirayama A. Ikeda S. Shoji F. Suzuki K. Locasale J.W. Soga T.

Together, this demonstrated that although insulin increased numerous metabolites, only selected pathways depended on the carbon provided by glucose to facilitate this response. We next focused on lipogenic substrates, because recent studies (15Green C.R. Wallace M. Divakaruni A.S. Phillips S.A. Murphy A.N. Ciaraldi T.P. Metallo C.M. Branched-chain amino acid catabolism fuels adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 (26571352): 15-2110.1038/nchembio.1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) have reinvigorated the notion that nonglucose substrates may fuel a major portion of lipogenesis in adipocytes (12Feller D.D. Feist E. Metabolism of adipose tissue: incorporation of isoleucine carbon into lipids by slices of adipose tissue.J. Lipid Res. 1959; 1: 90-96Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 13Feller D.D. Feist E. The conversion of leucine carbon into CO2, fatty acids and other products by adipose tissue.Biochim. Biophys.

Because we set out to determine the requirement for glucose in adipocyte lipogenesis, we considered the precursors to lipid synthesis and storage, malonyl-CoA and glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 1E, top right panel). Insulin increased glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner, with the fully labeled (m3) isotopologue predominant in the glucose/insulin condition. Thus, with insulin stimulation, G3P was predominantly derived from exogenous glucose, which is intuitive because G3P is derived from glycolysis. Furthermore, the m0 isotopologue decreased upon insulin treatment, even without glucose present, suggesting that G3P is used in response to insulin and glucose is required to replenish G3P during insulin-stimulated anabolism. Malonyl-CoA followed a similar pattern, with the rise in malonyl-CoA in the glucose/insulin condition being due to the m2 isotopologue (Fig. 1E, top right panel). Because malonyl-CoA is derived from carboxylation of the two-carbon carrier acetyl-CoA, the m2 isotopologue reflects lipogenic carbon sourced entirely from glucose. However, the m0 isotopologue did not decrease upon insulin stimulation. Together, this implies that insulin-responsive lipogenesis is glucose-dependent, and the contribution of malonyl-CoA from nonglucose sources is maintained regardless of insulin status. Based on these observations, we examined how de novo lipogenesis responds to insulin treatment in the presence or absence of glucose. As an additional control to galactose, we included a “no sugar” condition, which, like galactose, abolished insulin-responsive lactate production (Fig. S2A). Furthermore, we reduced the sugar concentration in the medium from 25 to 10 mm, which is more physiological and enabled us to conserve labeled substrate. We assessed whether this would impact glucose incorporation into lipid; increasing the medium glucose concentration from 5 to 25 mm caused a ∼2.5-fold increase in glucose uptake (22Krycer J.R. Quek L.E. Francis D. Fazakerley D.J. Elkington S.D. Diaz-Vegas A. Cooke K.C. Weiss F.C. Duan X. Kurdyukov S. Zhou P.X. Tambar U.K. Hirayama A. Ikeda S.

This demonstrated that altering the sugar concentration should have little impact on glucose utilization in lipid metabolism. De novo lipogenesis was measured by incubation with 3H-labeled H2O ([3H]H2O): the reduction reactions in de novo lipogenesis incorporate 3H atoms into the backbone of fatty acids and glyceride–glycerol moiety, thus providing a measure of newly synthesized lipid (23Jungas R.L.

This revealed that insulin-responsive synthesis of both glyceride–glycerol (Fig. 2A) and fatty acid (Fig. 2B) moieties was blunted in the absence of glucose. To test whether this was due to glucose acting as a carbon source, we incubated parallel adipocyte cultures with [3H]H2O or [14C]glucose, to assess total or glucose-derived lipid synthesis, respectively. Upon insulin treatment, the glyceride–glycerol moiety was almost entirely derived from exogenous glucose (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the synthesis of fatty acids from glucose carbon increased with a similar magnitude to total synthesis, but this glucose-derived lipid only accounted for a portion of the total newly synthesized lipid (Fig. 2D). Thus, insulin-stimulated adipocytes derive lipogenic substrates from exogenous glucose carbon, but nonglucose sources also contribute substantially to fatty acid synthesis under these conditions. We complemented these experiments with a stable-isotope lipidomics approach, in which we examined which lipid species were enriched by 13C-glucose (Fig. S2C). We confirmed an insulin response by the increase in total and 13C-enriched lactate production (Fig. S2D), as observed previously (22Krycer J.R. Quek L.E. Francis D. Fazakerley D.J. Elkington S.D. Diaz-Vegas A. Cooke K.C. Weiss F.C. Duan X. Kurdyukov S. Zhou P.X. Tambar U.K. Hirayama A. Ikeda S. Kamei Y. et al.Lactate production is a prioritized feature of adipocyte metabolism.J. Biol.

Because the treatment/labeling period was short (1 h), we included a 48-h incubation period with 13C- or naturally labeled glucose as positive and negative controls for detecting lipid isotopologues (Fig. S2C). We examined several lipid classes (Fig. 2E): although 13C enrichment could be detected across all lipid classes after a 48-h labeling period, only acylglycerides (triacylglycerides (TAGs) and diacylglycerides) and phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine) exhibited detectable enrichment that increased after 1 h of insulin treatment (Fig. S2E). If glucose is incorporated into the fatty acid moiety, this would generate m2/m4/m6/etc isotopologues. These isotopologues were substantially less abundant than the m3 isotopologue (Fig. 2F), which represents the glyceride–glycerol backbone in these lipid species. The absence of a dominant m3 isotopologue for ceramide (Fig. S2F), which lacks the glyceride–glycerol backbone, supports this interpretation. This corroborates the prominent role that glucose plays in the synthesis of the glyceride–glycerol backbone, implied by our radiotracer experiments (Fig. 2C). Overall, these experiments demonstrate that glucose supports insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis by acting directly as a carbon substrate, contributing partially to fatty acid synthesis and being the dominant substrate for the glyceride–glycerol backbone across multiple lipid species. Because a large portion of the carbon for de novo fatty acid synthesis was not derived from glucose (Fig. 2D), we considered whether glucose metabolism influences lipogenesis indirectly, i.e. promotes lipogenesis from other carbon sources. For instance, malic enzyme (pyruvate–malate cycle, Fig. 1E) and the pentose phosphate pathway are both NADPH sources, and flux through these pathways was highly glucose-dependent (Fig. 1, D and E); hence, glucose metabolism may generate NADPH to facilitate"

https://openalex.org/W3046175611,"Since the advent of protein crystallography, atomic-level macromolecular structures have provided a basis to understand biological function. Enzymologists use detailed structural insights on ligand coordination, interatomic distances, and positioning of catalytic amino acids to rationalize the underlying electronic reaction mechanisms. Often the proteins in question catalyze redox reactions using metal cofactors that are explicitly intertwined with their function. In these cases, the exact nature of the coordination sphere and the oxidation state of the metal is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, the redox-active nature of metal cofactors makes them especially susceptible to photoreduction, meaning that information obtained by photoreducing X-ray sources about the environment of the cofactor is the least trustworthy part of the structure. In this work we directly compare the kinetics of photoreduction of six different heme protein crystal species by X-ray radiation. We show that a dose of ∼40 kilograys already yields 50% ferrous iron in a heme protein crystal. We also demonstrate that the kinetics of photoreduction are completely independent from variables unique to the different samples tested. The photoreduction-induced structural rearrangements around the metal cofactors have to be considered when biochemical data of ferric proteins are rationalized by constraints derived from crystal structures of reduced enzymes."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methanol crude extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of J. mimosifolia leaves for bioactive metabolites, as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. The anti-inflammatory potential of the various fractions of J. mimosifolia leaf extract was studied via the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay. Methanol crude extract (ME), derived fractions extracted with chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EAF), and residual aqueous extract (AE) of dried J. mimosifolia leaves were assayed for polyphenolic compounds, their antioxidant, antimicrobial and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, and anticancer properties. Polyphenolic compounds were determined via HPLC while phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and ortho-diphenol contents), antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydrogen peroxideperoxide, hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions) and LOX were measured via spectrophotometry. Methanol extracts and various fractions were evaluated for antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antifungal potential of the fractions was tested against three species: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest values for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, tannins and ortho-diphenols were in the ME, followed by CF > EAF > AE. ME also had the highest antioxidant activity with EC50 values 48±1.3, 45±2.4, 42±1.3 and 46±1.3 μg/mL based on the DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical assays, respectively. TPC and TFC showed a significant, strong and positive correlation with the values for each of these antioxidant activities. ME exhibited anti-inflammatory potential based on its LOX inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.3 μg/mL). ME also had the maximum antibacterial and antifungal potential, followed by EAF > CF > AE. Furthermore, ME showed the strongest cytotoxic effect (EC50 = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL) against human hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines, respectively. Bioactive compounds present in leaf methanol extracts of J. mimosifolia were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifteen compounds were identified including phenolic and alcoholic compounds, as well as fatty acids. Our results suggest that J. mimosifolia leaves are a good source of natural products with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties for potential therapeutic, nutraceutical and functional food applications."
https://openalex.org/W3045501231,"‘Normal aging’ in the brain refers to age-related changes that occur independent of disease, in particular Alzheimer’s disease. A major barrier to mapping normal brain aging has been the difficulty in excluding the earliest preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, before addressing this issue we first imaged a mouse model and learn that the best MRI measure of dendritic spine loss, a known pathophysiological driver of normal aging, is one that relies on the combined use of functional and structural MRI. In the primary study, we then deployed the combined functional-structural MRI measure to investigate over 100 cognitively-normal people from 20–72 years of age. Next, to cover the tail end of aging, in secondary analyses we investigated structural MRI acquired from cognitively-normal people, 60–84 years of age, who were Alzheimer’s-free via biomarkers. Collectively, the results from the primary functional-structural study, and the secondary structural studies revealed that the dentate gyrus is a hippocampal region differentially affected by aging, and that the entorhinal cortex is a region most resistant to aging. Across the cortex, the primary functional-structural study revealed and that the inferior frontal gyrus is differentially affected by aging, however, the secondary structural studies implicated other frontal cortex regions. Together, the results clarify how normal aging may affect the brain and has possible mechanistic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W3045895241,"Old-growth forests play a major role in conserving biodiversity, protecting water resources, and sequestrating carbon, as well as serving as indispensable resources for indigenous societies. Novel silvicultural practices must be developed to emulate the natural dynamics and structural attributes of old-growth forests and preserve the ecosystem services provided by these boreal ecosystems. The success of these forest management strategies depends on developing an accurate understanding of natural regeneration dynamics. Our goal was therefore to identify the main patterns and drivers involved in the regeneration dynamics of old-growth forests with a focus on boreal stands dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (L.) Mill.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) in eastern Canada. We sampled 71 stands in a 2 200 km2 study area located within Quebec's boreal region. For each stand, we noted tree regeneration (seedlings and saplings), structural attributes (diameter distribution, deadwood volume, etc.), and abiotic (slope and soil) factors. The presence of seed-trees located nearby and slopes having moderate to high angles most influenced balsam fir regeneration. In contrast, the indirect indices of recent secondary disturbances (e.g., insect outbreaks or windthrows) and topographic constraints (slope and drainage) most influenced black spruce regeneration. We propose that black spruce regeneration dynamics can be separated into distinct phases: (i) layering within the understory, (ii) seedling growth when gaps open in the canopy, (iii) gradual canopy closure, and (iv) production of new layers once the canopy is closed. These dynamics are not observed in paludified stands or stands where balsam fir is more competitive than black spruce. Overall, this research helps explain the complexity of old-growth forest dynamics, where many ecological factors interact at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This study also improves our understanding of ecological processes within primary old-growth forests and identifies the key factors to consider when ensuring the sustainable management of old-growth boreal stands."

The protein structure analysis revealed that the m.3866T>C (I187T) and m.11778G>A (R340H) mutations destabilized the specific interactions with other residues of ND1 and ND4, thereby altering the structure and function of complex I. Cellular data obtained using cybrids, constructed by transferring mitochondria from the Chinese families into mtDNA-less (ρ°) cells, demonstrated that the mutations perturbed the stability, assembly, and activity of complex I, leading to changes in mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. These mitochondrial dysfunctions promoted the apoptotic sensitivity of cells and decreased mitophagy. Cybrids bearing only the m.3866T>C mutation displayed mild mitochondrial dysfunctions, whereas those harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited greater mitochondrial dysfunctions.

These Chinese pedigrees carrying only the m.3866T>C mutation exhibited extremely low penetrance of LHON, whereas the penetrances of LHON among those pedigrees bearing the m.3866T>C mutation together with m.11778G>A mutations were higher than those in families carrying only single mtDNA mutation (15Ji Y.

However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these LHON-associated mutations remain elusive. The m.3866T>C mutation resulted in the change of highly conserved isoleucine at position 187 with threonine (I187T) in ND1, the core component of 45 subunits of complex I (29Zhou X. Qian Y. Zhang J.

Thus, the m.3866T>C mutation may perturb both the structure and function of complex I, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. The higher penetrance of LHON in the families carrying both m.11778G>A and m.3866T>C mutations implied that biochemical consequences caused by the m.3866T>C mutation deteriorate the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with m.11778G>A mutation, thereby increasing the penetrance and risk of LHON.

Functional consequences of m.3866T>C mutation was further investigated through the cybrid cell lines constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an affected matrilineal relative carrying the m.11778G>A and m.3866T>C mutation, individuals bearing only m.3866T>C or m.11778G>A mutation, and a control subject belonging to the same mtDNA haplogroup, all into human mtDNA-less (ρ°) cells (19Zhang J.

Using Western blotting and blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analyses, we examined if the m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exerted an effect on the stability of ND1 and ND4 as well as assembly of complex I. These cell lines were then assessed for effects of the mtDNA mutations on the enzymatic activities of respiratory chain complexes, the rate of O2 consumption, mitochondrial ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These cell lines were further evaluated for the effect of these mtDNA mutations on apoptotic state and mitophagy. Ten Han Chinese pedigrees bearing the m.3866T>C mutation (6 bearing only the m.3866T>C mutation, 4 carrying m.3866T>C mutation together with m.11778G>A mutation) were identified in a large cohort of 1793 Chinese probands with LHON (15Ji Y.

All available members of 10 pedigrees underwent comprehensive physical and ophthalmologic examinations to identify personal or family medical histories of visual impairments and other clinical abnormalities. As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1, matrilineal relatives exhibited variable penetrance and expressivity of optic neuropathy among and within families. In particular, the severity of visual loss ranged from profound visual loss to normal vision. The age at onset of optic neuropathy of 6 pedigrees bearing only m.3866T>C mutation ranged from 5 to 39 years, with an average of 24.8 years, whereas the average age at onset of visual impairment of 4 pedigrees harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations were 22.2 years, respectively. Strikingly, 6 pedigrees harboring only the m.3866T>C mutation exhibited extremely low penetrance of optic neuropathy, ranging from 11.1% to 29.2%, with an average of 17.0%. In contrast, the average penetrances of optic neuropathy of 4 pedigrees harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations were 41.9%. Entire sequence analysis of mtDNAs among these Chinese pedigrees revealed that these probands showed the presence of m.3866T>C or m.11778G>A mutations and distinct sets of mtDNA polymorphisms, including 129 known variants, as shown in Table S2. As shown in Table S1, the mtDNAs from 10 pedigrees resided at mtDNA haplogroups C4a (1), D4 (2), G2 (1), M 10 (4), H2 (1), and R (1), respectively (35Kong Q.-P. Bandelt H.-J. Sun C. Yao Y.-G.

These mtDNA variants included 35 in the D-loop region, 4 in the 12S rRNA gene, 3 in the 16S rRNA gene, 5 in the tRNA gene, and 53 silent and 29 missense variants in the genes encoding polypeptides (36Andrews R.M. Kubacka I. Chinnery P.F. Lightowlers R.N. Turnbull D.M. Howell N. Reanalysis and revision of the Cambridge reference sequence for human mitochondrial DNA.Nat.

These variants in RNAs and polypeptides were evaluated by phylogenetic analysis of these variants and sequences from 17 vertebrates, as shown in Table S2. These variants were further evaluated for the presence of 485 control subjects and potential structural and functional alterations. Of these, these variants may not have potential structural and functional alterations. These findings indicated that these mtDNA variants do not play an important role in the phenotypic manifestation of m.3866T>C mutations. To test the effect of m.3866T>C (I187T) and m.11778G>A (R340H) mutations on the structure and function of ND1 and ND4, we performed the tertiary structure analysis of complex I from H. sapiens and M. musculus. Based on the Cryo-EM structure of mammalian complex I (PDB entry 5XTD and 6G2J) (32Guo R. Zong S. Wu M. Gu J. Yang M.

Hence, the replacement of hydrophobic isoleucine at position 187 with the hydrophilic threonine by m.3866T>C mutation in ND1 or arginine at position 340 with histidine by m.11778G>A mutation in ND4 may destabilize these interactions inside ND1 or ND4, thereby perturbing the structure and stability of ND1 and ND4 proteins, respectively. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of ND1 and ND4 proteins by Western blotting in these mutant cell lines carrying only m.3866T>C mutation, only m.11778G>A mutation, or both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations, as well as control cell lines lacking these mutations. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the levels of ND1 in mutant cell lines carrying only m.3866T>C, m.11778G>A, or both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations were 74.1%, 90.3%, and 56.4% relative to the average values of control cell lines. Furthermore, the levels of ND4 in mutant cell lines carrying only m.3866T>C, m.11778G>A, and both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations were 94.5%, 66.0%, and 51.9%, respectively, relative to the average control values. The complex I of human and mice is composed of 45 subunits, including 7 subunits encoded by mtDNA and 38 subunits encoded by nuclear genes. These subunits are organized into six modules, Q, ND1, ND2, ND4, ND5, and N, with the help of specific assembly factors that begin to assemble separately and ultimately combine to form the complex I holocomplex in the inner membrane of mitochondria (37Guerrero-Castillo S.

To examine whether the m.3866T>C or m.11778G>A mutation affected the expression of other subunits of complex I, we measured the levels of NDUFA3, NDUFA8, NDUFA13, ND5, NDUFS2, NDUFB4, NDUFB5, NDUFB8, and NDUFB11 by Western blot analysis among mutant and control cell lines, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, and 2, B–D, the levels of these subunits in mutant cell lines were comparable with those in control cell lines.

Design Population-based retrospective cohort study using linked cancer registry and administrative data at ICES. Setting The universal healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Participants Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients diagnosed between April 1st, 2007 and December 31st, 2012. SPI history (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders or major depressive disorders) was determined using hospitalization, emergency department, and psychiatrist visit data and categorized as ‘no history of mental illness, ‘outpatient SPI history’, and ‘inpatient SPI history’. Main outcome measures Cancer-specific survival, non-receipt of surgical resection, and non-receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. Results 24,507 CRC patients were included; 482 (2.0%) had an outpatient SPI history and 258 (1.0%) had an inpatient SPI history. Individuals with an SPI history had significantly lower survival rates and were significantly less likely to receive guideline recommended treatment than CRC patients with no history of mental illness. The adjusted HR for cancer-specific death was 1.69 times higher for individuals with an inpatient SPI (95% CI 1.36–2.09) and 1.24 times higher for individuals with an outpatient SPI history (95% CI 1.04–1.48). Stage II and III CRC patients with an inpatient SPI history were 2.15 times less likely (95% CI 1.07–4.33) to receive potentially curative surgical resection and 2.07 times less likely (95% CI 1.72–2.50) to receive adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. These findings were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Individuals with an SPI history experience inequalities in colorectal cancer care and survival within a universal healthcare system. Increasing advocacy and the availability of resources to support individuals with an SPI within the cancer system are warranted to reduce the potential for unnecessary harm."
https://openalex.org/W3045958193,"Platelets upregulate the generation of thrombin and reinforce the fibrin clot which increases the incidence risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of venous cardiovascular diseases remains hard to quantify. An experimentally validated model of thrombin generation dynamics is formulated. The model predicts that a high platelet count increases the peak value of generated thrombin as well as the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) as reported in experimental data. To investigate the effects of platelets density, shear rate, and wound size on the initiation of blood coagulation, we calibrate a previously developed model of venous thrombus formation and implement it in 3D using a novel cell-centered finite-volume solver. We conduct numerical simulations to reproduce in vitro experiments of blood coagulation in microfluidic capillaries. Then, we derive a reduced one-equation model of thrombin distribution from the previous model under simplifying hypotheses and we use it to determine the conditions of clotting initiation on the platelet count, the shear rate, and the plasma composition. The initiation of clotting also exhibits a threshold response to the size of the wounded region in good agreement with the reported experimental findings."
https://openalex.org/W3045618311,"The EAG (ether-à-go-go) family of voltage-gated K+ channels are important regulators of neuronal and cardiac action potential firing (excitability) and have major roles in human diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, cancer, and sudden cardiac death. A defining feature of EAG (Kv10-12) channels is a highly conserved domain on the N terminus, known as the eag domain, consisting of a Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain capped by a short sequence containing an amphipathic helix (Cap domain). The PAS and Cap domains are both vital for the normal function of EAG channels. Using heme-affinity pulldown assays and proteomics of lysates from primary cortical neurons, we identified that an EAG channel, hERG3 (Kv11.3), binds to heme. In whole-cell electrophysiology experiments, we identified that heme inhibits hERG3 channel activity. In addition, we expressed the Cap and PAS domain of hERG3 in Escherichia coli and, using spectroscopy and kinetics, identified the PAS domain as the location for heme binding. The results identify heme as a regulator of hERG3 channel activity. These observations are discussed in the context of the emerging role for heme as a regulator of ion channel activity in cells."

Its primary role is to protect lung tissue by inhibiting neutrophil elastase. The Z allele of SERPINA1 encodes a mutant AAT, named ATZ, that changes the protein structure and leads to its misfolding and polymerization, which cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and liver disease through a gain-of-function toxic mechanism. Hepatic retention of ATZ results in deficiency of one of the most important circulating proteinase inhibitors and predisposes to early-onset emphysema through a loss-of-function mechanism. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the liver disease are not completely understood. C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor induced by ER stress, was found among the most up-regulated genes in livers of PiZ mice that express ATZ and in human livers of patients homozygous for the Z allele. Compared with controls, juvenile PiZ/Chop−/− mice showed reduced hepatic ATZ and a transcriptional response indicative of decreased ER stress by RNA-Seq analysis. Livers of PiZ/Chop−/− mice also showed reduced SERPINA1 mRNA levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitations and luciferase reporter–based transfection assays, CHOP was found to up-regulate SERPINA1 cooperating with c-JUN, which was previously shown to up-regulate SERPINA1, thus aggravating hepatic accumulation of ATZ. Increased CHOP levels were detected in diseased livers of children homozygous for the Z allele. In summary, CHOP and c-JUN up-regulate SERPINA1 transcription and play an important role in hepatic disease by increasing the burden of proteotoxic ATZ, particularly in the pediatric population. α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) encoded by the SERPINA1 gene is an acute-phase protein synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation.

AAT deficiency is a common genetic cause of lung and liver diseases. The vast majority of patients with AAT deficiency (∼95%) are homozygous for the Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene (PiZZ), which results in a single glutamic acid–to–lysine substitution at amino acid position 342 (p.Glu342Lys) (1Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency—a model for conformational diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346 (11778003): 45-5310.1056/NEJMra010772Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This mutation changes the protein structure, leading to misfolding, polymerization, and accumulation of mutant AAT (ATZ) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency—a model for conformational diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346 (11778003): 45-5310.1056/NEJMra010772Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In PiZZ individuals, intrahepatic retention of ATZ results in low circulating levels of AAT and inadequate anti-protease protection in the lower respiratory tract that can lead to progressive lung emphysema (1Carrell R.W.

PiZZ individuals are also at risk of developing liver disease due to intracellular retention and accumulation of aberrantly folded ATZ leading to hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Sveger T. The natural history of liver disease in α1-antitrypsin deficient children.Acta Paediatr.

There is great variability in the severity of liver disease among PiZZ homozygotes, and a survey of a unique cohort of homozygote individuals identified by an unbiased newborn screening carried out in Sweden showed that about 8% of homozygotes develop clinically significant liver disease in the first 4 decades of life (3Eriksson S. Carlson J. Velez R. Risk of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.N. Engl. J.

A greater proportion of this population will likely develop liver injury as they reach older ages. Nevertheless, a number of PiZZ individuals do not manifest clinical symptoms of liver disease throughout their lifetime (4Sveger T.

These data suggest that genetic and/or environmental modifiers play a major role in susceptibility to liver disease. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the liver disorder is important to identify disease modifiers and to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. Combining results in mouse and human livers expressing ATZ, we identified CHOP as an important transcriptional regulator of SERPINA1 expression aggravating the liver disease. For this study, we used transgenic PiZ mice, that have been a valuable model for studying the liver disease induced by ATZ because in the livers of these mice, ATZ accumulates within the ER of hepatocytes as periodic acid–Schiff–diastase–resistant (PAS-D) positive globules, in a nearly identical manner to livers of human patients (5Perlmutter D.H. Liver injury in α1-antitrypsin deficiency: an aggregated protein induces mitochondrial injury.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110 (12464659): 1579-158310.1172/JCI16787Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because they have been genetically engineered to express the human SERPINA1 gene harboring the Z mutation that includes the human promoter region (6Carlson J.A. Rogers B.B. Sifers R.N. Finegold M.J. Clift S.M. DeMayo F.J. Bullock D.W. Woo S.L. Accumulation of PiZ α1-antitrypsin causes liver damage in transgenic mice.J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83 (2784798): 1183-119010.1172/JCI113999Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), they are also useful to investigate SERPINA1 transcriptional regulation. Importantly, mouse data were validated in human liver tissues from PiZZ patients of various ages with hepatic disease. We previously found up-regulation of genes related to response to ER stress in PiZ livers (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among differentially expressed genes, the transcription factor Chop was among the most up-regulated. Under nonstress conditions, CHOP is typically not expressed at detectable levels, and its subcellular location is mainly in cytoplasm, whereas stress conditions induce its nuclear translocation (8Yang Y. Liu L. Naik I. Braunstein Z. Zhong J. Ren B. Transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein in health and diseases.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 (29230213): 161210.3389/fimmu.2017.01612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Compared with age-matched WT controls, Chop showed a significant 12-fold up-regulation in 6-week-old PiZ mouse livers by real-time PCR (Fig. 1A). Greater Chop up-regulation was detected in 6-week-old compared with 36-week-old PiZ mouse livers (Fig. 1A). Increased expression of CHOP was confirmed at the protein level in 6- and 36-week-old PiZ mouse livers (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). Compared with WT controls, PiZ mouse livers showed increased CHOP levels by Western blot analysis also on nuclear extracts, although at lower levels compared with mice injected with tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress and CHOP expression (9Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9531536): 982-99510.1101/gad.12.7.982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). Increased nuclear CHOP in PiZ livers was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1D), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on microarray expression data (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed enrichment of up-regulated CHOP target genes compared with WT controls (enrichment score = 0.58) (Fig. S2, supporting data and Fig. 1E). Moreover, by immunohistochemistry, CHOP-positive nuclei were found in hepatocytes, but they were not detected in infiltrates of inflammatory cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, greater Chop expression was detected in the parenchymal cell fraction compared with nonparenchymal fraction obtained by liver perfusion of PiZ mice (Fig. 2, B and C).Figure 2CHOP expression detected in nuclei of hepatocytes but not of inflammatory infiltrating cells.

Tang Q. Gruntman A. Blomenkamp K. Teckman J. Song L. Zamore P.D. Flotte T.R. Sustained miRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant AAT with simultaneous augmentation of wild-type AAT has minimal effect on global liver miRNA profiles.Mol. Ther. J. Am. Soc. Gene Ther. 2012; 20 (22252449): 590-60010.1038/mt.2011.292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As controls, mice were injected with the same dose of an AAV8-CB-GFP expressing the GFP. By 4 weeks postinjection, mice injected with AAV8-CB-mir914 showed a reduction of hepatic ATZ by PAS-D staining (Fig. S3A), an ∼90% reduction of serum ATZ (Fig. S3B), and ∼50% reduction of Chop expression compared with mice injected with the control vector expressing GFP (Fig. S3, C and D). Taken together, these data support up-regulation and activation of CHOP in livers of mice expressing ATZ. To evaluate the role of CHOP in hepatic ATZ accumulation, we crossed PiZ mice with Chop−/− mice (9Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9531536): 982-99510.1101/gad.12.7.982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Chop−/− mice do not exhibit a substantial phenotype unless they are subjected to stress signals (9Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9531536): 982-99510.1101/gad.12.7.982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Compared with WT, PiZ mice have reduced weight (11Hubner R.H. Leopold P.L. Kiuru M. De B.P. Krause A. Crystal R.G. Dysfunctional glycogen storage in a mouse model of α1-antitrypsin deficiency.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 40: 239-24710.1165/rcmb.2008-0029OCCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but PiZ/Chop−/− mice showed greater weight compared with PiZ mice (Fig. S4). Serum ATZ in PiZ/Chop−/− mice was lower compared with PiZ mice at 6 weeks of age, but no differences were detected in 36-week-old PiZ/Chop−/− mice (Fig. 3A). Compared with PiZ, livers of 6-week-old PiZ/Chop−/− mice showed marked reduction of hepatic ATZ by PAS-D staining and immunofluorescence with anti-polymer antibody (Fig. 3B). However, neither PAS-D staining nor ATZ polymer immunofluorescence detected any difference in ATZ accumulation in livers of 36-week-old PiZ/Chop−/− mice compared with age-matched PiZ controls (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5). PiZ/Chop−/− mouse livers did not show increased apoptosis like PiZ controls, consistent with previous reports (12Lindblad D. Blomenkamp K. Teckman J. α1-Antitrypsin mutant Z protein content in individual hepatocytes correlates with cell death in a mouse model.Hepatology. 2007; 46 (17886264): 1228-123510.1002/hep.21822Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. S6). Targeted qPCR analysis showed down-regulation of SERPINA1 expression in PiZ/Chop−/− compared with age- and gender-matched 6-week-old PiZ mice, and consistent with liver ATZ content, no significant differences in SERPINA1 expression were detected in older mice (Fig. 3C). Although CHOP has been involved in liver fibrosis (13DeZwaan-McCabe D. Riordan J.D. Arensdorf A.M. Icardi M.S. Dupuy A.J. Rutkowski D.T. The stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes hepatic inflammatory gene expression, fibrosis, and oncogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 (24367269): e100393710.1371/journal.pgen.1003937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), compared with age-matched PiZ, liver fibrosis in 69-week-old PiZ/Chop−/− mice appeared to be unaffected by Sirius Red staining and expression of Col1a1, Timp1, and α-Sma (Fig. 3D and Fig. S7). Consistent with PAS-D staining and ATZ polymer immunofluorescence, compared with age-matched PiZ controls, PiZ/Chop−/− mice showed reduced ATZ protein by immunoblotting performed on soluble and insoluble fractions at 6 weeks of age but not at 36 weeks (Fig. 3E and Fig. S8). Unbiased RNA-Seq on liver RNA revealed that PiZ/Chop−/− exhibited a hepatic gene expression profile different from age- and gender-matched PiZ mice both at 6 and 36 weeks of age (Fig. S9). To specifically investigate the effect of CHOP on gene expression profiles of PiZ mice, we performed a comparison of all data sets, as shown by the VENN diagrams in which we evaluated differentially expressed genes obtained by three different comparisons: PiZ versus WT, PiZ/Chop−/− versus WT, and PiZ/Chop−/− versus PiZ at 6 and 36 weeks of age. This analysis allowed us to isolate only genes differentially expressed in PiZ versus WT and normalized to WT levels in PiZ/Chop−/− mice. Whereas at 36 weeks of age no differences in gene expression were detected, at 6 weeks of age, the analysis revealed 912 genes differentially expressed (468 up-regulated genes and 444 down-regulated genes, almost all in opposite correlation) in the intersection between PiZ versus WT and PiZ/Chop−/− versus PiZ (shown in red in Fig. 4A). Gene ontology functional analysis was performed by restricting the output to the biological processes in which differentially expressed genes (up- and down-regulated, separately) were functionally involved. This analysis showed several biological processes, mainly including ER stress, cell proliferation, and immune response for up-regulated genes and metabolic pathways for down-regulated genes among the most significant (enrichment score >1.5) (Figs. S10 and S11). Next, we dissected clusters relevant for the pathogenesis of liver disease induced by ATZ, including cell cycle, immune response, ER stress, cell death, and response to oxidative stress, that were up-regulated in PiZ mouse livers and normalized to WT levels in PiZ/Chop−/− mice (Fig. 4B and supporting data). In contrast, biological clusters of processes related to metabolic functions were down-regulated in PiZ mouse livers and normalized to WT levels in PiZ/Chop−/− mice (Fig. 4C and supporting data). Collectively, these data showed that deletion of Chop reduces expression of pathways involved ER in stress and immune response while restoring several metabolic functions induced by ATZ accumulation. CHOP is also involved in induction of autophagy genes, such as Atg5 and Atg7 upon nutrient deprivation (14B'chir W. Maurin A.-C. Carraro V. Averous J. Jousse C. Muranishi Y. Parry L. Stepien G. Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. The eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is essential for stress-induced autophagy gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23804767): 7683-769910.1093/nar/gkt563Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). However, RNA-Seq studies did not reveal changes in expression of autophagy genes. Human SERPINA1 gene contains regulatory elements at both the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR (15Kalsheker N. Morley S. Morgan K. Gene regulation of the serine proteinase inhibitors α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30 (12023832): 93-9810.1042/bst0300093Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As described previously, the 5′-UTR contains binding sites for AP-1 (shown in green in Fig. 5A) (15Kalsheker N. Morley S. Morgan K. Gene regulation of the serine proteinase inhibitors α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30 (12023832): 93-9810.1042/bst0300093Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CHOP can make stable heterodimers with the AP-1 complex (e.g. c-JUN and c-FOS), increasing AP-1–mediated gene expression without binding DNA (16Ubeda M. Vallejo M. Habener J.F. CHOP enhancement of gene transcription by interactions with Jun/Fos AP-1 complex proteins.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19 (10523647): 7589-759910.1128/mcb.19.11.7589Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate CHOP-mediated regulation of human SERPINA1 expression, we co-transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing CHOP and the pAAT-Luc-AAT-3′UTR plasmid, which contains the SERPINA1 regulatory elements included in PiZ transgenic mice (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (dashed line in Fig. 5A) upstream from the firefly luciferase coding region and human SERPINA1 3′-UTR. As positive control, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing c-JUN that transactivates luciferase expression, as shown previously (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Compared with cells co-transfected with the negative control, cells co-transfected with CHOP showed a mild increase in luciferase levels, suggesting that CHOP up-regulates SERPINA1 expression (Fig. 5B). In contrast, transfections of plasmids expressing c-FOS did not significantly increase luciferase expression (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of CHOP and c-JUN resulted in greater increase of luciferase levels compared with cells transfected with plasmids expressing each of the two transcription factors alone (Fig. 5B). Mutagenesis of site 2 but not site 1 of the AP-1–binding sites (shown in green in Fig. 5A) reduced luciferase expression after co-transfection of CHOP and c-JUN (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results show that site 2 of the AP-1–binding sites is required for transactivation by CHOP and c-JUN. Previous studies showed that CHOP forms a complex with c-JUN and enhances AP-1–mediated gene expression without direct binding to the DNA (16Ubeda M. Vallejo M. Habener J.F. CHOP enhancement of gene transcription by interactions with Jun/Fos AP-1 complex proteins.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19 (10523647): 7589-759910.1128/mcb.19.11.7589Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, protein co-immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged CHOP and MYC-tagged c-JUN showed that CHOP binds c-JUN (Fig. S12). However, we also found two putative binding sites for CHOP in the SERPINA1 5′-UTR (shown in red in Fig. 5A) (17Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Stress-induced binding of the transcriptional factor CHOP to a novel DNA control element.Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16 (8657121): 1479-148910.1128/mcb.16.4.1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were confirmed by real-time PCR on ChIP of PiZ mouse livers using an anti-CHOP antibody. CHOP-binding sites (shown in red in Fig. 5A) were indeed significantly enriched in PiZ mouse livers, whereas no enrichment was detected for AP-1–binding sites (shown in green in Fig. 5A) (Fig. 5D). As positive control of the ChIP with anti-CHOP antibody, p62 promoter region was found to be enriched in PiZ livers, whereas no signal was detected for the Rpl30 promoter used as negative control. Both CHOP-binding sites and the p62 promoter region were not enriched by ChIP with anti-CHOP antibody in PiZ/Chop−/− mouse livers (Fig. S13). Consistent with previous findings (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), enrichment of AP-1–binding site sequences (shown in green in Fig. 5A) was detected in the chromatin immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-c-JUN antibody, whereas no enrichment was detected for the Gapdh promoter region used as a negative control (Fig. S14). Mutagenesis of CHOP-binding site 2 and, to a significantly lower extent, of site 1 (shown in red in Fig. 5A) reduced luciferase expression after co-transfection of CHOP and c-JUN (Fig. 5E). Mutagenesis of CHOP-binding site 2 strongly reduced transactivation mediated by CHOP alone, whereas mutagenized AP-1 site 2 abrogated transactivation by CHOP (Fig. 5F). Altogether, these results show that CHOP binds to the SERPINA1 regulatory region and cooperates with c-JUN in regulating SERPINA1 expression. To interrogate the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated CHOP levels and activation in livers of PiZZ patients. In liver samples from PiZZ patients of less than 16 years of age with extensive PAS-D staining and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J. Wilson A.A. Ballabio A. Brunetti-Pierri N. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of hepatic mutant Z α1-antitrypsin.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (28073160): 1865-187410.1002/hep.29035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Table S1), increased CHOP nuclear signals were detected compared with controls (Fig. 6 and Fig. S15). Based on the mouse data, showing a role of CHOP in ATZ accumulation in younger mice but not in older animals, we investigated CHOP expression in PiZZ children with liver disease compared with PiZZ adults with liver disease. CHOP up-regulation was indeed found to be greater in children compared with adults (Fig. 7 and Table S2). Taken together, these results supported a role of CHOP in the pathogenesis of ATZ-related liver disease in children. AAT is an acute-phase reactant, and its circulating levels may rise several fold in response to several inflammatory stimuli and stress conditions (15Kalsheker N. Morley S. Morgan K. Gene regulation of the serine proteinase inhibitors α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30 (12023832): 93-9810.1042/bst0300093Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, in subjects carrying the Z allele, increased synthesis of ATZ augments the burden of mutant protein, which correlates with the degree of liver injury and fibrosis (18Clark V.C. Marek G. Liu C. Collinsworth A. Shuster J. Kurtz T. et al.Clinical and histologic features of adults with α1-antitrypsin deficiency in a non-cirrhotic cohort.J Hepatol. 2018; 69 (30138687): 1357-136410.1016/j.jhep.2018.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address the factors involved in the pathogenesis of the liver disease, most studies have been focused on ATZ protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy (19Perlmutter D.H. Pathogenesis of chronic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma in α1-antitrypsin deficiency.Pediatr. Res. 2006; 60 (16864711): 233-23810.1203/01.pdr.0000228350.61496.90Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the contribution of transcriptional regulation of SERPINA1 expression has been neglected for the most part. In this study, we found that CHOP is an important regulator of SERPINA1 expression; it is up-regulated and activated in livers of PiZ mice and PiZZ patients, and juvenile Chop-deleted mice show marked reduction of liver ATZ accumulation. Moreover, we found an important role of CHOP in regulating c-JUN–mediated up-regulation of SERPINA1. However, we also found that the lack of CHOP does not affect the progression of the hepatic disease because livers of older mice show ATZ accumulation and liver fibrosis similar to PiZ/Chop+/+ mice. Finally, we detected higher levels of CHOP in children with ATZ-related liver disease compared with adults. Whereas the precise factors responsible for its activation in livers expressing ATZ remain to be identified, CHOP was found to play an important role in aggravating ATZ accumulation in juvenile PiZ mice through transcriptional up-regulation of SERPINA1 expression. CHOP is an important player in the unfolded protein response and ER-stress response. Moreover, it is activated by several stimuli, such as amino acid and glucose deprivation, DNA damage, cellular growth arrest, and hypoxia (8Yang Y. Liu L. Naik I. Braunstein Z. Zhong J. Ren B. Transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein in health and diseases.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 (29230213): 161210.3389/fimmu.2017.01612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Fafournoux P.

Previous studies showed that cells expressing ATZ are more sensitive to activate ER stress after a second hit (21Ordóñez A. Snapp E.L. Tan L. Miranda E. Marciniak S.J. Lomas D.A. Endoplasmic reticulum polymers impair luminal protein mobility and sensitize to cellular stress in alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.Hepatology. 2013; 57: 2049-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also found previously that toxic accumulation of ATZ leads to dysfunctional liver zonation and metabolic alterations (22Piccolo P. Annunziata P. Soria L.R. Attanasio S. Barbato A. Castello R. Carissimo A. Quagliata L. Terracciano L.M. Brunetti-Pierri N.

Considering this evidence, we speculate that ATZ accumulation may induce such liver alterations, including perturbed metabolism, which in turn leads to CHOP activation. We previously found that JNK-mediated activation of c-JUN results in up-regulation of SERPINA1 in human and mouse livers expressing ATZ (7Pastore N. Attanasio S. Granese B. Castello R. Teckman J.

https://openalex.org/W3046017469,"This paper aims at designing coordination contract in a dual channel supply chain (DCSC) which consists of a socially responsible manufacturer and a retailer. We build stylized game models under both centralized and decentralized scenarios. Then, we identify the reason for supply chain inefficiency under decentralized scenario. Further, according to the manufacturer's corporate social responsibility (CSR) coefficient, we design two different contracts to achieve coordination. We find that with the impact of CSR, social welfare under centralized scenario is always higher than that under decentralized scenario. However, profit of the whole supply chain between the two scenarios has different relationship. More specifically, when CSR coefficient is relatively low, profit under centralized scenario is higher than that under decentralized scenario. When CSR coefficient is high, profit under centralized scenario is lower than that under decentralized scenario. Due to these two cases, we respectively design revenue sharing contract with franchise fee and wholesale price contract with franchise fee and government subsidy to achieve coordination. The result suggests that encouraging the manufacturer to bear CSR properly can reach a multi-win for social welfare, consumers and supply chain members through coordination contract. However, when CSR coefficient is higher than a certain threshold, conflict between supply chain members becomes irreconcilable which results in the retailer's resistance. In this condition, only through subsidy from government or philanthropic organization can supply chain members sustain their cooperation."

This study aims to establish a preclinical research model for EMPD. We transplanted EMPD tissue into immunodeficient NOD/Scid mice. Histopathological and genetic analyses using a comprehensive cancer panel were performed. For in vivo preclinical treatments, trastuzumab, lapatinib, docetaxel, or eribulin were administered to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Tissue transplanted from the EMPD patient was enlarged in NOD/Scid mice and was transplanted into further generations. Both the transplantation of PDX into nu/nu mice and the reanimation of the cryopreserved xenografted tumors in NOD/Scid mice were successful. We also established an EMPD-PDX-derived primary cell culture. Histopathologically, the xenografted tumors were positive for CK7, which was consistent with the patient’s tumors. Genetically, the pathogenic mutation ERBB2 S310F was detected in the patient’s tumors (primary intraepidermal lesion, metastatic lymph node) and was observed in the xenografted tumors even after continued passages. The xenografted tumors responded well to trastuzumab and lapatinib therapy. Also, cytotoxic agents (docetaxel and eribulin) were effective against the xenografted tumors. This PDX model (EMPD-PDX-H1) could be a powerful tool for the research and development of EMPD treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3046164575,"Cofilin is an actin filament severing protein necessary for fast actin turnover dynamics. Coronin and Aip1 promote cofilin-mediated actin filament disassembly, but the mechanism is somewhat controversial. An early model proposed that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 disassembled filaments in bursts. A subsequent study only reported severing. Here, we used EM to show that actin filaments convert directly into globular material. A monomer trap assay also shows that the combination of all three factors produces actin monomers faster than any two factors alone. We show that coronin accelerates the release of Pi from actin filaments and promotes highly cooperative cofilin binding to actin to create long stretches of polymer with a hypertwisted morphology. Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their sides, disintegrating them into monomers or short oligomers. The results are consistent with a catastrophic mode of disassembly, not enhanced severing alone."

https://openalex.org/W3035766507,"Although previous studies show that exogenous nutrients regulate the stem cell function, little is known about the effects of L-arginine on intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In this study, we utilize mice, small intestinal (SI) organoids, and ISC-Paneth cell co-cultured models to clarify the role of L-arginine in ISC function. We find that exogenous L-arginine is essential for ISCs proliferation and intestinal epithelial renewal. Our data show that Paneth cells, a critical component of the ISCs niche, augment the ISCs function in response to L-arginine. Moreover, enhanced the expression of Wnt3a in Paneth cells, which is a ligand of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, mediates the effects of L-arginine on ISCs function. Pre-treatment with L-arginine enhances the ISCs pool and protects the gut in response to injury provoked by murine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Our findings establish that the regulation of Wnt3a in the Paneth cell niche by exogenous L-arginine couples ISCs function and favours a model in which the ISCs niche couples the nutrient levels to ISCs function."
https://openalex.org/W3045551093,"Craniofacial asymmetry, mandibular condylar modeling and temporomandibular joint disorders are common comorbidities of skeletally disproportionate malocclusions, but etiology of occurrence together is poorly understood. We compared asymmetry, condyle modeling stability and temporomandibular health in a cohort of 128 patients having orthodontics and orthognathic surgery to correct dentofacial deformity malocclusions. We also compared ACTN3 and ENPP1 genotypes for association to clinical conditions. Pre-surgical posterior-anterior cephalometric and panometric radiographic analyses; jaw pain and function questionnaire and clinical examination of TMD; and SNP-genotype analysis from saliva samples were compared to assess interrelationships. Almost half had asymmetries in need of surgical correction, which could be subdivided into four distinct morphological patterns. Asymmetric condyle modeling between sides was significantly greater in craniofacial asymmetry, but most commonly had an unanticipated pattern. Often, longer or larger condyles occurred on the shorter mandibular ramus side. Subjects with longer ramus but dimensionally smaller condyles were more likely to have self-reported TMD symptoms (p = 0.023) and significantly greater clinical diagnosis of TMD (p = 0 .000001), with masticatory myalgia most prominent. Genotyping found two significant genotype associations for ACTN3 rs1671064 (Q523R missense) p = 0.02; rs678397 (intronic SNP) p = 0.04 and one significant allele association rs1815739 (R577X nonsense) p = 0.00. Skeletal asymmetry, unusual condyle modeling and TMD are common and interrelated components of many dentofacial deformities. Imbalanced musculoskeletal functional adaptations and genetic or epigenetic influences contribute to the etiology, and require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3036769656,"Free fatty acid 2 receptor (FFA2) is highly expressed on neutrophils and, when activated by its cognate ligand acetate, generates potent anti-inflammatory activities. The roles of FFA2 and acetate have not been explored in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We therefore examined the function of FFA2 and the therapeutic potential of acetate to reduce tissue injury in an acute model of intestinal IRI. The superior mesenteric artery of wild-type (WT) and FFA2−/− mice was briefly occluded then reperfused following treatment with acetate or vehicle. The absence of FFA2 resulted in intestinal injury similar to that observed in WT mice, indicating a minimal causal role for FFA2 in this model. Acetate treatment to WT mice prior to ischemia profoundly protected the intestine from IRI-induced damage. Amelioration of IRI was also observed, although to a lesser extent, when acetate was administered to FFA2−/− mice demonstrating that certain protective effects of acetate were FFA2-independent. Remarkably, despite the lack of tissue damage following IRI, acetate-treated mice had markedly increased neutrophil infiltration to the reperfused intestine which was dependent on FFA2. These studies reveal a minimal causal role for FFA2 in intestinal IRI but highlight the novel therapeutic potential for acetate in the amelioration of ischemia-mediated tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W3046168304,"Prion disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by misfolding and aggregation of the prion protein (PrP), and there are currently no therapeutic options. PrP ligands could theoretically antagonize prion formation by protecting the native protein from misfolding or by targeting it for degradation, but no validated small-molecule binders have been discovered to date. We deployed a variety of screening methods in an effort to discover binders of PrP, including 19F-observed and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), DNA-encoded library selection, and in silico screening. A single benzimidazole compound was confirmed in concentration-response, but affinity was very weak (Kd > 1 mm), and it could not be advanced further. The exceptionally low hit rate observed here suggests that PrP is a difficult target for small-molecule binders. Whereas orthogonal binder discovery methods could yield high-affinity compounds, non-small-molecule modalities may offer independent paths forward against prion disease."
https://openalex.org/W3045632433,"Little data is available on the long-term psychosocial effects of disclosure of HIV status that may occur in late adolescence, even when disclosure is timely. Moreover, few studies have described the post-disclosure psychosocial needs of older adolescents who experience delayed disclosure. This study sought to address existing knowledge gaps in the post-disclosure experiences and psychosocial needs of older adolescents living with HIV (ALWHIV).We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) among older perinatally infected adolescents aged 16-19 years We collected socio-demographic data and baseline viral load (copies/ml) results for the preceding six months using interviewer-administered questionnaires and clinical notes abstraction. We analysed data inductively and deductively to identify themes related to the experiences and expectations of adolescents with the disclosure and post-disclosure period.Adolescents who reported having received timely disclosure expressed that as they grew older, they began to comprehend the lifelong repercussions of an HIV diagnosis and experienced a re-emergence of the negative feelings similar to those experienced during the post-disclosure period. Those who received the knowledge of their HIV status during late adolescence experienced prolonged periods of negative self-perception and anger at not receiving their HIV status earlier. They also expressed a need for more information during the disclosure process on the prevention of onward transmission of the virus, safe conception practices resulting in HIV negative children, and information on how to disclose their HIV status to sexual partners or peers. Anticipated stigma was experienced universally by these older adolescents and was a major barrier towards adherence and coping with an HIV status. Caregivers or siblings with a similar HIV status were a source of social support. Adolescents felt that the support of peers (ALWHIV) helped them to accept their HIV status and to learn how to develop a positive outlook on life.Provision of psychosocial care in late adolescence during the transition to adult care is critical in ensuring the resolution of re-emergent negative emotions. Comprehensive information on HIV prevention and sexual reproductive health should be a crucial component of post-disclosure care for older adolescents. HIV Disclosure and adolescent transition guidelines should include these components to optimize psychosocial care for older adolescents."

SidA is an N-monooxygenase that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of l-ornithine through a multistep oxidative mechanism, utilizing a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Here we present four new crystal structures of SidA in various redox and ligation states, including the first structure of oxidized SidA without NADP(H) or l-ornithine bound (resting state). The resting state structure reveals a new out active site conformation characterized by large rotations of the FAD isoalloxazine around the C1–′C2′ and N10–C1′ bonds, coupled to a 10-Å movement of the Tyr-loop. Additional structures show that either flavin reduction or the binding of NADP(H) is sufficient to drive the FAD to the in conformation. The structures also reveal protein conformational changes associated with the binding of NADP(H) and l-ornithine. Some of these residues were probed using site-directed mutagenesis. Docking was used to explore the active site of the out conformation. These calculations identified two potential ligand-binding sites.

Knockout of the SidA gene in A. fumigatus renders the fungus unable to cause disease in mouse models, suggesting that SidA is a good target for therapeutic intervention (1Hissen A.H. Wan A.N.

Because humans and animals lack the SidA gene, the inhibition of an equivalent host enzyme is not a restricting factor during treatment or prophylactic use. SidA is essential for A. fumigatus virulence because it is required for siderophore-dependent iron acquisition (8Martín Del Campo J.S. Vogelaar N. Tolani K. Kizjakina K. Harich K. Sobrado P.

Iron in the host organism is sequestered by iron-binding proteins, making it a restricted nutrient for A. fumigatus and other invasive organisms to acquire (9Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Bacterial iron sources: from siderophores to hemophores.Annu.l Rev.

Fungi and other infectious organisms have specific metabolic pathways to produce iron-chelating molecules called siderophores (9Wandersman C. Delepelaire P.

This is a key step, because the hydroxyl group added in the SidA reaction is part of the iron-chelating hydroxamate group of the mature siderophore (Fig. S1). Without the SidA step, the siderophore lacks three of the six oxygen ligands to iron, which would significantly reduce the affinity. The essential role of SidA in siderophore biosynthesis makes it an attractive drug target to impair iron uptake by pathogens (8Martín Del Campo J.S. Vogelaar N. Tolani K. Kizjakina K. Harich K.

SidA is an N-hydroxylating flavin-dependent monooxygenase (NMO) and belongs to a family of enzymes that hydroxylate soft nucleophiles such as the primary amines of lysine and ornithine (14Badieyan S.

SidA is a class B flavin monooxygenase, which is characterized by both a high selectivity for its substrate and by NADP+ remaining bound throughout most of the catalytic cycle (Scheme 2) (as opposed to the class A family which are more promiscuous and release NADP+ upon reduction of the flavin) (15Huijbers M.M.

SidA contains a tightly bound FAD, which is oxidized in the ligand-free resting state. The catalytic cycle is initiated by the binding of NADPH, resulting in the reduction of the FAD (Scheme 2) (2Chocklett S.W. Sobrado P. Aspergillus fumigatus SidA is a highly specific ornithine hydroxylase with bound flavin cofactor.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20614882): 6777-678310.1021/bi100291nCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Badieyan S.

The FADred-NADP+ complex reacts with molecular oxygen to form a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin (FADOOH), with NADP+ remaining bound to the enzyme to stabilize the FADOOH and thereby preventing H2O2 release (i.e. uncoupling) (16Palfey B.A. McDonald C.A. Control of catalysis in flavin-dependent monooxygenases.Arch. Biochem.

PvdA and KtzI are 37.3% and 33.7% identical in sequence to SidA, respectively, and the three enzymes share a conserved fold and tetrameric structure. The protein fold is composed of three domains: an ornithine binding domain and two Rossmann fold domains, one of which binds FAD and the other NADP(H). The domains are arranged to bring together the re-face of isoalloxazine of the FAD, the nicotinamide of NADP(H), and the N5 atom of ornithine for catalysis. These structures have provided information about residues that contribute to substrate and cofactor recognition and insight into the catalytic mechanism. Motion of the flavin is an important aspect of some flavoenzymes. For example, it has been well established in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, and other related enzymes, that substrate binding induces flavin motion to an exposed position, where it can react with NADPH (16Palfey B.A. McDonald C.A. Control of catalysis in flavin-dependent monooxygenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 493 (19944667): 26-3610.1016/j.abb.2009.11.028Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Crozier-Reabe K.

Also, the flavins in some flavin switch proteins exhibit large redox-linked conformational changes (24Becker D.F. Zhu W. Moxley M.A. Flavin redox switching of protein functions.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14 (21028987): 1079-109110.1089/ars.2010.3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Evidence for flavin dynamics is also emerging for ornithine hydroxylases (22Setser J.W.

The SidA structures all show the FAD in a conserved well-ordered state, which will hereafter be termed the in conformation. In this conformation the si-face of the isoalloxazine is buried and the re-face is primed for catalysis. All previously determined SidA structures show the flavin in this in position, regardless of oxidation state or bound ligands (Table S1). The in position of the flavin was also observed in PvdA structures in both the oxidized and reduced states (Table S1) (19Olucha J. Lamb A.L.

They also showed that the flavin redox state controls movement between the in and out conformations (Table S1). This work suggested that flavin dynamics may be an important aspect of the catalytic mechanism of ornithine hydroxylases. Here we report a new crystal form of SidA that enabled us to capture a new conformation of the FAD and investigate the dependence of the FAD conformation on redox state and ligand binding. Four crystal structures of SidA in different redox and ligation states are reported at high resolution limits of 1.95–2.34 Å (Table 1 and Table S2).

Open table in a new tab The structure of ligand-free oxidized SidA in a new P21 crystal form was determined at 2.09Å resolution. This structure represents the resting state of the enzyme, prior to the binding of NADPH. The color of the crystal used for data collection was yellow, consistent with the oxidized state, and no reducing agent was included during crystallization and cryoprotection. The electron density map clearly indicated the conformation of the FAD (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the isoalloxazine conformation is much different from all previous SidA structures (Fig. 1B). In the new conformation, the re-face of the isoalloxazine is buried by the protein, whereas the si-face stacks against Tyr324 (Fig. 1B). Thus, neither face is available for catalysis. The new structure also shows protein conformational changes that accompany movement of the isoalloxazine. The largest of these involves Tyr324, which moves by 10 Å. The new conformation of the FAD is similar to the out conformation described for KtzI (22Setser J.W. Heemstra Jr, J.R. Walsh C.T. Drennan C.L. Crystallographic evidence of drastic conformational changes in the active site of a flavin-dependent N-hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25184411): 6063-607710.1021/bi500655qCrossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The movement of the FAD between the in and out conformations appears to involve rotations around two dihedral angles, one of ∼90° around the C1′–C2′ bond and another of ∼180° around the N10–C1′ bond (Fig. 1C). The net result is that the pyrimidine edge moves by 9.5 Å, although the ribityl chain hydroxyl groups are left undisturbed. Crystal soaking and co-crystallization were used to identify conditions that induce movement of the FAD to the in conformation observed in all previous SidA structures. Soaking crystals of oxidized, ligand-free SidA with sodium dithionite and l-Orn bleached the yellow color of the crystals, consistent with flavin reduction. In the resulting structure, the isoalloxazine has rotated to the in conformation and Tyr324 has shifted away from the active site (Fig. 2B). Electron density for l-Orn is strong and indicates binding in the expected conformation (Fig. S2C). Similarly, SidA crystals grown in the presence of NADP+ also show the in conformation of the active site (Fig. 2C). The in conformation was modeled at 100% occupancy in three chains of the asymmetric unit, whereas the density was consistent with dual occupancy of the in and out conformations in chain C (53% in, 47% out). Electron density for NADP+ was strong in all four chains, and the ligand was modeled in the conformation observed in other SidA structures (Fig. S2B). Finally, a crystal of the SidAox-NADP+ complex was soaked with NADPH and l-Orn. Soaking bleached the yellow color of the crystals, indicating that NADPH had displaced NADP+ and reduced the flavin. The structure shows that the in conformation was maintained in all subunits (Fig. 2D). Altogether, the structures show that either flavin reduction or cofactor binding is sufficient to promote movement of the FAD from out to in, and that Tyr324 moves in concert with the FAD (Fig. 3A). We note that Tyr324 is part of the Tyr-loop (Asn323-FTyr324-Ser325), which is highly conserved among ornithine hydroxylase sequences (see alignment in Fig. S3). The transition from out to in dramatically changes the structural relationship between Tyr324 and the FAD. In the out conformation, the two make intimate contact of 3.3 Å (Fig. 3B), whereas they are 9.4 Å apart in the in conformation (Fig. 3C). The stacking of Tyr324 against the isoalloxazine in the out conformation appears to block the isoalloxazine's path to the in conformation, necessitating a concerted 10-Å movement of Tyr324 to allow the FAD to rotate around its C1′–C2′ and N10–C1′ bonds into the in conformation. Movement of Tyr324 is also required for the binding of NADPH. In the out conformation of the active site, the stacking pose of Tyr324 occupies the nicotinamide binding site, necessitating a conformational change to allow cofactor binding (Fig. 3D). By capturing the first structure of SidA in the absence of NADP(H) and l-Orn, we are able to describe the protein conformational changes that accompany cofactor and substrate binding. In addition to Tyr324 described above, notable movements involve Asn323 and Ser325 of the Tyr-loop. Ser325 rotates 130° around its χ angle upon NADP(H) binding to enable hydrogen bonding with the adenosine phosphate of NADP(H) (Fig. 4, C and D). The conformational changes for Asn323 are more complex than a simple side-chain rotation. The binding of either l-Orn or NADP+ is accompanied by stabilization of Asn323. Electron density for this residue is very weak in three of the subunits of the SidAox structure, implying high mobility in the absence of ligands. In contrast, Asn323 has strong electron density and a well-defined conformation when either NADP+ or l-Orn is present. The stabilization of Asn323 likely reflects the hydrogen bonds it forms with the nicotinamide ribose of NADP(H) and the δ-amino group of l-Orn (Fig. 4, B–D). Conformational changes in residues near the Tyr-loop are also observed. Asn293 (near Asn323) rotates to hydrogen-bond to the backbone of l-Orn (Fig. 4, A to B and C to D). Also, Arg279 (near Ser325) rotates to ion-pair with the adenosine phosphate of the cofactor (Fig. 4, A to C). The resting states (oxidized, ligand-free) of SidAox and KtzIox (Protein Data Bank Entry 4TM3) share similarities in the positioning of the active site residues and the flavin (Fig. 5, A, E, and H). In both structures, the oxidized flavin is in the out position with the re-face of the FAD buried and the si-face stacking with a tyrosine (Tyr324 in SidA, Tyr276 in KtzI). This shows a conserved active site structure in the resting state of the two ornithine hydroxylases. The pre-turnover reduced states of SidA and KtzI are also very similar. This state is represented by the structures of SidAred-NADPH-Orn and KtzIred-NADP-Orn (Protein Data Bank Entry 4TLX). In both structures, the flavin is in and the Tyr-loop has been displaced by the NADP(H) cofactor (Fig. 5, C, G, and J). Curiously, the structures of the oxidized enzymes with NADP+ are different. SidAox-NADP+ has the FAD in (Fig. 5B), whereas KtzIox-NADP+-Orn has the FAD out (Fig. 5F). In both structures the Tyr-loop makes an obligatory shift away from the active site to avoid a steric clash with NADP+. These two structures reveal different factors that induce the movement of the isoalloxazine ring. In SidA, we see that the oxidized FAD moves in with NADP+ binding and the nicotinamide of NADP+ stacks with the re-face of the isoalloxazine. This suggests that for SidA, cofactor binding can induce the movement of the FAD into the active conformation. In KtzI, the FAD remains out even upon cofactor binding. The authors attributed the out position of the flavin to its oxidized state and suggested that reduction was required to move the FAD to the in conformation (22Setser J.W. Heemstra Jr, J.R. Walsh C.T. Drennan C.L. Crystallographic evidence of drastic conformational changes in the active site of a flavin-dependent N-hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25184411): 6063-607710.1021/bi500655qCrossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the timing of flavin motion may differ in the two enzymes. As discussed below, our results suggest that the hydride transfer step in SidA could occur with the FAD in an out conformation. We investigated residues that the structures suggest could be important in movement between the in and out active site conformations. The stacking residue Tyr324 was mutated to Ala (Y324A) and Phe (Y324F). Mutation to Ala appears to negatively impact protein folding/solubility, because we were unable to recover any soluble Y324A protein for analysis. Y324F was soluble and exhibited kinetic parameters substantially different from WT. The kcat measured in the oxygen consumption assay was decreased 3-fold, whereas the Km values for l-Orn and NADPH were increased by ∼10-fold (Table 2). Thus, the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of Y324F are ∼30 times lower than WT. We note that removing the hydroxyl of Tyr324 impacts the kinetic parameters much more than removing the side chain of Asn323, a residue that hydrogen-bonds to both NADPH and l-Orn (N323A, Table 2). In particular, the catalytic efficiency of N323A for NADPH is essentially unchanged from WT, whereas that of Y324F is 35 times lower.Table 2Kinetic parametersaThe kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, were obtained from oxygen consumption assays.

This study investigates how nesting habitat will likely be lost and altered with various increases in sea level, using global sea level rise (SLR) predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Beach profiling datasets from Bioko’s five southern nesting beaches were used in GIS to create models to estimate habitat loss with predicted increases in sea level by years 2046–2065 and 2081–2100. The models indicate that an average of 62% of Bioko’s current nesting habitat could be lost by 2046–2065 and 87% by the years 2081–2100. Our results show that different study beaches showed different levels of vulnerability to increases in SLR. In addition, on two beaches erosion and tall vegetation berms have been documented, causing green turtles to nest uncharacteristically in front of the vegetation line. We also report that development plans are currently underway on the beach least susceptible to future increases in sea level, highlighting how anthropogenic encroachment combined with SLR can be particularly detrimental to nesting turtle populations. Identified habitat sensitivities to SLR will be used to inform the government of Equatorial Guinea to consider the vulnerability of their resident turtle populations and projected climate change implications when planning for future development. To our knowledge this is the first study to predict the impacts of SLR on a sea turtle nesting habitat in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3046157566,"Lately, Drosophila has been favored as a model in sleep and circadian rhythm research due to its conserved mechanism and easily manageable operation. These studies have revealed the sophisticated parameters in whole-day sleep profiles of Drosophila, drawing connections between Drosophila sleep and human sleep. In this study, we tested several sleep deprivation protocols (mechanical shakes and light interruptions) on Drosophila and delineated their influences on Drosophila sleep. We applied a daytime light-deprivation protocol (DD) mimicking jet-lag to screen drugs that alleviate sleep deprivation. Characteristically, classical sleep-aid compounds exhibited different forms of influence: phenobarbital and pentobarbital modified total sleep time, while melatonin only shortened the latency to sleep. Such results construct the basis for further research on sleep benefits in other treatments in Drosophila. We screened seven herb extracts, and found very diverse results regarding their effect on sleep regulation. For instance, Panax notoginseng and Withania somnifera extracts displayed potent influence on total sleep time, while Melissa officinalis increased the number of sleep episodes. By comparing these treatments, we were able to rank drug potency in different aspects of sleep regulation. Notably, we also confirmed the presence of sleep difficulties in a Drosophila Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model with an overexpression of human Abeta, and recognized clear differences between the portfolios of drug screening effects in AD flies and in the control group. Overall, potential drug candidates and receipts for sleep problems can be identified separately for normal and AD Drosophila populations, outlining Drosophila’s potential in drug screening tests in other populations if combined with the use of other genetic disease tools."
https://openalex.org/W4253238251,"Objectives To assess the potential value of some miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to identify other risk factors for MCI among them. Methods This study enrolled 163 adults with T2DM using face to face interview. Cognitive function with its domains was assessed using Adenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACE III). Lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin, and miR-128, miR-132, miR- 874, miR-134, miR-323, and miR-382 expressions, using quantitative real-time PCR, were assessed. Results MCI was detected among 59/163 (36.2%) patients with T2DM. Plasma expression of miR-132 was significantly higher in T2DM patients with MCI compared to those without MCI and to normal cognitive healthy individuals (median = 2, 1.1 and 1.2 respectively, P < 0.05. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher miR-132 expression with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.2 (95% CI 1.0–1.3), female gender (AOR:2.1; 95%CI 1.0–4.3), education below postgraduate (secondary and university education with AOR: 9.5 & 19.4 respectively) were the significant predicting factors for MCI among T2DM patients. Using ROC curve, miR-132 was the only assayed miRNA that significantly differentiates T2DM patients with MCI from those with normal cognition with 72.3% sensitivity, 56.2% specificity, and 63.8% accuracy (P < 0.05). Other studied miRNAs showed lower sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI among studied T2DM participants. Conclusion MCI affects nearly one-third of adult patients with T2DM. A significantly over expression of miR-132 was detected among T2DM with MCI compared to those with normal cognition."

Data extraction A total of 743 articles were included for final analysis. Bibliographic data were exported from databases and then cleaned manually before using Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer to analyze and visualize the findings. Data synthesis It was found that 743 articles have been cited 31515 times (h-index: 98). The volume of publications increased by 29.3 times in the past two decades. Across the globe, Sweden was the most prolific country having 129 articles (17.4%) with six of its institutions in the top ten most prolific institutions in the world. Fifty-two (7.8%) documents were published in Midwifery journal. The most prolific author was Hildingsson, who published 35 articles (4.7%). “Cesarean section,” “experience,” and “factor” were the words that appeared most frequently in titles and abstracts of studies. “Point prevalence of psychiatric disorders during the second trimester of pregnancy: A population-based study” was the most cited article and received 525 citations. Conclusion There is an increasing interest in the research in fear of childbirth during the past two decades. This study has demonstrated that the Swedish authors have a leading role on this topic. Researchers especially in countries with high birth rates, need to promote research projects in this field as it is an important public health issue."
https://openalex.org/W3045568408,"There are several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that neutralize influenza viruses with different mechanisms from traditional polyclonal antibodies induced by vaccination. CT149, which is one of the broadly neutralizing antibodies, was also previously reported to neutralize group 2 and some of group 1 influenza viruses (13 out of 13 tested group 2 viruses and 5 out of 11 group 1 viruses). In this study, we developed another antibody with the aim of compensating partial coverage of CT149 against group 1 influenza viruses. CT120 was screened among different antibody candidates and mixed with CT149. Importantly, although the binding sites of CT120 and CT149 are close to each other, the two antibodies do not interfere. The mixture of CT120 and CT149, which we named as CT-P27, showed broad efficacy by neutralizing 37 viruses from 11 different subtypes, of both group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses. Moreover, CT-P27 showed in vivo therapeutic efficacy, long prophylactic potency, and synergistic effect with oseltamivir in influenza virus-challenged mouse models. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for more efficient treatment of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W3045794062,"ADP-ribosylhydrolase-like 1 (Adprhl1) is a pseudoenzyme expressed in the developing heart myocardium of all vertebrates. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, knockdown of the two cardiac Adprhl1 protein species (40 and 23 kDa) causes failure of chamber outgrowth but this has only been demonstrated using antisense morpholinos that interfere with RNA-splicing. Transgenic production of 40 kDa Adprhl1 provides only part rescue of these defects. CRISPR/Cas9 technology now enables targeted mutation of the adprhl1 gene in G0-generation embryos with routine cleavage of all alleles. Testing multiple gRNAs distributed across the locus reveals exonic locations that encode critical amino acids for Adprhl1 function. The gRNA recording the highest frequency of a specific ventricle outgrowth phenotype directs Cas9 cleavage of an exon 6 sequence, where microhomology mediated end-joining biases subsequent DNA repairs towards three small in-frame deletions. Mutant alleles encode discrete loss of 1, 3 or 4 amino acids from a di-arginine (Arg271-Arg272) containing peptide loop at the centre of the ancestral ADP-ribosylhydrolase site. Thus despite lacking catalytic activity, it is the modified (adenosine-ribose) substrate binding cleft of Adprhl1 that fulfils an essential role during heart formation. Mutation results in striking loss of myofibril assembly in ventricle cardiomyocytes. The defects suggest Adprhl1 participation from the earliest stage of cardiac myofibrillogenesis and are consistent with previous MO results and Adprhl1 protein localization to actin filament Z-disc boundaries. A single nucleotide change to the gRNA sequence renders it inactive. Mice lacking Adprhl1 exons 3–4 are normal but production of the smaller ADPRHL1 species is unaffected, providing further evidence that cardiac activity is concentrated at the C-terminal protein portion."
https://openalex.org/W3045898182,"Patient satisfaction is an important indicator of health care quality, and it remains an important goal for optimal treatment outcomes to reduce the level of misdiagnoses and inappropriate or absent therapeutic actions. Digital support tools for differential diagnosis to assist clinicians in reaching the correct diagnosis may be helpful, but how the use of these affect patients is not clear. The primary objective of this feasibility study was to investigate patient experience and satisfaction in a primary care setting where general practitioners (GPs) used a visual clinical decision support system (CDSS) compared with standard consultations. Secondary objectives were diagnostic accuracy and length of consultation. Thirty-one patients with a dermatologist-confirmed skin diagnosis were allocated to consult GPs that had been randomized to conduct either standard consultations (SDR, n = 21) or CDSS (n = 16) on two separate study days one week apart. All patients were diagnosed independently by multiple GPs (n = 3–8) in both the SDR and CDSS study arms. Using the CDSS, more patients felt involved in the decision making (P = 0.05). In addition, more patients were exposed to images during the consultations (P = 6.8e-27), and 83% of those that were shown images replied they felt better supported in the consultation. The use of CDSS significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy (34%, P = 0.007), and did not increase the duration of the consultation (median 10 minutes in both arms). This study shows for the first time that compared with standard GP consultations, CDSS assist the GP on skin related diagnoses and improve patient satisfaction and diagnostic accuracy without impacting the duration of the consultations. This is likely to increase correct treatment choices, patient adherence, and overall result in better healthcare outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3046206075,"Darwinian sexual selection theory holds that mate selection occurs inter-sexually, and mate competition occurs intra-sexually for opposite-sex partners. We demonstrate that inter-sexual mate competition can also occur among humans at appreciable rates that vary by culture. In Canada, inter-sexual mate competition was both rare and inconsequential. However, data from two disparate non-Western cultures—Samoa and the Istmo Zapotec (Oaxaca, Mexico)—show that women frequently compete with feminine same-sex attracted males to acquire and maintain masculine male mates (i.e., men). Inter-sexual mate competition most commonly involved feminine males attempting to poach women’s masculine male sexual partners. During these interactions, women and feminine males both attempted to manipulate the man who was the object of sexual competition; feminine males attempted to entice the target man, whereas women engaged in guarding and emotionally punitive behaviours. We do not anticipate that inter-sexual mate competition will be common in most species or across all cultures. However, when males and females prefer the same sexual partners, who themselves behave in a bisexual manner, then inter-sexual mate competition can ensue."
https://openalex.org/W2914148577,"The classical complement pathway is triggered when antigen-bound immunoglobulins bind to C1q through their Fc region. While C1q binds to a single Fc with low affinity, a higher avidity stable binding of two or more of C1q globular heads initiates the downstream reactions of the complement cascade ultimately resulting in bacteriolysis. Synergistic bactericidal activity has been demonstrated when monoclonal antibodies recognize nonoverlapping epitopes of the same antigen. The aim of the present work was to investigate the synergistic effect between antibodies directed toward different antigens. To this purpose, we investigated the bactericidal activity induced by combinations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against factor H-binding protein (fHbp) and Neisserial Heparin-Binding Antigen (NHBA), two major antigens included in Bexsero, the vaccine against Meningococcus B, for prevention from this devastating disease in infants and adolescents. Collectively, our results show that mAbs recognizing different antigens can synergistically activate complement even when each single Mab is not bactericidal, reinforcing the evidence that cooperative immunity induced by antigen combinations can represent a remarkable added value of multicomponent vaccines. Our study also shows that the synergistic effect of antibodies is modulated by the nature of the respective epitopes, as well as by the antigen density on the bacterial cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W3036134787,"The rs6647 variant G allele in SERPINA1 gene was reported to be associated with the risk of large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS), however, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we performed a functional annotation of the rs6647 variant by using the software HaploReg version 4.1 (HaploReg v4.1). Next, the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analysis of multiple datasets was conducted for determining the association between the rs6647 and SERPINA1 expression in various tissues. Then, a case-control gene expression analysis was done using two independent ischemic stroke (IS) gene expression datasets. Finally, SERPINA1 expression in whole blood samples from 8 LAS patients and 14 healthy persons were compared. The functional annotation suggested that the rs6647 regulates gene expression in multiple human tissues especially in brain and blood. The eQTLs analysis revealed a significant association of the rs6647 G allele with increased expression of SERPINA1 gene only in whole blood. Compared with the controls, there was an increased expression of SERPINA1 gene in whole blood in both IS patients and LAS patients. SERPINA1 gene expression in whole blood bridges the rs6647 variant G allele with increased LAS risk, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying role of the rs6647 in determining LAS risk."
https://openalex.org/W3045620863,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell membrane-derived phospholipid bilayer nanostructures that contain bioactive proteins, enzymes, lipids and polymers of nucleotides. They play a role in intercellular communication and are present in body fluids. EVs can be isolated by methods like ultracentrifugation (UC), polyethylene-glycol-precipitation (PEG) or size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The co-presence of immunoglobulins (Ig) in EV samples isolated from plasma (pEVs) is often reported and this may influence the assessment of the biological function and phenotype of EVs in bio- and immunoassay. Here, we studied the presence of an Ig-based therapeutic (etanercept) in pEV samples isolated from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and improved the isolation method to obtain purer pEVs. From plasma of etanercept (Tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-α antibodies)-treated RA patients pEVs were isolated by either UC, PEG or SEC. SEC isolated pEVs showed the highest particle-to-protein ratio. Strong TNF-α inhibition determined in a TNF-α sensitive reporter assay was observed by pEVs isolated by UC and PEG, and to a lesser extent by SEC, suggesting the presence of functional etanercept. SEC isolation of etanercept or labelled immunoglobulin G (IgG) showed co-isolation of these antibodies in the pEV fraction in the presence of plasma or a high protein (albumin) concentration. To minimize the presence of etanercept or immunoglobulins, we extended SEC (eSEC) column length from 56mm to 222mm (total stacking volume unchanged). No effect on the amount of isolated pEVs was observed while protein and IgG content were markedly reduced (90%). Next, from six etanercept- treated RA patients, pEVs were isolated on a eSEC or standard SEC column, in parallel. TNF-α inhibition was again observed in pEVs isolated by conventional SEC but not by eSEC. To confirm the purer pEVs isolated by eSEC the basal IL-8 promoter activation in human monocytes was determined and in 4 out of 5 SEC isolated pEVs activation was observed while eSEC isolated pEVs did not. This study shows that extended SEC columns yielded pEVs without detectable biologicals and with low protein and IgG levels. This isolation method will improve the characterization of pEVs as potential biomarkers and mediators of disease."
https://openalex.org/W3046039143,"The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is an important crop in Malaysia but its productivity is hampered by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Recent studies suggest the importance of signalling molecules in plants in coping against stresses, which includes thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine is an essential microelement that is synthesized de novo by plants and microorganisms. The active form of thiamine, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), plays a prominent role in metabolic activities particularly as an enzymatic cofactor. Recently, thiamine biosynthesis pathways in oil palm have been characterised but the search of novel regulatory element known as riboswitch is yet to be done. Previous studies showed that thiamine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by an RNA element known as riboswitch. Riboswitch binds a small molecule, resulting in a change in production of the proteins encoded by the mRNA. TPP binds specifically to TPP riboswitch to regulate thiamine biosynthesis through a variety of mechanisms found in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. This study was carried out to hunt for TPP riboswitch in oil palm thiamine biosynthesis gene. Riboswitch detection software like RiboSW, RibEx, Riboswitch Scanner and Denison Riboswitch Detector were utilised in order to locate putative TPP riboswitch in oil palm ThiC gene sequence that encodes for the first enzyme in the pyrimidine branch of the pathway. The analysis revealed a 192 bp putative TPP riboswitch located at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA. Further comparative gene analysis showed that the 92-nucleotide aptamer region, where the metabolite binds was conserved inter-species. The secondary structure analysis was also carried out using Mfold Web server and it showed a stem-loop structure manifested with stems (P1-P5) with minimum free energy of -12.26 kcal/mol. Besides that, the interaction of riboswitch and its ligand was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and it yielded an exothermic reaction with 1:1 stoichiometry interaction with binding affinities of 0.178 nM, at 30°C. To further evaluate the ability of riboswitch to control the pathway, exogenous thiamine was applied to four months old of oil palm seedlings and sampling of spear leaves tissue was carried out at days 0, 1, 2 and 3 post-treatment for expression analysis of ThiC gene fragment via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results showed an approximately 5-fold decrease in ThiC gene expression upon application of exogenous thiamine. Quantification of thiamine and its derivatives was carried out via HPLC and the results showed that it was correlated to the down regulation of ThiC gene expression. The application of exogenous thiamine to oil palm affected ThiC gene expression, which supported the prediction of the presence of TPP riboswitch in the gene. Overall, this study provides the first evidence on the presence, binding and the functionality of TPP riboswitch in oil palm. This study is hoped to pave a way for better understanding on the regulation of thiamine biosynthesis pathway in oil palm, which can later be exploited for various purposes especially in manipulation of thiamine biosynthesis pathways in combating stresses in oil palm."
https://openalex.org/W3045534239,"Introduction Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) include a wide variety of chronic progressive pulmonary diseases characterized by lung inflammation, fibrosis and hypoxemia and can progress to respiratory failure and even death. ILDs are associated with varying degrees of quality of life impairments in affected people. Studies on the quality of life in patients with ILDs are still limited, and there are few studies with long-term follow-up periods in these patients. Methods Data from patients who were clinically diagnosed with ILDs in the Respiratory Department, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2017 to February 2018 were collected. Clinical status and HRQoL were assessed at baseline and subsequently at 6- and 12-month intervals with the LCQ, mMRC, HADS, SF-36, and SGRQ. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the determinants of the decline in HRQoL. Results A total of 139 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and 30 with connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD) were enrolled, 140 of whom completed the follow-up. The mean age was 63.7 years, and 92 patients were men. At baseline, the decline in HRQoL assessed by the SF-36 and SGRQ was significantly associated with the mMRC, LCQ and HADS depression score. In the follow-up, changes in FVC%, DLco%, mMRC and LCQ were significantly associated with changes in HRQoL. Conclusions HRQoL in both IIP and CTD-ILD patients deteriorates to varying degrees, and the trend suggests that poor HRQoL in these patients is associated with many determinants, primarily dyspnea, cough and depression. Improving HRQoL is the main aim when treating patients living with ILDs."
https://openalex.org/W3045680372,"A historical cohort study in workers occupationally exposed to chrysotile was set up in the town of Asbest, the Russian Federation, to study their cause-specific mortality, with a focus on cancer. Chrysotile has different chemical and physical properties compared with other asbestos fibres; therefore it is important to conduct studies specifically of chrysotile and in different geographical regions to improve the knowledge about its carcinogenicity. Setting was the town of Asbest, Sverdlovsk oblast, the Russian Federation. Participants were all current and former employees with at least one year of employment between 1/1/1975 and 31/12/2010 in the mine, enrichment factories, auto-transport and external rail transportation departments, the central laboratory, and the explosives unit of the company. Of the 35,837 cohort members, 12,729 (35.5%) had died (2,373 of them of cancer, including 10 of mesothelioma), 18,799 (52.5%) were known to be alive at the end of the observation period (2015), and 4,309 (12.0%) were censored before the end of 2015. Mean follow-up duration was 21.7 years in men and 25.9 years in women. The mean age at death was 59.4 years in men and 66.5 years in women. This is the largest occupational cohort of chrysotile workers to date, and the only one with a large proportion of exposed female workers."
https://openalex.org/W3045711275,"Haloferax volcanii is, to our knowledge, the only prokaryote known to tolerate CRISPR-Cas-mediated damage to its genome in the WT background; the resulting cleavage of the genome is repaired by homologous recombination restoring the WT version. In mutant Haloferax strains with enhanced self-targeting, cell fitness decreases and microhomology-mediated end joining becomes active, generating deletions in the targeted gene. Here we use self-targeting to investigate adaptation in H. volcanii CRISPR-Cas type I-B. We show that self-targeting and genome breakage events that are induced by self-targeting, such as those catalyzed by active transposases, can generate DNA fragments that are used by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery for integration into the CRISPR loci. Low cellular concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in acquisition of large numbers of spacers originating from the entire genomic DNA. In contrast, high concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in lower acquisition that was mostly centered on the targeting site. Furthermore, we observed naive spacer acquisition at a low level in WT Haloferax cells and with higher efficiency upon overexpression of the Cas proteins Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4. Taken together, these findings indicate that naive adaptation is a regulated process in H. volcanii that operates at low basal levels and is induced by DNA breaks."

The spindle apparatus is responsible for chromosome segregation, and both centrosome-dependent and centrosome-independent mechanisms have been reported to regulate spindle assembly (1Ohkura H.

Despite the diverse mechanisms used to regulate spindle assembly, the spindle dynamics of meiosis and mitosis are remarkably similar. In particular, both meiotic and mitotic cells require their spindle lengths to be constant during metaphase to promote chromosome alignment for further segregation (3Goshima G. Scholey J.M.

Due to the lack of comparative studies of meiotic and mitotic spindles, it has remained unclear whether the metaphase spindle length in meiotic and mitotic cells is regulated by similar mechanisms. It is conceivable that specific molecular mechanisms operate during meiosis I to regulate spindle dynamics, because the spindle mechanics of meiotic and mitotic cells are different. During mitotic metaphase, kinetochores on sister chromatids are bi-oriented and captured by microtubules from the opposite spindle poles, whereas, during metaphase of meiosis I, kinetochores on a homologous chromosome are mono-oriented and captured by microtubules from the same spindle pole (1Ohkura H. Meiosis: an overview of key differences from mitosis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a01585910.1101/cshperspect.a015859Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This special configuration of kinetochores during meiosis I requires chiasmata, instead of cohesion, to provide physical links between two homologous chromosomes to resist the separating forces contributed by meiotic spindles. The evolutionarily conserved kinesin-5 and kinesin-14 motor proteins have been shown to play important roles in regulating spindle assembly and dynamics during meiosis and mitosis. Generally, kinesin-5 functions to promote spindle bipolarization during preanaphase and works with kinesin-14 in an antagonistic manner to maintain the bipolar spindle during mitotic metaphase (5Rincon S.A.

Unlike Pkl1 and its counterpart in Drosophila (i.e. NCD), the role of Klp2 in mitotic spindle assembly is ill-defined, and the role of klp2 in regulating meiotic spindle dynamics remains to be determined. We employed live-cell microscopy to study spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I in a comparative manner and demonstrated that the conserved motor Klp2 plays a crucial role in preventing spindle collapse during meiosis I but not during mitosis. Similar to Ase1, Klp2 may function as a microtubule cross-linker and synergize with Ase1 to maintain spindle stability during meiosis I. Therefore, our work provides important insights into understanding the differential regulation of meiotic and mitotic spindle dynamics. During meiosis I, chiasmata form between homologous chromosomes and the kinetochores on sister chromatids are mono-oriented. These characteristics of meiosis prompted us to hypothesize that the spindle of meiosis I is regulated specially to properly segregate the homologous chromosomes. To test this hypothesis, we first employed live-cell microscopy to analyze the spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I in fission yeast cells expressing Sid4-GFP (a protein-marking spindle pole body) and mCherry-Atb2 (α-tubulin). As reported previously (45Nabeshima K. Nakagawa T. Straight A.F. Murray A. Chikashige Y. Yamashita Y.M. Hiraoka Y. Yanagida M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182 (18644893): 277-28810.1083/jcb.200802053Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I exhibits three characteristic phases: phase I (prophase-like, during which the spindle assembles), phase II (metaphase/anaphase A, during which the spindle length remains relatively constant), and phase III (anaphase B, during which the spindle length increases rapidly) (Fig. 1, A–C). Despite the similarities between mitosis and meiosis, the spindle dynamics during these two types of cell division had different characteristics. As shown in Fig. 1D, the spindle elongated faster during phase I of meiosis I (referred to as prophase I) than during phase I of mitosis and maintained a longer length during phase II of meiosis I (referred to as metaphase I) than during phase II of mitosis. The duration of phase I and II of meiosis I (referred to as preanaphase I) appeared to be longer than the duration of phase I and II of mitosis, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1D). We then attempted to identify the proteins that are responsible for regulating meiotic spindle dynamics. We focused on motor proteins because they are one of the main types of proteins involved in spindle assembly and regulation (47Reber S. Hyman A.A. Emergent properties of the metaphase spindle.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7 (26134313): a01578410.1101/cshperspect.a015784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Live-cell microscopy was employed to examine meiotic spindle dynamics of dynein-deletion cells (Dhc1Δ) and kinesin-deletion cells (all nonessential kinesins). As shown in Fig. S1, most of the kinesin/dynein mutants displayed defective spindle dynamics during meiosis I, but to different extents, with klp2Δ (kinesin-14 in human), klp5Δ (kinesin-8 in human), and klp6Δ (kinesin-8 in human) cells showing the strongest phenotypes. In the absence of Klp5 or Klp6, most of the meiotic spindles continuously elongated and did not show a distinguishable metaphase I. Interestingly, in the absence of Klp2, about half of the meiotic spindles abruptly collapsed during metaphase I (Fig. S1 and Fig. 2), suggesting that Klp2 functions mainly to maintain spindle stability during metaphase I. Therefore, in this present study, we addressed the role of Klp2 in regulating meiotic spindle dynamics. For comparison, we examined spindle dynamics of WT and klp2Δ cells during mitosis and meiosis I. Mitotic spindle dynamics of WT and klp2Δ cells was comparable (Fig. 2B), and no spindle collapse was detected, except that one WT cell (21 in total) displayed slight spindle regression during metaphase (Fig. 2D). In contrast, 50% of the spindles in klp2Δ cells underwent abrupt collapse during metaphase I (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). Intriguingly, the klp2Δ cells resumed spindle elongation after the spindle collapse and entered anaphase. The spindle collapse may not be due to the abnormalities of prophase spindle elongation and altered spindle length, because the absence of Klp2 did not significantly affect spindle elongation during prophase I and only slightly lengthened the maximal spindle length during metaphase I (Fig. 2G). Similar to the microtubule cross-linker Ase1 (14Janson M.E. Loughlin R. Loiodice I. Fu C. Brunner D. Nedelec F.J. Tran P.T.

Therefore, it is possible that the microtubule-cross-linking activity, but not the motor activity, of Klp2 plays an important role in regulating meiotic spindle dynamics. Further analysis showed similar results of mitotic and meiotic spindle parameters in WT and klp2Δ cells (Fig. 2, F and G). In both mitotic and meiotic cells, the absence of Klp2 slightly but significantly prolonged the duration of preanaphase (Fig. 2, F and G). Collectively, the results not only show similar functions of Klp2 in regulating spindle dynamics but also highlight the meiosis-specific role of Klp2 in preventing spindle collapse. Next, we employed live-cell microscopy to image WT and klp2Δ cells expressing Bub1-GFP (a spindle assembly checkpoint protein localized to kinetochores) and mCherry-Atb2.

Here we explored through what proteins and processes celastrol may act in activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients. Differential expression of genes and proteins after celastrol treatment of FLS was examined using RNA sequencing, label-free relatively quantitative proteomics and molecular docking. In this paper, expression of 26,565 genes and 3,372 proteins was analyzed. Celastrol was associated with significant changes in genes that respond to oxidative stress and oxygen levels, as well as genes that stabilize or synthesize components of the extracellular matrix. These results identify several potential mechanisms through which celastrol may inhibit inflammation in RA."

https://openalex.org/W3046019742,"Behavioral development in domestic dogs has been investigated for predicting suitability for service dog work or for matching with the ""right"" families as well as for identifying predispositions to behavioral problems. Findings from the scientific literature seem to confirm that conducting behavioral tests at 7 weeks of age is too early to reliably predict the temperament and personality of a dog. However, this period for domestic dogs is sensitive for early life learning and conditions during this time could have important consequences in adulthood. The aims of this study were to evaluate inter-rater reliability of a simple standardized test and to investigate which factors influence the behavioral reaction of puppies. 105 seven-week old puppies were exposed to five subtests: social attraction, following, retrieving, sudden appearance, noise. During each task, the behaviour of each pup was scored on a 3-5 point scale that reflected the suitability of the pup's reaction to the task. Scores were evaluated for a single subtest and for two aggregate indicators (i.e. response to a person: social attraction subtest and following subtest and response to object and noise: retrieving subtest, sudden appearance subtest and noise subtest). Three assessors independently scored the dogs' reactions for each task. Inter-rater reliability of the three assessors were analyzed with Fleiss' Kappa and Kendall's coefficient, which showed a high inter-rater reliability in 4 of 5 tasks. The ordered logistic regression was carried out to obtain a proportional odds model that was used to model the relationship between sex, litter size, stimulating environment, parity of mother, adequate maternal behavior and high scores. Litter size and maternal parity were associated with test performance in response to a person. The variance of effect of litter was high in response to object and noise. Taken together, our results suggest that using this scoring system there is sufficient inter-rater reliability in the test and litter size and mother experience influences task performances related to dog-human interaction."

Also, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed on the factors affecting urban electricity consumption. The research results show that the urban scaling characteristics of Chinese cities differ between different types of cities, industrial cities show unique scaling features compared to commercial cities and mixed-economy cities. Additionally, urban electricity consumption is found to be closely related to urban population, urban construction land area and street lamp number.

The orientation information allows predicting properties and behavior of materials to validate and guide a fabrication process of materials with controlled fiber orientation. Meanwhile, development of detector systems for high-resolution non-invasive 3D imaging techniques led to a significant increase in the amount of generated data per a sample up to dozens of gigabytes. Though plenty of 3D orientation estimation algorithms were developed in recent years, neither of them can process large datasets in a reasonable amount of time. This fact complicates the further analysis and makes impossible fast feedback to adjust fabrication parameters. In this work, we present a new method for quantifying the 3D orientation of fibers. The GPU implementation of the proposed method surpasses another popular method for 3D orientation analysis regarding accuracy and speed. The validation of both methods was performed on a synthetic dataset with varying parameters of fibers. Moreover, the proposed method was applied to perform orientation analysis of scaffolds with different fibrous micro-architecture studied with the synchrotron μCT imaging setup.

https://openalex.org/W3036897212,"The human chloride intracellular channel (hCLIC) family is thought to transition between globular and membrane-associated forms by exposure of a hydrophobic surface. However, the molecular identity of this surface, and the triggering events leading to its exposure, remain elusive. Here, by combining biochemical and structural approaches, together with mass spectrometry (MS) analyses, we show that hCLIC5 is inherently flexible. X-ray crystallography revealed the existence of a globular conformation, while small-angle X-ray scattering showed additional elongated forms consisting of exposure of the conserved hydrophobic inter-domain interface to the bulk phase. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the transition to the membrane-associated form is enhanced by the presence of oxidative environment and lipids. Using MS, we identified a dose-dependent oxidation of a highly conserved cysteine residue, known to play a key role in the structurally related omega-class of glutathione-S-transferases. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS analysis revealed that oxidation of this cysteine facilitates the exposure of the conserved hydrophobic inter-domain interface. Together, our results pinpoint an oxidation of a specific cysteine residue as a triggering mechanism initializing the molecular commitment for membrane interaction in the CLIC family."

In this publication we characterize the regional distribution of prostatic cell types in the young intact dog to enable comparisons with human and mice and we examine how the cellular source of procollagen 1A1 changes with age in intact male dogs. Methods A multichotomous decision tree involving sequential immunohistochemical stains was validated for use in dog and used to identify specific prostatic cell types and determine their distribution in the capsule, peripheral, periurethral and urethral regions of the young intact canine prostate. Prostatic cells identified using this technique include perivascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, luminal, intermediate, and basal epithelial cells, neuroendocrine cells, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and other hematolymphoid cells. To enhance rigor and transparency, all high resolution images (representative images shown in the figures and biological replicates) are available through the GUDMAP database at https://doi.org/10.25548/16-WMM4. Results The prostatic peripheral region harbors the largest proportion of epithelial cells. Aging does not change the density of hematolymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts in the peripheral region or in the fibromuscular capsule, regions where we previously observed aging- and androgen-mediated increases in prostatic collagen abundance Instead, we observed aging-related changes the procollagen 1A1 positive prostatic cell identity from a myofibroblast to a fibroblast. Conclusions Hematolymphoid cells and myofibroblasts are often identified as sources of collagen in tissues prone to aging-related fibrosis. We show that these are not the likely sources of pathological collagen synthesis in older intact male dogs. Instead, we identify an aging-related shift in the prostatic cell type producing procollagen 1A1 that will help direct development of cell type and prostate appropriate therapeutics for collagen accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W3046133218,"Introduction Incorrect positioning of the body in space increases the tension of the myofascial tissue and overloads the skeleton. It is important to look for factors that affect the deterioration of body posture that could be eliminated. Understanding the interrelationship between the positioning of individual body segments should be the key knowledge for those involved in the prevention and correction of faulty body posture. The study aimed to determine the relationship between the degree of physiological curvatures of the spine and the incidence of incorrect knee position. Materials and methods The study involved 685 children aged 10–12. Body height, weight and BMI were measured and calculated. The degree of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis was assessed using the Zebris Pointer ultrasound system. Valgus and varus knees were diagnosed in an upright position based on the intermalleolar distance with knees together, and intercondylar distance with the feet placed together. The statistical analysis uses descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test (comparison of girls and boys), the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Tukey's post hoc test (comparison of variables in participants with correct, varus and valgus knees) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (the relationship between the position of the spine and knees). Results The examined girls were heavier than the boys and had higher BMI. Spine deformities and incorrect knee position are common among 10-12-year-old children. The girls and boys differed significantly in the spine shape in the sagittal plane and the intermalleolar distance. Round lumbar lordosis is more characteristic for girls, and for boys, round thoracic kyphosis. For both genders, valgus knees occur more often than varus knees and coexist with decreased thoracic kyphosis. The rounder the thoracic kyphosis, the greater distance between the knees and the smaller distance between ankles. Conclusions The frontal knee position significantly correlated with the depth of thoracic kyphosis."
https://openalex.org/W3046177365,"The primary aim of in vitro testing of chemicals delivered via the percutaneous route is to predict the absorption that would ensue if exposure occurred in live animals. While there is mounting evidence that in vitro diffusion studies in mammalian skin can provide valid information regarding likely in vivo absorption, little is known whether such a correlation exists between in vitro diffusion testing and in vivo blood levels in amphibians. The current study used previously-reported in vitro absorption data for caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen across isolated skin from the cane toad (Rhinella marina) to produce a series of linear mixed-effect models of the absorption parameters flux and permeability coefficient (Kp). Models investigated the relative impacts of animal weight, physicochemical characteristics of the applied chemical (logP or molecular weight), and site of application. The top models were then used to predict the flux, Kp and serum concentrations of the same three model chemicals. Finally, the absorption of these chemicals was determined in live cane toads, and results compared to the model predictions. LogP and site of application were included in all top models. In vivo absorption rates were lower than predicted for all chemicals, however, the models provided reasonable predictions of serum concentration, with factors of difference (FOD) ranging from 2.5-10.5. Ibuprofen, the chemical with the highest relative lipophilicity, had the poorest predictive performance, consistently having the highest FOD for all predictions. This report presents the first models of percutaneous absorption in an amphibian. These models provide a basic method to establish the approximate in vivo absorption of hydrophilic and moderately-lipophilic chemicals through frog skin, and could therefore be used to predict absorption when formulating such chemicals for treatment of disease in frogs, or for risk-assessments regarding chemical pollutants in frog habitats."

Paternal indifference & neglect in early life was assessed on the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and creativity on the Runco Creativity Assessment Battery (rCAB). Two primary findings emerged. Firstly, significant paternal indifference & neglect × TPH1 genotype interaction effects were identified in predicting all three dimensions of creativity (fluency, originality, and flexibility). Paternal indifference & neglect in early life negatively predicted fluency, originality, and flexibility when individuals carry A allele of TPH1 (rs623580). Secondly, there was a significant interaction effect of TPH1 genotype by offspring gender on flexibility. Only in males, individuals who carry A allele were linked with lower level of flexibility compared to TT homozygote individuals. No significant three-way interaction was found. In conclusion, the current findings provided the first preliminary evidence for the moderation effect of TPH1 on the relationship between parenting and creativity, and TPH1- offspring gender interaction on creativity; future studies are needed to validate these findings."

Elicited levels of inflammatory cytokines at 48 h and 24 h (interferon γ, IFN-γ only) and the cellular sources of IFN-γ were analysed.Among Papua New Guinean women, microscopic malaria at enrolment did not alter peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses. Compared to samples from Australia, cells from Papua New Guinean women secreted more inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6 and IFN-γ; p<0.001 for all assays, and more natural killer cells produced IFN-γ in response to infected erythrocytes and phytohemagglutinin. In both populations, cytokine responses were not affected by gravidity, except that in the Papua New Guinean cohort multigravid women had higher IFN-γ secretion at 24 h (p = 0.029) and an increased proportion of IFN-γ+ Vδ2 γδ T cells (p = 0.003). Cytokine levels elicited by a pregnancy malaria-specific CSA binding parasite line, CS2, were broadly similar to those elicited by CD36-binding line P6A1.Geographic location and, to some extent, gravidity influence maternal innate immunity to malaria."
