https://openalex.org/W2165419593,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is one of the most abundant proteins in the circulatory system and plays a key role in the transport of fatty acids, metabolites, and drugs. For many drugs, binding to serum albumin is a critical determinant of their distribution and pharmacokinetics; however, there have as yet been no high resolution crystal structures published of drug-albumin complexes. Here we describe high resolution crystal structures of HSA with two of the most widely used general anesthetics, propofol and halothane. In addition, we describe a crystal structure of HSA complexed with both halothane and the fatty acid, myristate. We show that the intravenous anesthetic propofol binds at two discrete sites on HSA in preformed pockets that have been shown to accommodate fatty acids. Similarly we show that the inhalational agent halothane binds (at concentrations in the pharmacologically relevant range) at three sites that are also fatty acid binding loci. At much higher halothane concentrations, we have identified additional sites that are occupied. All of the higher affinity anesthetic binding sites are amphiphilic in nature, with both polar and apolar parts, and anesthetic binding causes only minor changes in local structure.

Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). The identity of these targets, however, remains uncertain, although a large body of evidence is accumulating on the functional effects of general anesthetics on a variety of possible candidates (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 2Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Most of these data come from electrophysiological measurements, coupled more recently with the techniques of molecular genetics. Although these approaches are crucial in understanding the actions of general anesthetics, they give at best only indirect information on the forces that are involved in anesthetic-protein interactions and virtually no information on the molecular architectures of anesthetic binding sites. The lack of direct structural information is due at least in part to the fact that the most likely targets for general anesthetics are thought to be neuronal ion channels. These are, of course, integral membrane proteins and have proven to be exceptionally difficult to crystallize in a form that is suitable for high resolution x-ray diffraction analysis. However, there are several soluble proteins to which anesthetics are known to bind, and studies with these proteins have provided valuable information on the nature of anesthetic binding sites. Most of this work has been done with serum proteins and luciferase enzymes, but so far the only example of an anesthetic-sensitive protein for which there is also high resolution structural data is firefly luciferase (3Franks N.P. Jenkins A. Conti E. Lieb W.R. Brick P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2205-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most extensively studied anesthetic binding protein is serum albumin, and there have been numerous attempts to characterize the binding sites involved (4Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Dubois B.W. Cherian S.F. Evers A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), none of them, however, using direct structural techniques. This protein is not only amenable to high resolution structural analysis but, more importantly, is known to play a key role in the pharmacological actions of several general anesthetics. The importance of serum albumin in anesthetic pharmacology derives from its high concentration in the circulatory system (approximately 0.6 mm in plasma) and from its ability to bind an extraordinarily diverse range of drugs (including most anesthetics), metabolites, and fatty acids (for reviews, see Refs. 9Kragh-Hansen U. Dan. Med. Bull. 1990; 37: 57-84PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 152-203Google Scholar, 11Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). In several cases more than 50% of a clinically administered general anesthetic will be bound to serum albumin, and in some cases, such as the intravenous agent propofol, approximately 80% is bound (12Altmayer P. Buch U. Buch H.P. Arzneim.-Forsch. 1995; 45: 1053-1056PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, any changes in the interactions between an anesthetic and serum albumin, either by fatty acids or other drugs competing for binding or by genetic modifications in the protein itself, could result in significant changes in the pharmacologically active concentration of the anesthetic. Although a high resolution structure of human serum albumin was published some years ago (13He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar), the unavailability of the three-dimensional coordinates did not encourage others to extend this work. Curry et al. (14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) subsequently published a high resolution structure of the protein that identified the principal fatty acid binding sites, and this was followed by the publication of an independent determination of the native structure (15Sugio S. Kashima A. Mochizuki S. Noda M. Kobayashi K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The protein is heart-shaped and contains 585 amino acids. It is organized into three homologous domains (labeled I-III), and each domain consists of two sub-domains (A and B) that share common structural elements (Fig. 1). In this paper we have used x-ray crystallography to provide high resolution information on the nature and locations of the principal binding sites for two of the most widely used general anesthetics, the intravenous agent propofol and the inhalational agent halothane (see Structures I and II).

Foster J.F. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) at low pH. This was supplied at a concentration of 250 mg ml−1 in 145 mm NaCl by Dr. John Woodrow of Delta Biotechnology Limited (Nottingham, UK). The halothane-myristate complex was formed using protein that, in addition, originally contained 40 mm octanoate (C8:0) and 15 mg liter−1 Tween 80. In both cases the protein was further purified on a Superdex S75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a phosphate running buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5) to remove dimers and polymers of HSA, exactly as described previously (14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). After combining the appropriate fractions, the running buffer was exchanged with a storage buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0), and the protein was concentrated using an Amicon 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Millipore, Watford, Hertfordshire, UK) to greater than 80 mg ml−1and stored at 4 °C. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Crystals of native HSA were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 °C using the sitting drop configuration. Crystals were first grown with a reservoir of 28–30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. After 2–3 months, large stacked plates were observed in some drops, but these crystals were rarely single and diffracted poorly. However, using these crystals as seeds and equilibrating with a lower concentration of polyethylene glycol 25–26% (w/v), crystals were obtained with dimensions of approximately 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm in 4–6 weeks. These crystals diffracted to high resolution (2.1 Å). For the propofol complex, an identical crystallization procedure was followed except that a saturating concentration of propofol (approximately 4 mm in 25–26% polyethylene glycol) was maintained throughout. The propofol was a gift from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, UK. Co-crystallization with propofol generally resulted in larger crystals than those obtained in the absence of propofol. Native propofol-free crystals could be readily obtained by back-soaking in solutions that contained progressively less propofol while at the same time progressively increasing the polyethylene glycol concentration up to 32% (w/v). Complexes with halothane were prepared by exposing native crystals to chosen partial pressures of halothane in 1-mm sealed glass capillaries at room temperature. The partial pressure was set by using mixtures of halothane and hexadecane at defined mole ratios. To the extent that halothane and hexadecane mix ideally, the vapor pressure of halothane above such a mixture can, according to Raoult's Law, be taken to be proportional to its mole fraction. The maximum partial pressure of halothane that could be used with native crystals before a significant deterioration in the diffraction patterns was observed was 15% of the saturated vapor pressure, which would correspond to a partial pressure of 5% atm, or 2.6 mm in free aqueous solution. To prepare the halothane-myristate complex, crystals with myristate were first prepared (14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) before exposure to halothane, as described above. In the presence of myristate we found that a much higher concentration of halothane could be used (60% of the saturated vapor pressure, which would correspond to a partial pressure of 20% atm, or 10.5 mm in free aqueous solution) before lattice disorder in the crystals reduced the resolution of the diffraction patterns. Data were collected to high resolution at the synchrotrons in Daresbury (SRS, UK) and in Hamburg (DESY, Germany). At Daresbury (beamline 9.6), short exposure times (2–3 s) were used to minimize radiation damage, which was evident with longer exposures. In Hamburg (beamline X-11), the exposure times were 20–30 s. All data was processed using MOSFLM. 2A. Leslie, personal communication.

The structure of native HSA was determined using molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the search model were those of “molecule A” in the 2.5-Å structure of HSA (Brookhaven code 1AO6) recently determined by Sugio et al. (15Sugio S. Kashima A. Mochizuki S. Noda M. Kobayashi K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Rigid-body refinement was carried out using the program X-PLOR (18Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) followed by restrained least squares crystallographic refinement. For the structure containing both halothane and myristate, the HSA coordinates of the previously determined HSA-myristate structure (14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) were used before rigid-body refinement. The coordinates for propofol were taken from the Cambridge Structural data base (19Fletcher D.A. McMeeking R.F. Parkin D.J. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1996; 36: 746-749Crossref Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), and those for halothane were calculated assuming standard stereochemistry. At the resolution of our data, the two enantiomers of halothane would have been indistinguishable and we arbitrarily chose to model theR enantiomer. After the addition of water molecules as well as fatty acid and anesthetic molecules where appropriate, all of the refined models had good stereochemistry (Table II), with no main-chain dihedral angles lying in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (not shown).

Open table in a new tab In the absence of fatty acids, HSA crystallized in a P1 space group with unit cell dimensions (Table I) that have not been observed before despite the fact that our crystallization conditions were similar to those used by others (13He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 15Sugio S. Kashima A. Mochizuki S. Noda M. Kobayashi K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The native HSA structure that we have determined is essentially identical to those previously published, with only minor differences in the flexible subdomain IIIB (Fig. 1 A), due no doubt to differences in crystal packing. For comparison, Fig. 1 Bshows the HSA structure in the presence of myristate (14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) 3Bhattacharya, A. A., Grüne, T., and Curry, S. (2000) J. Mol. Biol. 303, 721–732. and the locations of eight fatty acid binding sites. For the crystals containing propofol, the quality of the difference electron density allowed the positions and orientations of two propofol molecules to be unambiguously determined. One molecule (PR1) binds in subdomain IIIA, and the other (PR2) binds in subdomain IIIB (Fig. 2). The propofol molecule in IIIA (Fig. 2 B and Table III) binds in an apolar pocket with the phenolic hydroxyl group, making a hydrogen bond (3.1 Å) with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Leu-430 and with the aromatic ring of the anesthetic sandwiched between the side chains of Leu-453 and Asn-391. One of the two isopropyl groups makes numerous apolar contacts at one end of the pocket, whereas the other is exposed at the aqueous entrance, although it too makes close contacts with several side chains (Asn-391, Leu-407, Arg-410, and Tyr-411). The mouth of the binding pocket opens onto a network of five hydrogen-bonded water molecules that are further stabilized by interactions with Ser-489, Arg-410, and Tyr-411. The electron density for this solvent-exposed isopropyl group is much better defined (indicating a higher degree of order) than that of the isopropyl group, which is deeper in the pocket. The only conformational adjustment that takes place on propofol binding to this pocket is a 120° rotation of the side chain of Val 433, which moves to accommodate the inner isopropyl group. Comparisons with structures that contain fatty acids suggest that this propofol molecule would compete for ligand binding at fatty acid binding site FA3 and also disrupt the binding of fatty acid at site FA4 (via interactions with Arg-410, which coordinates the fatty acid carboxyl group) (14Curry S.

The anesthetic is sandwiched between the side chains of Phe-502 and Leu-532, which make close contacts with the propofol aromatic ring. The aliphatic portion of Glu-531 and the side chain of His-535, situated approximately 4 Å from the base of the propofol molecule, close off this end of the pocket. The hydroxyl group of Ser-579 makes a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) with the propofol hydroxyl. The entrance to the binding pocket is quite polar, with several well-ordered water molecules and a number of polar residues in close proximity. As with the first propofol site, there are only a few minor local conformational changes on binding, the most marked of these being a 90° rotation about the Cα-Cβ bond of Phe-507, which moves the side chain away from the center of the binding pocket (there are also minor movements in the aromatic rings of Phe-502 and Phe-509). Superposition of the fatty acid structures3indicates that the binding of this propofol molecule could be prevented by ligands that bind to fatty acid binding site FA5. It is probable that the first of the two propofol binding sites (PR1 in sub-domain IIIA) has the highest affinity because, during one experiment where the crystals were partially back-soaked and the propofol concentration was reduced, the electron density for the second propofol molecule PR2 disappeared, whereas that for the first molecule was easily interpretable (data not shown). When crystals of HSA were exposed to halothane vapor, we found that a maximum concentration of around 15% of the saturated vapor pressure could be used before there was a noticeable deterioration in the resolution of the diffraction pattern. With myristate-containing crystals, a significantly higher concentration could be used (60% of the saturated vapor pressure) before this occurred. At the lower concentration and in the absence of fatty acid, the difference electron density showed three “high affinity” halothane binding sites (molecules HAL1, HAL2, and HAL3; Fig. 3 A, Table IV). (Although the position of the electron-dense bromine atom was always clear, there was some ambiguity about the relative positions of the chlorine atom and the CF3 group. In most cases the shape of the density was used to guide positioning of the slightly bulkier CF3 group, but because the data are limited to 2.4 Å resolution and the model B-factors are relatively high, the orientations modeled cannot be regarded as definitive.) Two of these halothane molecules (HAL1 and HAL2) bind within a solvent-exposed trough at the interface between subdomains IIA and IIB, which can also bind a fatty acid molecule (FA6). At the higher halothane concentration, a third molecule (HAL4) also binds in the trough (see Figs. 3 B and4 A), adjacent to HAL1 and HAL2. The strongest density was observed for the central halothane molecule HAL1, which binds in an amphiphilic environment formed on the one side by the polar groups of Arg-209 and Glu-534, which interact via a salt bridge (that also involves Asp-324), and on the other side by the aliphatic portion of Lys-212 and the side chains of Ala-213 and Leu-327. The second molecule (HAL2) is in a predominantly apolar environment (Ala-213, Leu-347, Ala-350 and the aliphatic portion of K351), although a polar interaction is provided by Arg-209. The third molecule (HAL4) in the trough only binds at much higher concentrations and makes relatively few interactions with neighboring side chains. Even at the higher halothane concentration there was, within experimental error, no significant change in the local structure, despite the competitive displacement of myristate.Table IVHalothane binding sitesAnestheticBinding locationResidues lining cavity wallsHalothane 1IIA-IIBArg-209, Ala-210, Ala-213, Leu-347, Ala-350, Lys-351, Glu-354, Lys-212(FA6)Halothane 2IIA-IIBArg-209, Lys-212, Ala-213, Val-216, Asp-324, Leu-327, Leu-331(FA6)Halothane 3IIIAIle-388, Asn-391, Phe-403, Leu-407, Leu-430, Val-433, Gly-434, Cys-438, Ala-449, Leu-453(FA3 & 4)Halothane 4IIA-IIBVal-216, Phe-228, Ser-232, Val-235, Val-325(FA6)Halothane 5IIALeu-238, His-242, Arg-257, Leu-260, Ile-264, Ser-287, Ile-290, Ala-291(FA7)Halothane 6IIATrp-214, Arg-218, Leu-219, Arg-222, Phe-223, Leu-238, Ala-291(FA7)Halothane 7IA-IIAAla-26, Tyr-30, Leu-66, His-67, Phe-70, Asn-99, Asp-249, Leu-250, Leu-251(FA8)Halothane 8IA-IBAla-21, Leu-135, Lys-136, Leu-139, Leu-155, Ala-158, Lys-159, Lys-162 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Details of halothane binding sites.

This molecule binds in a site that overlaps with the methylene tail of the fatty acid bound in site FA3 and with the first propofol molecule (PF1). HAL3 makes numerous close, mainly apolar, interactions within the binding pocket (Table IV and Fig. 4 B). The bromine atom interacts with the sulfur of Cys-438, the main chain of Gly-434 and makes additional (hydrophobic) contacts with Phe-403 and the side chain of Asn-391 (Fig. 4 B). At the higher halothane concentration, electron density appears for molecules HAL5 and HAL6 within a binding site in subdomain IIA that can also bind fatty acid FA7. These two halothane molecules (see Fig. 3 B and 4 C) lie adjacent to one another in a predominantly apolar environment, although both molecules also interact with polar groups. The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Arg-257 contacts halothane HAL5, whereas its charged guanidinium side chain interacts with the bromine atom of the anesthetic. Similarly, the bromine atom of HAL6 is close to the guanidinium of Arg-222. HAL6 is also within 5 Å of Trp-214, which has been implicated in halothane binding to HSA (7Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol.

With the HSA structure in the presence of myristate and at the higher halothane concentration, we observed strong electron density for two more halothane molecules (HAL7 and HAL8). One of these (HAL7) binds at the interface between subdomains IA and IIA (Fig. 3 B and4 D) in a cavity that is formed as a consequence of the fatty acid-induced conformational change (Ref. 14Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). This conformational change rotates domain I relative to domain II to create a largely apolar cavity that is flanked on one side by the methylene tail of the fatty acid bound to FA2. The bromine atom is coordinated by several polar interactions (Tyr-30, His-67, Asn-99, and Asp-249). Binding of HAL7 displaces the myristate from site FA8. The other halothane molecule, HAL8, present in the HSA-myristate crystals (Fig. 3 B), binds in a solvent-exposed niche that is formed by the parallel side chains of Lys-136, Lys-159, and Lys-162 (not shown). The orientations of these side chains that form the hydrophobic cavity are determined very largely by interactions with a symmetry-related HSA molecule in the crystal, suggesting that the binding site for halothane HAL8 is a crystallographic artifact. A number of general statements can be made about the nature of the propofol and halothane binding sites on HSA and the effects these anesthetics have on the protein structure. First, only a relatively small number of discrete sites are involved. In all cases these are pre-formed pockets or clefts on the protein that are, in almost all cases, capable of binding natural ligands (i.e. fatty acids). Second, the only changes we observed in local structure were two side-chain conformational changes on propofol binding (see “Results”), and there was no evidence in the pharmacolo"

Using a nucleotide binding assay, we found that Apaf-1 alone bound dATP poorly and the nucleotide binding to Apaf-1 was significantly stimulated by cytochrome c. The binding of dATP to Apaf-1 induces the formation of a multimeric Apaf-1·cytochromec complex, apoptosome. Procaspase-9 also synergistically promotes dATP binding to Apaf-1 in a cytochromec-dependent manner. The dATP bound to apoptosome remained as dATP, not dADP. A nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ADPCP (β,γ-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate), was able to support apoptosome formation and caspase activation in place of dATP or ATP.

Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Because caspase-mediated proteolysis is in general an irreversible process, caspases are synthesized as inactive pro-forms that are activated only during apoptosis (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). One major intracellular caspase activation pathway is triggered by cytochrome c released from mitochondria (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Once in cytosol, cytochrome c binds its cytosolic partner Apaf-1,1 the human homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans apoptotic protein CED-4, and induces the oligomerization of Apaf-1·cytochrome c complex in a dATP/ATP-dependent manner (3Zou H.

For example, it is well established that dATP or ATP is required for the apoptosome formation (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

It is not clear, however, whether the hydrolysis or simply binding of nucleotides to Apaf-1 is critical for such an event. Additionally, the relationship between nucleotide and cytochromec binding to Apaf-1 is still not established, although both are absolutely needed for the reaction (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). In the current manuscript, we report the study of molecular mechanism of Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation using highly purified recombinant Apaf-1 and procaspase-9. The results indicate that the key event in this caspase activation reaction is nucleotide binding to Apaf-1. The event is regulated by cytochrome c as well as procaspase-9. Nucleotides dATP, ATP, dGTP, and ATPγS were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dADP and ADPCP were from Sigma. [α-33P]dATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and [γ-32P]dATP from ICN. Polyclonal antibodies against Apaf-1 and caspase-9 were prepared as described previously (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against cytochrome cwas purchased from PharMingen. Purified horse cytochromec was produced as described previously (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar).35S-labeled procaspase-3 was in vitro translated and purified as described previously (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Recombinant procaspase-9, both wild type and D315A mutant, was expressed and purified as described previously (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Recombinant Apaf-1 was expressed and nickel affinity-purified as described previously (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), followed by MonoQ chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The MonoQ column was equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm NaCl, and subsequently eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 100 mm NaCl to 250 mm NaCl in buffer A. Apaf-1 was eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl. After being dialyzed against buffer A, the purified Apaf-1 was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. A rapid filter binding assay was developed to measure dATP binding to Apaf-1. In a final volume of 20 μl in buffer A, containing additionally 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA, 500 nm [α-33P]dATP (100–200 cpm/fmol) was mixed with other factors as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was started by adding 100 nm Apaf-1 and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After incubation, the samples were diluted immediately with 2 ml of chilled washing buffer (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 40 mmMgCl2) and filtered through 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of chilled washing buffer and counted for radioactivity with a scintillation counter (Beckman). For K D measurement, the same procedure was performed except that: 1) different amounts of dATP were used in each reaction as indicated in the presence of 500 nm cytochrome cor 500 nm cytochrome c plus 50 nmD315A procaspase-9; and 2) the mixtures were incubated for 1 h, at which time point the binding equilibrium was reached.K D values were calculated by double-reciprocal plot (1/[dATP]total versus1/[Apaf-1·dATP]) analysis. Linear regression of the plots was processed automatically using SigmaPlot program. Radioactive samples were loaded on a Baker-flex cellulose polyethyleneimine TLC plate (J. T. Baker, Inc.) as indicated. One μl of 10 mm nonradioactive dATP and dADP were loaded as the controls. After being developed in 1 m formic acid plus 0.5m LiCl, the plate was air-dried. The control dATP and dADP were visualized under UV light in the dark, and the resolved radioactive samples were detected by phosphorimaging. In buffer A containing additionally 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 μm [γ-32P]dATP (50–100 cpm/fmol) was mixed with other factors as indicated in figures. The reaction was started by finally adding 100 nm Apaf-1 and was incubated at 30 °C. Hydrolysis of dATP was measured as the release of γ-32Pi from dATP, as described previously for the ATPase assay (13Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, at indicated times, 20-μl aliquots of samples were taken out from reactions and added to glass tubes containing 0.5 ml of 1.25n perchloric acid to terminate nucleotide hydrolysis, and then 0.125 ml of 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate was added followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of 1:1 isobutanol benzene. The mixtures were vibrated by vortex to achieve phase extraction. After phase separation, 0.25-ml aliquots of the organic phase were counted for radioactivity by a scintillation counter, and dATP hydrolysis by Apaf-1 was calculated as the release of Pi from dATP. in our previously reported reconstitution of caspase-9 activation using purified recombinant Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), the purity was measured by Coomassie Blue staining, and minor contamination remained that precluded us from quantitatively measuring the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by Apaf-1. To improve the assay conditions, Apaf-1 was subjected to an additional purification step so that it was pure by silver staining standard (Fig.1 A). When purified, procaspase-9 and cytochrome c were added to Apaf-1, and caspase-9 activation was observed in a time-dependent fashion measured by silver staining of the autocleaved 35-kDa subunit generated from the 50-kDa procaspase-9 (Fig. 1 A). Procaspase-9 activation requires the pre-formation of a multimeric Apaf-1·cytochrome c complex, apoptosome. To confirm the formation of apoptosome, the caspase-9 activation reaction mixture was separated in a gel filtration column, and the fractions from the column were analyzed by Western blot. The inactive Apaf-1 monomer ran at fraction 14 (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1 B, most of the Apaf-1 protein was migrated at a position correlating with a large complex (fractions 10 and 11). Cytochrome c and caspase-9 were also detected in these fractions. Interestingly, the majority of cleaved caspase-9 was not associated with the complex and was present in a free form that migrated at fractions 14–17. When caspase-9 activity was measured directly by adding 35S-labeled substrate procaspase-3, only the fractions that correlated with the large complex showed caspase-3 cleavage activity, whereas the major free caspase-9 fraction showed only marginal activity (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). This result further supports the model proposed by Lazebnik and colleague (14Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) that it is the holoenzyme consisting of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 that cleaves the downstream procaspases. the purified Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 allowed us to do a direct nucleotide binding assay using radiolabeled dATP. Nucleotide binding to proteins was measured by a filter binding assay. Procaspase-9 and cytochrome c showed no detectable binding of nucleotides by themselves (data not shown). Apaf-1 alone also showed little nucleotide binding activity, even though within the CED-4 homologous region Apaf-1 has the well conserved nucleotide binding site, Walker's A and B motif (Fig.2 B). However, when cytochromec was co-incubated with Apaf-1, nucleotide binding to Apaf-1 was significantly increased (Fig. 2, A and B). The nucleotide bound to Apaf-1 reached a plateau when cytochromec was used at 500 nm and higher concentrations (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2 B, when procaspase-9 was present, dATP binding to Apaf-1 was stimulated further. Procaspase-9 without cytochrome c had no effect on dATP binding to Apaf-1. The stimulatory effect of procaspase-9 did not seem to relate to caspase-9 cleavage, because a cleavage site mutant procaspase-9 (D315A) promoted dATP binding as well as the wild type protein. The stimulatory effect of procaspase-9 on dATP binding to Apaf-1 reached a plateau at about 50 nm procaspase-9 in the presence of saturated cytochrome c (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2The effects of cytochrome cand procaspase-9 on dATP binding to Apaf-1. Nucleotide binding of Apaf-1 was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, cytochrome c stimulates dATP binding to Apaf-1. Binding of dATP to Apaf-1 was measured in the presence of different amounts of cytochrome c as indicated.B, procaspase-9 further enhances dATP binding to Apaf-1 in a cytochrome c-dependent manner. Binding of dATP to Apaf-1 was measured in the presence of 100 nm cytochromec (Cyt.C), and/or 50 nm procaspase-9, either wild-type (WT.C9) or the D315A mutation (DA.C9) as indicated. C, in the presence of 500 nm cytochrome c (Cyt.c), the effect of different amounts of D315A procaspase-9 (DA.Caspase-9) on dATP binding to Apaf-1 was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding constants of dATP to Apaf-1 in the presence of cytochromec or cytochrome c plus procaspase-9 were measured and calculated by double-reciprocal plot (Fig.3 A). The K dof dATP binding to Apaf-1 in the presence of 500 nmcytochrome c is 1.72 μm. The presence of procaspase-9 further dropped the K d to 0.86 μm, roughly about half of the value with cytochromec alone. We also used this dATP binding assay to measure the relative binding affinity of different nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3 B, increasing amounts of dATP competed efficiently with the radiolabeled dATP bound to Apaf-1. In contrast, dGTP and dADP could not compete for dATP binding to Apaf-1 at all. ATP and ATPγS were about 5- and 50-fold less efficient, respectively, in competing for dATP binding to Apaf-1. To resolve whether dATP hydrolysis is required for apoptosome formation and caspase activation after it binds to Apaf-1, we used [α-33P]dATP in the caspase-9 activation reaction, analyzing the reaction mixture on a gel filtration column. As shown in Fig. 4 A, after incubating [α-33P]dATP with Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and procaspase-9, most of the Apaf-1 was in the apoptosome that also contained cytochrome c. The radioactive nucleotide showed two peaks when eluted from the column. One peak was at fractions 10 and 11, correlating with the apoptosome, and another smaller peak was at fraction 14, correlating with the monomer Apaf-1. Free [α-33P]dATP runs after fraction 18. When the nucleotide associated with fractions 10 and 11 was analyzed on a TLC plate, the predominant form of nucleotide in these fractions was [α-33P]dATP (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that dATP was not hydrolyzed during apoptosome formation. To measure dATP hydrolysis directly, we incubated [γ-32P]dATP with Apaf-1, Apaf-1 with cytochromec, and Apaf-1 with cytochrome c plus procaspase-9 and measured the released 32P. As shown in Fig.4 C, a steady, low level of hydrolysis was observed. However, the rate of hydrolysis was not changed in the presence of cytochromec or cytochrome c plus procaspase-9 compared with Apaf-1 alone. In contrast, dATP binding to Apaf-1 was elevated about 20-fold when cytochrome c and procaspase-9 were present (Fig. 4 D). In addition, the rate of dATP hydrolysis was calculated as less then 1 molecule/Apaf-1/h. We therefore interpreted the observed dATP hydrolysis as background, which is not relevant to Apaf-1 function. To further confirm that dATP hydrolysis is not important for caspase activation, we performed caspase-3 cleavage using two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and compared the results with dATP and ATP. As shown in Fig. 4 F, both ATP analogs ATPγS and ADPCP were able to compete with dATP for Apaf-1 binding. When measured caspase-9 activation directly by the cleavage of its downstream substrate procaspase-3, 1 μm dATP or 100 μm ATP gave maximum caspase-3 cleavage. ATPγS failed to activate caspase-3 even at 1 mm, a result that was consistent with previous finding (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 7Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ADPCP was able to activate caspase-3 at 100 μm concentration, and the activation was comparable with 100 μm ATP when 1 mm ADPCP was used. ADPCP at 1 mm concentration also promoted apoptosome formation as demonstrated in Fig. 4 E. The above data presented a model of caspase activation by Apaf-1. The key event seems to be the binding of dATP or ATP to Apaf-1, which is induced by the binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1. The binding of dATP then induces the oligomerization of Apaf-1·cytochromec complex, which may simultaneously recruits procaspase-9 to the complex. The binding of procaspase-9 synergistically stimulates and/or stabilizes dATP binding to Apaf-1. Finally, Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and caspase-9 form the holoenzyme that cleaves and activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3. The first surprising finding from the current study was that Apaf-1 alone bound dATP poorly. Although Apaf-1 possesses the nucleotide binding sequences that are conserved in the CED-4 protein ofC. elegans and the DARK protein ofDrosophila, these binding sites must either not be accessible to nucleotides or the binding was so loose that it could not withstand the washing procedure used in the assay. In the presence of cytochrome c, nucleotide binding to Apaf-1 increased about 10-fold. Because cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1 happens in the absence of nucleotide (3Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), a temporal sequence emerged with cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1 first, an event that presumably opened up the nucleotide binding site or stabilized the binding so that it withstood the washing condition. The second surprising finding was that procaspase-9 could further increase the dATP binding to Apaf-1, decreasing the K d from 1.72 to 0.86 μm (Fig. 3). This finding indicates that the formation of the holoenzyme of Apaf-1·cytochromec·caspase-9 is a synergistic event with the binding of caspase-9 to apoptosome further opening up the nucleotide binding site or stabilizing the nucleotide binding. The K d of dATP to Apaf-1 in the presence of cytochrome c or cytochromec plus procaspase-9 is well below the cytosolic dATP concentration, which is about 10 μm (15Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6434-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding sequences of the C. elegans Apaf-1 homologue CED-4 are also critical for its function (16Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 455-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Apaf-1, CED-4 protein is lacking the WD-40 repeats and is kept in an inactive state by the binding of CED-9. During apoptosis, CED-4/CED-9 interaction is disrupted, and CED-4 moves from the mitochondrial to the perinuclear region (17Chen F. Hersh B.M. Conradt B. Zhou Z. Riemer D. Gruenbaum Y. Horvitz H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is possible that nucleotide binding to CED-4 might be regulated with CED-9 blocking the nucleotide-binding region of CED-4. The dissociation of CED-9 might open up the nucleotide-binding region of CED-4, leading to its oligomerization and activation of the C. elegans caspase, CED-3 (18Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratories and others has suggested that the hydrolysis of the high-energy bond of dATP or ATP is important for apoptosome formation and caspase activation (6Zou H. Li Y.

The supporting evidence included a direct measurement of ATP hydrolysis by Apaf-1 and the finding that a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, was able to efficiently inhibit caspase activation (6Zou H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). However, when the Drosophila Apaf-1 homologue DARK was discovered, it was noticed that the two critical aspartic acid residues that are supposed to be critical for ATP hydrolysis were changed to leucine and asparagine, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis might not be important for its function (19Rodriguez A. Oliver H. Zou H. Chen P. Wang X. Abrams J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we isolated the apoptosome and analyzed the nucleotide that bound to it, the predominant form was dATP, not dADP (Fig. 4, A and B). We suggest, therefore, that the dATP hydrolysis by Apaf-1 we reported earlier (6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) was from the contaminated proteins in the Apaf-1 preparation. When we measured the dATP hydrolysis directly in the caspase activation reaction mixture using more pure Apaf-1, only the background level of hydrolysis was observed, and the hydrolysis was not regulated by the presence of cytochrome c and procaspase-9 (Fig. 4 C). So, even though we cannot completely rule out the possibility that dATP is hydrolyzed by Apaf-1, the hydrolysis is very slow and is not correlated with its function. The importance of dATP hydrolysis was further ruled out by the observation that a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ADPCP, is sufficient to promote apoptosome formation and caspase-9 activation (Fig. 4, E and F). ADPCP does not contain the high energy bond at its β-γ position and cannot be hydrolyzed by Apaf-1. We now know that the reason dADP cannot substitute dATP or ATP for caspase-9 activation is that dADP has a poor affinity for Apaf-1 (Fig.3 B). These results also suggest that ATPγS is able to inhibit caspase-9 activation efficiently not because it cannot be hydrolyzed, but rather, the substitution of oxygen with a sulfur atom somehow makes it unable to induce the oligomerization of Apaf-1 and may even lock Apaf-1 into a “dead” position so that it cannot oligomerize with other Apaf-1 molecules. The role of nucleotide in Apaf-1 function is similar to that of GTP in G protein function. In both cases, it is the triphosphate form that activates the protein. Both Apaf-1 and G proteins have very low nucleotidase activity. For G protein, there are GTPase-activating proteins, GAPs, that promote GTP hydrolysis to inactivate the G protein, and nucleotide exchange factors, GEFs, that promote G protein activity (20Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

If there are, they may provide new layers of regulation in addition to the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate cytochrome c release and the IAP family of proteins that regulate caspase activity.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Abnormalities in the Ub system have been shown to cause pathological responses, including malignant transformation and several genetic diseases (4Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of a protein substrate involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions. First, Ub, a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, is activated by a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), leading to ATP-dependent formation of a high energy thiol ester bond between the C terminus of Ub and E1; the activated Ub is then transferred to an E2 (Ub-conjugating enzyme or Ubc). E2 enzymes then mediate the transfer of Ub to the target protein directly or to E3 Ub protein ligases, which are responsible for substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to substrate. A substrate may be repetitively ubiquitinated by sequential linkage of additional Ub molecules to form a poly(Ub) chain, which marks the protein substrate for recognition and consequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The E3s are the critical components that provide specificity to the Ub system by direct interaction with substrate. Itch, a novel E3 Ub ligase, is absent in the non-agouti-lethal 18H or Itchy mice (5Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These mice develop immunological and inflammatory diseases, including inflammation in the lung and stomach, hyperplasia in lymphoid and hematopoietic cells, and constant itching in the skin (6Hustad C.M.

Genetics. 1995; 140: 255-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Itch is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Itch contains an N-terminal protein kinase C-related C2 domain, four WW domains, and a C-terminal Hect (homologous to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus) ligase domain (5Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). At present, the biological pathways affected by Itch mutation have not been identified. A recent genetic study showed that suppressor of deltex, an Itch-related protein in Drosophila melanogaster, negatively regulates Notch-mediated signaling (7Cornell M. Evans D.A. Mann R. Fostier M. Flasza M. Monthatong M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Notch may be a target protein for Itch. Notch proteins are a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptors that have been shown to be important regulators in cell fate decisions in many tissues of mammals, including the immune system (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Notch signaling is critically involved in the induction of T cell lineage development and T cell survival (9Deftos M.L. Bevan M.J. Curr. Opin.

We have investigated whether Itch may induce Notch-Ub conjugation and thus regulate Notch-mediated signaling pathways in T cells. Protein expression in Jurkat T cells was performed with a mammalian vector pEFneo that was either tagged with a Myc or HA epitope (11Liu Y.C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or not tagged. A Notch-ΔEF cDNA encoding the transmembrane and entire intracellular domain of murine Notch-1, extending from Ile1701 to Lys2530, was inserted into the pEFneo vector. The intracellular domain of Notch-1 contains an N-terminal transcriptional factor binding domain, six ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST sequence (12Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). A Notch-ΔPEST cDNA derived from Notch-ΔEF with the C-terminal PEST sequences deleted, extending from Ile1701 to Glu2480, was provided by B. Yankner. A Notch-ΔEN encoding the N-terminal transcriptional factor binding domain and the six ankyrin repeats, from Val1744 to Asp2097, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the construct was confirmed by sequencing. A HA·Ub cDNA encoding the eight ubiquitin repeats individually tagged with an HA epitope (13Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) was provided by M. Treier and was subcloned into pEFneo. Mouse Itch cDNA was provided by N. G. Copeland. A mutation at the putative active site cysteine 822 to alanine was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For protein expression in bacteria, Itch cDNAs lacking the N-terminal C2 domain (ΔC2, extending from Asn226 to Glu854), the four WW domains (WW from Pro268 to Pro471), or the C-terminal Hect domain (Hect, from Gln472 to Glu854) were subcloned into a pGEX GST fusion vector. Simian virus 40 T antigen-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For protein expression in Jurkat T cells, cells were transfected with appropriate amounts of plasmids (usually 3–10 μg total) by electroporation (240 V, 960 microfarad, Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaPiP, 5 mmNaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 10 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, lysates (∼1 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies (1 μg) for 2 h, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein A/G Plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional hour at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and boiled in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies (1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were then washed and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 1 h at 70 °C with constant agitation and washed and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at room temperature and purified as described (14Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). For the pull-down assay, GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were added to the cell lysates for incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by addition of 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Precipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. His-tagged Ub, E1, UbcH6, or GST-tagged UbcH7 were prepared using standard protocols as described (14Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination reactions (15 μl) contained His·E1 (100 nm), His·Ubc6 or GST·Ubc7 (0.5 μm), GST·ΔC2 or GST·ΔC2-CA (5 μg), ubiquitin (5 μm), and ATP (2 mm) in Ub buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) with immunoprecipitated Notch-ΔEF on the Sepharose beads as substrate. Incubation was at 25 °C for 90 min. Reactions were stopped by washing the beads four times with lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-Ub antibody. Two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with purifed GST·ΔC2 fusion protein. Antisera were absorbed with excess amounts of GST protein bound on glutathione-Sepharose beads to remove antibodies against GST. The antisera recognized an ∼110 kDa protein in Jurkat T cells and mouse thymocytes by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:500. To determine whether Notch is ubiquitinated, we expressed a Myc epitope-tagged Notch construct containing its transmembrane and intracellular domains (Notch-ΔEF) in the absence or the presence of HA epitope-tagged Ub in human Jurkat T cells. Co-expression of HA·Ub with Notch-ΔEF caused the formation of a higher molecular weight smear in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates that were recognized by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 a). Addition of MG132, a protease inhibitor, which prevents 20 S proteosome-mediated proteolysis (15Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), enhanced this event. The Notch-Ub conjugate formation was further enhanced by the coexpression of UbcH7, an E2 enzyme (Fig. 1 b). We tested whether Itch is involved in ubiquitination of Notch. Co-expression of Itch with Notch-ΔEF in Jurkat T cells markedly induced Notch-Ub conjugation, and that was further increased by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1 c). The Notch-Ub reaction was then reconstituted in vitro. To this end, we generated a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal C2 domain-truncated Itch ΔC2. Immunopurified Notch-ΔEF served as substrate. Ubiquitination reactions were initiated by addition of Ub, human E1, UbcH7 E2, and ATP in the presence of GST or GST·ΔC2. The ubiquitinated products were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody, and then reprobed anti-Ub antibody (Fig. 1 d). Incubation of Notch-ΔEF with GST·ΔC2, but not with GST, led to the formation of slower migrating proteins that were recognized by anti-Myc antibody (left panel). These higher molecular weight forms of Notch-ΔEF represented differential polyubiquitination, as revealed by reprobing the same membrane with anti-Ub antibody. We conclude that the Notch intracellular domain is ubiquitinated and that it serves as a direct substrate for Itch E3 ligase. E3 ligases interact directly with protein substrates and facilitate the transfer of E2-loaded Ub onto the target proteins (16Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The interaction between Itch and Notch was examined by pull-down assays using GST·ΔC2, GST fusion protein containing the four WW domains (GST·WW) or the C-terminal Hect domain (GST·Hect), or GST alone. Lysates prepared from untreated or pervanadate-treated Jurkat T cells overexpressing Notch-ΔEF were incubated with respective GST fusion proteins and the precipitates were analyzed by anti-Myc antibody (Fig.2 a). GST·ΔC2, which encompasses the four WW domains and the Hect domain of Itch, bound to Notch. GST·WW, but not GST·Hect nor GST alone, precipitated Notch to a similar degree as GST·ΔC2 (top panel). We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with pervanadate induces phosphorylation at both the tyrosine and serine/threonine residues such as in the Cbl adaptor protein (17Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether similar treatment could affect the phosphorylation state of Notch and thus the association between Notch and Itch. However, treatment of Jurkat T cells with pervanadate did not affect the interaction (Fig. 2 a, top panel).Figure 2Interaction of Itch with Notch. a, Jurkat T cells were transfected with Notch-ΔEF plasmid (5 μg) and lysates prepared from untreated or pervanadate (PV)-treated cells were incubated with GST, or GST fusion proteins containing both four WW domains and the Hect domain (ΔC2) or with either the WW domains or the Hect domain only (5 μg each) for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (top). The position of Notch-ΔEF is indicated. Bottom, Jurkat T cells were transfected with plasmids containing a PEST sequence-deleted Notch (Notch-ΔPEST) or Notch-ΔEF. Cell lysates were incubated with GST, GST·WW or GST·ΔC2 and analyzed as in the top panel. b, Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with Itch plasmid (5 μg) with pEF empty vector, Notch-ΔPEST, or Notch-ΔEF plasmid (5 μg each). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Itch antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed with anti-Myc antibody (top). The same membrane was reprobed with anti-Itch antibody. The position of Itch is indicated. c, Notch-ΔEF or Notch-ΔPEST was expressed in Jurkat T cells together with HA·Ub. Ub conjugation to these proteins was analyzed as in Fig. 1.d, Notch-ΔPEST was co-expressed without (–) or with (+) Itch. Ubiquitination of Notch-ΔPEST was analyzed as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Notch has a C-terminal Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr (PEST) region, which is implicated in protein degradation (18Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). We tested whether removal of the PEST region (Notch-ΔPEST) affects the association between Itch and Notch. Lysates prepared from Jurkat T cells expressing Notch-ΔPEST or Notch-ΔEF were incubated with GST, GST·WW, or GST·ΔC2 and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. Deletion of the PEST sequences in Notch did not affect the interaction between Itch and Notch (Fig. 2 a,bottom panel). The in vitro association was confirmed by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. Itch was co-expressed with Notch-ΔPEST or Notch-ΔEF in Jurkat T cells and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Itch antibody. Both Notch-ΔPEST and Notch-ΔEF were co-immunoprecipitated with Itch (Fig. 2 b). Ub conjugation to Notch-ΔEF or to Notch-ΔPEST was compared in Jurkat T cells. The two proteins were ubiquitinated to a similar degree under resting conditions, and in both cases ubiquitination was enhanced by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2 c). Like Notch-ΔEF, co-expression with Itch remarkably increased ubiquitination of Notch-ΔPEST (Fig. 2 d). We tried to further map the Itch binding region in Notch intracellular domain. A Myc-tagged cDNA construct was generated that contains the N-terminal RAM transcription factor binding domain and the six ankyrin repeats (Notch-ΔEN). Notch-ΔEN as well Notch-ΔEF was expressed in Jurkat T cells. Cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST·WW and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc. GST·WW, but not GST alone still bound to Notch-ΔEN, although less efficiently than to Notch-ΔEF (Fig.3 a). Thus, the N-terminal region of the Notch intracellular domain is responsible for the association with the WW domains of Itch. Ub conjugation to Notch-ΔEN was subsequently examined. Ubiquitination of Notch-ΔEN was detected in cells co-expressing HA·Ub, and this was increased by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3 b). The same cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed with anti-Myc antibody. Mono- or polyubiquitinated Notch-ΔEN was present in the Ub immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 c). To determine whether the N-terminal intracellular domain of Notch can serve as a substrate for Ub conjugation by Itch, Notch-ΔEN was co-expressed with Itch. Co-expression with Itch significantly increased ubiquitination of Notch-ΔEN (Fig. 3 d), suggesting that this portion is required for both recognition and subsequent ubiquitination of Notch by Itch. Hect domains of E3 ligases of this family share a region of ∼350 amino acids at the C terminus, which contains an E2 binding site and a putative active site cysteine residue. The Hect domain governs the transfer of Ub from E2 to the putative active-site cysteine and then to the protein substrate and the polyubiquitination of the substrate (19Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To evaluate a possible role of the Itch Hect domain in mediating Notch ubiquitination, we next generated a construct in which the putative active-site cysteine 822 was mutated to an alanine (Itch-CA) and examined whether this mutation affects the ligase activity of Itch. Whereas wild-type Itch enhanced Ub conjugation to Notch-ΔEN under both resting and MG132-treated conditions, Itch-CA mutation abolished this effect (Fig. 4 a). In fact, Itch-CA reduced ubiquitination of Notch-ΔEN to a lower level as compared with cells transfected with empty control vector, suggesting that Itch-CA plays a dominant-negative role. The role of this putative active site cysteine in promoting ubiquitination of Notch was also examined in vitro. Replacement of cysteine 822 with alanine in GST·ΔC2 of Itch fusion protein almost completely abolished Ub conjugation to immunopurified Notch-ΔEF, as revealed by either anti-Myc or by anti-Ub blotting (Fig. 4 b), suggesting that the putative active-site cysteine is indeed required for the transfer of Ub to the substrate. In this study we demonstrated that Itch acts as an E3 protein ligase to induce Notch ubiquitination using both in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays. More importantly, Itch WW domains interact with the Notch N-terminal region and a functional Hect ligase domain is required for promoting Ub conjugation to Notch. The results suggest that Notch may function as a physiological target for the Itch E3 ligase. WW domains derive their name from the presence of two highly conserved tryptophan (W) residues, which are spaced 20–22 amino acids apart. WW domains contain 38–40 amino acids in a triple-stranded β-sheet and are found in proteins that participate in cell signaling or regulation. These domains are implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs (20Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing elements in their binding partners (21Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Notch has a proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich PEST sequence at its C terminus. It is also known that PEST sequences in general are involved in protein instability (18Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). In consequence, it is surprising to note that this sequence is not required for the interaction with Itch WW domains nor for Ub conjugation. Rather, it was shown that an N-terminal region is responsible for the interaction. This region contains ankyrin repeats and has been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Inspection of this region, however, does not show any proline- or serine/threonine-rich sequences. Further study is needed to understand whether this interaction is direct or through indirect factor (s). Notch has been implicated in the regulation of T cell development and hematopoiesis, particularly in CD4 versus CD8 lineage decision (22Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The results of this work suggest that Itch, an E3 protein ligase, recruits and promotes the Ub conjugation of Notch, thus down-regulating Notch protein level and Notch-mediated signaling. This notion is consistent with the observation in Drosophila that ectopic overexpression of suppressor of deltex, an Itch homologue, enhances the phenotypes of loss-of-function mutations in Notch (7Cornell M. Evans D.A. Mann R. Fostier M. Flasza M. Monthatong M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data may support an idea that Itch or its homologs play an evolutionarily conserved role as a negative regulator of Notch receptor signaling. Further functional studies of Itch in T cell development and activation will provide molecular insights into the abnormal immune responses manifested in Itchy mice."
https://openalex.org/W2062232288,"While most organisms grow at temperatures ranging between 20 and 50 °C, many archaea and a few bacteria have been found capable of withstanding temperatures close to 100 °C, or beyond, such as Pyrococcus or Aquifex. Here we report the results of two independent large scale unbiased approaches to identify global protein properties correlating with an extreme thermophile lifestyle. First, we performed a comparative proteome analyses using 30 complete genome sequences from the three kingdoms. A large difference between the proportions of charged versuspolar (noncharged) amino acids was found to be a signature of all hyperthermophilic organisms. Second, we analyzed the water accessible surfaces of 189 protein structures belonging to mesophiles or hyperthermophiles. We found that the surfaces of hyperthermophilic proteins exhibited the shift already observed at the genomic level,i.e. a proportion of solvent accessible charged residues strongly increased at the expense of polar residues. The biophysical requirements for the presence of charged residues at the protein surface, allowing protein stabilization through ion bonds, is therefore clearly imprinted and detectable in all genome sequences available to date. While most organisms grow at temperatures ranging between 20 and 50 °C, many archaea and a few bacteria have been found capable of withstanding temperatures close to 100 °C, or beyond, such as Pyrococcus or Aquifex. Here we report the results of two independent large scale unbiased approaches to identify global protein properties correlating with an extreme thermophile lifestyle. First, we performed a comparative proteome analyses using 30 complete genome sequences from the three kingdoms. A large difference between the proportions of charged versuspolar (noncharged) amino acids was found to be a signature of all hyperthermophilic organisms. Second, we analyzed the water accessible surfaces of 189 protein structures belonging to mesophiles or hyperthermophiles. We found that the surfaces of hyperthermophilic proteins exhibited the shift already observed at the genomic level,i.e. a proportion of solvent accessible charged residues strongly increased at the expense of polar residues. The biophysical requirements for the presence of charged residues at the protein surface, allowing protein stabilization through ion bonds, is therefore clearly imprinted and detectable in all genome sequences available to date. open reading frame water-accessible surface the difference between charged and polar noncharged amino acids The number of solved protein structures from hyperthermophiles is increasing at a fast pace (Refs. 1Goldman A.

Based on comparisons between mesophiles and hyperthermophiles, two main factors have been suggested as responsible for thermostability: (i) the presence of large networks of ion pairs at the protein surface (1Goldman A.

Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 307-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, it as been proposed that adaptation to high temperature might involve different mechanisms in moderate thermophiles versusextreme thermophiles (12Szilagyi A. Zavodszky P. Structure ( Lond. ). 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). This follows from a markedly different temperature dependence of the hydrophobic interactions, optimal around 70 °C (14Scheraga H.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1998; 16: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), compared with coulombic interactions, optimum at higher temperatures, up to 100 °C (9Pace N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moderate thermophiles and extreme thermophiles should therefore be treated separately for the analysis of high temperature adaptation factors. Apparent discrepancies in the results of previous works might originate in a failure to do so. The availability of an increasing number of complete genomic sequences makes global proteome analysis a powerful tool for establishing genome-function relationships. In this respect, some differences were already noted between the amino acid compositions of subsets of ORFs1 from mesophiles and hyperthermophiles (15Tekaia F. Lazcano A. Dujon B. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 550-557PubMed Google Scholar, 16Böhm G. Jaenicke R. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Choi I.-G. Kim S.S. Ryu J.R.

However, previous approaches used comparisons of orthologous sequences or of structures of proteins belonging to a same family (5Vogt G. Woell S. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 6Lo Leggio L. Kalogiannis S. Bhat M.K. Pickersgill R.W. Proteins Struct. Funct.

The x-ray structures were also selected according to quality criteria. Applying these two criteria lead to a reduced number of structures analyzed and might yield to a statistically less satisfactory approach. Here, we postulated that the most basic features of protein structures, amino acid composition and localization, should be imprinted in the genome of organisms with very different lifestyles. We therefore expected that global differences should be readily detectable from a coarse but comprehensive and unbiased analysis. Here, we computed the amino acid compositions in the ORFs of all complete genome sequences available to date (30) as well as on the protein surfaces (water-accessible surface (WAS), Ref. 19Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 306: 287-290Google Scholar) of a large set of protein structures. Although these analysis were unbiased, since no prior selection of sequences or structures was performed, they exhibit a remarkable correlation, suggesting that the replacement of polar noncharged residues by charged ones constitutes a major stabilization mechanism in the proteins of hyperthermophilic organisms. Data on the amino acid composition of the fully sequenced genomes were taken from the web site of Fred Tekaia, Pasteur Institute (Paris). Organisms have been classified according to the three major domains of life and using the following abbreviations (which are used in Figs. 1 and 2 A).

The number of Protein Data Bank structures used for surface calculations are as follows. (i) Mesophiles: E. coli, 50; B. subtilis, 34;S. cerevisiae, 47. (ii) Hyperthermophiles (total of 58): Pyrococcus furiosus, 11; wosei, 3;kodakaraensis, 2; T. maritima, 10;neapolitana, 1; Aquifex pyrophilus, 2;aeolicus, 1; Sulfolobus solfataricus, 6;acidocaldarius, 5; M. jannaschii, 9;Thermococcus littoralis, 2; celer, 1; gorgonarius, 1; Methanopyrus kandleri, 2; Pyrobaculum aerophilum, 2. Our data set consists of the amino acid compositions of the entire proteomes of 22 mesophiles, 1 thermophile, and 7 hyperthermophiles. We calculated the average proportion of each amino acid in all mesophiles (30–50 °C) on one hand and in all hyperthermophiles (>80 °C, Table I) on the other hand. The only moderately thermophile organism genome available, that of M. thermoautotrophicum (Table I), was excluded from the comparisons for the reasons mentioned above (except for Figs 1 and 2 A). We then grouped the results for each amino acid in classes such as charged, polar noncharged, aliphatics, and aromatics, a procedure based on biophysical characters and already used in this kind of approach (5Vogt G. Woell S. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar,12Szilagyi A. Zavodszky P. Structure ( Lond. ). 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). A benefit of this procedure is also to correct the bias in the proportion of certain amino acids induced by the strong variation in (G + C) content across the compared genomes (Fig. 1). For instance, arginine content was found to be strongly correlated with the (G + C) percentage, while the lysine content is strongly anticorrelated (Fig. 1). The use of Lys or Arg by a given organism does not depend on specific chemical properties of Argversus Lys, but only depends on the (G + C) content, as indicated by Fig. 1. Therefore, grouping Lys + Arg makes it possible to overcome the (G + C) content bias. As a consequence, the variations observed for the positively charged residues (Lys + Arg) stay within 50%, while up to 5-fold variations are observed for the individual amino acids (Fig. 1). It is worth to notice that the (G + C) content is not correlated to the optimal growth temperature of the organisms (Fig. 1).Table IOptimal growth temperature of the thermophile and the different hyperthermophiles used in this workHyperthermophiles Aquifex pyrophilusBacteria85 °C Aquifex aeolicusBacteria90 °C Thermotoga maritimaBacteria80 °C Aeropyrum pernixArchaea90 °C Archaeoglobus fulgidusArchaea85 °C Methanococcus jannaschiiArchaea85 °C Methanopyrus kandleriArchaea98 °C Pyrobaculum aerophilumArchaea98 °C Pyrococcus abyssiiArchaea97 °C Pyrococcus furiosusArchaea97 °C Pyrococcus horikoshiiArchaea95 °C Pyrococcus woeseiArchaea97 °C Sulfolobus solfataricusArchaea85 °C Thermococcus litoralisArchaea83 °CThermophile Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicusArchaea65 °CData were taken from the DSMZ data base of organisms (Braunschweg, Germany). Open table in a new tab Data were taken from the DSMZ data base of organisms (Braunschweg, Germany). The proteome analysis in amino acid classes indicated that hyperthermophilicity is characterized by a sharp increase of charged residues, Lys and Glu, at the expense of polar noncharged residues, mainly Gln (Fig. 2 A). This correlation with growth temperature is verified across the three kingdoms (Fig. 2 A). A slight increase in medium and large aliphatics is also observed, while the percentage of the short aliphatic alanine is lower (Fig.2 B). No significant variations are observed in aromatics or in other residues such as His, Pro, Gly, or Cys. In summary, the difference between charged and polar noncharged amino acids (Ch-Po) is the best indicator of the organism's lifestyle (Fig. 2,A–C). A threshold is observed around 10% for the extreme thermophiles Ch-Po values, while a higher limit of 5% characterizes the mesophiles. The moderate thermophile M. thermoautotrophicum is situated in between these two values (Fig.2 A). Our initial analysis of the A. pernix proteome revealed a discrepancy: a Ch-Po value of only 5.2% was computed for this organism, thus in the mesophile range and much below the 10% lower limit inferred from the other true hyperthermophiles (Table I). This conflicting result prompted us to reassess the quality of the ORF annotation originally proposed for this genome. According to the original publication (20Kawarabayasi Y. et al.DNA Res. 1999; 6: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar)A. pernix was found to exhibit 2694 ORFs for a total genome length of 1,669,695 base pairs, thus corresponding to 1 ORF for 620 nucleotides in average. This theoretical gene density is almost twice as much as previously reported for any other micro-organism sequenced so far. The fact that this organism was also claimed to exhibit the largest proportion of ORFs without data base similarity (57.1%) suggested an anomaly in the genome annotation. The whole A. permix ORF data set was then downloaded from the official site at the Japan National Institute for Technology Evaluation for further study. It soon appeared that the total number of nucleotides included in the protein coding fraction of the genome (1,916,052) was much greater than the total number of nucleotides (1,669,695). This anomaly is mostly due to the annotation of overlapping ORFs in different reading frames, resulting in a significant overprediction of genes and the pollution of our computations by illegitimate protein sequences. We first corrected this problem by limiting our amino acid composition analyses to the subset of 628 predicted ORFs for which clear homologues have been recognized in other organisms (“Annotable ORFs,” according to Ref. 20Kawarabayasi Y. et al.DNA Res. 1999; 6: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This subset is less likely to contain illegitimate ORFs. Independently, we also reannotated A pernix genomic sequence using the iterative Markov model method SelfID (21Audic S. Claverie J.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and recomputed the amino acid composition on the predicted coding regions longer than 300 nucleotides. The amino acid compositions obtained by these two independent ways are virtually identical, and as expected, very different from the composition computed on the original data set. Using the two corrected amino acid compositions, our previously defined indicator of thermophilicity Ch-Po was 10.6%, compatible with the values observed for the other hyperthermophilic organisms. After the above correction for A. pernix, P. horkoshii became the hyperthermophile organism associated with the lowest Ch-Po value (10.2%), far from the other Pyrococcus,P. abyssii (13.2%). It turns out that the P. horkoshii genome sequence was determined in the same Institute as that of A. pernix and annotated according to a similar protocol (23Kawarabayasi Y. et al.DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). P. horkoshii is also characterized by a very large fraction of ORFs without data base similarity (44.4%) and a unusually high gene density with predicted protein coding nucleotides representing 98.5% of the total genome. We thus suspected that the same overprediction plaguing A. pernix could affect P. horikoshii, although to a lesser extent. As expected, restraining the amino acid composition analysis to the subset of 557 predicted ORFs with recognized homologs resulted in a corrected C-P value of 13.6%, almost identical to that of P. abyssii. The average values presented in the plots of Fig. 2 include these corrections. In the paper by Audic and Claverie (21Audic S. Claverie J.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) 10 bacterial genomes were checked using the described method. There were very small differences between the published data and the reanalyzed one. After the discovery of the wrong annotations of the Japanese institute, we reanalyzed the 13 remaining genomes, and we found, as in the first 10, small differences or none. The proportion of polar noncharged amino acids is greatly decreased in the extreme thermophile organisms and partially compensated by charged amino acids (Fig. 2 A). Where are these amino acids located in the proteins structures? Are the variations observed in the genomes correlated with differences at the protein surfaces? To address these questions, we calculated the WAS of the various amino acids for 131 proteins from three mesophilic bacteria and for 58 proteins from hyperthermophilic bacteria or archaea (Fig.3). The WAS values were then grouped by classes of amino acids, as defined above for the genomic analyses. The most striking difference between the WAS values was again found between charged and polar noncharged amino acids (Fig. 3 A). The WAS percentage of charged amino acids increased from 22.5 in mesophiles to 27 in hyperthermophiles (+20%), mainly due to lysines and glutamic acids. This difference (+4.5%) was almost fully compensated for by the decrease of the WAS percentage (−3.5%) of polar residues in mesophiles (Fig. 3 B). Glutamine exhibited the largest variation among all residues, with a WAS decreased by more than 2-fold. WAS values for the other polar residues exhibited the same trend, to a lesser magnitude. The WAS percentage for aliphatic residues showed little change at 6.0–6.5% of the total surface area. In contrast, alanines are decreased by 2-fold, and histidines by 1.5-fold (Fig.3 A). Finally, the exposed area of Gly, Cys, and aromatic residues was found to be unchanged between mesophiles and hyperthermophiles. The differences observed in the above average values are comparable with those computed between individual sets of proteins from the three mesophilic or the three hyperthermophilic organisms, reinforcing their significance (Fig. 3 B). Thus, our results indicate that the large differences in surface accessibilities of amino acid classes are correlated with the large variations observed in the overall proteome abundance between the two sets of organisms. Coarse but extensive approaches at the genome or structure level are thus able to identify discriminant factors between mesophiles and extreme thermophiles. This implies the existence of global structural features associated with hyperthermostability common to thermophilic bacteria and archaea. The equal increase of subclasses of oppositely charged residues (mostly Lys, Arg, and Glu) in hyperthermophiles most likely derives from the increased amount of ion pairs observed at the surface of their proteins. This is the genomic signature of a thermodynamic advantage resulting from the increased stability of coulombic interactions with temperature (itself due to the decrease of water dielectric constant, Ref. 9Pace N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in most structures of hyperthermophilic proteins, the existence of long chains of ion pairs providing cooperative stabilization has been demonstrated (1Goldman A. Structure ( Lond. ). 1995; 3: 1277-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Korolev S. Nayal M. Barnes W.M. Di Cera E. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure ( Lond. ). 1995; 3: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residues the proportion of which exhibit the largest relative decreases in the genomes of hyperthermophiles are Asn and Gln, already known to be the most temperature sensitive. It is tempting to relate the observed Glu/Gln balance to a peculiarity in the metabolism of hyperthermophiles. For instance, the Gln tRNA synthetase gene is missing in the bacteria A. aeolicus (18Deckert G. et al.Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) and the archaeaM. janaschii (24Bult C.J. et al.Science. 1997; 273: 1058-1073Crossref Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In both organisms, Gln originates from the amidation of glutamic acid loaded on the Gln tRNA. Conversely, a completely different class of Lys tRNA synthetase gene has been found to exist in some hyperthermophiles, where the proportion of lysine is much increased. Missing, different, or more efficient aminoacyl tRNA synthetases may contribute to various adaptive mechanisms and play a crucial and general role in the pathway to hyperthermostability.

Hoffmann J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In fact, the hemocytes of horseshoe crabs contain various cysteine-rich cationic peptides (tachyplesin, polyphemusin, tachycitin, tachystatin, and big defensin) with inhibitory effects on the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. In addition, two non-cysteine-rich proteins, anti-lipopolysaccharide factor, and factor D, with antimicrobial properties mainly against Gram-negative bacteria are produced in response to a microbial infection (7Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The tachyplesin family of antimicrobial peptides, including polyphemusins, is located in the small granules of the hemocytes, as also are tachycitin and tachystatin, whereas the anti-lipopolysaccharide factor and factor D are found in the large granules and the big defensin in both types of granules. In addition to this group of chelicerates, several antimicrobial peptides were characterized in the hemolymph of the scorpions Leiurus quinquestriatus (8Cociancich S. Goyffon M. Bontems F. Bulet P. Bouet F. Menez A. Hoffmann J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Androctonus australis (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among these peptides, two are members of the widespread invertebrate defensin family (for a review see Ref. 10Dimarcq J.L. Bulet P. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Biopolymers ( Peptide Sci. ). 1998; 47: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These scorpion defensins are mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria. Although only a defensin type molecule was found in L. quinquestriatus (7Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), three distinct antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from the hemolymph of unchallenged scorpions of the species A. australis: an insect defensin-like molecule (as mentioned above) and two additional cysteine-containing peptides, androctonin and buthinin (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Androctonin is a 25-residue peptide with four cysteine residues, active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Androctonin shows sequence similarities to tachyplesin and polyphemusin. In contrast, buthinin, a 34-amino acid peptide with three internal disulfide bridges, shows no sequence similarities with known antimicrobial peptides. Buthinin was found to be active only against bacteria. Interestingly, in addition to strictly antimicrobial peptides found in chelicerates, additional molecules with antibacterial properties have been recently isolated from the venom of the wolf spider Lycosa carolinensis. In this spider, two toxins (lycotoxins I and II) containing 25–27 amino acids and deprived of cysteine residues exhibit antimicrobial properties. Surprisingly, they show marked sequence similarities to some frog antimicrobial peptides such as magainin, adenoregulin, and dermaseptins. In addition to having antimicrobial activity, they dissipate ion and voltage gradients across the membranes of excitable cells and probably contribute to paralysis of envenomed prey (11Yan L. Adams M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2059-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no report of a strictly antimicrobial peptide from spiders is available in the literature. To understand whether spiders are able to mount an immune response through the production of antimicrobial substances as observed in insects, we started to investigate such possibility in the mygalomorph spiderAcanthoscurria gomesiana. The characterization of antimicrobial peptides in this class of chelicerates would be of great value to understand the evolutionary aspects of innate immunity. On this basis, the use of mygalomorph spiders as an experimental model is very useful, because they are one of the oldest species in the orderAraneae. In this paper, we report the isolation and full characterization of a small size antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of unchallengedA. gomesiana. This peptide, named gomesin from the speciesgomesiana, has 18 amino acids and two disulfide bridges. This open-ended cyclic peptide shows marked sequence similarities to tachyplesin and polyphemusin from horseshoe crabs (12Nakamura T. Furunaka H. Miyata T. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Niwa M.

Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and to androctonin from the scorpion A. australis (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). More interestingly, gomesin shares also structural similarities with protegrins, antimicrobial peptides from porcine leukocytes (14Kokryakov V.N. Harwig S.S. Panyutich E.A. Shevchenko A.A. Aleshina G.M. Shamova O.V. Korneva H.A. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition to being effective against the growth of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, synthetic gomesin was found to be strongly efficient against the growth of filamentous fungi and yeast and moderately active against the viability of the parasiteLeishmania amazonensis. The common spider (A. gomesiana) was obtained from the Arthropods Laboratory of the Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil). A. gomesiana is a tarantula spider of theTheraphosidae family. The hemolymph (approximately 0.4 ml/spider) from animals of either sex at different stages of development was collected from prechilled animals by cardiac puncture with an apyrogenic syringe. To avoid hemocyte degranulation and coagulation, the hemolymph was collected in the presence of sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.6 (2:1, v/v) (15Söderhall K. Smith V.J. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1983; 7: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The hemocytes were removed from plasma by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Entire hemocytes were washed once with sodium citrate buffer and lysed by concentration in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant Instruments, Inc). For experimental spider immunization, 50 μl of the Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter cloacae (2 × 105 cells) were injected into the dorsal abdomen of the animals. The hemolymph was collected 48 h after injection. After concentration, the hemocytes collected from the hemolymph (1.8 ml) of unchallenged spiders were homogenized in a Dounce apparatus (maximum, 152 μm; minimum, 76 μm) in 1.5 ml of 2 macetic acid supplemented with aprotinin (20 μg/ml) as protease inhibitor. A second homogenization was performed by sonication (3 × 30 s) at medium power (Branson Ultrasons Annemasse, France) in an ice-cold water bath, and extraction was performed over a period of 30 min at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The supernatant, obtained by centrifugation at 13,800 × g for 30 min at 6 °C, was directly subjected to prepurification by solid phase extraction. The combined cytosolic and organelle acid extracts were loaded onto serially linked classic Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates) equilibrated in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Three stepwise elutions were successively performed with 5%, 40%, and 80% acetonitrile in acidified water. The 40% Sep-Pak fraction was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted with MilliQ water, and applied to reversed phase chromatography on a semipreparative Aquapore RP-300 C8 column (250 × 7.0 mm, BrownleeTM) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile in acidified water. Elution was performed with a linear 2–60% gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water over 120 min at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The active fraction from hemocytes (AGH2) was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using two serially linked HPLC-SEC1 columns (Ultraspherogel SEC 3000 and SEC 2000 columns, 300 × 7.5 mm, BeckmanTM) protected by a precolumn (Ultraspherogel SEC, 40 × 7.5 mm, BeckmanTM). Elution was performed under isocratic conditions with 30% acetonitrile in acidified water at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. HPLC purification was carried out at room temperature on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. The column effluent was monitored for absorbance at 225 nm. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were hand collected, concentrated under vacuum, and reconstituted in MilliQ water. The presence of antibacterial activity was determined by a liquid growth inhibition assay. Peptide purity was ascertained by capillary zone electrophoresis. Analysis was performed in a Model 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems) equipped with a fused silica tube (length, 72 cm; internal diameter, 50 μm) as described previously (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF-MS was performed with a Bruker BIFEX™ (Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer operating in a positive linear mode as described previously (16Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lambert J. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data were obtained using a Finnigan LCQTMDuo mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest) at a mass to charge (m/z) range of 2000. The peptides dissolved in water/acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) were introduced in the spectrometer by flow injection at 5 μl/min and analyzed in the positive mode. Calibration was performed using the following mixture of standard substances: caffeine (m/z 195.2),l-methionyl-arginyl-phenylalanyl-alanine acetate H2O (m/z 524.3), and Ultramark 1621 (m/z 1022, 1122, 1222, 1322, 1422, 1522, 1622, 1722, 1822, and 1922). Purified peptide (2 nmol) was subjected to reduction and S-pyridylethylation using a procedure described previously (17Bulet P. Cociancich S. Reuland M. Sauber F. Bischoff R. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The S-pyridylethylated peptide was desalted/purified on an Aquapore RP300 C8column (220 × 4.6 mm, BrownleeTM) using a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water over 120 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Synthetic amidated peptide (90 nmol) was reduced andS-carboxyamidomethylated by iodoacetamide (18Aitken A. Learmonth M. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 339-340Crossref Google Scholar). TheS-carboxyamidomethylcysteine peptide was desalted/purified on a Vydac C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Vydac®) using a linear gradient of 2–80% acetonitrile in acidified water over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The pyridylethylated peptide to be cleaved with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithioerythritol and 5% glycerol (v/v), pH 8, using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The deblocked peptide was purified by HPLC onto a microbore reversed phase column (100 × 1 mm, Aquapore RP-300 C8, BrownleeTM) using a linear 2 to 60% acetonitrile gradient in acidified water over 60 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min at 35 °C. The eluted peaks were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the fraction corresponding to the deblocked peptide was subjected to sequencing by Edman degradation. Native peptide was treated with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) in a 40-μl reaction medium containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Incubation was carried out overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by acidification with formic acid (final concentration, 3%). Peptide fragments were separated by HPLC on a narrowbore reversed phase column (Delta Pak HPI C18, 2 × 150 mm; WatersTM) using a linear 2–80% acidified acetonitrile gradient over a period of 90 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min at 30 °C. The various peptide fragments obtained were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the fragments of interest were subjected to microsequencing by Edman degradation. Automated Edman degradation of the deblocked pyridylethylated peptide and of the peptide fragments and detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were performed using a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (Perkin Elmer 32 Applied Biosystems model 473A). Nonamidated and amidated peptides were synthesized according to a procedure previously described (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptides were synthesized according to classical Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. At the end of the process, the peptides (25 μmol) were taken up to 2.5 liters in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 8.5, and allowed to renature by air oxidation overnight at room temperature under stirring. After renaturation, the pH was adjusted to 4 with acetic acid and the peptide solution loaded onto Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridges (Waters Associates) equilibrated with acidified water. The peptides were eluted with 60% acetonitrile in acidified water, concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge and purified to homogeneity by reversed phase chromatography using a preparative column (Aquapore RP 300 C8, 150 × 10 mm, BrownleeTM). The microbial strains were those used in previous studies (19Bulet P. Cociancich S. Dimarcq J.-L. Lambert J. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann D. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol.

The following additional fungal and bacterial strains were generous gifts from different colleagues: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. hemeolyticus (H. Monteil, Institute of Bacteriology, University of Strasbourg, France), Nocardia asteroides (Y. Piémont, Institute of Bacteriology, University of Strasbourg, France),Serratia marcescens Db11 (H.G. Boman, Department of Microbiology, University of Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden),Beauveria bassiana (INRA, St-Christol-les-Ales, France), andTricophyton mentagrophytes and Candida tropicalis(H. Koenig, Laboratory of Mycology, University of Medicine, Strasbourg, France). During the purification procedure, antibacterial activity was monitored by a liquid growth inhibition assay against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli SBS363 as described in Ref.23Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The MIC of the synthetic peptides was determined against fungi and bacterial strains using a procedure described previously (9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When the antifungal activity assay was performed in the presence of salt, the culture medium was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, 137 mm NaCl. MICs are expressed as the [a] − [b] interval of concentrations, where [a] is the highest concentration tested at which the microorganisms are growing and [b] is the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition. The bactericidal assay was monitored against M. luteus andE. coli D22 as described in Ref. 9Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar. The final concentration of amidated gomesin tested was 10 μm. For the fungicidal assay, spores of Neurospora crassa were incubated in the presence of 10 μm amidated gomesin. After 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h, the culture medium containing the peptide was removed and replaced with fresh medium. After 48 h the cultures were examined microscopically and spectrometrically. The hemolytic activity assay was monitored against human erythrocytes. Two times serial dilutions of synthetic gomesin from concentrations of both forms of gomesin of 0.1 to 100 μm were incubated in Eppendorf tubes with a suspension of erythrocytes (0.4%) in phosphate-buffered saline. As a positive control (100% lysis), the erythrocytes were incubated with 0.1% SDS. After 1 h at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged (320 × g, 5 min), and the absorbance of the supernatant (50 μl) was measured at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader. For the antiparasitic assay, cell viability of L. (Leishmania) amazonensis (MPRO/BR/72/M 1841-LV-79) was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay as described (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46517) Google Scholar) and adapted for Leishmania spp. (25Kiderlen A.F. Kaye P.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 127: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 stationary phase promastigotes suspended in buffered saline (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) were incubated with two times serial dilutions of synthetic gomesin and hemoglobin fragment (33–61 of bovine α-hemoglobin) (26Fogaça A.C. da Silva Jr., P.I. Miranda M.T. Bianchi A.G. Miranda A. Ribolla P.E. Daffre S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25330-25334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) from 0.3 to 80 μm. After a 1-h incubation at 22 °C, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the reaction was measured after 40 min in a microtiter plate reader at 595 nm. We first performed a pilot experiment to compare the antibacterial activity against M. luteus of crude extracts of hemocytes from unchallenged and bacteria-challenged A. gomesiana spiders. Because no increase in antibacterial activity was found in the immunized spiders, we decided to purify the antimicrobial compounds from native spider hemocytes. The antimicrobial compounds from the hemocytes were extracted under acidic conditions after sonication. The acidic extract was prepurified by solid phase extraction. The three eluted fractions obtained (5, 40, and 80%) were submitted to reversed phase HPLC and to the antibacterial assay. Among the different fractions obtained from the 40% Sep-Pak fraction, three were found to have activity againstM. luteus and E. coli, the two bacterial strains used for the bioassay (Fig.1 A). In the present study, we focused our attention on fraction AGH2, which has activity against both strains of bacteria. MALDI-MS analysis of fraction AGH2 revealed the presence of three different molecules with molecular masses of 413.4, 2270.4, and 7179.8 Da. To separate these molecules, the second step of purification was performed using size exclusion chromatography (Fig.1 B). Among the different fractions obtained, only one peak was found to be active against M. luteus and E. coli. Because a single molecular mass of 2270.4 Da was obtained by mass spectrometry, the molecule was considered to be pure enough for sequencing by Edman degradation. Because no PTH-derivative signal was observed in the 25 cycles of Edman degradation, this molecule was supposed to be a N-terminally blocked peptide. To verify this hypothesis, the reduced andS-pyridylethylated molecule was subjected to pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion to remove a potential pyroglutamic acid. After purification by reversed phase HPLC of the digestion products, two fractions were obtained (data not shown). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a difference of 111 Da between the two molecules that corresponded to the exact molecular mass of a pyroglutamic acid. For this reason, only the compound with the smallest molecular mass (2583.8 Da) was subjected to Edman degradation. The following 17-residue sequence was obtained: C*RRLC*YKQRC*VTYC*RGR,where C* stands for a pyridylethylated cysteine residue. The identification of the four pyridylethylated cysteine residues after Edman degradation is in agreement with the increased mass (424.3 Da) of the native peptide following reduction/alkylation with vinyl pyridine (2694.7 Da). From the primary sequence obtained and assuming pyroglutamic acid (Z) as the first residue and four cysteine residues involved in two disulfide bridges, the mass calculated as 2269.7 Da differs only by approximately +1 Da from the mass measured by MALDI-TOF-MS (2270.4 Da). This observation indicates a possible amidation of the C-terminal arginine of the peptide. To define the cysteine array, the native molecule (ZC*RRLC*YKQRC*VTYC*RGR) was subjected to tryptic digestion. Following digestion, several fragments were separated by reversed phase HPLC. A peak with a molecular mass at 1006.9 Da was sequenced by Edman degradation, and the following sequence was obtained: Leu-Val-(Tyr/Thr)-(Tyr/Lys). The presence of two clear PTH-derivatives at positions 3 and 4 at the same intensity clearly demonstrated the presence of a double sequence in this fraction. This observation, associated with the primary structure established, is in agreement with the linkage of the tetrapeptide Leu5-Cys6-Tyr7-Lys8 to the sequence Cys11-Val12-Thr13-Tyr14. Therefore, the two intramolecular disulfide bridges are between Cys21 and Cys154 and between Cys62 and Cys113. To confirm our hypothesis concerning the terminal amidation of this peptide, amidated and non-amidated molecules were prepared chemically. After renaturation and purification to homogeneity, the identity and integrity of both compounds were confirmed by mass spectrometry and capillary zone electrophoresis (data not shown). When the native molecule and the two synthetic forms were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, the monoisotopic molecular mass of the native molecule (2270.9 Da) was in perfect agreement with the monoisotopic molecular mass of the synthetic amidated molecule (2270.5 Da) compared with the molecular mass of the non-amidated form (2271.6 Da). This confirmed that the native peptide presents a C-terminal arginine α-amide. This 18-residue amidated peptide was named gomesin in reference to the species name of the spider A. gomesiana. The MIC of gomesin purified from spider hemocytes against M. luteus was 0.25–0.5 μm, similar to the MIC found for the synthetic peptides (0.4–0.8 μm) (TableI). The amidated synthetic gomesin had a strong activity against almost all Gram-positive bacteria tested (MICs < 3.15 μm), except Pediococcus acidolactici (MIC = 3.15–6.25 μm) andBacillus cereus and E. faecalis (MIC = 6.25–12.5 μm). Therefore, the synthetic gomesin can be considered equivalent to the native one. Synthetic gomesin showed also high activity against almost all Gram-negative bacteria tested with the exception of the insensitive strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the entomopathogenic bacteria S. marcescens. The most sensitive strains were E. coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella thyphimurium (MICs < 3.15 μm). The other strains were affected by gomesin at MICs between 3.15 and 6.25 μm.

Recent evidence has linked TOR signaling to Gln3p. Rapamycin causes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Gln3p, thereby activating nitrogen catabolite repressible-sensitive genes. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of this process is lacking. In this study, we show that Tor1p physically interacts with Gln3p. An intact TOR kinase domain is essential for the phosphorylation of Gln3p, inhibition of Gln3p nuclear entry and repression of Gln3p-dependent transcription. In contrast, at least two distinct protein phosphatases, Pph3p and the Tap42p-dependent phosphatases, are involved in the activation of Gln3p. The yeast pro-prion protein Ure2p binds to both hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated Gln3p. In contrast to the free Gln3p, the Ure2p-bound Gln3p is signifcantly resistant to dephosphorylation. Taken together, these results reveal a tripartite regulatory mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Gln3p is regulated.

Glutamine is a preferred nitrogen source, whereas glutamate is a poor nitrogen source. Cells respond to the preferred nitrogen sources by decreasing the expression of genes associated with transport and degradation of poor nitrogen sources. For example, glutamine prevents the expression of GLN1 andGAP1, structural genes for glutamine synthetase and the general amino acid permease. In contrast, their expression is derepressed with glutamate as the sole nitrogen source. This physiological control is designated nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Magasanik B. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 283-318Google Scholar). Gln3p is a GATA-type transcriptional factor responsible for the expression of a majority of NCR-sensitive genes. Gln3p activity is inhibited by Ure2p, a yeast pro-prion protein in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources (1Magasanik B. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 283-318Google Scholar, 2Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Other transcriptional factors are also involved in the complex regulation of NCR-sensitive genes, including the four GATA-type transcriptional factors Gln3p, Gat1p, Dal80p, and Gzf3p (3Coffman J.A. Rai R. Loprete D.M. Cunningham T. Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3416-3429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Zinc finger transcriptional factors Dal81p and Dal82p (4Coornaert D. Vissers S. André B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each NCR-sensitive gene appears to be regulated in a combinatorial manner by several transcription factors. Rapamycin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that has potent immunosuppressive effects. When complexed with its immunophilin receptor FKBP12, rapamycin causes growth inhibition of both mammalian cells and yeast. There are two highly related TOR proteins (targetsof rapamycin), Tor1p and Tor2p in budding yeast (5Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

They are members of the ATM (a taxia t elangiectasia mutated)-related kinase family and possess intrinsic protein Ser/Thr kinase activity (8Bertram P.G. Zeng C. Thorson J. Shaw A.S. Zheng X.F. Curr.

However, emerging evidence indicates that TOR signaling is rather complex and possibly involved in many other cellular processes. For example, several studies show that TOR signaling is clearly involved in regulation of genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis (14Mahajan P.B. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Zaragoza D. Ghavidel A. Heitman J. Schultz M.C. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). TOR signaling to NCR genes has been linked to the GATA-type transcription factor Gln3p and its inhibitor Ure2p (17Hardwick, J. S., Kurnvilla, F. G., Tong, J. K., Shamji, A. F., and Schreiber, S. L. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 14866–14870.Google Scholar, 18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what the role of TOR is with regard to the regulation of Gln3p. Although the Tap42p·Sit4p protein phosphatase complex has been suggested to mediate TOR signaling to Gln3p (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), there is also evidence indicating that it is not involved (19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that TOR binds to Gln3p via its HEAT domain. An intact TOR kinase domain is required for phosphorylation of Gln3p, the inhibition of Gln3p nuclear translocation, and repression of Gln3p-dependent genes. We also show that mutations in at least two phosphatases, Tap42p·Sit4p and Pph3p, can affect the activation of Gln3p. We further demonstrate that Ure2p is capable of binding to both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Gln3p but appears to protect Gln3p from dephosphorylation. Therefore, a tripartite regulatory mechanism is involved in governing the repression and activation of Gln3p. To create a Gal4p DNA-binding domain-Tor1p fusion plasmid, pYDF72 (11Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was modified inserting a NOT1 restriction site into the SacII site. The pAS2–2 was created by inserting a NOT1 linker into theEcoRI site of pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Inc.). The full-length TOR1 was excised with NOT1 andPstI and inserted into the same sites of pAS2–2 to create pASTOR1. To identify Tor1p-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with full-length Tor1p fused to the DNA-binding domain (BD) of Gal4p (BD-Tor1p). A plasmid library of fusions between the transcription activation domain (AD) of Gal4p and yeast genomic DNA fragments (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened for interaction with BD-Tor1p in a yeast reporter strain. The positive clones specifically interacted with BD-Tor1p but not with a BD alone, the BD-human lamin C, or p53 fusion proteins. Sequence analyses of the positive clones were carried out by automatic DNA sequencing. The DNA sequences were used to search for open reading frames in the Saccharomyces Genomic Data Base. A Myc9 epitope tag or protein A (ProA) tag was introduced at the C terminus of Gln3p and Ure2p, respectively, on the chromosomal copies of GLN3 and URE2 genes using a method developed by Schneider et al. (21Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Deletion ofGLN3 and URE2 were carried out by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (22Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). URE2(83–354aa) was excised from PJ6, a library clone containing the URE2insert with BamHI, and inserted into pGEX-4T1 to create pGEX-Ure2(aa93–243), respectively. pGEX-Gln3(510–720aa) was similarly created by excising the genomic inserts from PJ2, a two-hybrid library clone containing the corresponding GLN3 genomic DNA fragment. GST, GST-Ure2p, and GST-Gln3p were prepared according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immobilized GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were used directly for assaying their abilities to bind to Tor1p-Myc9. Exponential wild type and mutant yeast cultures were treated with 200 nm rapamycin, FK506, or a drug vehicle control (methanol). Aliquots of yeast cultures were withdrawn at different times. Total yeast RNAs were prepared using the phenol freezing extraction method (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total yeast RNA samples were separated on denaturing agarose gels, transferred onto nylon filters, hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes, and detected by phosphorimaging. The wild type and theTOR1(S1972I) dominant rapamycin-resistant isogenic strains were incubated with 200 nm rapamycin. Samples were withdrawn at different times, and total yeast RNA was isolated and used to prepare 33P-labeled cDNA probes by reverse transcription. The radioactively labeled probes were used to hybridize GeneFilters© (Research Genetics, Inc.) that contain a microarray of the entire yeast open reading frames. The results were analyzed by the QuantityOne software package (Bio-Rad). Log phase yeast cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads in disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by vortexing. 1-mg yeast extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 for Myc. For Western blotting analysis, 20-μg protein samples were used for gel electrophoresis and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with mAb 9E10. For the phosphatase treatment, the Gln3p-Myc9 immunocomplex was incubated with CIP buffer alone, 20 units of CIP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 20 units CIP plus phosphatase inhibitor 10 mm Na4P2O7 for 10 min at 30 °C. Yeast immunofluorescence studies were performed as described without dehydration (24Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 137Google Scholar). Myc-specific mAb 9E10 were used at 1:500 dilution. A rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) was used for visualization with a Zeiss microscope. Images were captured by a SPOT digital camera. To elucidate the mechanisms of TOR signaling, we initiated a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Tor1p-interacting proteins. Gln3p and Ure2p were isolated multiple times as independent clones. They interacted with Tor1p and Tor2p but not with a variety of control proteins (Fig. 1 a). We have also found that Tor2p interacted with Gln3p and Ure2p (Fig.1 a), suggesting that both Tor1p and Tor2p are involved in the Gln3p-dependent process. We further studied their interaction biochemically. Gln3p and Ure2p were produced as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and incubated with lysates from yeast expressing Tor1p-Myc9. We found that Tor1p-Myc9 bound to both GST-Gln3p and GST-Ure2p but not to GST alone (Fig. 1 b). By deletional analysis, we localized the Gln3p- and Ure2p-binding sites to an N-terminal fragment of Tor1p (Fig. 1 c) that contains multiple HEAT repeats previously predicted to mediate protein-protein interaction (25Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We further found that the Δgln3 mutation caused rapamycin resistance, whereas deletion of URE2, the inhibitor of GLN3rendered hypersensitivity to rapamycin (Fig. 1 d). These data suggest an inhibitory role of TOR in the regulation of Gln3p. Activation of Gln3p by rapamycin in rich medium (such as YPD) may cause starvation response and contribute to growth inhibition by rapamycin. To further examine whether TOR signaling is involved in regulating Gln3p, we performed Northern blotting analysis of two NCR-sensitive genes GAP1 (the general amino acidpermease) and GLN1 (glutamine synthetase) that are known to be Gln3p-dependent. In agreement with the previous studies (17Hardwick, J. S., Kurnvilla, F. G., Tong, J. K., Shamji, A. F., and Schreiber, S. L. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 14866–14870.Google Scholar, 18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we found that their expression was rapidly induced by rapamycin (Fig.2 a). Their expression was significantly reduced in the Δgln3 strain, but their expression became constitutive in the Δure2 genetic background. Thus, the effect of rapamycin is Gln3p-dependent (Fig. 2 b). However, we have consistently noted a slight residual induction of GAP1 andGLN1 by rapamycin in the absence of Gln3p (Fig.2 b). During our yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated five other NCR-sensitive transcription activators and repressors (Dal80p, Dal81p, Dal82p, Gat1p, and Gzf3p) that interacted with Tor1p (Table I). Gat1p appears to be responsible for the expression of GAP1 and GLN1in the absence of Gln3p (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We have also carried out a genome-wide expression profiling analysis of yeast cells treated with rapamycin. In agreement with TOR as a major regulator of transcription of NCR-sensitive genes, many such genes were indeed regulated by TOR (Table II and Ref. 17Hardwick, J. S., Kurnvilla, F. G., Tong, J. K., Shamji, A. F., and Schreiber, S. L. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because TOR is a protein kinase and interacts with Gln3p, we asked whether the kinase domain of TOR is required for the repression of the Gln3p-dependent genes. We performed Northern blotting analysis of GAP1 and GLN1 in cells carrying a plasmid expressing the recombinant wild type Tor1p or dominant rapamycin-resistant Tor1p(S1972I) in the wild type strain. Both cells also express the endogenous, wild type Tor1p and Tor2p. FKBP12-rapamycin only binds to the recombinant, wild type Tor1p as well as the endogenous wild type Tor1p and Tor2p but not the Tor1p mutants with the S1972I in the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain. The bulky isoleucine residue prevents the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to the hydrophobic pocket of the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain (11Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 27Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). We found that rapamycin failed to cause the expression ofGAP1 and GLN1 in cells producing recombinant Tor1p(S1972I) (Fig. 2 c). Thus, the ability of rapamycin to induce the expression of GAP1 and GLN1 is TOR-dependent. We similarly studied the importance of the kinase domain of Tor1p using yeast expressing the kinase-dead Tor1p(S1972I,D2294E). D2294E is a mutation in the kinase domain that disables Tor1p kinase (8Bertram P.G. Zeng C. Thorson J. Shaw A.S. Zheng X.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1259-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Unlike the cells expressing Tor1p(S1972I), rapamycin caused an induction of GAP1 andGLN1 in the Tor1p(S1972I,D2294E) cells, even though FKBP12-rapamycin is incapable of binding to both forms of Tor1p (Fig.2 c). Thus, an intact kinase domain or the kinase activity of Tor1p is required for repressing Gln3p-dependent genes. To examine how Gln3p is regulated by TOR signaling, we have generated Gln3p tagged with Myc9 epitopes on the C terminus of the chromosomal copy of GLN3. Both rapamycin and nitrogen starvation caused rapid cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of Gln3p-Myc9 (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). An analog drug FK506 or the drug carrier methanol did not have the same effect. Thus, Gln3p is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm in the nitrogen-rich conditions. When cells are starved or treated with rapamycin, Gln3p translocated into the nucleus to activate the expression of NCR-sensitive genes (Fig.3, a and b). In contrast, Tor1p (data not shown) remained in the cytoplasm in the presence of rapamycin, suggesting that the regulation of Gln3p primarily occurs in the cytoplasm. To analyze whether the rapamycin effect is dependent on TOR and its kinase activity, we expressed recombinant wild type Tor1p, rapamycin-resistant Tor1p(S1972I) or the kinase-inactive Tor1p(S1972I, D2294E) in the wild type yeast. We found that Gln3p remained in the cytoplasm in cells expressing the recombinant Tor1p(S1972I) but not Tor1p (data not shown) or Tor1p(S1972I, D2294E) (Fig. 3 c). Thus, sequestration of Gln3p in the cytoplasm is dependent on TOR and its intact kinase domain. Gln3p-Myc9 normally migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a 130-kDa polypeptide as detected with mAb 9E10 (Fig.4 a), which is consistent with a previous observation using an anti-Gln3p polyclonal antibody (28Blinder D.

In contrast, no detectable signal was seen for samples prepared from the wild type, untagged yeast (data not shown). Gln3p-Myc9rapidly became several faster migrating forms in the presence of rapamycin but not in the control (methanol) (Fig. 4 a and Ref. 18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Because such gel mobility shifts are often indicative of changes in protein phosphorylation status, we treated the Gln3p-Myc9 immunocomplex with CIP. The CIP-treated Gln3p-Myc9 became a faster mobility form, co-migrating with the fastest mobility form of the rapamycin-treated Gln3p-Myc9. In the presence of sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7), a potent phosphatase inhibitor, this gel mobility increase was completely blocked (Fig.4 b). Thus, rapamycin rapidly caused dephosphorylation of Gln3p, which results in an increase in its gel mobility. Expression of Tor1p(S1972I) but not Tor1p or Tor1p(S1972I, D2294E) prevented the gel mobility increase of Gln3p by rapamycin. Taken together, our results show that an intact TOR kinase is required for the in vivophosphorylation and inhibition of nuclear translocation of Gln3p, and the expression of Gln3p-dependent genes. To ask whether Tor1p can directly phosphorylate Gln3p, we incubated purified wild type and kinase-dead mutant Tor1p with bacterially expressed Gln3p in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. We found that Gln3p was specifically phosphorylated by the wild type Tor1p but not the kinase-dead Tor1p(D2294E) (Fig. 4 c). An overlay of the32P-phosphorylated Gln3p and the Ponceau Red-stained Gln3p indicated that there was a gel mobility retardation associated with the phosphorylated Gln3p (data not shown), suggesting that TOR is responsible for Gln3p phosphorylation in vivo. Further identification of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation site(s) on Gln3p will be important to confirm that TOR is the relevant Gln3p kinase. Activation of Gln3p requires dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase(s). There has been a controversy regarding the role of Tap42p·Sit4p. Beck and Hall (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) reported that Tap42p·Sit4p is crucial for the activation of Gln3p, whereas Cardenas et al.(19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) concluded that it is not required. We have also examined whether activation of Gln3p-dependent genes by rapamycin is affected by the tap42-11 mutation. Tap42p is the regulatory subunit of the type 2 protein phosphatase Sit4p (29Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).tap42-11 is a gain-of-function mutation that confers rapamycin resistance at permissive temperature in polysomal formation (29Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylation of Npr1p (30Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). At a low concentration of rapamycin (25 nm), the induction of GAP1 was attenuated in the tap42-11 mutant strain at the permissive temperature (Fig. 4 d). However, this attenuation by thetap42-11 mutation gradually diminished with increasing rapamycin concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the difference between the two previous observations could attribute to different rapamycin concentrations used in their respective experiments. Although Tap42p·Sit4p appears to be involved in the activation of Gln3p, it may only play a redundant role with other phosphatases. Indeed, we also found that the expression of GAP1 by rapamycin was similarly attenuated in cells lacking Pph3p, another general protein phosphatase (Fig. 4 e). It should be noted that we do not have evidence that Sit4p and Pph3p are directly responsible for the dephosphorylation of Gln3p. To examine the role of Ure2p in the regulation of Gln3p by TOR, we examined the interaction among TOR, Gln3p, and Ure2p. Although Gln3p still interacted with Tor1p without Ure2p, Ure2p failed to bind to Tor1p in the absence of Gln3p (Fig.5 a). Thus, the interaction between Ure2p and TOR is mediated by Gln3p. As previously reported (18Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), rapamycin reduced the amount of Gln3p bound to Ure2p (Fig.5 b). In contrast to that study, however, we found that the bacterially expressed GST-Ure2p bound to the hyper-phosphorylated Gln3p and the dephosphorylated Gln3p generated by CIP treatment in vitro (Fig. 5 c) or rapamycin treatment in vivo (data not shown). In fact, we have consistently observed that the dephosphorylated Gln3p has a higher affinity for Ure2p (Fig.5 c). Gln3p also remained bound to Ure2p in both whole cell extracts (Fig. 5 d) and purified Ure2p-immunocomplex treated with CIP (data not shown). Thus, it seems unlikely that phosphorylation regulates the interaction between Ure2p and Gln3p. Instead, the Ure2p-bound Gln3p is considerably more resistant to CIP treatment than Ure2p and the free Gln3p (Fig. 5 d). Therefore, the binding of Ure2p appears to protect Gln3p from dephosphorylation, which is also consistent with a previous observation that overexpression of Ure2p causes accumulation of slower gel mobility forms of Gln3p (28Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that TOR binds to Gln3p, which is mediated by the HEAT domain of TOR. We further show that an intact kinase domain is required for the phosphorylation of Gln3p as well as repression of Gln3p cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation and Gln3p-dependent transcription. At least two protein phosphatases, Tap42p·Sit4p and Pph3p are involved in the activation of GAP1, a gene regulated by Gln3p. Ure2p binds to both hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated Gln3p. However, it appears to protect Gln3p from dephosphorylation. Taken together, our results reveal a tripartite regulation of phosphorylation of Gln3p (a model shown in Fig. 6). Perturbation of the delicate balance among the three factors such as rapamycin treatment or deletion of URE2 results in a deregulated Gln3p. An important challenge in the near future is to determine how nutrient signals alter such a balance. In addition to Gln3p and Ure2p, five other NCR-sensitive transcription regulators (Gat1p, Gzf3p, Dal80p, Dal81p, and Dal82p) also interact with Tor1p and Tor2p (Table I). These proteins are known to serve as transcriptional activators as well as repressors. They regulate diverse NCR-sensitive genes in response to different nitrogen nutrients such as amino acids, allantoin, ammonia, and urea. Such interactions imply that TOR also regulates these NCR-sensitive transcription regulators. Similarly, a wide variety of NCR-sensitive genes are rapidly responsive to rapamycin as indicated by gene expression profiling studies (TableII and Refs. 17Hardwick, J. S., Kurnvilla, F. G., Tong, J. K., Shamji, A. F., and Schreiber, S. L. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 14866–14870.Google Scholar and 19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Therefore, combinatorial regulation of different NCR-sensitive transcription regulators by TOR is likely to be responsible for the well orchestrated expression of NCR-sensitive genes in response to specific nitrogenous compounds. The N terminus of TOR contains 20 HEAT repeats. HEAT repeats form elongated coiled coil structures as indicated by the crystal structures of Karyopherin α and the A subunit of type 2 protein phosphatase. Although the secondary structures of the HEAT repeats are highly conserved, their primary sequences bear a very low degree of similarity. The primary role of the HEAT repeats has been suggested to mediate protein-protein interaction. However, the protein partners appear to be different for individual HEAT repeat-containing proteins. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that the HEAT region of Tor1p is necessary and sufficient to bind to multiple proteins, including Gln3p and Gat1p (Table I). A recent study also shows that the same region of RAFT (mammalian TOR) also interacts with gephyrin, a cytoskeletal protein necessary for RAFT signaling to p70S6 kinase (31Sabatini D.M. Barrow R.K. Blackshaw S. Burnett P.E. Lai M.M. Field M.E. Bahr B.A. Kirsch J. Betz H. SH S. Science. 1999; 284: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These results show that the HEAT repeats of TOR are involved in protein-protein interactions as are other HEAT repeat-containing proteins. The second important domain of TOR in the regulation of Gln3p is the kinase domain. Although the kinase domain of TOR shares significant similarity with the catalytic domains of phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinases, it only appears to have protein serine/threonine kinase activity. A number of rapamycin-sensitive proteins including 4EBP-1/Phas-1 and p70S6 kinase have been shown to be phosphorylated by TOR in vitro as well. In this study, we found that an intact kinase domain of TOR is critical for the in vivophosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of Gln3p as well as the repression of Gln3p-dependent genes. It is also required for Tor1p to phosphorylate Gln3p in vitro. These results show that the kinase activity of TOR plays an essential role to regulate Gln3p and suggest that TOR is directly responsible for phosphorylating Gln3p in vivo. The rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites need to be identified to establish the relevance of Gln3p phosphorylation in its regulation and the role of TOR. In addition, TOR has been implicated in the regulation of Tap42p-dependent protein phosphatases as well (9Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 29Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, TOR may phosphorylate Gln3p as well as inhibit the dephosphorylation of Gln3p by negatively regulating the phosphatases involved. However, whether Tap42p·Sit4p and Pph3p are directly involved in Gln3p dephosphorylation remains to be determined. We found that Ure2p binds to both hyperphosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of Gln3p. The bacterially recombinant GST-Ure2p binds to both hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated Gln3p in vitro (Fig. 5 c). The hypo-phosphorylated Gln3p appears to have a slightly higher affinity to Ure2p. In addition, treatment of the purified Ure2p-Gln3p complex with phosphatase does not cause dissociation of Gln3p from Ure2p. Thus, the phosphorylation status of Gln3p does not appear to affect the binding of Ure2p. Instead, our results indicate that Ure2p protects Gln3p from dephosphorylation, which is also supported by a previous observation that overexpression of Ure2p leads to accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated Gln3p (28Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How does Ure2p become rapidly dissociated from Gln3p upon rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation? Mks1p was genetically identified as an inhibitor of Ure2p (32Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar, 33Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ure2p is also a phosphoprotein (Fig. 5and Refs. 17Hardwick, J. S., Kurnvilla, F. G., Tong, J. K., Shamji, A. F., and Schreiber, S. L. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 14866–14870.Google Scholar and 19Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). It becomes dephosphorylated in as a result of rapamycin treatment. Mks1p may preferentially bind to the dephosphorylated Ure2p, which prevents Ure2p from binding to Gln3p. In addition, the dephosphorylated Gln3p may be preferentially imported into the nucleus, thereby causing the equilibrium shifting toward fewer Ure2p·Gln3p complexes (a model is shown in Fig. 6). Phosphorylation is broadly involved in the regulated transport of many important regulatory proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus (34Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation within or adjacent to the nuclear localization signal sequence can dramatically affect recognition of cargo proteins by the nuclear importins. One such example is Pho4p, a phosphate-regulated transcription factor. Pho4p is phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm when yeast is grown in phosphate-rich medium, whereas in low phosphate medium, Pho4p is dephosphorylated and localized to the nucleus. Pho4p nuclear translocation required an importin called Pse1p. Phosphorylation decreases the affinity of Pho4p to Pse1p, thereby causing the cytoplasmic retention of Pho4p (35Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A similar scenario could also apply to Gln3p and other NCR-sensitive transcription activators and repressors (a model is shown in Fig. 6). Identification of the nuclear importin and exportin for Gln3p will be important to further define the mechanism by which the nucleocytoplasmic transport of Gln3p is regulated. We are grateful to D.

Although the turnover of connexins has been shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of either the lysosome or of the proteasome, how connexins are targeted for degradation and whether this process can be regulated to affect intercellular communication is unknown. We show here that reducing connexin degradation with inhibitors of the proteasome (but not with lysosomal blockers) is associated with a striking increase in gap junction assembly and intercellular dye transfer in cells inefficient in both processes under basal conditions. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on wild-type connexin stability, assembly, and function was mimicked by treatment of assembly-inefficient cells with inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide. Sensitivity of connexin degradation to cycloheximide, but not to proteasome inhibitors, was abolished when connexins were rendered structurally abnormal by perturbation of essential disulfide bonds or by mutation. Our findings provide the first evidence that intercellular communication can be up-regulated at the level of connexin turnover and that a short-lived protein may be required for conformationally mature connexins to become substrates of proteasomal degradation.

By serving as low resistance pathways for the diffusional transfer of low molecular weight substances such as ions, amino acids, and second messengers, gap junctions play important roles in embryonic development, growth control, and the function of differentiated tissues throughout the body (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, gap junctions are composed of members of a highly homologous family of tetraspanning integral membrane proteins known collectively as connexins. The first step in the assembly of gap junctions is the noncovalent oligomerization of six connexin monomers into an annular structure known as a connexon, or hemichannel (2Musil L.S. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms of Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 173-194Google Scholar). After transport to the cell surface, two connexons on apposing cell surfaces dock to form an intercellular channel. These channels then cluster at densities up to 10,000/μm2 into paracrystallin arrays referred to as gap junctional “plaques,” each of which can contain from ∼10 to more than 10,000 intercellular channels. To date, no nonconnexin protein has been demonstrated to be a component of gap junctional plaques or to be essential for gap junction assembly. One of the most unusual aspects of gap junction biosynthesis is the exceptional metabolic lability of connexins. As assessed from the degradation rate of total cell surface biotinylated proteins, the half-life of the great majority of plasma membrane proteins exceeds 24 h (3Hare J. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5902-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, pulse-chase analysis has demonstrated that connexin family members turn over with a half-life of only 1.5–5 h, even after incorporation into gap junctional plaques. This rapid rate of degradation has been observed in a wide variety of mammalian systems including primary and established tissue culture cells (4Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 5Traub O. Look J. Dermietzel R. Brummer F. Hulser D. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), whole organs (6Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and intact animals (7Fallon R.F. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The instability of connexins is especially remarkable given the relatively long half-lives of components of the tight junction (8Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and of desmosomes (9Penn E.J. Burdett I.D. Hobson C. Magee A.I. Rees D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and because intercellular communication can be rapidly down-regulated by gating of the gap junctional channel without the need for connexin degradation. To date, two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in connexin turnover in intact cells. The first is the lysosome, which electron microscopy localization studies have shown mediates the degradation of internalized gap junctional plaques in at least some cell types (10Larsen W.J. Tung H.N. Tissue Cell. 1978; 10: 585-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second is the proteasome, the multicatalytic protease complex that degrades most fast turnover proteins in the cytosol and nucleus and that also plays a role in the degradation of proteins in the secretory pathway. Laing and colleagues (6Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 11Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol.

Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as determined by pulse-chase analysis. We have recently obtained similar results for another member of the connexin family, connexin32 (Cx32) (13VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Experiments in which brefeldin A was used to block intracellular transport suggested that proteasome inhibitor-sensitive degradation of connexins occurs at the level of the ER (13VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) as well as after transport to the cell surface (12Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both sites have previously been implicated in proteasome-mediated degradation of other integral plasma membrane proteins (14Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In none of the aforementioned studies were the consequences of proteasome inhibition on gap junction function assessed. Although highly unusual for an integral plasma membrane protein, rapid turnover kinetics are a common characteristic of mature, fully folded forms of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins involved in signal transduction. Before such proteins can be degraded by the proteasome, they must undergo a multistep targeting process. First, the substrate is usually distinguished from other wild-type molecules by posttranslational “tagging” events such as a change in phosphorylation and/or protein-protein interaction that facilitate the addition of polyubiquitin chains and mark it for destruction (15Ciechanover A. Laszlo A. Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Orian A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The substrate must then be completely unfolded to gain entry into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S proteasome core, a process that for at least some proteins appears to require extraproteasomal components such as cytosolic molecular chaperones (16Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Decreasing the efficiency with which cytosolic and nuclear proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation is a physiologically important mechanism by which their signaling function is prolonged or enhanced (17Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For example, regulated proteasomal degradation of the cytosolic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase requires association with a protein known as antizyme. Preventing antizyme synthesis with cycloheximide stabilizes ornithine decarboxylase and preserves its enzymatic function (18Glass J.R. Gerner E.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Murakami Y. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Omura S. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not yet clear, protein synthesis inhibitors also slow the turnover and thereby prolong the activity of certain other (but not all) cytoplasmic proteasome substrates, including pp60v-src(20Ziemiecki A. Friis R.R. Bauer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 355-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), estradiol-liganded estrogen receptors (21Borras M. Laios I. el Khissiin A. Seo H.S. Lempereur F. Legros N. Leclercq G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and some forms of p53 (22Reich N.C. Oren M. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to determine whether the signaling function of integral membrane connexins (intercellular communication) could be increased by slowing the rate of connexin turnover. We show here that reducing connexin degradation with inhibitors of the proteasome or of protein synthesis (but not with inhibitors of the lysosome) is associated with a striking increase in gap junctional plaque assembly and intercellular dye transfer in cells that are inefficient in both processes under basal conditions. Our findings support a model in which protein synthesis inhibitors interfere with events required for targeting of folded forms of connexins for proteasomal degradation, possibly by lowering the levels of a fast-turnover protein required for this process. Regulation of the rate of connexin degradation is a novel means of posttranslationally increasing intercellular communication that is distinct from gating of the gap junctional channel. Mouse sarcoma cells stably transfected with the adhesion molecule L-CAM (S180L cells) (23Mege R.M. Matsuzaki F. Gallin W.J. Goldberg J.I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12 medium with the same additions and were refed with fresh medium 6–8 h prior to use. Three-day-old, newly confluent cultures were used for all experiments unless otherwise specified.

Clonal lines of PC12J cells (a subclone of rat pheochromocytoma cells devoid of endogenous gap junction activity) stably expressing either wild-type human Cx32 or a CMTX-linked Cx32 mutant were generated and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FCS, penicillin G, streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 as described by Deschenes et al.

Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma except for carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine-vinylsulfone (ZL3VS), a gift of M. Bogyo (Harvard Medical School). Final concentrations of reagents in experiments were as follows: 100 μm N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN), 10 μm lactacystin, 20 μm ZL3VS, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm chloroquine, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. At this concentration, cycloheximide reduced the synthesis of total cellular proteins (including connexins) by >96% within 10 min (not shown). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed for 30 min with PBS, and then postfixed for 5 min with −20 °C acetone. After a second 30-min rinse with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 0.5% normal goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were sequentially incubated with anti-Cx43 antibodies and then with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) as described by Le and Musil (26Le A.C. Musil L.S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with MOWIOL 4–88 mounting medium (Calbiochem) and immunofluorescence images captured using a Leica DM LD photomicrography system and Scion Image 1.60 software. Cells grown on 5-mm-diameter glass coverslips were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (HB). The HB was removed and 2.5 μl of PBS containing 1% Lucifer Yellow (LY) (Sigma) and 0.75% of the gap junction-impermeant compound rhodamine dextran (fluoro-ruby; molecular mass, 10 kDa) (Molecular Probes) was applied to the center of the glass coverslip. A 27 gauge needle was then used to create two longitudinal scratches through the cell monolayer. Cells were incubated in the dye mix for exactly 1 min and then quickly rinsed three times with HB prior to a 5-min incubation in HB at room temperature to allow dye transfer. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and immediately fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS, pH 7.5. LY and rhodamine dextran were subsequently examined by fluorescence microscopy (Leitz DMR) using fluorescein and rhodamine filter sets, respectively. Only images taken with fluorescein optics are shown; in all cases, rhodamine dextran remained confined to a single row of cells immediately bordering the wound. In some experiments, 1% biocytin (Molecular Probes) was substituted for LY and visualized with avidin-FITC (Molecular Probes) as described by Le and Musil (26Le A.C. Musil L.S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The scrape loading/dye transfer assay has the advantage over microinjection techniques of allowing simultaneous monitoring of dye coupling in a large population of cells; its utility in the assessment of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication has been well documented (27el-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 28Venance L. Piomelli D. Glowinski J. Giaume C. Nature. 1995; 376: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for methionine for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM lacking methionine and supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS and 2 mmglutamine (“labeling” medium). The medium was then replaced with fresh labeling medium containing [35S]methionine (Expre35S35S, NEN Life Science Products; 0.1 mCi/35-mm dish of cells, scaled proportionally for dishes of other sizes). The radioactive medium was removed after a 30-min pulse, and if desired, the cells were then rinsed three times with complete DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm unlabeled methionine and chased in DMEM/0.5 mm unlabeled methionine/10% FCS at 37 °C. At the end of the chase period, cells were rinsed once with PBS at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris base, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.6% SDS, 250 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 200 μm leupeptin. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with the desired antibody as described by Le and Musil (26Le A.C. Musil L.S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two modifications were made for immunoprecipitation of Cx32: first, cells were lysed in SDS at room temperature for 30 min instead of at 100 °C for 3 min to minimize aggregation of Cx32; and second, samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C prior to addition of anti-Cx32 antibody (29VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. Methods. 2000; 20: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cx43 and Cx32 immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10 or 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, respectively, after incubation of samples in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer for either 3 min at 100 °C (Cx43) or 30 min at room temperature (Cx32). The dried gels were quantitated on a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) utilizing IPLab Gel software (Signal Analytics Corp.). S180L cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in DMEM/10% FCS until ∼80% confluent. After two rinses with PBS lacking Ca+2 and Mg+2 (PBS–), the cultures were incubated in PBS–, 5 mm EDTA, and 2% FCS for 10 min at room temperature on a orbital shaker. The cells were then removed from the plate and triturated 10 times with a 10-ml pipette to generate a single-cell suspension. The cells were pelleted at 150 ×g for 7 min and resuspended in labeling medium (see above). After verification of cell viability (>95% Trypan blue-excluding) and the absence of cell clumps, 5 × 105 cells in 500 μl of labeling medium were added to each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate. Label (60 μCi of Expre35S35S/well) was then immediately added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, during which time the cells quantitatively adhered to the dish. The cultures were then rinsed three times with complete DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm unlabeled methionine and chased for the desired period prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of Cx43 as described above. A striking feature of gap junction biosynthesis bothin vivo and in tissue culture is that cells differ greatly in their inherent ability to assemble connexins into gap junctional plaques. The four cell lines shown in Fig.1 synthesize comparable quantities of endogenously expressed, wild-type Cx43, the coding sequence of which is very highly conserved among mammals and not subject to alternative mRNA splicing. We have previously shown that each cell type assembles this Cx43 into connexons and transports them to the cell surface (30Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 31Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, under basal conditions, only NRK and S180L cells are able to efficiently assemble Cx43 into large gap junctional plaques, which appear as punctate or linear concentrations of anti-connexin immunoreactivity at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 1,A and C). CHO cells have substantially fewer and generally smaller gap junctions (Fig. 1 E; see also Figs.5 A and 7 A), even if the level of Cx43 expression is increased by refeeding the cells in fresh culture medium for 6–8 h (data not shown). At the resolution of immunofluorescence microscopy, L929 fibroblasts lack detectable gap junctions (Fig. 1 G). The number of immunodetectable gap junctions in NRK, S180L, CHO, and L929 cells correlates closely with their capacity to mediate intercellular communication as assessed by a scrape loading/dye transfer assay. As previously reported (4Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), NRK and S180L cells are highly communication-competent and transfer LY to several orders of cells distal to the wound edge (Fig. 1, B and D). Intercellular movement of LY is still detectable but much more restricted in CHO cells (Fig. 1 F), whereas the dye remains confined to wounded cells in monolayers of L929 fibroblasts (Fig.1 H). Based on their capacity to assemble functional gap junctions under basal conditions, we herein refer to cells as either “assembly-efficient” (e.g. NRK and S180L cells), “assembly-inefficient” (e.g. CHO cells), or “assembly-incompetent” (e.g. L929 cells).Figure 5Proteasome inhibition up-regulates gap junctions in assembly-inefficient cells. CHO cells and ssS180L cells were incubated for 7 h in new medium without additions (A, D, G, and J), with 100 μm ALLN (B, E, H, and K), or with 200 μmchloroquine (C, F, I, and L). The cells were then either fixed and immunostained with anti-Cx43 antibodies (A–C and G–I) or assessed for their ability to mediate intercellular transfer of the gap junction permeant LY (D–F and J–L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Cycloheximide up-regulates gap junction formation and function in assembly-inefficient, but not assembly-efficient, cells.

Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 11Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These kinetics are in keeping with results obtained in other systems with high levels of preexisting intercellular contact (5Traub O. Look J. Dermietzel R. Brummer F. Hulser D. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Circ.

Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). One possibility not addressed by such experiments is that the first gap junctional plaques assembled at newly established cell-cell contacts might be metabolically stable and that there are a limited number of such stable gap junctions that can be accommodated at cell interfaces. If so, then any [35S]methionine-labeled Cx43 synthesized in confluent cultures of gap junction-rich cells after saturation is reached would be turned over at a rate indistinguishable from that of connexins in less assembly-competent cells. Differential cell surface stability has been described for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which has a t12 of 8–10 days when localized to the neuromuscular junction but only 1 day at extrajunctional sites (33Steinbach J.H. Merlie J. Heinemann S. Bloch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3547-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,34Chang C.C. Huang M.C. Nature. 1975; 253: 643-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test whether the extent of preexisting intercellular contact influences Cx43 assembly and/or turnover, pulse-chase studies were conducted in both established and newly forming monolayers of S180L cells. In 2-day-old, confluent cultures, pulse-labeled [35S]methionine-Cx43 underwent the posttranslational changes in electrophoretic mobility characteristic of Cx43 in assembly-efficient cells (4Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Following synthesis as a 42-kDa species referred to as Cx43-NP, [35S]methionine-Cx43 was progressively converted to two slower migrating species, Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2, by phosphorylation on serine residues. Numerous studies in a wide variety of systems, including S180L cells, have established that conversion to the P1 and P2 forms occurs only after transport to the cell surface and that Cx43-P2 is concentrated in gap junctional plaques (30Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 32Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 35Nagy J.I. Li W.E. Roy C. Doble B.W. Gilchrist J.S. Kardami E. Hertzberg E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All forms of [35S]methionine-Cx43 were largely turned over by 8 h of chase (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). To examine Cx43 processing during de novo formation of cell-cell contacts, S180L cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension under protease-free conditions and then replated at confluent density to rapidly reform a monolayer. [35S]Methionine-Cx43 synthesized during the initial 30-min replating period was converted to the plaque-associated P2 form at a rate that closely correlated with the appearance of gap junctions as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). The labeled Cx43 was degraded over an 8-h period with kinetics nearly identical to those of Cx43 in two-day-old monolayers (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained when cells were pulsed 3 h after replating (not shown). The lack of a detectable pool of metabolically stable Cx43 indicates that the turnover rate of connexins is unaffected by the presence or absence of preexisting gap junctional plaques. As a first step toward determining whether a reduction in the rate of connexin degradation influences gap junction assembly and/or function, we assayed inhibitors of either the proteasome or the lysosome for their ability to decrease Cx43 turnover in NRK, S180L, CHO, and L929 cells (Fig. 3). As expected, only 9–25% of the Cx43 synthesized during a 30-min pulse was recovered after a 7-h chase in the absence of inhibitors in all four cell types. Although there was some variability between experiments in the magnitude of the effect, the proteasome inhibitor ALLN reproducibly (in 15 of 15 experiments) increased the amount of labeled Cx43 that survived the chase period between 2- and 7-fold in all cell types examined relative to untreated controls within the same trial.

We expressed the rat P2X2receptor in human embryonic kidney cells, and used alanine-scanning mutagenesis on 30 residues with polar side chains conserved among the seven rat P2X receptor subunits. This identified a region proximal to the first transmembrane domain which contained 2 lysine residues that were critical for the action of ATP (Lys69 and Lys71). We substituted cysteines in this region (Asp57 to Asp71) and found that for S65C and I67C ATP-evoked currents were inhibited by methanethiosulfonates. At I67C, the inhibition by negatively charged ethylsulfonate and pentylsulfonate derivatives could be overcome by increasing the ATP concentration, consistent with a reduced affinity of ATP binding. The inhibitory action of the methanethiosulfonates was prevented by pre-exposure to ATP, suggesting occlusion of the binding site. Finally, introduction of negative charges into the receptor by mutagenesis at this position (I67E and I67D) also gave receptors in which the ATP concentration-response curve was right-shifted. The results suggest that residues close to Ile67 contribute to the ATP-binding site.

Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). They are homomeric or heteromeric proteins, formed by assembly of subunits named P2X1-P2X7. Current evidence suggests that three subunits form a channel (or a multiple of three) (2Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 3Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The ligand for the P2X receptors is ATP, acting from the extracellular milieu. In this way ATP released from cells functions as a synaptic transmitter, an autocrine or paracrine signal, in a wide range of mammalian tissues (4Zimmermann H. Braun N. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 371-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other membrane proteins which bind ATP from the extracellular aspect include G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors, and degradative enzymes such as ectoATPase (4Zimmermann H. Braun N. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 371-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The individual subunits of the P2X receptor seem unrelated in amino acid sequence to other ion channels, and indeed to other proteins. The proteins range in length from 379 to 595 amino acids. The P2X2 receptor is normally glycosylated (Asn183, Asn239, and Asn298), and experiments with the introduction of additional glycosylation sites by mutagenesis indicate that most of the protein is extracellular (the ectodomain: residues 50–330) (5Newbolt A.

Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The N terminus and C terminus lie within the cell, and the residues 30–50 and 330–352 form membrane-spanning domains. Three kinds of approaches have been made to determine which parts of the molecule contribute to which of the functional properties of the channel, but none of these have addressed the ATP-binding site. First, the substituted cysteine accessibility method has been used to show that residues in and around the second membrane-spanning domain contribute to the formation of permeation pathway for cations (7Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in particular, Thr336 appears to lie in the outer vestibule of the pore and Asn349 is internal to the gate of the pore (7Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Second, desensitization is profound in the case of homomeric P2X1 and P2X3 receptors, but minimal for the PX2 receptor. Experiments with chimeric receptors made from these three types have shown that the transmembrane domains and certain residues in the adjoining cytoplasmic sequences determine this property (9Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Boue-Grabot E. Archambault V. Seguela P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Third, the effective concentrations of the antagonists suramin and pyridoxal 5-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid are very different for P2X2 and P2X4 receptors, and indeed between human and rat P2X4 receptors. Chimeric constructs and point mutagenesis have been used to indicate some regions in the ectodomain contribute to these differences (11Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Lund P.E. Stuhmer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).The aim of the present experiments was to identify residues that might contribute to the ATP-binding site. A great deal is known about ATP-binding sites in a range of intracellular proteins, with atomic resolution for several such as kinases, actin, and heat shock proteins (13Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the lack of any detectable sequence relatedness with these proteins provide few clues with respect to the P2X receptors. Only in the case of the tRNA synthases has it been suggested that homology exists with P2X receptors, but this is very weak (14Freist W. Verhey J.F. Stuhmer W. Gauss D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ATP binding generally involves hydrogen bond formation with charged or polar side chains, and our initial strategy was to test their involvement by alanine substitution of such residues. These results focussed our attention on 2 lysine residues situated about 20 amino acids from the extracellular end of the first transmembrane domain (Lys69 and Lys71). We sought more direct evidence that this part of the protein contributed to ATP binding by introducing cysteines in this region to which methanethiosulfonates of differing sizes and charges could be attached. Finally, we asked whether pre-exposure to ATP could inhibit the attachment of the methanethiosulfonates.Note added in ProofSimilar results with respect to the mutation of the Arg and Lys residues have recently been reported for the P2X1 receptor (Ennion, S., Hagan, S., and Evans, R.

Third, the effective concentrations of the antagonists suramin and pyridoxal 5-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid are very different for P2X2 and P2X4 receptors, and indeed between human and rat P2X4 receptors. Chimeric constructs and point mutagenesis have been used to indicate some regions in the ectodomain contribute to these differences (11Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Lund P.E. Stuhmer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The aim of the present experiments was to identify residues that might contribute to the ATP-binding site. A great deal is known about ATP-binding sites in a range of intracellular proteins, with atomic resolution for several such as kinases, actin, and heat shock proteins (13Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the lack of any detectable sequence relatedness with these proteins provide few clues with respect to the P2X receptors. Only in the case of the tRNA synthases has it been suggested that homology exists with P2X receptors, but this is very weak (14Freist W. Verhey J.F. Stuhmer W. Gauss D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ATP binding generally involves hydrogen bond formation with charged or polar side chains, and our initial strategy was to test their involvement by alanine substitution of such residues. These results focussed our attention on 2 lysine residues situated about 20 amino acids from the extracellular end of the first transmembrane domain (Lys69 and Lys71). We sought more direct evidence that this part of the protein contributed to ATP binding by introducing cysteines in this region to which methanethiosulfonates of differing sizes and charges could be attached. Finally, we asked whether pre-exposure to ATP could inhibit the attachment of the methanethiosulfonates.

https://openalex.org/W2117494325,"Nramp2, also known as DMT1 and DCT1, is a 12-transmembrane (TM) domain protein responsible for dietary iron uptake in the duodenum and iron acquisition from transferrin in peripheral tissues. Nramp2/DMT1 produces by alternative splicing two isoforms differing at their C terminus (isoforms I and II). The subcellular localization, mechanism of action, and destination of divalent cations transported by the two Nramp2 isoforms are not completely understood. Stable CHO transfectants expressing Nramp2 isoform II modified by addition of a hemaglutinin epitope in the loop defined by the TM7–TM8 interval were generated. Immunofluorescence with permeabilized and intact cells established that Nramp2 isoform II is expressed at the plasma membrane and demonstrated the predicted extracytoplasmic location of the TM7–TM8 loop. Using the fluorescent, metal-sensitive dye calcein, and a combination of membrane-permeant and -impermeant iron chelators, Nramp2 transport was measured and quantitated with respect to kinetic parameters and at steady state. Iron transport at the plasma membrane was time- and pH-dependent, saturable, and proportional to the amount of Nramp2 expression. Iron uptake by Nramp2 at the plasma membrane was into the nonferritin-bound, calcein-accessible so-called “labile iron pool.” Ion selectivity experiments show that Nramp2 isoform II can also transport Co2+ and Cd2+ but not Mg2+ into the calcein-accessible pool. Parallel experiments with transfectants expressing the lysosomal Nramp1 homolog do not show any divalent cation transport activity, establishing major functional differences between Nramp1 and Nramp2. Monitoring the effect of Nramp2 on the calcein-sensisitve labile iron pool allows a simple, rapid, and nonisotopic approach to the functional study of this protein.

Computer-assisted sequence analysis of Nramp2 protein predicts a polytopic membrane protein composed of 12 transmembrane (TM)1 segments, a glycosylated extracytoplasmic loop, a consensus transport signature (found in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic transport proteins), and precisely conserved charged amino acids in TM domains (4Cellier M.

However, the membrane topology of Nramp2 has yet to be experimentally verified. TheNramp2 gene produces by alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal exon two distinct mRNAs that are distinguished by different C-terminal amino acid sequences and by the presence (isoform I) or absence (isoform II) of an iron response element (IRE) located in the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA (12Lee P.L. Gelbart T. West C. Halloran C. Beutler E. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nramp2 isoform I protein (13Moffett P. Dayo M. Reece M. McCormick M.K. Pelletier J. Genomics. 1996; 35: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is expressed at the duodenum brush border where its expression is regulated by dietary iron (14Canonne-Hergaux F. Gruenheid S. Ponka P. Gros P. Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations (G185R) atNramp2 in mice (mk) and rats (b) cause a severe form of iron deficiency and microcytic anemia, associated with impaired iron absorption at the intestinal mucosa (15Fleming M.D. Trenor 3rd, C.C.

Hematol. 1992; 39: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); together, these results have indicated that Nramp2 isoform I is responsible for iron transport from the duodenum lumen into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. However, plasma membrane staining for Nramp2 has been difficult to ascertain (20Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp.

Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular localization studies of endogenous protein in Hep-2 cells, as well as studies using stably transfected CHO and RAW cells, show that Nramp2 is also expressed in a subcellular vesicular compartment identified as early (20Gruenheid S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22220-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or both. These findings have suggested that Nramp2, and more specifically its isoform II, may also be implicated in iron acquisition in peripheral tissues as well, transporting transferrin-bound iron across the membrane of acidified endosomes into the cytoplasm (20Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 21Su M.A. Trenor C.C. Fleming J.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possible role for Nramp2 isoform II in iron transport at the plasma membrane or in acidified endosomes has yet to be explored.The mechanistic basis of transport has been analyzed inXenopus oocytes where Nramp2 (DCT1) isoform I transports a number of divalent cations such as Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, and Cu2+. This transport is pH-dependent, electrogenic, and associated with the symport of a single proton (1Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Nramp2-mediated iron transport was also demonstrated at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells (23Tandy S. Williams M. Leggett A. Lopez-Jimenez M. Dedes M. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Sharp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, transient overexpression of the wild type but not G185R Nramp2 in HEK293T cells results in a robust stimulation of cellular55Fe2+ uptake (21Su M.A. Trenor C.C. Fleming J.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular compartment to which iron is delivered by Nramp2 has not yet been established. Indeed, transport studies using 55Fe as a ligand monitor total cellular accumulation and do not distinguish between free iron, ferritin-bound iron, and iron sequestered in subcellular organelles. Although electrophysiological measurements in Xenopusoocytes are extremely useful to elucidate the bioenergetics and mechanism of transport, such experiments do not recreate the normal environment and subcellular compartments of mammalian cells.To gain further insight into the structure and function of Nramp2 (isoform II), including the site of transport and destination of the transported substrate, CHO cell clones that stably express an epitope tagged copy of Nramp2 (isoform II) were created. Nramp2 (isoform II) was expressed at the plasma membrane and the epitope tag inserted between TM7 and TM8 was found to be accessible from the medium, indicating that the corresponding loop is indeed extracellular. Transport studies using the metal-sensitive and fluorescent dye calcein demonstrate that Nramp2 (isoform II) can indeed function as a pH-dependent divalent cation transporter at the plasma membrane acting on Fe2+, Co2+, and Cd2+. Our results also show that the incoming iron transported by Nramp2 (isoform II) is delivered to the cytoplasm of CHO cells, within the so-called “labile iron pool” (LIP) (24Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONOne of the distinguishing features of the Nramp protein family is the presence of a 20–46-amino acid residues hydrophilic loop delineated by TM7 and TM8. The sequence of this loop is not conserved throughout evolution; for example mammalian Nramp1 and Nramp2 show 19 of 42 identical residues with nine conservative substitutions in this segment. However, this segment often contains N-linked glycosylation signals (NXS or NXT), suggesting that this loop would be glycosylated and extracytoplasmic (35van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This, together with the presence of a transport signature in the adjacent TM9–TM10 interval, which is conserved at the cytoplasmic face of several bacterial periplasmic permeases, was initially used to anchor the predicted topological arrangement of the 12 TM domains of the Nramp protein (4Cellier M. Prive G. Belouchi A. Kwan T. Rodrigues V. Chia W. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In this study, the insertion of an epitope tag in the TM8–TM9 loop did not affect protein stability, membrane targeting, or transport properties. In addition, immunofluorescence studies in nonpermeabilized Nramp2 CHO transfectants with an anti-tag antibody confirmed that this loop was indeed extracellular in Nramp2. These results provide a first validation of the initial topological model of the protein based on hydropathy profiling and suggest that this approach could be used for topology mapping of individual TM domains of Nramp2.The mechanism of transport of Nramp2 has so far been studied after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes (1Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar), in nontransfected or in stably or transiently transfected cultured cells (21Su M.A. Trenor C.C. Fleming J.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tandy S. Williams M. Leggett A. Lopez-Jimenez M. Dedes M. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Sharp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and by the use of radioisotopes. Although those are sound technological approaches there are certain limitations. Studies in Xenopusoocytes require unique expertise and instrumentation and may not fully recreate the transport environment of mammalian cells.55Fe2+ and 56Fe2+ are high energy emitters that require containment that limit their use. In addition, isotopic iron has a tendency to bind nonspecifically to various cellular components and proteins in live and dead cells, producing a relative high background in whole cells assays. Also, the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ (substrate) to Fe3+(nonsubstrate) at various degrees in aqueous solutions complicates analysis of transport assays. Finally, neither method provides information on the destination of the transported iron, because they cannot distinguish between intracellular iron complexed to ferritin, and the cytoplasmic pool of free Fe2+ (LIP). Another limitation of these methods is that the subcellular localization of the protein to a functionally relevant site is difficult to establish with certainty. Calcein binds to a number of divalent cations, Ca2+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, and Co2+, and some of these (notably Fe2+ and Co2+) are potent quenchers of calcein fluorescence. In addition, only binding of Fe2+ but not Fe3+ to calcein results in fluorescence quenching (32Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), alleviating the problems associated with change in valence of the iron atom during transport experiments. Calcein has been previously used to monitor in nontransfected cells the size of the ferritin-free, so-called labile iron pool (24Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15341-15382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that it could also be used to monitor the activity of Nramp2 in intact cells, and may also provide information on the status of iron transported by Nramp2. By using a combination of membrane-impermeant (HES-DFO) and membrane-permeant (SIH) Fe2+ chelators in calcein-loaded cells, we were able to accurately measure in a kinetic fashion the effect of Nramp2 expression on the size of the intracellular iron pool in transfected CHO cells. We observed robust influx of iron in Nramp2 transfectants that was related to the amount of Nramp2 protein expressed in these clones; over a 3-min loading period, Nramp2-expressing cells showed a 5-fold increase in the initial rate of fluorescence quenching and 3–4-fold increase in total SIH-sensitive fluorescence over control CHO cells (ΔF). In this assay, Nramp2 transport of Fe2+ is pH-dependent (optimum at pH 5.5–6.0) and is saturated at approximately 1 μm, a value in good agreement with that measured in Xenopus oocytes for Nramp2/DCT1-mediated (K 0.5 = 2 μm) and SMF1-mediated (K m = 2.2 μm) iron transport (1Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar, 9Chen X.Z. Peng J.B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, Nramp2 expressed at the plasma membrane is shown to transport Co2+ and Cd2+ but not Mg2+. The fate of iron transported at the plasma membrane by an iron transporter such as Nramp2 has been debated (reviewed in Ref. 37Ponka P. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: S2-S11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It could become quickly complexed to ferritin, sequestered away in subcellular membrane compartments or organelles such as mitochondria or could be part of a free cytoplasmic pool previously identified as the LIP (24Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Results from this study show that iron transport into CHO cells by Nramp2 is into the calcein-accessible cytoplasmic LIP. In addition, kinetic and saturation measurements show that most of the iron transported by Nramp2 during the monitoring period is into that pool.The Nramp2 gene produces by alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal exon two distinct proteins and mRNAs that are distinguished by different C-terminal amino acid sequences and the presence (isoform I) or absence (isoform II) of an IRE located in the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA (12Lee P.L. Gelbart T. West C. Halloran C. Beutler E. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The isoform I protein (14Canonne-Hergaux F. Gruenheid S. Ponka P. Gros P. Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is expressed at the duodenum brush border where it is regulated by dietary iron and ultimately responsible for iron transport from the duodenum lumen into the cytoplasm of eptihelial cells. It is the isoform I of Nramp2 that has been used in transport assays inXenopus oocytes to demonstrate the iron transport by Nramp2 (1Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization studies in intact cells (Hep-2), in transfected CHO cells, and in RAW mouse macrophages show that Nramp2 is also expressed in a subcellular vesicular compartment identified as early (20Gruenheid S.

In several cell lines tested (murine erythroleukemia MEL cells and Sertoli TM4 cells), it appears that the majority of the protein expressed at that site is the isoform II of Nramp2. 2S. Gruenheid and F. Canonne-Hergaux, unpublished results.Co-localization studies with transferrin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (20Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo studies in mk andb mutant animals support a role for Nramp2 in the transport of transferrin iron from acidified endosomes into the cytoplasm of peripheral tissues (38Orgad S. Nelson H. Segal D. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Farcich E.A. Morgan E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: R220-R224PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we have been able to establish by immunofluorescence that the IRE negative isoform II of the protein (used in our expression construct) can be expressed at the plasma membrane. The strict pH dependence of transport together with the rapid fluorescence quenching kinetics observed in Nramp2transfectants indicates that Nramp2 isoform II can indeed function as a pH-dependent divalent cation transporter at the plasma membrane of these cells. The fact that both isoforms I and II can be targeted to the PM membranes in primary cells and in transfected cells would suggest that the membrane targeting information required for this process is not located in the extreme C terminus of the protein, which shows no sequence homology between isoforms I and II. Thus, it is interesting to speculate that NPXY and YSCF motifs identified by scrutiny of the N-terminal sequence of Nramp2 may be implicated in this process, because they have been identified as sorting motifs for other membrane proteins such as transferrin receptor, Lamp-1, CD3, and H,K-ATPase (40Bonifacio J.S. Dell Angelica E., C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 41Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar).The fluorescence quenching method developed here to monitor Nramp2 transport offers several advantages over current methods. First, its does not rely on the use of radioisotopic derivatives of Nramp2 substrates, some of which are not commercially available. Second, it is carried out in intact mammalian cells and is not destructive, and cells analyzed in this fashion can be further put through other tests. Third, the use of two chelators allows one to easily distinguish nonspecific binding from transport and intracellular accumulation of iron. Fourth, quantitative and rapid kinetic data can be obtained for transport of three divalent cations by this assay. Finally, and most importantly, we show that divalent cations transport by Nramp2, including Fe2+ is into a free cytoplasmic pool that is accessible to calcein. This assay can now be used to identify structure/function relationships in Nramp2 variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis, including identification of residues underlying pH dependence and substrate specificity of the transporter. In addition, insertion of the HA tag in the predicted TM7–TM8 loop does not seem to affect transport activity, compared with Nramp2 marked with a c-Myc tag at the C terminus. Thus, membrane topology of Nramp2 could be determined by immunofluorescence in CHO cells expressing recombinant proteins engineered with epitope tags at different positions and tested for biological activity in this assay (28Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).As opposed to their Nramp2 counterparts, CHO cells transfected with and expressing high levels of the macrophage-specific Nramp1 protein (4Cellier M.

A. 1995; 92: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) do not demonstrate increased divalent cations import in the calcein quenching assay. The high degree of sequence homology between mammalian Nramp1 and Nramp2 (78% sequence similarity), and the report that a loss-of-function mutation at the mvl locus can be corrected by Nramp1 in transgenic flies (11D'Souza J. Cheah P.Y. Gros P. Chia W. Rodrigues V. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 1909-1915PubMed Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that of increased dietary metals (38Orgad S. Nelson H. Segal D. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together strongly suggest that Nramp1 can transport divalent cations as well. The lack of divalent cation transport reported here for Nramp1 CHO cells (Figs. 2 E and3 B) is likely to be the result of the absence of Nramp1 expression at the plasma membrane concomitant to strict expression in the lysosomal compartment of these cells (25Gruenheid S.

The results obtained here with Nramp1 and Nramp2 CHO transfectants clearly suggest that the protein signals underlying targeting of the two proteins to distinct subcellular compartments can be identified in chimeric proteins expressed in CHO cells and analyzed by this assay.AcknowledgmentWe are grateful to Martine Brault for technical support during this work.

Although Smad proteins are identified as key signal transducers in TGF-β1-dependent growth inhibition, their roles in the induction of apoptosis are unclear. We show here that both Smad proteins and AP-1 complex are involved in TGF-β1 signaling for apoptosis. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Smad3 mutant or Smad7, both of which impair Smad-mediated signal transduction, inhibits TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Only the JunD·FosB form of the AP-1 complex is markedly activated during TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.

Expression of JunD·FosB enhances induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1.

Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β1, the founding member of the superfamily, is well known as a negative regulator of cell growth. A variety of cell types express the TGF-β receptors, and their cell growth is inhibited by TGF-β1. Its apoptotic activity is also shown in specific cell types such as hepatocytes, myeloid cells, and epithelial cells. TGF-β1 promotes apoptosis not only in a hepatoma cell line (3Lin J.-K. Chou C.-K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar) but also in hepatocytes in regressing liver (4Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and in cirrhotic liver (5Takiya S. Tagaya T. Takahashi K. Kawashima H. Kamiya M. Fukuzawa Y. Kobayashi S. Fukatsu A. Katoh K. Kakumu S. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 48: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is implicated in the induction of apoptosis in prostatic epithelial cells after castration and is used to treat advanced prostatic tumor (6Brodin G. ten Dijke P. Funa K. Heldin C.-H. Landstroem M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis plays an essential role in eliminating abnormal cells from normal tissues in vivo. On the other hand, myeloid cell development is known to be under the control of apoptosis induced by TGF-β1 (7Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Blood. 1993; 81: 2257-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TGF-β1 exerts two distinct biological activities: inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis.Recent studies demonstrate that Smad proteins transmit the signals of the TGF-β superfamily members from their cell surface receptors to the nucleus (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Upon ligand activation of the receptor complex, receptor-regulated Smads become serine-phosphorylated by the activated receptors and associate with the common Smad4 to form a hetero-oligomeric complex. The complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and regulates transcription of specific genes. The Smad2·Smad4 and Smad3·Smad4 complexes have been demonstrated to be responsible for TGF-β1-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter constructs and growth inhibition. Although overexpression of Smad4 is suggested to induce apoptosis in MDCK canine epithelial cells (8Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), TGF-β1-induced overexpression of Smad7, which inhibits TGF-β1 signaling mediated by Smad2·Smad4 and Smad3·Smad4 complexes (9Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata K. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P.

Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The role of Smad proteins is still obscure in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.TGF-β1 has been reported to immediately and transiently up-regulate mRNA levels of genes of AP-1 components such as junB(12Zentella A. Weis F.M.B. Ralph D.A. Laiho M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and c-jun (13Kim S.-J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 12: 5015-5023Google Scholar), but the role of these up-regulated AP-1 components in TGF-β1-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis is unknown. The promoters of TGF-β1-responsive genes like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) andc-jun contain AP-1 binding sites. Mutation in these AP-1 binding sites, which impairs binding of the AP-1 complex, inhibits transcriptional activation of these promoters by TGF-β1 (14Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Smad proteins and the AP-1 complex synergize to activate the TGF-β1-responsive promoters. Recent studies indicate that Smad3 directly binds c-Jun and c-Fos of the AP-1 complex (16Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and that both Smad3 and Smad4 bind all three Jun proteins, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD (17Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, involvement of the AP-1 complex has not been demonstrated either in growth inhibition or in apoptosis induced by TGF-β1.The AP-1 complex appears to be involved in cell proliferation and survival, and a role of this multicomponent complex is also suggested in apoptosis of some cell types (18Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative mutant form of c-Jun, a central component of the AP-1 complex, protects sympathetic neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation (19Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase is required for induction of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells and PC12 cells (20Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 21Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, the AP-1 complex does not participate in apoptosis induced by TNF-α or cross-linking of Fas with agonistic anti-Fas antibody (22Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 23Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether the AP-1 complex is actually involved in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.Our present results show that TGF-β1 activates Smad proteins and the AP-1 complex (JunD·FosB) and that overexpression of their dominant-negative forms inhibits TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we find that overexpression of FosB enhances Smad-dependent transcription of the TGF-β1-responsive reporter. JunD·FosB recruits Smad3·Smad4 to form the AP-1·Smad complex that binds to the AP-1 binding site, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter element. These results show that both Smad proteins and AP-1 complex play a critical role in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that Smad proteins are key components in TGF-β1 signaling for growth inhibition and mesoderm formation (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). We show here that not only Smad proteins but also AP-1 complex actually participate in TGF-β1 signaling for apoptosis and that interference of the function of either Smad proteins or FosB component of the AP-1 complex markedly impairs TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.Smad2 and Smad1/Smad5 have been shown to mediate activin and bone morphogenetic protein 2-dependent apoptosis of murine B cell hybridoma (33Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad7 impairs phosphorylation of Smad proteins induced by activin or bone morphogenetic protein 2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. Although these observations indicate that Smad proteins are involved in activin or bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling for apoptosis, their roles are unclear in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Smad4, but not Smad3, is proposed to mediate apoptosis in MDCK cells (8Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis of the cells is not indicated in this report. In fact, a recent report indicates that TGF-β1 induces growth inhibition but not apoptosis in MDCK cells (34Altieri P. Zegarra M.O. Galietta L.J. Tarelli L.T. Sessa A. Ghiggeri G.M. J. Cell. Phys. 1998; 177: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although Smad3 overexpression is shown to induce apoptosis in BEAS2B epithelial cells, TGF-β1 stimulation is required to induce apoptosis in addition to Smad3 overexpression (35Yanagisawa K. Osada H. Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Takagi K. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis was inhibited by expression of either dominant-negative mutant Smad3 or Smad7 (Fig.2 B), indicating that formation of the Smad complex is necessary for induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1.Although Smad proteins are suggested to cooperate with the AP-1 complex to regulate transcription of target genes, involvement of the AP-1 complex has not been demonstrated in cell growth inhibition or apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. We found that only JunD and FosB, but not the other components of the AP-1 complex, are markedly induced during TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4, Aand B). FosB enhanced Smad3·Smad4-dependent transcription (Fig. 6 B), and its dominant-negative form blocked TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis but not growth inhibition (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that JunD·FosB activates transcription of a putative target gene for TGF-β1, which is responsible for apoptosis. Previous reports have shown that the AP-1 complex directly binds FasLpromoter and activates FasL expression, resulting in Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat T cells and PC12 cells (20Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 21Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We, however, found that there was no expression of Fas in Hep3B cells, whereas FasL expression was increased by TGF-β1 (data not shown). It remains to be determined which gene is involved in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis under the control of Smads and AP-1. Although c-Myc overexpression promotes apoptosis, c-Myc down-regulation also leads to apoptosis in some cell types. c-Myc is down-regulated by TGF-β1 (36Alexandrow M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1452-1457PubMed Google Scholar), and its promoter contains AP-1 binding site. Smads and AP-1 might recruit corepressors to blockc-myc transcription to mediate TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.Our present results suggest synergistic cooperation between Smads and the AP-1 complex in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Recently, a zinc finger protein, OAZ, was identified as a DNA binding factor that interacts with Smad1·Smad4 and Olf-1·EBF transcription factor using its different zinc finger domains to modulate transcriptional activity of distinct gene promoters (37Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Similar to OAZ, Smads may coordinate distinct signals from multiple signaling cascades by interacting with specific partners. Indeed, Smad proteins have been shown to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors, AP-1, ATF2, FAST, and TFE3, and with nuclear oncoproteins, Evi-1, E1A, Ski, and SnoN, all of which repress TGF-β1 signaling (38Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Smad proteins may positively or negatively modify transcription of target genes through cooperation with their DNA binding partners to exert diverse biological activities.Smad proteins are suggested to be tumor suppressors. Smad2 and Smad4 are functionally mutated in colorectal carcinoma (39Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Lap-Chee T. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H.

Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar), respectively. Smad3 knockout mice develop metastatic colorectal cancer (41Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TGF-β1 has been implicated as inducing apoptosis to eliminate abnormal cells from normal tissues such as the liver and prostate (4Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 5Takiya S. Tagaya T. Takahashi K.

Heldin C.-H. Landstroem M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of TGF-β1 could contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and prostatic tumor. This is consistent with the fact that higher concentrations of TGF-β1 at more than physiological concentration is required to induce apoptosis in the hepatoma and myeloma cell lines we used in our present study. An understanding of the cooperation between Smads and the AP-1 complex in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis could further show us the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily consists of a large number of cytokines including TGF-βs, bone morphogenetic proteins, and activins, which exert a wide range of biological functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β1, the founding member of the superfamily, is well known as a negative regulator of cell growth. A variety of cell types express the TGF-β receptors, and their cell growth is inhibited by TGF-β1. Its apoptotic activity is also shown in specific cell types such as hepatocytes, myeloid cells, and epithelial cells. TGF-β1 promotes apoptosis not only in a hepatoma cell line (3Lin J.-K. Chou C.-K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar) but also in hepatocytes in regressing liver (4Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and in cirrhotic liver (5Takiya S. Tagaya T. Takahashi K. Kawashima H. Kamiya M. Fukuzawa Y. Kobayashi S. Fukatsu A. Katoh K. Kakumu S. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 48: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is implicated in the induction of apoptosis in prostatic epithelial cells after castration and is used to treat advanced prostatic tumor (6Brodin G. ten Dijke P. Funa K. Heldin C.-H. Landstroem M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis plays an essential role in eliminating abnormal cells from normal tissues in vivo. On the other hand, myeloid cell development is known to be under the control of apoptosis induced by TGF-β1 (7Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Blood. 1993; 81: 2257-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TGF-β1 exerts two distinct biological activities: inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Recent studies demonstrate that Smad proteins transmit the signals of the TGF-β superfamily members from their cell surface receptors to the nucleus (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Upon ligand activation of the receptor complex, receptor-regulated Smads become serine-phosphorylated by the activated receptors and associate with the common Smad4 to form a hetero-oligomeric complex. The complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and regulates transcription of specific genes. The Smad2·Smad4 and Smad3·Smad4 complexes have been demonstrated to be responsible for TGF-β1-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter constructs and growth inhibition. Although overexpression of Smad4 is suggested to induce apoptosis in MDCK canine epithelial cells (8Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), TGF-β1-induced overexpression of Smad7, which inhibits TGF-β1 signaling mediated by Smad2·Smad4 and Smad3·Smad4 complexes (9Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata K. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P.

Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The role of Smad proteins is still obscure in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. TGF-β1 has been reported to immediately and transiently up-regulate mRNA levels of genes of AP-1 components such as junB(12Zentella A. Weis F.M.B. Ralph D.A. Laiho M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and c-jun (13Kim S.-J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 12: 5015-5023Google Scholar), but the role of these up-regulated AP-1 components in TGF-β1-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis is unknown. The promoters of TGF-β1-responsive genes like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) andc-jun contain AP-1 binding sites. Mutation in these AP-1 binding sites, which impairs binding of the AP-1 complex, inhibits transcriptional activation of these promoters by TGF-β1 (14Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Smad proteins and the AP-1 complex synergize to activate the TGF-β1-responsive promoters. Recent studies indicate that Smad3 directly binds c-Jun and c-Fos of the AP-1 complex (16Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and that both Smad3 and Smad4 bind all three Jun proteins, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD (17Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, involvement of the AP-1 complex has not been demonstrated either in growth inhibition or in apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. The AP-1 complex appears to be involved in cell proliferation and survival, and a role of this multicomponent complex is also suggested in apoptosis of some cell types (18Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative mutant form of c-Jun, a central component of the AP-1 complex, protects sympathetic neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation (19Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase is required for induction of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells and PC12 cells (20Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 21Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, the AP-1 complex does not participate in apoptosis induced by TNF-α or cross-linking of Fas with agonistic anti-Fas antibody (22Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 23Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether the AP-1 complex is actually involved in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Our present results show that TGF-β1 activates Smad proteins and the AP-1 complex (JunD·FosB) and that overexpression of their dominant-negative forms inhibits TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we find that overexpression of FosB enhances Smad-dependent transcription of the TGF-β1-responsive reporter. JunD·FosB recruits Smad3·Smad4 to form the AP-1·Smad complex that binds to the AP-1 binding site, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter element. These results show that both Smad proteins and AP-1 complex play a critical role in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. DISCUSSIONIt is well established that Smad proteins are key components in TGF-β1 signaling for growth inhibition and mesoderm formation (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). We show here that not only Smad proteins but also AP-1 complex actually participate in TGF-β1 signaling for apoptosis and that interference of the function of either Smad proteins or FosB component of the AP-1 complex markedly impairs TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.Smad2 and Smad1/Smad5 have been shown to mediate activin and bone morphogenetic protein 2-dependent apoptosis of murine B cell hybridoma (33Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad7 impairs phosphorylation of Smad proteins induced by activin or bone morphogenetic protein 2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. Although these observations indicate that Smad proteins are involved in activin or bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling for apoptosis, their roles are unclear in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Smad4, but not Smad3, is proposed to mediate apoptosis in MDCK cells (8Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis of the cells is not indicated in this report. In fact, a recent report indicates that TGF-β1 induces growth inhibition but not apoptosis in MDCK cells (34Altieri P. Zegarra M.O. Galietta L.J. Tarelli L.T. Sessa A. Ghiggeri G.M. J. Cell. Phys. 1998; 177: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although Smad3 overexpression is shown to induce apoptosis in BEAS2B epithelial cells, TGF-β1 stimulation is required to induce apoptosis in addition to Smad3 overexpression (35Yanagisawa K. Osada H. Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Takagi K. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis was inhibited by expression of either dominant-negative mutant Smad3 or Smad7 (Fig.2 B), indicating that formation of the Smad complex is necessary for induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1.Although Smad proteins are suggested to cooperate with the AP-1 complex to regulate transcription of target genes, involvement of the AP-1 complex has not been demonstrated in cell growth inhibition or apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. We found that only JunD and FosB, but not the other components of the AP-1 complex, are markedly induced during TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4, Aand B). FosB enhanced Smad3·Smad4-dependent transcription (Fig. 6 B), and its dominant-negative form blocked TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis but not growth inhibition (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that JunD·FosB activates transcription of a putative target gene for TGF-β1, which is responsible for apoptosis. Previous reports have shown that the AP-1 complex directly binds FasLpromoter and activates FasL expression, resulting in Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat T cells and PC12 cells (20Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 21Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We, however, found that there was no expression of Fas in Hep3B cells, whereas FasL expression was increased by TGF-β1 (data not shown). It remains to be determined which gene is involved in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis under the control of Smads and AP-1. Although c-Myc overexpression promotes apoptosis, c-Myc down-regulation also leads to apoptosis in some cell types. c-Myc is down-regulated by TGF-β1 (36Alexandrow M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1452-1457PubMed Google Scholar), and its promoter contains AP-1 binding site. Smads and AP-1 might recruit corepressors to blockc-myc transcription to mediate TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis.Our present results suggest synergistic cooperation between Smads and the AP-1 complex in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis. Recently, a zinc finger protein, OAZ, was identified as a DNA binding factor that interacts with Smad1·Smad4 and Olf-1·EBF transcription factor using its different zinc finger domains to modulate transcriptional activity of distinct gene promoters (37Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Similar to OAZ, Smads may coordinate distinct signals from multiple signaling cascades by interacting with specific partners. Indeed, Smad proteins have been shown to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors, AP-1, ATF2, FAST, and TFE3, and with nuclear oncoproteins, Evi-1, E1A, Ski, and SnoN, all of which repress TGF-β1 signaling (38Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Smad proteins may positively or negatively modify transcription of target genes through cooperation with their DNA binding partners to exert diverse biological activities.Smad proteins are suggested to be tumor suppressors. Smad2 and Smad4 are functionally mutated in colorectal carcinoma (39Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Lap-Chee T. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H.

On the other hand, TGF-β1 has been implicated as inducing apoptosis to eliminate abnormal cells from normal tissues such as the liver and prostate (4Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S.

Heldin C.-H. Landstroem M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of TGF-β1 could contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and prostatic tumor. This is consistent with the fact that higher concentrations of TGF-β1 at more than physiological concentration is required to induce apoptosis in the hepatoma and myeloma cell lines we used in our present study. An understanding of the cooperation between Smads and the AP-1 complex in TGF-β1-dependent apoptosis could further show us the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. It is well established that Smad proteins are key components in TGF-β1 signaling for growth inhibition and mesoderm formation (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

https://openalex.org/W2003405109,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies. Recently, two point mutations in α-synuclein were found to be associated with familial PD, but as of yet no mutations have been described in the homologous genes β- and γ-synuclein. α-Synuclein forms the major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, but these do not stain for β- or γ-synuclein. This result is very surprising, given the extent of sequence conservation and the high similarity in expression and subcellular localization, in particular between α- and β-synuclein. Here we compare in vitro fibrillogenesis of all three purified synucleins. We show that fresh solutions of α-, β-, and γ- synuclein show the same natively unfolded structure. While over time α-synuclein forms the previously described fibrils, no fibrils could be detected for β- and γ-synuclein under the same conditions. Most importantly, β- and γ-synuclein could not be cross-seeded with α-synuclein fibrils. However, under conditions that drastically accelerate aggregation, γ-synuclein can form fibrils with a lag phase roughly three times longer than α-synuclein. These results indicate that β- and γ-synuclein are intrinsically less fibrillogenic than α-synuclein and cannot form mixed fibrils with α-synuclein, which may explain why they do not appear in the pathological hallmarks of PD, although they are closely related to α-synuclein and are also abundant in brain.

They are all expressed in the thalamus, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, amygdala, and the hippocampus (9Lavedan C. Leroy E. Torres R. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Buchholtz S. Nussbaum R.L.

The high expression of β- and γ-synuclein in the substantia nigra and their similarity to α-synuclein make these genes excellent candidate loci for PD; however, studies published to date have failed to find pathogenic mutations in either gene (12Lincoln S.

We decided to compare the aggregation behavior of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein in a detailed time course to address whether there are fundamental differences among the three homologs that could offer insight into why β- and γ-synuclein are not found in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.Here we show that fresh solutions of β- and γ-synuclein exhibit the same natively unfolded structure as α-synuclein; however, both proteins are not only intrinsically less fibrillogenic than α-synuclein, but they are also not seedable by α-synuclein fibrils. This may explain why they do not appear to make a major contribution to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.RESULTSTo compare the aggregation properties of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein, we cloned β- and γ-synuclein cDNAs (8Jakes R.

Fig. 2 shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the three purified proteins, which are >99% pure. To address whether α-, β-, and γ-synuclein differ in their conformation, we performed CD and FTIR spectroscopy; fresh solutions of all three proteins showed the same natively unfolded structure with identical near and far UV CD spectra (Fig.3 A), confirming the far UV CD results of Serpell et al. (33Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The titration curves of the α-helix inducing agent trifluoroethanol for β- and γ-synuclein are identical to that for α-synuclein, demonstrating that under conditions that strongly favor α-helix these proteins have the same propensity for helical formation (data not shown). We then subjected α-, β-, and γ-synuclein to FTIR spectroscopy, which is more sensitive for β-sheet structure than CD spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra are nearly identical with the amide I absorption maximum for all three proteins at 1650 cm−1, indicating that they contain primarily random coil structure (Fig. 3 B), with no evidence of a higher β-sheet content in α-synuclein. In summary, the initial conformation of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein is identical, and the propensity for α-helix formation in the presence of trifluoroethanol is also equivalent.Figure 3Fresh solutions of wild type α-, β-, and γ-synuclein exhibit the same natively unfolded structure.

We now followed a similar aggregation time course to compare α-, β-, and γ-synuclein in parallel at the same concentrations (Fig.4 A). Under the experimental conditions we reproduced the previously reported loss of soluble α-synuclein, which is accompanied by the formation of fibrils (25Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); the depletion of soluble monomer continues until the critical concentration is reached (26Wood S.J.

In contrast, we did not observe a loss of soluble material for either β- or γ-synuclein at the same concentration (Fig. 4 A). However, in a nucleation-dependent process like α-synuclein aggregation, the rate-limiting step is the formation of nuclei. Thus, while β- and γ-synuclein do not spontaneously form fibrils, under the conditions of our experiment, they could still be aggregation-competent and participate in fibril elongation once a seed is provided. This could have pathological relevance, if the more rapidly aggregating α-synuclein was able to cross-seed β- or γ-synuclein. To address this possibility, we performed cross-seeding experiments in which we tried to seed α-, β-, and γ-synuclein with α-synuclein seeds at 1% of the monomer concentration. We have previously shown that under these conditions α-synuclein fibrillogenesis is strongly accelerated (26Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and we reproduce this finding here (Fig. 4 B). However, no fibril formation of β- or γ-synuclein is detectable (Fig. 4 B), indicating that neither of these proteins can be cross-seeded by α-synuclein.Figure 4Comparison of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein aggregation.

Values shown are the average of triplicate incubations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether β- and γ-synuclein can form fibrils on their own at all, we forced the conditions toward aggregation by performing incubations with continuous shaking at 37 °C and 3 mg/ml (200 μm). Under these conditions a solution of α-synuclein monomers is converted into fibrils within 1 day (versus 10 days in the non-shaken paradigm) and shows a lag phase of 7–10 h (Fig.5). When β-synuclein was incubated with continuous shaking, we did not observe a reduction in soluble material even after several days (Fig. 5). We extended the incubation to several weeks and still did not detect loss of β-synuclein (data not shown). However, γ-synuclein in solution did decrease after an initial lag phase of about 1 day (approximately three times that of α-synuclein) and reached steady state at about 2.5 days (Fig. 5). Paralleling the loss of soluble γ-synuclein, insoluble material could be precipitated by centrifugation. When we analyzed the γ-synuclein pellet by atomic force microscopy, we could clearly detect fibrils (Fig.6 A); their average height was ≈7 nm. To gain structural information, we performed FTIR spectroscopy of the γ-synuclein precipitate. Fig. 6 B shows the second derivative FTIR spectrum; the strong low wave number β-sheet band at 1629 cm−1 together with a weak high wave number β-sheet band at 1696 cm−1 indicates the presence of predominantly antiparallel and intermolecular β-sheet structure. The weak bands at 1644 (β-sheet), 1650 (unordered), 1654 (α-helix), and 1661 (turn) and the band at 1673 cm−1 (turn) suggest the existence of a small amount of other secondary structures as well. The fact that the frequencies of the low wave number β-sheet bands of α- and γ-synuclein are the same suggests that the intermolecular arrangements of the β-sheet structures are similar between α- and γ-synuclein (Fig. 6 B). We have shown in Fig. 4,A and B, that under our standard non-shaken conditions γ-synuclein does not aggregate and cannot be cross-seeded by α-synuclein. However, forcing aggregation by continuous shaking showed that γ-synuclein does not only have the intrinsic capacity to form fibrils (Fig. 5), but in doing so shows a pronounced lag phase, which is an indication of nucleation-dependent aggregation (34Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test for this mechanism, we added preformed γ-synuclein aggregates as seeds to a fresh γ-synuclein solution. This resulted in bypass of the lag phase and initiated aggregation (Fig. 6 C), with the rate of fibrillogenesis being seed concentration-dependent. Thus, γ-synuclein fibril formation, like α-synuclein fibril formation, is nucleation-dependent. In summary, we could not detect fibrillogenesis of β-synuclein in any of our paradigms, but under extreme conditions γ-synuclein can be forced to form fibrils by a nucleation-dependent mechanism; however, γ-synuclein cannot be cross-seeded by α-synuclein.Figure 5Aggregation of α- (■), β- (⋄), and γ-synuclein (○) at 3 mg/ml with continuous shaking during the incubation.

We reproduce our previous results on thein vitro fibril formation of α-synuclein by a nucleation-dependent mechanism. β- and γ-synuclein incubated at the same concentrations under the same conditions do not form fibrils within the same time frame as α-synuclein. Although the latter starts to form fibrils around day 6, incubation of β- and γ-synuclein for a period three times longer did not result in loss of soluble material. However, if the incubation at 37 °C was extended over 4 weeks, we did occasionally, but not reproducibly, observe a loss in soluble β-synuclein, and we could spin out an amorphous precipitate of different appearance than the α- and γ-synuclein fibrils. Atomic force microscopy analysis of this precipitate did not reveal fibrils or protofibrillar intermediates, and providing preformed precipitate as a seed could not accelerate its formation (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that this material does not form ordered fibrils but is instead an unstructured precipitate, due to protein denaturation.We further tried to force aggregation by continuous shaking and increased concentration, and we observed dramatically accelerated aggregation of α-synuclein, as shown in a 15–20-fold reduction in lag time (7–10 h versus 6 days). Under these conditions we can generate atomic force microscopy-detectable γ-synuclein fibrils of ≈7 nm height, which show a cross-β-sheet structure by FTIR. Although in our standard, non-shaken incubation paradigm γ-synuclein does not aggregate for up to 4 weeks, it can be seeded by the addition of exogenous preformed γ-synuclein seeds. These results establish that γ-synuclein can form well structured fibrils of similar height as α-synuclein filaments and that fibrillogenesis occurs by a nucleation-dependent mechanism as in α-synuclein. Again, even under these accelerated conditions, we cannot induce β-synuclein aggregation, even if the experiment is extended to several weeks. Along this line, a study investigating the induction of α-synuclein aggregation by iron reports no ferric ion effect on β-synuclein (27Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, Serpell et al. (33Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) report “small numbers of filaments” detectable by electron microscopy after 5 weeks of shaken incubation for γ- as well as β-synuclein. Finally, the most important aspect of our study addresses the in vivo situation of synuclein coexpression and the possibility of heterogeneous seeding. We show that neither β- nor γ-synuclein can be seeded by α-synuclein.These results should be useful to get a first hint at the exact regions of α-synuclein that are critical for fibril formation; the fact that β-synuclein completely fails to fibrillize under our conditions, although it has a higher overall homology to α-synuclein, than γ- has to α-synuclein, suggests that the region between amino acids 72 and 84, which is lacking in β- but not γ-synuclein, may contain critical fibrillation determinators. Consistent with this idea, two independent standard secondary structure prediction programs (35Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 36Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) both suggest that within the α-synuclein protein this particular region has the highest propensity to form β-sheets (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, the Chou-Fasman program predicts a tendency for β-sheet in the corresponding region of γ-synuclein, spanning amino acids 74–81, but not β-synuclein, consistent with the idea that this region may be critical for fibril formation. The pathogenic A53T mutation in α-synuclein even completely abolishes the α−helical stretch from amino acids 51–66 and results in an additional β-sheet spanning amino acids 51–58 (Chou-Fasman). Thus, the disease-associated A53T mutation induces a nearly continuous β-sheet stretch in α-synuclein between amino acids 51 and 81 and shows significantly accelerated fibrillogenesis in our in vitro assays (25Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Unlike β-synuclein, γ-synuclein carries a threonine at position 53 (see Fig. 1 A) and, consequently, shows a somewhat extended β-sheet in this area. However, the effect is small and, in contrast to the pathogenic A53T α-synuclein mutation, has nearly no consequence for the helical properties, which in both cases still dominate the overall structure. We feel that the differences in fibrillogenesis between β-and γ-synuclein cannot be attributed to just the threonine at position 53 alone but are most probably associated with the existing β-sheet at position 74–81, stabilized or extended by β-sheet-favoring sequences, e.g. Ala → Thr, or α-helix breakers like A30P.Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites contain α-synuclein as their major fibrillar component and are defining pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. It is unknown if and how the Lewy bodies and/or Lewy neurites cause neuronal degeneration. The finding that two α-synuclein mutations cause familial autosomal dominant PD and that both mutations enhance aggregation of α-synuclein in vitrosuggests a simple working model according to which at least some cases of PD could be due to enhanced aggregation of α-synuclein, leading to the formation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites and somehow causing the observed neuronal loss.β- and γ-synuclein are abundant in brain; both are similar to α-synuclein (78 and 60%, respectively), and both are expressed in regions of Lewy body formation and PD pathology. However, they have not been linked to PD genetically, and although a recent study describes novel hippocampal axonal lesions involving all synucleins (37Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M.-Y.

In these respects the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR in vitro resembles the ordered phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells. eIF4E, and eIF4G, eukaryotic initiation factors 3, 4E and 4G, respectively FK506-binding protein of M r = 12,000 human embryonic kidney histidine-tagged PHAS-I mTOR antibodies 1 and 2, respectively mammalian target of rapamycin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type mitogen-activated protein PHAS-I (also known as 4E-BP1) is a key element in a regulatory system that governs translation initiation by controlling the availability of eIF4E1 (1Lawrence Jr., J.C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). One of the first steps in initiation involves binding of eIF4E to the m7GpppN (where N is any nucleotide) cap, which is found at the end of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs (3Gingras A.-C. Raught B.

Nonphosphorylated PHAS-I binds tightly to eIF4E (5Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

When phosphorylated in the appropriate sites PHAS-I dissociates (5Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

PHAS-I in adipocytes and HEK293 cells is phosphorylated in the following five sites, all of which conform to a (S/T)P motif (9Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69 in both fat cells and HEK293 cells, and incubating cells with rapamycin decreases the phosphorylation of these sites (9Fadden P.

Determining which sites are most important in controlling PHAS-I in cells is complicated by the existence of an ordered mechanism in which the three TP sites are phosphorylated before phosphate accumulates in Ser-64 (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The kinases participating in the ordered phosphorylation of PHAS-I are not known, although it is clear that the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells is controlled in part by the mTOR signaling pathway (1Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). mTOR is a member of the family of protein kinases that have catalytic domains more homologous to phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase than to members of the much larger protein kinase family, of which the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is the prototypic member (13Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The finding that rapamycin attenuated the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in response to insulin was the first indication that mTOR participated in the control of PHAS-I (14Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rapamycin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the function of mTOR in cells, although adding rapamycin directly to mTOR has little effect, as it is rapamycin complexed to FKBP12 that binds with high affinity to mTOR (15Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). FKBP12 also binds FK506 but forms a complex that does not bind to mTOR. Overexpressing mTOR increases PHAS-I phosphorylation in cells (16Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T.

Phosphorylation of PHAS-I becomes insensitive to rapamycin following expression of mTOR having a point mutation that disrupts high affinity binding to rapamycin-FKBP12. mTOR rendered kinase-dead by a point mutation in the kinase domain is ineffective in stimulating PHAS-I phosphorylation (16Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). PHAS-I was the first exogenous substrate found for the mTOR kinasein vitro (16Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 17Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Based on peptide mapping and Edman degradation analyses of PHAS-I phosphorylated by mTOR that had been immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with the antibody, mTAb1, it was concluded that mTOR was capable of phosphorylating Thr-36, Thr-45, Thr-69, and Ser-64 (19Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by other groups failed to confirm the phosphorylation of Ser-64 and Thr-69, leading to suggestion that phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR is confined to Thr-36 and Thr-45 (12Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 17Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). However, different antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate mTOR, an important point in view of the fact that mTAb1 is an activating antibody (19Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Most previous studies of the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells have relied upon measurements of the gel shift that PHAS-I undergoes when it is phosphorylated in the appropriate sites. Three forms, designated α, β, and γ in order of decreasing electrophoretic mobility, are typically resolved by SDS-PAGE (20Lawrence Jr., J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lin T.-A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that Thr-45 and Ser-64 may be phosphorylated without a significant change in electrophoretic mobility (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, because more than one combination of sites may be phosphorylated in each mobility form, the gel shift assay provides no definitive information on the phosphorylation state of specific sites in PHAS-I (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To address this problem, we have generated a series of phospho-specific antibodies to sites in the PHAS-I protein. In this report, we present evidence documenting the specificity of the antibodies, and we describe results that provide new insight into the role of sites in controlling eIF4E binding as well as the mechanisms involved in the ordered phosphorylation of PHAS-I by the mTOR signaling pathway. The mTOR antibodies, mTAb1 and mTAb2, were described previously (19Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PHAS-I antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (CSSPEDKRAGGEESQFE) as described previously (21Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These antibodies bind in the COOH-terminal region of PHAS-I and react equally well with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the protein. To generate antibodies that specifically recognize PHAS-I phosphorylated in Thr-36/Thr-45, Ser-64, or Thr-69, rabbits were immunized with the following phosphopeptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: Thr(P)-36/45, CGDYSTT*PGGT; Ser(P)-64, CRNS*PVAK; and Thr(P)-69, CNSPVAKT*PPKD (where S* and T* are phosphorylated Ser and Thr, respectively). Note that the amino acid sequence surrounding the Thr-36 site (YSTT*PGGT) is almost identical to that surrounding the Thr-45 site (FSTT*PGGT) (9Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), so that phospho-specific antibodies generated against the Thr-36/45 peptide would be expected to react with PHAS-I when either Thr-36 or Thr-45 is phosphorylated. To select the phospho-specific antibodies, the serum was first incubated with nonphosphorylated peptides (CGDYSTTPGGTLFSTTPGGTR for Thr(P)-36/45, CRNSPVAKTPPKDLPT, for Ser(P)-64 and Thr(P)-69) that had been coupled to SulfoLink resin (Pierce). Next, the fractions that did not bind to the nonphosphorylated peptide resins were incubated with the respective phosphopeptides coupled to SulfoLink. After washing the columns, the phospho-specific antibodies were eluted at pH 2.7, immediately neutralized, and affinity-purified using protein A-agarose. Wild type (WT) PHAS-I and PHAS-I proteins having Ser/Thr → Ala mutations at positions 36, 45, 64, and 69 were expressed in bacteria and purified as described by Yang et al. (11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Designations for various mutant PHAS-I proteins are as described by Mothe-Satney et al. (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged PHAS-I ([His6]PHAS-I) was prepared as described previously (22Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [His6]S64 PHAS-I was generated by inserting cDNA encoding S64 PHAS-I into pET14b (Novagen) and expressing the protein in bacteria. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-FKBP12 was purified as described previously (23Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL 1573) were seeded into plastic tissue culture dishes (Falcon, 2 × 104 cells/cm2) and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 24 h in growth medium composed of 10% (v/v) horse serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The construction of pCMV4 vectors for the expression of WT PHAS-I and mutant PHAS-I proteins and the procedures used in transfecting HEK293 cells were described previously (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone or pcDNA3 containing inserts encoding AU1-mTOR proteins by using TransIT-LT2 polyamine transfection reagent (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) and 5 μg of DNA/100-mm diameter dish as described previously (16Brunn G.J.

AU1-mTOR has an AU1 epitope tag at the NH2 terminus. AU1-mTOR (rr) and AU1-mTOR (kd) have Ser-2035 → Ile and Asp2338 → Ala mutations, respectively. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes and used in experiments 8–10 days after removal of the differentiation medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in HEPES-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaPi, 5 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated as indicated in Fig. 4. Extracts were prepared as described previously (14Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells that had been transfected with vector alone or with the pcDNA-3 AU1-mTOR constructs were cultured for 18 h, washed twice with Buffer A (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and homogenized at 0 °C in Buffer B (50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm potassium phosphate, and 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) (750 μl/100-mm diameter dish) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. mTOR was immunoprecipitated from aliquots (700 μl) of extract using anti-AU1 antibody (from 2 μl of ascites) (Babco, Richmond, CA) bound to protein G-agarose (15 μl of packed beads). After incubating with extracts for 180 min, the beads were washed (1 ml buffer/wash) at 4 °C as follows: twice in Buffer B, twice in buffer B plus 0.5m NaCl, and twice in Buffer C (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The beads were then incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in Buffer C and then washed twice in Buffer D (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 10 mm Na-HEPES, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4). Prior to the kinase assay, the washed beads were incubated at 22 °C for 90 min in 25 μl of Buffer D supplemented with FKBP12, rapamycin, FK506, and mTOR antibodies. The beads were then washed twice with Buffer D, and the kinase reactions were initiated by adding 25 μl of Buffer D supplemented with 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2000 mCi/mmol), 10 mmMnCl2, and 50 μg/ml of the appropriate PHAS-I protein. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. PHAS-I was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts by using the antibody to the COOH-terminal region of the protein, and PHAS-I·eIF4E complexes were isolated from cell extracts by using m7GTP-Sepharose beads as described previously (5Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE by using the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). PHAS-I was identified by immunoblotting with PHAS-I antibodies as described previously (25Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Binding of phospho-specific antibodies were assessed in the same manner. To assess the specificity of the antibodies used in this study, recombinant WT PHAS-I and mutant PHAS-I proteins having Ser/Thr to Ala mutations in different phosphorylation sites were phosphorylated in vitro with MAP kinase before samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were prepared with the different antibodies (Fig. 1). A36 PHAS-I, A45 PHAS-I, A64 PHAS-I, and A69 PHAS-I have Ser/Thr → Ala mutations in Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69, respectively. A36/A45 PHAS-I has Thr → Ala mutations in both Thr-36 and Thr-45. MAP kinase is able to phosphorylate all four of these (S/T)P sites in WT PHAS-I, although Thr-69 is phosphorylated relatively slowly (9Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All of the antibodies reacted with WT PHAS-I that had been phosphorylated with MAP kinase (Fig. 1). However, none of the phospho-specific antibodies reacted with any of the PHAS-I proteins that had not been incubated with MAP kinase, 2I. Mothe-Satney and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., unpublished observations. indicating that recognition by the antibodies is dependent on phosphorylation. Results with the mutant proteins provided further support of the specificity of the antibodies. Thus, the Ser(P)-64 antibody bound to all of the phosphorylated PHAS-I proteins, except A64 PHAS-I, indicating that Ser-64 phosphorylation was required for recognition by this antibody. Likewise, mutating Thr-69 ablated binding by the Thr(P)-69 antibody. Mutating either Thr-36 or Thr-45 decreased binding of the Thr(P)-36/45 antibody, and mutating both Thr-36 and Thr-45 was required to abolish binding of this antibody. These results indicate that Thr(P)-36/45 recognizes the phosphorylated forms of either Thr-36 or Thr-45.Figure 1Reactivity of antibodies with WT PHAS-I and mutant PHAS-I proteins after in vitro phosphorylation with MAP kinase. WT PHAS-I and PHAS-I proteins having Ser/Thr to Ala mutations in the four insulin-sensitive phosphorylation sites were incubated with activated MAP kinase and ATP for 5 h as described previously (10Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane. Immunoblots were prepared with Thr(P)-36/45 antibodies (P-Thr36/45 Ab), Ser(P)-64 antibodies (P-Ser64 Ab), Thr(P)-69 antibodies (P-Thr69 Ab), or PHAS-I antibodies. α, β, and γ denote electrophoretic mobility forms of PHAS-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the phospho-specific antibodies could be used to investigate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in intact cells, WT PHAS-I and mutant PHAS-I proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, which were then incubated with a combination of insulin and amino acids to stimulate phosphorylation of the expressed proteins. When compensations are made for the slightly different amounts of the proteins expressed, as judged by blotting with PHAS-I antibodies, it can be seen that the Thr(P)-36/45 antibodies reacted equally well with WT PHAS-I, A64 PHAS-I, A69 PHAS-I, and A82 PHAS-I (Fig.2 A). Mutating either Thr-36 or Thr-45 decreased binding of the Thr(P)-36/45 antibodies, but mutation of both sites was required to abolish binding. The findings are consistent with the results from the in vitrophosphorylation experiments (Fig. 1) and indicate that the Thr(P)-36/45 antibodies bind to PHAS-I phosphorylated in either Thr-36 or Thr-45. Also consistent with the results from in vitro studies of specificity, Thr(P)-69 bound to all of the mutant proteins, except A69 PHAS-I (Fig. 2 A). Ser(P)-64 antibodies recognized WT PHAS-I in cell extracts of HEK293 cells, but other proteins having mobilities similar to that of PHAS-I reacted with the antibody.2 For this reason, when using Ser(P)-64 antibodies to investigate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in HEK293 cells, we immunoprecipitated PHAS-I before immunoblotting with Ser(P)-64 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). As expected Ser(P)-64 antibodies also bound A82 PHAS-I but did not bind to PHAS-I protein having a Ser-64 → Ala mutation. In addition, little if any binding of Ser(P)-64 antibodies to A36 PHAS-I, A45 PHAS-I, or A69 PHAS-I was detected. These findings provide additional evidence that accumulation of phosphate in Ser-64 depends on the phosphorylation of all three TP sites. Binding of eIF4E to PHAS-I markedly inhibits the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by certain kinases in vitro (14Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that phosphorylation of Ser-64 occurred secondarily to dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex in cells, we conducted experiments with NB PHAS-I, a protein with Leu-58 → Ala and Met-59 → Ala mutations, which have been shown to abolish high affinity binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E (10Mothe-Satney I.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results with Ser(P)-64 antibodies confirmed that Ser-64 was phosphorylated in both WT PHAS-I and NB PHAS-I (Fig. 2 C). However, Ser-64 was phosphorylated in neither S64 PHAS-I nor NB S64 PHAS-I, proteins having Ser → Ala mutations in all of the sites except Ser-64. Thus, the dependence of Ser-64 phosphorylation on the other phosphorylation sites does not occur because of dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex in response to phosphorylation of the TP sites. We next used the phospho-specific antibodies to investigate control of the phosphorylation of different sites in HEK293 cells overexpressing WT PHAS-I. Incubating cells with either insulin or amino acids alone increased Thr(P)-36/45 binding by approximately 3-fold (Fig. 3 A). Rapamycin had relatively little effect on the basal level of Thr(P)-36/45 binding, but rapamycin essentially abolished the effects of insulin and amino acids. Insulin and amino acids increased the binding of Ser(P)-64 antibodies by approximately 2- and 5-fold, respectively, and the effects were approximately additive (Fig. 3 B). Insulin also increased binding of Thr(P)-69 by 2-fold, but the effects of amino acids on Thr(P)-69 binding (Fig. 3 C) were less than the effects on Ser(P)-64 binding (Fig. 3 B). Incubating cells with rapamycin dramatically decreased binding of Ser(P)-64 and Thr(P)-69, both in cells incubated without other additions and in cells incubated with insulin and/or amino acids (Fig. 3, B andC). Incubating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin increased the reactivity of PHAS-I with the three phospho-specific antibodies, although the effects of insulin were less in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.4, A–C) than in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Rapamycin decreased reactivity with the different antibodies and attenuated the effects of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4, A–C), but the effects of rapamycin were also less pronounced in the adipocytes. Although phosphorylation of PHAS-I is known to promote dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex, certain phosphorylated forms of PHAS-I may copurify with eIF4E. An implication is that phosphorylation of the sites in such forms is not sufficient to promote dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex. Therefore, to gain further insight into the sites controlling PHAS-I binding to eIF4E in cells, PHAS-I·eIF4E complexes were affinity-purified from extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). In samples of the affinity-purified preparations from control cells, bands corresponding to α and β forms were detected with PHAS-I antibodies. The α form from control cells did not exhibit reactivity with any of the three phospho-specific antibodies, consistent with the interpretation that the band was composed primarily of nonphosphorylated PHAS-I. PHAS-I in the β band reacted with Thr(P)-69 antibodies (Fig. 5 B). Incubating cells with insulin essentially abolished binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E, as evidenced by the nearly complete loss of PHAS-I immunoreactivity in the m7GTP-Sepharose-purified fraction. Rapamycin attenuated the effect of insulin, and after treatment with rapamycin, phosphorylated Thr-69 was once again detected in the pool of PHAS-I bound to eIF4E. Moreover, after rapamycin, reactivity with Thr(P)-36/45 was detected in the α band. Phosphorylated Ser-64 was not detected in the fraction of PHAS-I that copur"
https://openalex.org/W2009310453,"The chemokine fractalkine (FK) has two structural features that make it unique in the chemokine family: a CX 3C motif and an extended carboxyl terminus that anchors it to the cell surface. This mucin-like stalk or an equivalent spacer is required for FK to mediate the adhesion of cells expressing its receptor, CX 3CR1. To determine whether the ability of FK to act as a cell adhesion molecule is due to the unique presentation of a chemokine domain on a stalk or to properties of the chemokine domain itself, we created a series of chimeras in which other soluble chemokines (RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, and interleukin 8) were fused to the mucin stalk. When tested in a static-cell adhesion assay, many of these chemokine chimeras demonstrated activity equivalent to that of FK. In flow assays, however, none of the chimeras captured cells as efficiently as FK. Interestingly, FK captured cells expressing either CX 3CR1 or the viral receptor US28. Cells bound to FK without rolling or detaching, whereas the interleukin 8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 chimeras induced primarily cell rolling and detaching, respectively. In binding studies, FK has a significantly slower off-rate from its receptors than any of the other chemokine chimeras had for their cognate receptors.

These studies revealed an unusual role for FK in directly mediating cell adhesion and raised the question of whether other chemokines presented in a similar manner would also directly support cell capture and adhesion.To determine whether the ability of FK to act as a cell adhesion molecule was due to its unique presentation atop a rigid stalk or rather to properties of the FK chemokine domain itself, we created a series of chimeras in which other soluble chemokines were fused to the FK mucin stalk. In this study, we have examined the ability of these chemokine/stalk chimeras to capture cells expressing the appropriate cognate receptors in both static and flow adhesion assays.RESULTSTo determine whether if the unique architecture of FK could completely explain its unusual ability to capture cells, we constructed a series of chimeras in which different chemokines were fused to the extracellular domain of the mucin-like stalk of FK (Fig.1). Each chimera had a series of six histidine residues added to the extreme carboxyl terminus to immobilize the protein on glass slides coated with antihistidine antibodies.A panel of 300-19 pre-B cells stably expressing epitope-tagged cognate receptors for FK and each of the chimeric chemokines was developed. Chemokine receptor expression was comparable in each of these cell lines, with the exception of US28, which was expressed at approximately half the level of the other receptors (Fig.2). A binding isotherm using125I-FK and the CX 3CR1-expressing cell line revealed 1.4 ± 0.2 × 105receptors/cell (not shown).Figure 2Receptor expression of 300-19 cell lines. Receptor expression of stably transfected 300-19 cell lines was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, with a phycoerythrin-conjugated M1 monoclonal antibody. The figure is presented in two panels (A and B) for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of each chimera to interact with its receptor was first assessed by measuring agonist-dependent changes in intracellular calcium levels. Full-length human and murine FK (FK/stalk) and the smaller, soluble chemokine domain-only portion of FK were essentially equipotent in their ability to mobilize intracellular calcium in CX 3CR1-transfected cell lines (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained for the MCP-1/stalk versus MCP-1 on CCR2-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B), for the MIP-1β/stalkversus MIP-1β on CCR5-transfected cells (Fig.3 C), and for SLC/stalk versus SLC on CCR7-transfected cells (Fig. 3 D). IL-8 and IL-8/stalk gave similar results on CXCR1-transfected cells (not shown).Figure 3Signaling by chemokines and chemokine/stalk chimeras. 300-19 cell lines stably expressing chemokine receptors were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Indo-1 AM and stimulated with soluble or stalk-chimeric chemokines. A, CX 3CR1 cells stimulated with soluble FK (sFK), human and murine FK/stalk, and IL-8/stalk (10 nm); B, CCR2 cells stimulated with soluble MCP-1 and MCP-1/stalk (10 nm); C, CCR5 cells stimulated with soluble MIP-1β and MIP-1β/stalk and FK/stalk (10 nm); D, CCR7 cells stimulated with soluble SLC and SLC/stalk and FK/stalk (20 nm). Responses are reported as the ratio of emission (410/490 nm) at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and are representative of at least two independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We began the adhesion studies by examining each of the chemokine/stalk chimeras in static assays (Fig. 4). FK captured cells expressing CX 3CR1 and US28, but not cells expressing other chemokine receptors (e.g. CCR5), consistent with previous reports (8Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The other chemokine/stalk chimeras varied in their ability to capture receptor-expressing cells. Some of these receptor-ligand pairs (MCP-1/stalk:CCR2; IL-8/stalk:CXCR1) were as potent as FK at mediating static adhesion. All pairs except MIP-1β/stalk:CCR5 mediated adhesion of cells above background levels. The ability to capture cells depended on the specific ligand-receptor pair. Thus, the MCP-1/stalk captured cells expressing CCR2 better than those expressing US28. Similarly, the RANTES/stalk captured cells expressing US28 better than cells expressing CCR1, even though CCR1 was expressed at a higher level than US28. In all cases, the addition of excess soluble chemokine (100 nm) reduced or eliminated adhesion of cells to the tethered chemokine (not shown). These data demonstrate that, under static conditions, at least a portion of the cell capture function of FK can be mimicked by chimeras that express other chemokines atop the FK mucin stalk.Figure 4Static adhesion of chemokine receptor cells. 300-19 cells stably expressing chemokine receptors were assayed for adhesion to antibody-tethered chemokine/stalk chimeras. Cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM and allowed to adhere for 30 min. Nonadherent cells were washed off, and the number of adherent cells was determined from the mean fluorescence in two wells. Each point represents an independent assay, and thebars represent the means. The following ligand receptor pairs showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) from wild-type, untransfected cells adhering to FK: FK-CCR5, mFK-US28, MIP-1β-CCR5, MCP-1-CXCR1, and IL-8-CX 3CR1. The others were significantly different (p < 0.05), indicating specific adhesion. Adhesion of US28-expressing cells to FK/stalk or RANTES/stalk was significantly greater than to MCP-1/stalk or mFK/stalk (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the chemokine/stalk chimeras could capture cells under physiological flow conditions, we used a parallel-plate adhesion assay. At a shear rate of 0.8 dyn/cm2, FK captured cells expressing CX 3CR1 more efficiently than those expressing US28, and the RANTES/stalk chimera failed to capture cells expressing CCR1, CCR5, or US28 (Fig.5 A). Similar results were obtained for MCP-1/stalk and US28 cells, although some adhesion of CCR2 cells by MCP-1/stalk remained. In addition, the capture of CXCR1 cells by the IL-8/stalk remained robust. At a shear rate of 1.2 dyn/cm2, however, only FK/stalk captured cells well (Fig. 5 B). As previously demonstrated for FK-mediated adhesion of cells expressing CX 3CR1, the IL-8/CXCR1 adhesion was not reduced by pertussis toxin treatment or by EDTA (not shown) (7Haskell C.A.

Cells adhering after 3 min were counted in 10 or more fields, and the mean value was determined. Eachpoint represents an independent assay, and thebars represent the means. A, 0.8 dyn/cm2, there was no significant difference between FK and mFK in capturing CX 3CR1-expressing cells. All others were significantly lower than FK-CX 3CR1 (p < 0.005). B, 1.2 dyn/cm2, all were lower than FK-CX 3CR1 (p< 0.01), except US28, which could not be analyzed statistically, because it contains only one point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we attempted to determine the coating density of the chemokine/stalk chimeras presented on the antihistidine antibody. As assessed from Western blots, the calculated density of FK was approximately 400 molecules/μm2 (60 pg/mm2). The “active” concentration was probably lower, because it is unlikely that all the protein was presented in a functional form by the antibody. The other chimeras coated at similar densities. Assuming that the surface area of one face of an endothelial cell has an area of 103 μm2 (24Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar), the density of FK in our assays would be equivalent to 4 × 105 molecules/cell. Although the actual density of FK on endothelial cells has not been reported, other adhesion proteins are expressed at comparable levels. For example, thrombin-activated endothelial cells express P-selectin at 50 molecules/μm2 or a total number of 5 × 104 molecules/cell (25Hattori R. Hamilton K.K. Fugate R.D. McEver R.P. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7768-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that we can see adhesion, albeit with reduced numbers of cells, to FK coated at 10% of this concentration (not shown).We observed during these flow adhesion assays that the behavior of captured cells depended on the specific chemokine/stalk substrate. We therefore further analyzed the interaction between the receptor-transfected cells and the chemokine/stalk chimeras. A single field of view in the flow chamber was selected, and cells that became tethered during an interval of 60 s were observed for an additional 30 s and classified as to whether they were arrested (remained stationary), rolled, or detached and re-entered the flow. Of the chemokine/stalk chimeras examined, only FK was able to capture and retain cells (Fig. 6). In the case of the IL-8/stalk chimera, the great majority of the cells that were “captured” subsequently rolled on the substrate. In the case of MCP-1/stalk and RANTES/stalk, cells adhered only briefly, and the majority detached during the observation period. Thus, only in the case of FK did cells attach and remain firmly adherent for the entire 30 s. In addition, both US28- and CX 3CR1-expressing cells showed a similar phenotype when interacting with FK (i.e. they arrested without rolling).Figure 6Action after tethering. 300-19 cell lines were perfused over antibody-tethered chemokine/stalk at a wall shear stress of 0.8 dyn/cm2. To determine the fate of cells that tethered, video was analyzed for the initial 60 s of flow. Every cell that tethered during this period was monitored for 30 s after the time of tethering. Cells were considered “detached” if they left the surface and re-entered bulk fluid flow. Rolling cells were defined as those that moved more than one cell diameter. “Arrested” cells remained stationary. Two assays were quantitated, and the means are shown (±S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data indicated that cell adhesion properties of FK were not simply due to the presentation of a chemokine-like domain at the top of a rigid stalk and thus suggested unique features of the interaction between FK and its receptor. To test this notion, we first asked whether cells expressing chemokine receptors could be “labeled” with the appropriate chemokine/stalk chimera. A variant of this approach, using epitope-tagged FK, has been used to evaluate receptor expression on cells (8Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S.

The RANTES/stalk labeled cells expressing US28 but failed to label cells expressing either CCR1 or CCR5. MCP-1/stalk and SLC/stalk also failed to label cells expressing their cognate receptors, but IL-8/stalk did bind to cells expressing CXCR1. These data indicated that the chemokine/stalk chimeras that supported cell adhesion under flow also bound to cells expressing the appropriate receptors with sufficient affinity to resist dissociation during the time and under conditions necessary to perform this flow cytometry assay.Figure 7Chemokine/stalk labeling of receptor-expressing cells. 300-19 cell lines were incubated with the indicated chemokine/stalk chimera (10 nm) at room temperature for 60 min. This was followed by labeling with an antipolyhistidine primary antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CCR2, CCR7, and CXCR1 are displayed with the dashed line indicating chemokine/stalk labeling and the solid line indicating unlabeled cells. These data are representative of two assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next asked whether the ability of FK to capture and retain cells under flow was due to a slow off-rate of the chemokine from its receptor. To address this question, we allowed the chemokine/stalk chimeras to bind to cells expressing the appropriate receptors and then added excess soluble chemokine either simultaneously with the chemokine/stalk or midway through the labeling period (Fig.8). Excess soluble FK blocked binding of the FK/stalk chimera when the two were added simultaneously but not if the soluble FK was added 30 min after the FK/stalk. In contrast, addition of the soluble chemokine reduced binding of the IL-8/stalk significantly even when added after 30 min. FK binding to US28 gave a result intermediate between those obtained with FK-CX 3CR1 and IL-8-CXCR1. In contrast, RANTES/stalk binding to US28 was almost completely eliminated by the addition of soluble RANTES, even after 30 min. Similar experiments could not be performed for the other chemokine/stalk-receptor pairs, because the initial binding affinity was too low (see Fig. 7).Figure 8FK/stalk has a slower off-rate than other chemokines. 300-19 cell lines were labeled with chemokine/stalk (10 nm), and excess soluble chemokine (100 nm) was added at the beginning of the assay or at 30 min into the 60-min incubation. This was followed by labeling with an antipolyhistidine primary antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These data are representative of two assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have created a series of chimeras in which soluble chemokines were fused to the mucin-like stalk of FK to test the hypothesis that the ability of FK to capture cells is due to the unique presentation of its chemokine-like domain. Under static conditions, a number of the chemokine/stalk chimeras bound cells expressing the cognate receptors. Under flow conditions, however, only FK/stalk and IL-8/stalk successfully captured cells. The majority of the CXCR1-expressing cells rolled on the IL-8/stalk chimera and were not firmly adherent. Finally, the ability of FK to capture cells expressing CX 3CR1 and US28 correlated well with the slow off-rate of the chemokine from these two receptors. We conclude that presentation of chemokines atop a rigid mucin-like stalk is not sufficient to confer the ability to capture cells under flow conditions.Evidence from many groups supports a multistep model for leukocyte emigration from the bloodstream. The initial step is selectin-mediated rolling of unactivated cells along the vessel wall, followed by capture and diapedesis through the endothelium. One conclusion from the current study is that static adhesion assays are less discriminatory than simple flow assays in identifying molecules capable of capturing cells. Thus, under static conditions, human and murine FK/stalk, RANTES/stalk, and MCP-1/stalk had comparable abilities to bind cells, a result similar to that observed with various chemokine/stalk:receptor pairs (8Imai T.

However, under conditions of low shear, only the FK/stalk interactions remained robust, and all the other chemokine chimeras had significantly reduced adhesion. We were further able to distinguish between human and murine FK/stalk in their ability to capture cells at a slightly higher flow. Interestingly, the IL-8/stalk interaction represented cell rolling rather than firm adherence. Although rolling is typically attributed to selectin-mediated interactions, there is evidence that the integrin α4β1(VLA-4) also mediates rolling (27Alon R. Kassner P.D. Carr M.W. Finger E.B. Hemler M.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Similar to what was seen with α4β1 (27Alon R. Kassner P.D. Carr M.W. Finger E.B. Hemler M.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), increased concentrations of IL-8/stalk induced firm adhesion, rather than rolling, in a subpopulation of the cells (not shown). Because IL-8 and other chemokines bind well to heparin sulfate proteoglycans, it is possible that they too contribute to rolling along the endothelium (28Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 29Kuschert G.S.V. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N.C.

Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although it is a promiscuous receptor that binds many chemokines, Kledal et al. (31Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) found that US28 binds FK preferentially with subnanomolar affinity and speculated that it has been “optimized” through evolution to promote viral entry through binding to FK on the host cell surface. Consistent with these data, we found that, although cells transfected with US28 adhered to many chemokines (FK/stalk, RANTES/stalk, MCP-1/stalk) under static conditions, only FK/stalk captured US28-expressing cells under flow conditions. Of the two receptors for FK, CX 3CR1 appeared to capture cells more efficiently than US28. A caveat to this conclusion, however, is that US28 was expressed at somewhat lower levels than CX 3CR1 on the 300-19 cells. Whether or not the binding of US28 to FK actually contributes to the entry of cytomegalovirus into mammalian cells remains to be determined.The three-dimensional structure of the chemokine-like domain of FK was recently solved by Mizoue et al. (32Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and several features were found that distinguish it from the other chemokines whose structures are known. For example, FK exists as a monomer at high concentrations, and the CX 3C motif forms a “bulge” in the structure. It is not known if these structural features are important for FK's unique ability to act as a cell adhesion receptor; however, the only other chemokine/stalk chimera to support adhesion was IL-8, a CXC chemokine. It is also interesting to note that a potential N-glycosylation site is present within the CX 3C motif (33NX(S/T)) in human FK, but not in murine FK. In our studies, murine FK failed to support adhesion of US28-expressing cell lines. Mutation of this asparagine or treatment with N-glycosidases may reve"

Lysyl oxidase and collagen III often show similar expression patterns in fibrotic tissues. Therefore, we investigated the influence of lysyl oxidase overexpression on the promoter activity of human COL3A1 gene. Our results showed that when COS-7 cells overexpressed the mature form of lysyl oxidase, the activity of the human COL3A1 promoter was increased up to an average of 12 times when tested by luciferase reporter assay. The effect was specific, because other promoters were not affected. Moreover, lysyl oxidase effect was abolished by β-aminopropionitrile, a specific inhibitor of its catalytic activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a binding activity in the region from −101 to −77 that was significantly increased by lysyl oxidase overexpression. The binding was specifically competed by the cold probe, and the mutagenesis of this region abolished both the binding activity in gel retardation and lysyl oxidase stimulation of COL3A1 promoter in transfection experiments. We identified the binding activity as Ku antigen in its two components: Ku80 and Ku70. This study suggests a new coordinated mechanism by which lysyl oxidase might control the development of fibrosis.

It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of peptidyl-lysine and hydroxylysine to peptidyl-α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde into elastin and collagen chains. The consequent aldheydes lead to a spontaneous condensation forming inter- and intra-chain cross-links into these important extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This post-translational modification of the ECM molecules seems to have a very important role both for collagen and elastin structural aspects and likely triggers some still unknown signal transduction pathways. Because of its action on ECM, deficit of normal LOX expression has been described in many polygenic and monogenic disorders such as atherosclerosis, type IX Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Menkes disease (3Kuivaniemi H. Peltonen L. Kivirikko K.I. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 798-808PubMed Google Scholar, 4Royce P.M. Camakaris J. Danks D.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 576-586Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an enhanced level of LOX as well seems to be involved in human pathology. Several reports have recently suggested a clear association between organ fibrosis and increased LOX activity. This has been described in several chronic human liver diseases (5Murawaki Y. Kusakabe Y. Hirayama C. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in rat experimental hepatic fibrosis (CCl4) (6Siegel R.C. Chen K.H. Greenspan J.S. Aguiar J.M.

In many naturally occurring and oncogene-induced tumors and cellular models, LOX is down-regulated, whereas on the other hand is one of the main genes induced in concomitance with the reversion process (14Contente S.

In particular, it seems that LOX is down-regulated in cells transformed byras or ras-related oncogenes, so that it was first identified as a “ras recision gene” (rrg) (14Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M.

Moreover, LOX expression and activity are proved to be regulated by several growth factors, including transforming growth factor-β1, interleukin-1, prostaglandins, insulin-like growth factor 1 (19Feres-Filho E.J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2417-2421PubMed Google Scholar), which puts this protein in a critical pathway for cell growth and phenotype control. Despite all these intriguing findings, there are no hypotheses so far about the mechanisms through which LOX might actually work as a tumor suppressor. The localization of the enzyme is mainly extracellular, where its acknowledged substrates are located. Yet, this does not imply that regulation of ECM cross-linking is the only biochemical role of LOX. It is not known whether LOX has substrates other than collagen and elastin, although it has been proved that in vitro LOX can catalyze the oxidative deamination in several peptides and complex proteins (27Kagan H.M.

Therefore, LOX might have an intracellular substrate(s), which would mediate its ability to control the cell phenotype (29Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K. Kagan H. Proc. Natl.

Biochem. 1999; 72: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of LOX overexpression on the activity of human collagen III α1 (COL3A1) promoter. To address this issue we used a reporter gene approach, transfecting COL3A1 promoter cloned upstream of luciferase gene into COS-7 cells. The influence of LOX expression was evaluated comparing the same cells co-transfected with the expression vector alone or carrying LOX coding sequence for the mature 32-kDa protein (30Di Donato A. Lacal J.C. Di Duca M. Giampuzzi M. Ghiggeri G. Gusmano R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J. Biochem.

Our results showed a dramatic increase in COL3A1 promoter activity when the recombinant LOX was overexpressed. Furthermore, we defined the region of COL3A1 promoter most likely involved in this LOX-dependent activation and some of the possible mechanisms involved. Monkey renal fibroblast COS-7 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was grown under humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin. Human skin fibroblasts were a primary culture and grown in the same conditions as described above for COS-7 cells. The different fragments of COL3A1 promoter described in the text were derived from the IdF8 clone kindly provided by Dr. F. Ramirez (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) both by endonuclease restriction and PCR amplification. The fragments were then subcloned into pGL2-basic vector (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) upstream the luciferase reporter gene (39Oleggini R. Musante L. Menoni S. Botti G. Duca M.D. Prudenziati M. Carrea A. Ravazzolo R. Ghiggeri G.M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The construct pFV1 was mutated into pFV1m by PCR, using overlapping primers containing the mutated nucleotide sequence. The mutation, encompassing the region from −97 to −75 in the COL3A1 promoter insert, transformed the original sequence 5′-GCT GAG GGG ATG GGT GCG-3′ into 5′-CAA TCT CCT GCC TAG ATT-3′. Lysyl oxidase coding sequence for the mature 32-kDa protein, obtained by PCR, was previously cloned into pTrc-His vector (30Di Donato A. Lacal J.C. Di Duca M. Giampuzzi M. Ghiggeri G. Gusmano R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fragmentNcoI-BglII including the poly-His tag with LOX coding sequence was subcloned into pSG5 vector (kind gift of Dr. D. Guerini, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland), using a NcoI-EcoRI adapter. All sequences were checked by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with 4 μg of the indicated plasmids by DEAE-dextran method (41Vaheri A. Pagano J. Virology. 1965; 27: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, for a 100-mm Petri dish 1–4 μg of each supercoiled plasmid resuspended in 1.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of NU-Serum™, 1% glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin was added to the cells, previously washed with phosphate-buffered saline. An equal volume of the above medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.15, containing 1 mg/ml DEAE-dextran was then added to the dish. The cells were incubated for 30 min at the usual growth conditions, and after the addition of 6 ml of the above medium were incubated for 3 h more. To improve the efficiency of the transfection, the medium added for the second incubation contained also 100 μm chloroquine, which inhibits the lysosomal degradation of the DNA. The incubation was ended by aspirating the DNA/DEAE-dextran solution and washing the cells for 3 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% of dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells were then incubated for 48 h with its normal medium and at the normal growth conditions, before being processed for luciferase assay. To normalize each experiment for transfection efficiency, 1–2 μg of pCMV-lacZ expressing the β-galactosidase enzyme was always co-transfected. Luciferase activity was determined by measuring luminescence in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), according to the luciferase assay kit (Promega) directions. The results were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity, which was assayed by spectrophotometric conversion of resorufin-β-galactopiranoside (Sigma) at 572 nm. The cells, previously washed with phosphate-buffered saline, were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were pelleted at 600 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 200 μl/100 mm plate of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiotreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride and kept at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell suspension was then added with15 volume of 1% Nonidet P-40 to obtain a final concentration of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 700 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (S1) was saved for further processing, whereas the pellet (P1), mostly containing the unbroken nuclei, was resuspended in the previous buffer, added with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 m NaCl, 10% glycerol and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. P1 was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction (S2) was collected and used as nuclear extract for gel retardation assay. S1 was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h, to obtain a partially purified cytosolic (S3) fraction. The protein concentration was determined using a classical Coomassie Blue-based assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described previously (43Barresi R. Sirito M. Karsenty G. Ravazzolo R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using 2–5 μg of nuclear extract proteins in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.35 mm dithiotreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 μl of 2 mg/ml of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/reaction). Where indicated the poly(dI-dC) was substituted with 5 μg/reaction of calf thymus DNA (Sigma), heat denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and then rapidly cooled on ice. The sequences of the oligonucleotide used were the following: 31, 5′-TAC TGC TGA GGG GAT GGG TGC GGC-3′; 11, 5′-AGG GGC TGG AAA GTG AGG GAA GCC A-3′; and 414, 5′-TGG CTG AGT TTT ATG ACG-3′. All oligonucleotides employed were labeled at their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding to the double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the different regions of COL3A1 promoter was performed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 ftmol of 32P-labeled probes with the previous nuclear extract mix. The DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. Competitions were performed by the addition of 100–300-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor to the incubation mixture. Where indicated, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with the specified antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and then used for the gel retardation assay. The antibodies were the same used in Western blot analysis. To introduce the oligonucleotide 31 in a circular DNA structure, it was modified, adding at its endsXbaI and PstI restriction sites and subsequentely subcloned into pSK+ plasmid digested in the corresponding restriction sites. After selection of the pSK+ clones carrying the oligonucleotide 31 insert, the plasmid was cut inEcoRI and PvuII restriction sites external to oligonucleotide 31, and the released fragment was purified from 3% agarose gel. Then the fragment was circularized by T4 ligation, producing a 280-bp circularized DNA molecule (44Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The circular product was purified again from agarose gel after digestion with Bal31 to remove the remaining linear DNA. The obtained microcircles were used to compete the binding of Ku to the oligonucleotide 31. Microcircles obtained from wild type pSK+ (without oligonucleotide 31) were used as negative control. Approximately 30 μg of proteins from the indicated cell fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and blotted to a Hybond-Super C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were probed with Omni-Probe/M21, an anti-(His)6 tag polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to detect recombinant LOX. To detect Ku80 and Ku70 in the indicated cell extracts, anti-Ku80 polyclonal (M-20) and anti-Ku70 polyclonal (C-19) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used. The blots were developed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated species-specific anti-immunoglobulin antibody. Total RNA was extracted (RNA Fast, Molecular Systems, San Diego, CA) from about 1–2 million subconfluent human skin fibroblast cells after 2 days from the transfection of pSG5 or pSG5-LOX vector. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, using random hexamers as primers (cDNA 1st Strand synthesis kit,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting cDNA was diluted to a ratio of 1:5 and used as template for the following PCR. The PCR was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm of each primer, 200 μm dNTP, 5% Me2SO, and 1.5 units of Taq Polymerase reactions (Taq DNA Polymerase from Termus Aquaticus strain YT1; Promega). The primers used to amplify Col3A1 messenger were: forward, 5′-CTG AAA TTC TGC CAT CCT GAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCA AGG TCC ACA CCA AAT TC-3′. The PCR conditions used to amplify the Col3A1 were: preincubation for 5 min at 95 °C and then 24 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final step of 5 min at 72 °C. The expected product was of 590 bp long. Parallel PCR reactions were performed to amplify the housekeeping gene G3PDH and to normalize the results obtained for Col3A1. The primers used for the amplification of G3PDH were the following: forward, 5′-TGA AGG TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC C-3′. To amplify the G3PDH we used the same conditions as above, but a temperature of 60 °C for the annealing and 90 s of elongation at 72 °C. The expected product was 980 bp long. Several amplifications for both messengers were performed to define the range of template amount and cycle number that would give the best linear results. The PCR products were quantified by densitometric analysis (National Institutes of Health Image v1.62 for Macintosh), and Col3A1 product was expressed as a Col3A1:G3PDH ratio. Several fragments of COL3A1 promoter, ranging at their 5′ ends from −1375 to -35 bp from the transcription start site and extending up to +61 bp, were cloned into pGL2-basic vector. In length order the constructs are: pRUP4, pRUP6, pFV1, pDD1, and pDD2, respectively starting at −1375, −257, −117, −55, and −35 (Fig.1, A and B). All of the above constructs showed a comparable basal activity, except for pDD2, which was significantly two times higher (Fig.2). COS-7 cells were transfected with pSG5-HLOX, a SV40-driven mammalian expression vector that expresses the mature form of LOX tagged with poly(His)6 at the NH2 terminus. Interestingly, the recombinant LOX protein, although expressed in the cytoplasm as expected, was also largely expressed in the nuclear compartment, which is in agreement with the most recent findings (29Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K. Kagan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12817-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We were unable to detect by any means the recombinant LOX in the extracellular compartment (data not shown), confirming the importance of the pro-peptide sequence in the secretion of the enzyme. This suited our aim of studying the putative intracellular activity of LOX.Figure 3SDS-PAGE of fractionated cell extracts from COS-7 transfected with LOX (pSG5-LOX) or with the vector alone (pSG5). The recombinant LOX was detected by Western blot with polyclonal anti-His tag antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pSG5-LOX and the other different COL3A1 promoter constructs, the activity of the promoter was increased up to an average of 12 times, depending on the construct. In Fig. 2 a summary of the responses of the different promoter fragments to LOX expression is shown. The FV1 and DD1 regions are the most responsive, although pDD2 construct still retains a significant 2–3-fold inducibility upon LOX expression. The Fig.4 A shows that LOX induction of COL3A1 promoter is dependent on LOX catalytic activity, being completely suppressed by its inhibitor, the β-amino-propionitrile (7Riley D.J. Kerr J.S.

Additionally, to rule out any generic effects on the basic transcription machinery, we co-transfected pSG5-LOX with pGL2-control vector, which is deprived of any promoter region, or with two short minimal unrelated promoters, the SV40 contained in pGL2-promoter vector and the interleukin-4 minimal promoter, also subcloned into pGL2 plasmid. Fig. 4 B shows that in all cases, except with pFV1, LOX expression did not cause any increase in luciferase activity. Based on these functional findings (Fig. 2), we guessed that a LOX-responsive sequence must be present in repeated copies in the FV1 fragment, because we observed the highest response to LOX expression in all three tested fragments, FV1, DD1, and DD2. Moreover, the response decreased with the shortening of COL3A1 fragment, probably due also to an increased basal activity. We therefore analyzed the homology among the three fragments. The homologous regions are shown underlinedin Fig. 1 B. The resulting consensus sequence can be indicated as: (A/G)CT(G/A)A(G/A)GG(A/G)A. Although there are some differences within the three sequences, there is a strict conservation of the purines, which accounts for 80% of the overlapping sequences. To probe the ability of this consensus sequence to bind some transcription factor(s), we performed a classic EMSA analysis approach. The experiment was performed using the nuclear extracts from COS-7 transfected with the vector expressing the recombinant LOX or with the empty vector as negative control, and the three consensus DNA sequences, respectively named 31, 11, and 414, were used as probes. Fig. 5 A shows clearly a retarded DNA-protein(s) complex that is increased 3–4 times when LOX is overexpressed. Although LOX induces the highest binding with probe 31, the relative increase seems within the same range for all three sequences. Fig. 5 B shows the specific competition of the DNA-protein complex bound to probe 31 by a molar excess of the cold oligonucleotide 31 or the other two consensus sequences, 11 and 414. The mutation of oligonucleotide 31 (31m) resulted in the abolition of the above described complex (Fig.6 A). The same mutation was also introduced in the pFV1 construct (FV1m) to test its effect in the luciferase gene reporter assay. The basal promoter activity of FV1m was almost double the one of the FV1, but, as expected, there was a much lower response to LOX expression (Fig. 6 B).Figure 5A, EMSA using oligonucleotides 31, 11, and 414 as 32P-labeled probes in presence of nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pSG5 expression vector alone or pSG5-LOX vector carrying the coding sequence for mature LOX.B, as above but using oligonucleotide 31 as32P-labeled probe.

It controls the folding of target proteins including steroid hormone receptors and kinases in complex with several partner proteins. Prominent members of this protein family are large peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds in proteins and possess chaperone activity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two closely related large Hsp90-associated PPIases, Cpr6 and Cpr7, exist. We show here that these homologous proteins bind with comparable affinity to Hsp90 but exhibit significant structural and functional differences. Cpr6 is more stable than Cpr7 against thermal denaturation and displays an up to 100-fold higher PPIase activity. In contrast, the chaperone activity of Cpr6 is much lower than that of Cpr7. Based on these results we suggest that the two immunophilins perform overlapping but not identical tasks in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1963650921,"Integrins are cysteine-rich heterodimeric cell-surface adhesion molecules that alter their affinity for ligands in response to cellular activation. The molecular mechanisms involved in this activation of integrins are not understood. Treatment with the thiol-reducing agent, dithiothreitol, can induce an activation-like state in many integrins suggesting that cysteine-cysteine dithiol bonds are important for the receptor's tertiary structure and may be involved in activation-induced conformational changes. Here we demonstrate that the platelet-specific integrin, αIIbβ3, contains an endogenous thiol isomerase activity, predicted from the presence of the tetrapeptide motif, CXXC, in each of the cysteine-rich repeats of the β3 polypeptide. This motif comprises the active site in enzymes involved in disulfide exchange reactions, including protein-disulfide isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) and thioredoxin. Intrinsic thiol isomerase activity is also observed in the related integrin, αvβ3, which shares a common β-subunit. Thiol isomerase activity within αIIbβ3 is time-dependent and saturable, and is inhibited by the protein-disulfide isomerase inhibitor, bacitracin. Furthermore, this activity is calcium-sensitive and is regulated in the EDTA-stabilized conformation of the integrin.

In cells at rest, integrins are present in a latent or resting conformation. Following cellular activation, they undergo conformational changes to become high affinity receptors for their specific ligand(s). The “switch” mechanism whereby integrins are converted from their resting conformation is critically important to their cellular function. However, the mechanisms underlying these conformational changes have not yet been deduced. The conformational changes in the platelet-specific integrin, αIIbβ3, are the composite result of at least two processes. First, intracellular signals converge on the cytoplasmic tails of the integrin conveying the intention to activate. Second, the extracellular domains, which constitute >95% of the molecules, respond with an increased affinity for ligand and an altered display of antibody epitopes suggestive of altered protein folding. We have shown that the conserved α-subunit cytoplasmic sequence, KVGFFKR, is critical for the intracellular-mediated activation of the platelet integrin (1Stephens G. O'Luanaigh N. Reilly D. Harriott P. Walker B. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20317-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The precise role played by this peptide sequence remains uncharacterized. However, Vinogradova et al. (2Vinogradova O. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), have recently proposed a structural basis for this effect which proposes a protein-protein interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic tails. Deletion or mutation of this cytoplasmic sequence from the αIIb subunit were found to increase the ligand binding affinity of the mutant receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (3O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 4Peter K. Bode C. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, ligand binding to the ectodomains of integrins has also been demonstrated to affect intracellular recognition sites on the cytoplasmic tails of integrins in a process known as outside-in signaling (5Leisner T.M.

These studies provide evidence for transmembrane modulation of integrin conformation although the mechanisms mediating these changes are not understood. The subunits of integrins are rich in cysteine residues. The pairing of these residues in disulfide bonds, particularly in the platelet-specific integrin αIIbβ3, have been shown to be important in the structural integrity of the receptor (6Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 22: 29-38Google Scholar). Chemical reduction of the thiol bonds by the reducing agent dithiothreitol induces an active conformation in αIIbβ3 (8Zucker M.B. Masiello N.C. Platelet Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of this observation is not understood. Selective mutation of critical cysteines in the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 results in the induction of a constitutively active form of the receptor lending further support to the proposal that altered dithiol bonding is implicated in integrin activation (10Liu C.-Y. Sun Q.-H. Wang R. Paddock C.M. Newman P.J. Blood. 1998; 92: A1413Crossref Google Scholar). Dithiol reduction also causes activation of other integrins (11Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Southon E.A.

Analysis of the integrin cysteine patterns reveals that there are nine CXXC repeats in each β-integrin subunit. This sequence has previously been identified in the active site motif in the bacterial thiol reducing enzyme, thioredoxin, and in the mammalian thiol isomerase, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI).1 A glycine residue is most often found as the first amino acid position of the repeat. Other proteins that possess this sequence include the chaperone molecules Erp61 and Erp72 (13Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the gonadotropins, lutropin and follitropin (14Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E.

Trans. 1995; 23: 394SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and fibronectin (16Langenbach K.J. Sottile J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7032-7038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All these proteins have demonstrable endogenous PDI-like activity. von Willebrand factor also has numerous CGXC sequences but no thiol isomerase activity was shown (17Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the integrin β subunit, the specific CGXC sequence is repeated four times; once in each of the regions identified as the cysteine-rich repeat regions (CRRs) (6Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated purified integrin αIIbβ3 for the presence of endogenous thiol isomerase activity. In addition, we evaluated its biochemical and pharmacological profile in in vitro assays and demonstrated that this enzymatic activity is a common feature of integrins. Ribonuclease A (RNase) and PDI were obtained from CalBiochem-Novabiochem (CA). αvβ3 and α5β1were supplied by Chemicon (CA). Sephadex G25 column, bacitracin, guanidine hydrochloride, EDTA, dithiothreitol, cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate, MOPS, and Trizma base were all supplied by Sigma. CD41a (an antibody to αIIbβ3) was obtained from Immunotech, Marseilles, France, and anti-PDI from StressgenBiotechnology Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Goat anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated IgG and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjuagated IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands. This was purified from outdated units of human platelets as described previously (18Phillips D.R. Fitzgerald L. Parise L. Steiner B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 244-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in a buffer containing 20 mmTris, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were concentrated to approximately 4 mg/ml by filtration through Centrex filters (Schleicher and Schuell, 10-kDa cut-off). 30 mg of purified RNase was reduced and denatured (rdRNase) at room temperature for 18 h in the presence of 0.15 m dithiothreitol and 6 mguanidine HCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.6, before desalting on a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 0.01 n HCl. The concentration of the reduced and denatured (rd)RNase fractions were determined from its extinction coefficient 9200m−1 cm−1 at 275 nm. Fractions were stored under argon at −80 °C for up to 14 days before use. The reduced enzyme at a final concentration of 30 μm was diluted into 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 mm EDTA containing either 5 μm bovine protein-disulfide isomerase, purified GPIIb/IIIa at the concentrations indicated, 5 μm ovalbumin, or no isomerase. The extent of reactivation of rdRNase was monitored by removing aliquots at various time points and measuring recovered RNase activity, as described by Bonifaceet al. (14Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E. Science. 1990; 247: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A typical assay consisted of 1.4 μm RNase and 0.44 mm cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0. Changes in absorbance at 284 nm were monitored in a Unicam split beam spectrophotometer. Activity was expressed as a percentage of a native RNase control. To determine these parameters, the RNase refolding assay described above was used. Concentrations of reduced denatured RNase ranging from 7.5 to 75 μm was used in the absence of isomerase or in the presence of protein-disulfide isomerase (1.5 μm) or αIIbβ3 (1.5 μm). The amount of active RNase was determined by measuring the initial rate of recovery of activity over 1 min at 284 nm after a 48-h incubation. Plots of substrate concentration versus initial velocity were fit to Michaelis-Menten equation using Deltagraph to determineV max and K m. The uncatalyzed initial rates, determined in the absence of a source of isomerase activity, were subtracted from the catalyzed rates determined in the presence of PDI or integrin. A standard curve was generated from the initial rates of various concentrations (0–4 μm) of native RNase. A value for micromolar of RNase regenerated per minute for V max was then determined from the slope of this curve. 2 μg/ml of either purified αIIbβ3 or protein-disulfide isomerase in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 was precipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human PDI antibody (a kind gift of Dr. Eric Quemeneur, Center d'Etudes Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Precipitates were harvested with protein G beads. Samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Membrane was probed with 1:1000 dilution of anti-PDI antibody (rabbit anti-protein-disulfide isomerase polyclonal antibody from Stressgen Biotech Corp.) followed by 1:1500 dilution of Protein A peroxidase. Membrane was developed with ECL. Glass slides pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) or slides coated with fibrinogen (20 μg/ml) for 2 h were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1.5 h in a humidified staining tray. Gel filtered platelets prepared as described previously (19Mendelsohn M.E. Zhu Y. O'Neill S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11212-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were diluted to 2.0 × 105/ml and allowed to adhere to the poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 15 min and to the fibrinogen-coated slides for 30 min. Slides were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold methanol (7 min). Slides were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Primary antibodies (1:200 dilution for monoclonal anti-αIIbβ3 complex specific and 1:50 for polyclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase) were incubated for 45 min. 1:400 dilution of goat anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated IgG and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjugated IgG in Tris-buffered saline were incubated for 10 min. Slides were washed and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) before imaging on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 confocal microscope. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Bacitracin (0–100 μm) was added to each reaction mixture at 0 h. Examination of the reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase in the presence of this inhibitor was carried out as described above. The results are expressed as % of maximal recovery of the refolding activity of rdRNase observed in the absence of bacitracin. Analysis of the integrin cysteine patterns reveals that there are four highly conserved CRRs in each β-integrin subunit (6Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In Fig.1, we show the alignment of the second cysteine-rich repeat from human β3, with the same region from other β-integrins ranging from sponge and coral to mammalian sequences. There is 44–63% sequence identity within this region increasing to 100% for the β3 subunits. The cross-species homology index is further increased when conservative amino acid substitutions are accounted for, giving a value of 56–83% homology. The cysteine residues are 100% conserved. Similar homology scores are obtained when the first, third, or fourth CRRs are aligned. The four CRRs of β3 subunits from human, mouse, and dog are 90–94% identical. The alignments also reveal the presence of two motifs in each repeat: motif I has the sequence “GXCXCXXCXC” and is separated by 5–12 amino acids from motif II which has the sequence “GXXCXC”(Fig. 1 b). In all integrins, the first CRR is imperfect with its first cysteine replaced by an Phe, Met, Leu, or Tyr. Similarly, the fourth CRR is incomplete in all integrins, lacking the second motif but having a similar GXX CXXCXXC in β1, β3, and β5–8 integrins. β8 integrins are an exception to the integrin family and have very corrupted CRRs, the first CRR containing a CXXC, but not the flanking residues of motif I. It lacks motif II. The second CRR also lacks motif II. The third CRR lacks C2 in motif I but has a normal motif II. The fourth CRR, like all other integrins, lacks a true motif II. Motif I contains the active site sequence (CXXC) of the ubiquitous thiol modifying enzymes, PDI and thioredoxin. Each β-integrin subunit contains nine repeats of this CXXC tetrapeptide sequence; two in the amino-terminal region, one in each of the four CRRs, and two in the modified motif II of the fourth CRR. The final CXXC is immediately COOH-terminal to the fourth CRR. Other proteins that possess this motif include the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (20Koedam J.A. van den Brande J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 198: 1225-1231Google Scholar), chaperone molecules Erp61 and Erp72 (13Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A.

A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Their active sites are compared with the active site sequences of PDI and thioredoxin in Fig. 1 c. All these proteins, with the exception of von Willebrand factor, have demonstrable endogenous thiol isomerase activity. Moreover, the four CXXC repeats found in the four CRRs of the β-integrins have a glycine (G) residue in their most NH2-terminal “X” position in common with PDI and many of the other proteins known to have endogenous thiol isomerase activity (13Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E.

We therefore assessed the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3, for the presence of endogenous thiol isomerase activity. Platelet αIIbβ3 was purified as described by Phillips et al. (18Phillips D.R. Fitzgerald L. Parise L. Steiner B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 244-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Coomassie staining of reducing SDS-PAGE gels shows the presence of pure protein bands corresponding to the β3 subunit and the heavy chain of αIIbat 95 and 115 kDa, respectively. The light chain of αIIbis observed at 25 kDa. There is no evidence for any additional co-purifying or contaminating proteins in this preparation (Fig.2 a). The ability of the purified αIIbβ3 to express thiol isomerase activity was determined in an assay described by Pigiet et al. (21Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Purified αIIbβ3 (15 μm) was shown to have equivalent thiol isomerase capacity to PDI (5 μm). In contrast, ovalbumin, a cysteine-rich protein that lacks a CXXC motif, had no isomerase activity above baseline levels when compared with an uncatalyzed reaction (Fig.2 b). This activity in αIIbβ3 was shown to be saturable and both time- and concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 c). To ascertain that the activity observed in these assays was not due to contaminating or co-purifying platelet PDI, the purified integrin preparation was probed for the presence of PDI immune-reactive proteins. Platelet PDI has a molecular mass of 57 kDa and is readily seen in immunoblot analysis of platelet lysates. Only one isoform of PDI is identified in human platelets as determined by immunoblotting. Similarly, platelet cDNA scanning with degenerate primers to conserved regions of published PDI shows evidence for only one platelet isoform of PDI in agreement with Chen et al. (22Chen K. Detwiler T.C. Essex D.W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (data not shown). PDI is not apparent in Coomassie-stained gels or in Western blots of purified αIIbβ3, nor could it be immunoprecipitated from large volumes of the purified integrin (Fig. 2 d). From these studies, we conclude that our integrin preparation is devoid of contaminating platelet PDI. Furthermore, in indirect immnuofluoresence studies it was found that, regardless of the activation state of the platelet, PDI did not colocalize with αIIbβ3 (Fig.3). Activated platelets, which spread on a fibrinogen-coated surface, or resting platelets, immobilized on poly-l-lysine, stain for both αIIbβ3 and for PDI. However, these proteins do not co-localize at any stage as shown in the overlay images (Fig. 3,D and H) where colocalization would be detected by the appearance of yellow pixels.Figure 3αIIbβ3and protein-disulfide isomerase do not co-localize in adhered platelets. Gel filtered platelets were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine (PLL, A-D) or fibrinogen (Fg, E-H)-coated slides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These were dual stained for αIIbβ3 using a monoclonal antibody (CD41a; B and F) which is complex specific and for protein-disulfide isomerase (anti-PDI; C andG) using a polyclonal antibody along with the appropriately labeled Alexa secondary antibodies. It was observed that resting platelets were obtained on the poly-l-lysine slides and spread or “activated” platelets on the fibrinogen-coated slides using differential interference contrast (DIC) mode (A and E). When these images were overlaid the absence of yellow pixels indicates that αIIbβ3 did not co-localize with protein-disulfide isomerase (D and H). Images were made on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 confocal microscope with a × 40 oil-immersion lens (1.4 n/a). Data shown is representative ofn = 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A direct comparison of the abilities of αIIbβ3 and protein-disulfide isomerase to catalyze the reactivation of rdRNase was made by determining values for the k cat and K m of each protein from Michaelis-Menten plots of kinetic data (Fig.4 and TableI). Both proteins showed typical equilibrium kinetics. The affinity (K m) of the integrin for its substrate (RNase) is less for αIIbβ3 than for PDI although the catalytic capacity of the enzymes (k cat) is equivalent. The value reported here for the K m of PDI (24.7 μm) is identical to that reported by Langenbach and Sottile (16Langenbach K.J. Sottile J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7032-7038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in their comparative study of the intrinsic isomerase activity of PDI and fibronectin. In contrast, however, to the thiol isomerase activity of fibronectin, we show that the catalytic capacity (k cat) of αIIbβ3 is equivalent to that of PDI (2.17 × 10−4 mol min−1/μm enzyme and 2.45 × 10−4 mol min−1/μm enzyme, respectively). Thus, the intrinsic thiol isomerase activity within αIIbβ3 is potent and has high capacitance, equal to that observed in PDI. The k cat values obtained in this study are different to those obtained by Langenbach and Sottile (16Langenbach K.J. Sottile J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7032-7038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the fact that we took into consideration the contribution of spontaneous refolding of rdRNase and subtracted this away from the catalyzed reaction in our studies.Table IEnzymatic parameters of αIIbβ3 and PDIK mk catk cat/K mμmμmmin −1 / μmenzymeμm −1 min −1αIIbβ336.622.17 × 10−45.93 × 10−6PDI24.722.45 × 10−49.91 × 10−6The standard RNase refolding assay was performed using 7.5–75 μm rdRNase in the presence of 1.5 μm PDI or 1.5 μm αIIbβ3.

Open table in a new tab The standard RNase refolding assay was performed using 7.5–75 μm rdRNase in the presence of 1.5 μm PDI or 1.5 μm αIIbβ3. Analysis of Michaelis-Menten data was performed using the curve-fitting programs of DeltaGraph 4.0. Values are derived from the mean data from four separate experiments performed in duplicate. To examine the pharmacological profile of this activity, we looked at the effects of bacitracin, a known inhibitor of protein-disulfide isomerase (23Essex D.W. Li M. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bacitracin dose dependently inhibited the isomerase activity of both PDI and αIIbβ3 (Fig.5). The IC50 value is 11 μm for αIIbβ3 and 4 μm for PDI. Maximal inhibition of αIIbβ3 activity is observed at 100 μm bacitracin. Moreover, in vitro incubation of platelets with bacitracin results in a dose-dependent abolition of platelet aggregation to all platelet agonists and an inhibition of fibrinogen binding (data not shown). Thus, the endogenous thiol isomerase activity of the platelet integrin can be inhibited by the pharmacological agent, bacitracin, resulting in an inhibition of functional responses in the platelet. The isomerase activity of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 can also be regulated by divalent cations. αIIbβ3 forms a calcium-dependent heterodimer on the platelet surface and both subunits contain calcium-binding motifs. Divalent cations are required for ligand recognition and influence the affinity of interactions with the integrin receptor (24Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L.Y. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, extracellular divalent cations regulate integrin function by controlling the integrin ligand binding events (25Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of calcium on the thiol isomerase activity of αIIbβ3. The observed isomerase activity in αIIbβ3 occurs in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA (1 mm). Removal of this EDTA causes the αIIbβ3 to loose the ability to reactivate rdRNase while the enzymatic activity of PDI is unaffected by the presence or absence of EDTA (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the isomerase activity associated with αIIbβ3 is dependent upon an EDTA-stabilized conformation of the integrin. This is supported by the observation that calcium is displaced from the integrin as the complex between receptor and ligand becomes stabilized (26D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EDTA has been demonstrated to induce a high affinity, activated conformation in αIIbβ3 (27Kouns W.C. Wall C.D. White M.M. Fox C.F. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20594-20601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other integrins (28Bazzoni G. Shih D.T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) equivalent to that induced by agonists or ligand mimetics. A similar EDTA-stabilized active conformation is observed in thrombospondin permitting the exposure of an RGD sequence necessary for ligand binding (29Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. Milev Y. Essex D.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in order to determine if this enzymatic activity is a common property of integrins, we examined commercial preparations of purified αvβ3 and α5β1for the presence of endogenous thiol isomerase activity. Fig.7 shows that the vitronectin receptor, αvβ3 has thiol isomerase activity. The activity of the αvβ3 is greater than that of αIIbβ3. This data suggests that the activity does indeed reside in the common β3 integrin subunit. The leukocyte fibronectin receptor, α5β1, also expresses thiol enzymatic activity but, under the conditions tested, its potency appears less than that of the β3 integrins. It may be that the conditions of time, temperature, pH, and Ca2+concentrations optimized for αIIbβ3 are not ideal for α5β1. The distinct potencies of the different integrins may suggest that the enzymatic activity of each integrin is regulated by their individual α-subunits, or that each may operate under discrete optimal conditions not addressed in this study. The contribution of thiol bonds to the integrin structure and function has been implied by many other groups (7Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 22: 29-38Google Scholar, 30Yan B. Hu D.D.

Activation of glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) signaling maintains the integrity of the intestinal epithelial mucosa via regulation of crypt cell proliferation. Because GLP-2 decreases mortality and reduces intestinal apoptosis in rodents after experimental injury, we examined whether GLP-2R signaling directly modifies the cellular response to external injury. We show here that activation of GLP-2R signaling inhibits cycloheximide-induced apoptosis in baby hamster kidney fibroblasts expressing a transfected GLP-2 receptor. GLP-2 reduced DNA fragmentation and improved cell survival, in association with reduced activation of caspase-3 and decreased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and reduced caspase-8 and caspase-9-like activities. Both GLP-2 and forskolin reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and decreased the cycloheximide-induced cleavage of caspase-3 in the presence or absence of the PKA inhibitor H-89. Similarly, GLP-2 increased cell survival following cycloheximide in the presence of the kinase inhibitors PD98054 and LY294002. These findings provide evidence that signaling through G protein-coupled receptors of the glucagon superfamily is directly linked to regulation of apoptosis and suggest the existence of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-independent pathway coupling GLP-2R signaling to caspase inhibition and cell survival."

Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Each annexin consists of a conserved core domain with four or eight repeats (70 amino acids) and a nonconserved, short, NH2-terminal domain. More than 10 different family members, several of which exist as multiple isoforms, have been described in higher vertebrates (2Morgan R.O. Fernandez M.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since annexins are expressed in many tissues and are located in the same cellular compartments, the understanding of the distinct physiological role of each annexin still remains elusive (1Gerke V.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicate a potential role for annexin VI in the endocytic pathways of polarized and nonpolarized cells. In support of this hypothesis, annexin VI has been found to bind β-spectrin at the cell surface, which in turn recruits and activates a calpain-like protease. This cascade of events seems to open the actin-cortical cytoskeleton to facilitate the initial steps of endocytosis (16Lin H.C. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The complexity of these interactions has recently been pointed out by Michaely and co-workers (18Michaely P. Kamal A. Anderson R.G.W. Bennett V. J. Biol.

However, the possible involvement of annexin VI in fusion events in the late endocytic pathway is not completely understood (15Pons M. Ihrke G. Koch S. Biermer M. Pol A. Grewal T. Jäckle S.

In order to investigate the influence of annexin VI on endocytic processes, we studied the effect of overexpression of annexin VI in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1cells on LDL and transferrin (Tf) uptake and intracellular processing. Here we report that parallel overexpression of annexin VI and the LDL receptor increases the internalization and degradation of LDL. When cotransfected with the Tf receptor, annexin VI moderately stimulates endocytosis but has no effect on the recycling of Tf. In contrast, overexpression of annexin II does not facilitate a stimulatory effect on the endocytosis of both ligands. Cellular subfractionation and immunofluorescence analysis suggest that annexin VI enters the prelysosomal compartment while being associated with LDL-containing endocytic vesicles. These findings indicate that intracellular stores of annexin VI have the ability to respond to so far unknown signals (e.g. ligand, cytokines, calcium) (21Fleet A. Ashworth R. Kubista H. Edwards H.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.3-1.58Google Scholar). The expression vectors encoding the human LDL receptor (pCMVhLDLR), human Tf receptor (pcD-TFR) (31McClelland A. Kuhn L.C. Ruddle F.H. Cell. 1984; 39: 267-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and human Rab5 (mRab5pF) (32Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. F. Schnieders and Dr. T. Jentsch (University of Hamburg). The expression vector for human annexin II (pCMV5-EX-AII) (33Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. V. Gerke. β-Galactosidase encoding pCMVSPORT-βGal was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA used for transfections was purified with the plasmid purification kit from Qiagen. 2–3 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and the FUGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Control cells were transfected with pCMVSPORT-βGal. For cotransfections, 0.5 μg of each plasmid was used. In these experiments, LDLR- and Tf receptor-transfected cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase-, annexin VI-, annexin II-, or Rab5-encoding plasmids. Expression of β-galactosidase in 10–25% of cells was confirmed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining, and coexpression of plasmids in transfected cells was confirmed by double immunofluorescence (data not shown). To generate stable annexin VI-overexpresing cells, 1 × 106 CHO cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNAanx6 and the FUGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). G418 (1 mg/ml) was added 24 h after transfection, and 2 weeks after transfection G418-resistant colonies were isolated and examined for expression of annexin VI by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. For Western blotting, cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, and 80 mm NaCl. 50 μg of cell protein or 500 ng of purified annexin VI were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to ProtranR Nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schüll). Annexin VI was detected using polyclonal sheep (Abimed) and three different rabbit anti-annexin VI antibodies. Recombinant human LDL receptor expression was analyzed with the rabbit anti-LDLR antibody. Annexin II, Rab5 (data not shown), Rab4, and dynamin expression was confirmed with the antibodies described above. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the reaction product was finally detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LDL was radiolabeled with [125I]Iodine by the iodine monochloride method (35McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Transferrin and HRP were iodinated by the IODO-GEN method (36Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1978; 80: 849-857Google Scholar). Reproducibly 93–97% of the radiolabeled LDL was trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. The protein content of LDL in five different labeled preparations was 0.6 ± 0.1 mg/ml, and the specific radioactivity was 180–300 cpm/ng. The specific radioactivity of Tf in three different preparations was 250–300 cpm/ng, and the specific radioactivity of HRP was 80–100 cpm/ng. To determine the internalization of 125I-LDL, 2–3 × 105 CHO cells were washed with PBS 24 h after transfection and preincubated with serum-free medium (Ham's F-12, 1% BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were chilled on ice, and125I-LDL was added at 4–5 μg/ml (in triplicate). Cells were then incubated for 60 min or 24 h at 37 °C. 50-fold excess of unlabeled LDL was added to every third sample prior to the incubation to determine nonspecific uptake of 125I-LDL. After internalization, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and subsequently with PBS/heparin (20 units/ml) to remove surface-bound LDL. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured. An aliquot of the cell lysate was used to determine the cell protein concentration (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For endocytosis of 125I-Tf and 125I-HRP, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in Ham's F-12, 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were chilled on ice, and 125I-Tf (2–3 μg/ml) or 125I-HRP (5 μg/ml) was added (in triplicate). A 50-fold excess of unlabeled Tf was added to every third sample. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for various times. To stop internalization, cells were put on ice, and the medium was removed. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS followed by a mild acid wash for 125I-Tf-incubated cells as described earlier (38Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1261-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. The radioactivity and protein concentration were determined. Cells were incubated with 125I-LDL as described above for 2, 6, or 24 h at 37 °C. At each time point, 100 μl of medium was removed, and 3 m ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%. The sample was vortexed vigorously and incubated for 10 min on ice. After the addition of 250 μl of 0.7 m AgNO3 to remove free iodine (39Kim M.J. Dawes J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 108: 5-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the sample was vortexed again and then centrifuged, and the amount of radioactivity in the remaining supernatant was determined. Cell lysates for protein concentration were prepared as described above. Cells were incubated with 125I-Tf for 60 min at 37 °C as described above. A 50-fold excess of unlabeled Tf was added to every third sample prior to the incubation. After incubation cells were put on ice, the medium was removed, and cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then incubated in Ham's F-12, 1% BSA at 37 °C, and the radioactivity released in the medium was collected at various times. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH to determine cell protein concentration and the amount of 125I-Tf remaining in the cells. 1 × 105 cells were grown on chamberslides (Nunc). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For DiI-LDL uptake experiments, the transfected cells were preincubated with DiI-LDL (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with antibodies (15Pons M. Ihrke G. Koch S. Biermer M. Pol A. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Enrich C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To visualize the primary antibodies, we used immune adsorbed Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-rabbit, donkey anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments, or donkey anti-sheep F(ab′)2 fragments. Samples were washed extensively with PBS, and finally the chamberslides were mounted with Mowiol®. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg) instrument based on an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope interfaced with an argon-krypton laser adjusted at 488 and 568 nm. The images were converted to TIFF format and processed with Corel Photo-Paint 7. Early endosomes were prepared according to the protocol described by Gorvel et al. (40Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4–6 × 107 CHOanx6 cells were used for each gradient. To label early or late endosomes, radiolabeled LDL was endocytosed for 5 or 120 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then preincubated with Ham's F-12, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated in Ham's F-12, 10 mm Hepes containing 10–20 μg/ml 125I-LDL plus 0.5 mg/ml cold LDL for 5 or 120 min at 37 °C. Cells were put on ice, washed two times with cold PBS, 0.5% BSA, and collected in homogenization buffer (250 mmsucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors). The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer, and homogenized by 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle. Complete homogenization was confirmed under the phase microscope. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 3400 cpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The postnuclear supernatant was brought to a final 40.2% sucrose (w/v) concentration by adding 62% sucrose (3 mmimidazole, pH 7.4) to postnuclear supernatant and loaded at the bottom of an SW40 centrifugation tube (Beckman Ultraclear). Then 35% sucrose, 25% sucrose, and finally homogenization buffer were poured stepwise on top of the postnuclear supernatant. The gradient was centrifuged for 90 min at 35,000 rpm, 4 °C in a swing out Beckman SW40 rotor. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the radioactivity was determined. Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity as described (41Fischer H.D. Gonzalez-Noriega A. Sly W.S. Morré D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9608-9615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to determine the distribution of annexin VI, Rab4, and dynamin by Western blotting. To study the role of annexin VI in the endocytic pathways, rat annexin VI was overexpressed in CHO cells. These cells contain only low amounts of endogenous annexin VI as judged by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence with four different annexin VI antibodies. Fig. 1 shows a representative Western blot demonstrating increased annexin VI expression in transfected cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and5) compared with endogenous annexin VI levels in β-galactosidase-transfected controls (lanes 1and 4; approximately 10–15-fold, compare lanes 4 and 5) using different antibodies. All four antibodies used positively recognize purified bovine liver annexin VI (Fig. 1, lane 3) and rat hepatocytic endosomal annexin VI (data not shown). In all experiments, the efficiency of transfection was approximately 10–25% of the cells. Transient or stable transfected annexin VI overexpressing cells showed morphological (actin-cytoskeleton, data not shown) and functional features (receptor-mediated endocytosis, see below) comparable with the wild type CHO cells. To investigate the role of annexin VI in the endocytotic pathway of Tf, we determined the uptake and recycling (Fig.2 A) of radiolabeled Tf in transiently annexin VI-overexpressing CHO cells. Rab5, a member of the Rab protein family that has been demonstrated to stimulate receptor-mediated endocytosis (32Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 42Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), served as a positive control. Cells transfected only with annexin VI, annexin II, or Rab5 did not demonstrate a significant alteration of Tf internalization (data not shown). As expected (32Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 42Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), cells coexpressing Rab5 together with the Tf receptor endocytosed Tf slightly faster than Tf receptor-expressing controls. Cotransfection of annexin II together with the Tf receptor did not alter endocytosis of transferrin compared with Tf receptor-transfected cells. Coexpression of annexin VI and the Tf receptor revealed a modest stimulatory effect on Tf internalization (1.5–1.8-fold) at the various time points (5–60 min) (data not shown). Subsequently, the recycling of Tf in controls and annexin VI-transfected cells was examined. Overexpression of annexin VI, annexin II, and Rab5 did not affect Tf recycling (data not shown). As observed by others (32Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), more than 40% of internalized Tf was recycled in Tf receptor-overexpressing cells after 30 min (Fig. 2 A). In cells cotransfected with annexin VI and Tf receptor, the recycling of Tf was not significantly increased compared with Tf receptor-transfected controls (p > 0.05 fort = 20, 30 min; Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained with Rab5 and annexin II, indicating that none of those proteins significantly affected the rates of recycling of transferrin (Fig. 2 A). In order to identify the intracellular localization of annexin VI and Tf receptor, we then performed immunofluorescence experiments of cells cotransfected with annexin VI and the human transferrin receptor. As expected, overexpression of the Tf receptor shows some localization at the cell surface, as well as a punctate staining of recycling vesicles with a more intense labeling in the perinuclear Tf recycling compartment (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, overexpression of annexin VI results in a wide diffuse staining throughout the cell. Although annexin VI and the Tf receptor partially colocalize within the cell, annexin VI is almost excluded from the recycling compartment of the Tf receptor at the perinuclear region (Fig. 2 B). These results correlate with the functional analysis of Tf recycling in these cells (Fig. 2 A) and further suggest that annexin VI is not involved in the trafficking of Tf recycling. The effect of overexpression of annexin VI on the uptake (Fig. 3) and degradation (Fig. 4) of LDL was studied. We first determined the accumulation of radiolabeled LDL in transiently annexin VI-overexpressing CHO cells (data not shown). Rab5 served again as a positive control (32Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Overexpression of annexin VI or Rab5 alone did not result in a significant accumulation of 125I-LDL compared with the control cells. Therefore, cotransfection of the above proteins together with the human LDL receptor was performed, and the accumulation of 125I-LDL after 24 h"

However, the effects of Aβ on endogenous apoE and apoJ levels and the potential role of apoE receptors in astrocyte activation have not been addressed. Three activating stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, dibutyryl cAMP, and aged Aβ 1–42) were used to induce activation of rat astrocyte cultures, as assessed by changes in morphology and an increase in interleukin-1β. However, only Aβ also induced ∼50% reduction in the amount of released apoE and apoJ and an 8-fold increase in the levels of cell-associated apoE and apoJ. Experiments using two concentrations of receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of apoE receptors with a differential affinity for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein (LRP), suggest that LRP mediates Aβ-induced astrocyte activation, whereas LDLR mediates the Aβ-induced changes in apoE levels. Receptor-associated protein had no effect on apoJ levels or on activation by either dibutyryl cAMP or lipopolysaccharide. These data suggest that apoE receptors translate the presence of extracellular Aβ into cellular responses, both initiating and modulating the inflammatory response induced by Aβ.

Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR-related protein apolipoprotein E and J interleukin receptor-associated protein phosphate-buffered saline lipopolysaccharide dibutyryl cyclic AMP glial fibrillary acidic protein Large numbers of activated astrocytes and microglia are a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),1sustained brain trauma, vascular insufficiency, AIDS, Down's syndrome, and Pick's disease (1Griffin W.S.T.

In AD brain, activated glia are closely associated with amyloid plaques. Although the precise relationship between amyloid plaques and dementia remains unclear, genetic and experimental evidence suggests that β-amyloid (Aβ) plays a critical role in AD. Aβ may initiate or exacerbate neuropathology by inducing glial activation, thereby promoting the release of inflammatory response compounds, including cytokines, nitric oxide, and other potentially neurotoxic agents. Glia, in particular astrocytes, are the primary cell type in the central nervous system that synthesize apoE, whereas apoJ is expressed by glia and neurons (reviewed in Ref. 2LaDu M.J. Reardon C.A.

In the periphery, apoE-containing lipoproteins participate in lipid and cholesterol transport, including the delivery of lipoprotein constituents to tissues expressing lipoprotein receptors that recognize apoE as a ligand. This process may also be operating in the parenchyma of the brain because neural cells express a variety of apoE receptors in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family (4Christie R.H.

The role of apoJ in lipid transport in both the periphery and within the central nervous system is less clear, and megalin/LRP2, the only known receptor for mammalian apoJ, appears to be expressed only by ependymal and endothelial cells in the brain (8Kounnas M.Z.

Several lines of evidence suggest that apoE and apoJ may be involved in neural homeostasis beyond their capacity to transport lipid.

In humans, apoE exists as three naturally occurring isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), and apoE4 is a risk factor for AD via a mechanism as yet unknown.

Third, LRP may play a role in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, because LRP has been shown to mediate the endocytosis of a secreted form of amyloid precursor protein (34Kounnas M.Z.

Fourth, immunoreactivity for LRP and a number of its ligands including apoE and α2-macroglobulin is found associated with senile plaques (30Rebeck G.W. Harr S.D. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic evidence suggests that polymorphisms in either LRP or α2-macroglobulin increase the risk of late onset familial AD (35Kang D.E. Saitoh T. Chen X. Xia Y. Masliah E. Hansen L.A.

Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) that aged preparations of Aβ 1–42 induce activation of primary rat astrocyte cultures, as measured by changes in morphology and an increase in IL-1β mRNA. This activation is inhibited by the addition of exogenous apoE-containing particles (38Hu J. LaDu M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the effects of Aβ-induced astrocyte activation on endogenous apolipoproteins have not been reported. The current experiments were designed to determine whether astrocyte activation altered the expression of endogenous apoE and apoJ. In addition, the role of apoE receptors in mediating Aβ-induced changes in astrocytes is unknown. By immunostaining, the activated astrocytes used for the present experiments express both the LDLR and LRP, consistent with previous observations (6Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 29Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1995; 37: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the effects mediated by the LDLR and LRP, we utilized receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist with different binding affinities for these two receptors (39Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). We report here that Aβ induced a dramatic increase in endogenous apoE and apoJ levels in activated astrocytes and that RAP abolished the Aβ-induced changes in astrocyte activation and apoE levels but had no effect on changes in apoJ. Our data suggest that LRP mediates Aβ-induced astrocyte activation, whereas the LDLR mediates the Aβ-induced changes in apoE levels. The Aβ 1–42 peptide was obtained from California Peptide Research, Inc. (Napa, CA) or from Dr. Charles Glabe (University of California at Irvine). The peptide was dissolved in 10 mm HCl to make a 2 mm stock solution and then diluted 1:20 into PBS. This 0.1 mm Aβ solution was stored at room temperature for 48 h before being added to the cells at a final Aβ concentration of 10 μm. Aβ 1–42 aged according to this protocol is a mixture of fibrils and soluble globular aggregates, and is active to astrocytes (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP), heparin, and heparan sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 1–2-day-old neonatal rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) as described previously (41Hu J. Castets F. Guevara J.L. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2543-2547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). After 11 days in culture, cells were trypsinized and replated into 100-mm tissue culture plates at a density of ∼6 × 105 cells/plate. After growing to confluency, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 105cells/well. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove serum and then incubated in α-minimum essential medium containing N2 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 24–48 h before treatment. As previously reported (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 41Hu J. Castets F. Guevara J.L. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2543-2547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) these tertiary cultures are ∼95–98% astrocytes, with only ∼2–5% microglial cells. Cells were treated with aged Aβ 1–42 (10 μm), dbcAMP (1 mm), LPS (10 μg/ml), or control buffer for the desired length of time. RAP was generated as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified as described previously (42Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, RAP was dialyzed against culture medium, as was a comparable molar concentration of bovine serum albumin to serve as a control. For experiments utilizing RAP, it was added to the cells 1 h before Aβ treatment. The bovine serum albumin-only control had no effect on the activation state of the cells in either the presence or the absence of Aβ (data not shown). For experiments utilizing heparin or heparan sulfate, it was added to cells 1 h before Aβ treatment. Heparin and heparan sulfate were used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and 1 μm, respectively (43Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell morphology was examined and morphological activation quantified as described previously (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were considered activated if they had a process greater in length than the diameter of the cell body. After treatment of cells for the desired length of time, conditioned medium was removed and stored at −20 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.05% bromphenol blue). Lysates were briefly sonicated and stored at −20 °C until Western analysis was performed. Western blotting of lysates and conditioned media was performed as described previously (3LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens S.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J.

The primary antibodies used were: goat anti-rat IL-1β (1:1000 dilution, R & D Systems, Inc), monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:108 dilution, Sigma), sheep anti-rat apoJ (1:3000 dilution, Quidel), and rabbit anti-rat apoE (1:5000 dilution) prepared using apoE purified from rat plasma as immunogen. Total RNA was isolated, and slot blots were run as described previously (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The rat apoE probe corresponds to nucleotides 396–724 and was obtained from pALE (45McLean J.W. Fukazawa C. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8993-9000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between two groups of data was analyzed with variance F tests, and the means were analyzed with Student's t test. Statistical significance was established at a level of p < 0.05. To determine the relationship between astrocyte activation and apolipoprotein levels, we first examined three standard activating stimuli for their ability to activate cultured rat astrocytes. Astrocytes were treated with Aβ 1–42 (10 μm), dbcAMP (1 mm), LPS (10 μg/ml), or PBS control buffer, and activation was assessed by morphology. As shown in Fig. 1 A, control cells showed the typical morphological features of quiescent astrocytes in culture, being a monolayer of flat and polygonal-shaped cells. In contrast, incubation of cells with Aβ, dbcAMP, or LPS for 12 h induced a marked change in cell morphology. Astrocytes became stellate-shaped, with a more spherical and phase bright cell soma and two or more processes. Quantitation of the morphological activation (Fig.1 B) showed a significant activation by all three stimulating agents. This morphological alteration was time-dependent, with activation evident by 6 h and reaching a peak at 12 h after addition of the stimuli (data not shown), as we previously reported for Aβ 1–42 (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 38Hu J. LaDu M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to changes in morphology, glial activation was assessed by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have demonstrated previously that treatment of astrocyte cultures with Aβ 1–42 induces an increase in IL-1β mRNA levels (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For the present study, we examined the levels of cell-associated IL-1β (the proIL-1β form of the protein can be detected in cell lysates). As shown in Fig.1 C, cells treated with Aβ, dbcAMP, or LPS exhibited an increase in proIL-1β levels compared with PBS-treated cells. In agreement with our previous report (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the GFAP levels did not change upon activation (Fig. 1 C). The stimulation of IL-1β protein levels peaked at 12 h after treatment and gradually decreased by 48 h (data not shown). These data demonstrate that cultured rat astrocytes can be activated by Aβ, dbcAMP, and LPS. To assess the effects of astrocyte activation on endogenous apoE and apoJ, cells were treated with the three activating stimuli or control buffer for 12 h, and the levels of apoE and apoJ protein in conditioned medium and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots. Under reducing conditions, apoE appears as ∼35-kDa monomer. ApoJ is synthesized as an ∼80-kDa holo-protein that is cleaved during processing to two 40-kDa subunits that reassociate via disulfide bonding. Thus, the 80-kDa apoJ-immunoreactive band seen on gels represents primarily uncleaved holo-protein, because the cysteine-linked subunits are resolved to the 40-kDa species under the reducing conditions of the gel. It is interesting to note the presence of the 80-kDa species in the medium, suggesting that at least a portion of the apoJ is secreted in an uncleaved form. For the purposes of this study, however, the reported changes in apoJ protein refer to the amount of the 40-kDa subunit. Aβ induced a robust increase in the levels of cell-associated apoE and apoJ (Fig. 2, A andB). The mean levels of cell-associated apoE and apoJ from four independent experiments were approximately 8-fold higher in Aβ-treated cells relative to control cells. In contrast to the large Aβ-induced increase in cell-associated apoE and apoJ, the levels of apoE and apoJ in conditioned medium decreased after treatment of cells with Aβ. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), the levels of apoE and apoJ in conditioned medium from Aβ-treated cells decreased by a mean of 35% (apoE) and 60% (apoJ) relative to control conditioned medium. Neither dbcAMP nor LPS altered the levels of cell-associated apoE and apoJ (Fig. 2, A and B) or the levels of apoE in the conditioned medium (Fig.2 C). However, there was an increase in apoJ levels in conditioned medium from LPS-treated cells (Fig. 2 D). As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2 D, LPS treatment consistently resulted in a number of immunoreactive bands in addition to the apoJ subunits and holo-protein. This pattern was not seen with other activating stimuli, and this observation was not pursued further as part of this study.Figure 1Activation of cultured astrocytes by Aβ 1–42, dbcAMP , or LPS.

As shown in Fig. 3, there was no difference in apoE or apoJ mRNA levels, expressed relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. This suggests that Aβ does not induce the accumulation of cell-associated apoE via an increase in transcription. However, we did observe the expected Aβ-induced increase in IL-1β mRNA levels, as we previously reported (37Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). By immunostaining, these activated astrocytes express both the LDLR and LRP (data not shown), consistent with the previous observations summarized above that these are the two primary members of the LDLR family that are expressed by activated astrocytes (4Christie R.H.

In the present study, we demonstrate that convulxin is a considerably more powerful agonist than collagen or the GPVI-selective collagen-related peptide (CRP). Confirmation that the response to convulxin is mediated solely via Syk was provided by studies on Syk-deficient platelets. The increase in phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is associated with marked increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream proteins including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SLP-76, and PLCγ2. The transmembrane adapter LAT coprecipitates with SLP-76 and PLCγ2, as well as with a number of other adapter proteins, some of which have not been previously described in platelets, including Cbl, Grb2, Gads, and SKAP-HOM. Gads is constitutively associated with SLP-76 and is probably the protein bridging its association with LAT. There was no detectable association between Grb2 and SLP-76 in control or stimulated cells, suggesting that the interaction of LAT with Grb2 is present in a separate complex to that of LAT-Gads-SLP-76. These results show that the trimeric convulxin stimulates a much greater phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain and subsequent downstream responses relative to CRP and collagen, presumably because of its ability to cause a greater degree of cross-linking of GPVI.

It is generally accepted that α2β1 is the major receptor supporting adhesion of platelets to collagen, while GPVI mediates activation. Evidence for this includes the observation that the GPVI-selective agonists collagen-related peptide (CRP) and convulxin are powerful platelet agonists, yet do not bind α2β1. GPVI is associated with the Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain in the membrane (2Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of GPVI induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic tail of FcR γ-chain leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated cascade that involves Syk and PLCγ2 (4Watson S.P.

The sequence of events that underlie phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and subsequent platelet activation, however, are not established.

LAT is a 36–38 kDa integral membrane adapter protein that was first identified in T cells (8Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Activation of ZAP-70 through the T cell receptor is believed to phosphorylate LAT resulting in subsequent recruitment of Grb2, PLCγ1, and other signaling molecules to the plasma membrane. LAT contains nine tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain that are conserved between the murine and human sequences, five of which are surrounded by the optimal binding sequence for binding to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Grb2 (9Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The majority of LAT, a fraction of PLCγ1, and several other signaling molecules are present in glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) in activated T cells. It is proposed that LAT is central to T cell activation, serving as a novel linker molecule targeting key proteins to membrane microdomains for regulated signaling. SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) is a cytoplasmic adapter protein that was initially identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from stimulated T cells that associates with the SH3 domain of the Grb2 adapter in vitro (10Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). SLP-76 has a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain that binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, a central proline-rich region that associates with Grb2 and three N-terminal tyrosine residues, which lie within the optimal binding sequence of the GTP exchange factor, Vav (11Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretsky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SLP-76 is believed to be a substrate for ZAP-70 in stimulated T cells, with phosphorylation taking place on two of the three tyrosines that fall within the optimal sequence for association with Vav (12Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16212-16306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SLP-76 has been shown to associate with Vav in stimulated T cells through this region and also with the adapter SLAP-130 (SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa), which binds to its SH2 domain (12Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16212-16306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SLP-76 is essential for activation of PLCγ1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase in stimulated T cells (14Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). LAT and SLP-76 play central roles in signaling by GPVI in platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 is substantially reduced in LAT-deficient and SLP-76-deficient platelets, and there is a corresponding inhibition of platelet activation (5Gross B. Lee J.R. Clements J.L. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5963-5971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Clements J.L.

Both adapters are thought to play critical roles in recruiting PLCγ2 to the membrane. LAT also associates with the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in platelets stimulated by GPVI, suggesting that it lies upstream of the PI 3-kinase pathway (15Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G.J. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An association between SLP-76 and the adapter SLAP-130 in platelets has been also reported (5Gross B. Lee J.R. Clements J.L. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5963-5971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, several new adapter proteins have been cloned and shown to become incorporated into intracellular complexes following T cell receptor activation. SKAP-HOM (SKAP55 homologue), a homologue of SKAP55 (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa), was identified as a T cell adapter that binds specifically with the Fyn SH2 domain in vitro (16Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SKAP-HOM has one pleckstrin homology and one SH3 domain. SKAP-HOM also associates with SLAP130 in activated T cells, although a complex of SKAP-HOM, SLAP-130, and SLP-76 has not been reported (16Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Marie-Cardine A. Hendricks-Taylor R. Boerth N., H., Z. Schraver B. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol.

A second adapter protein, Gads (Grb2-related adapter downstream ofShc), (also known as Grpl (Grb2-relatedprotein of the lymphoid system) and Grf40 (Grb2 family member of 40 kDa)) is a Grb2-related protein originally identified on the basis of its interaction with the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the adapter Shc (18Liu S.K.

Recent studies revealed that Gads is expressed strictly in hematopoietic cells and that SLP-76 and LAT interact with Gads through their SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively, following cross-linking of the T cell receptor (18Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effects of the GPVI-selective snake venom toxin, convulxin, on tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets. Convulxin is a C-type lectin, made of two subunits, α and β, linked by disulfide bridges forming an α3β3 complex (21Francischetti Ivo M.B. Saliou B. Lecduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We show that convulxin is a considerably more powerful agonist at GPVI than collagen or CRP, inducing a much greater degree of tyrosine phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. We also present data to support a critical role of LAT in GPVI-mediated signaling in platelets by demonstrating that it associates with several proteins including Gads and SKAP-HOM during platelet activation via convulxin. LAT appears to be a central adapter protein linking the GPVI-FcR γ-chain-Syk pathway to the regulation of a number of downstream pathways. CRP (GCP*(GPP)10GCP*G, using single-letter amino acid code, where P* represents hydroxyproline) was cross-linked via cysteine residues as described previously (22Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); CRP was kindly donated by Drs. M. Barnes, G. Knight, and R. Farndale (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK). Convulxin was purified from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus according to published procedures (21Francischetti Ivo M.B.

Purified convulxin gave similar results to the crude venom. Horm-Chemie collagen (collagen fibers from equine tendon) was purchased from Nycomed (Munich, Germany). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, anti-LAT polyclonal antibody, anti-FcR γ-chain mAb, and polyclonal anti-SLAP130 rabbit serum were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (TCS Biological Ltd., Botolph Claydon, UK). SLP-76 polyclonal antibody was kindly donated by Dr. Gary Koretzky (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Anti-Gads polyclonal antibody and anti-SKAP-HOM mAb were previously described (16Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B.

Human blood was taken from drug-free volunteers on the day of an experiment using acidic citrate dextrose (120 mmol/liter sodium citrate, 110 mmol/liter glucose, 80 mmol/liter citric acid). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 20 min, and platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml). Platelets were resuspended in a modified Tyrode's-Hepes buffer (134 mmNaCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.3) in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml), recentrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in the above buffer containing 1 mm EGTA and 10 μm indomethacin to a density of 5 × 108cells/ml. Mouse platelets were prepared as described previously (24Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Platelets were resuspended in the above buffer containing 1 mm EGTA and 10 μm indomethacin for 30 min prior to experiments. Stimulation of platelets was carried out at 37 °C in an aggregometer with continuous stirring at 1,200 rpm for the time indicated. Platelets were labeled in platelet-rich plasma with 0.5 μCi of [3H]5-HT for 1 h. Experiments were performed in the presence of apyrase (5 units/ml) and indomethacin (10 μm). Platelets were stimulated by convulxin, CRP, or collagen and then quenched by addition of an equal volume of 6% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer. Samples were microcentrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min and the supernatant analyzed by liquid scintillation counter. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Stimulations were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). Detergent-insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant precleared with protein A-Sepharose (50% (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBS-T: 20 mmTris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were added and each sample rotated at 4 °C for 120 min. The Sepharose pellet was washed sequentially in lysis buffer and TBS-T, before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. In re-immunoprecipitation experiments, immunoprecipitated complexes were dissociated by boiling for 10 min in the lysis buffer described above, containing 2% SDS. Dissociated proteins were renatured by addition of lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 to lower the concentration of SDS to 0.1%, and then re-immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed and Laemmli sample buffer added. The specificity of the interactions was verified with control, isotype-matched antibodies. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 8–18% gels and electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes that were then blocked by incubation in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBS-T. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with PVDF membranes for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were washed in TBS-T after each incubation with antibodies and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Cardiff, UK). A GST fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of Syk (GST-Syk-SH2) was constructed and expressed as described previously (25Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and bound to glutathione-agarose. Precipitation of platelet proteins with the fusion construct was performed as described previously (25Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8–18% gels under either reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The collagen receptor can be selectively activated by the synthetic collagen, CRP (21Francischetti Ivo M.B. Saliou B. Lecduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C.

Using maximal concentrations, convulxin was found to induce a more rapid and greater degree of tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets in comparison to CRP (Fig. 1 A). Additionally, it was notable that tyrosine phosphorylation of number of proteins, including those of 12–14 and 38 kDa, peaked within 15 s, whereas their phosphorylation in response to CRP was delayed. Immunoprecipitation studies using a specific antiserum identified the 12–14-kDa protein as the FcR γ-chain. Determination of concentration response curves to CRP and convulxin confirmed that the toxin induced a much greater degree of phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain (Fig.1 B). For example, convulxin stimulated a 3.2 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3) increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain relative to that seen in response to CRP at 30 s (an even greater difference would be present at 15 s, the time of peak response to convulxin as shown in Fig. 1 A). A similar result was obtained following precipitation of the FcR γ-chain using the tandem SH2 domains of Syk (2.8 ± 0.3-fold, n= 3) (Fig. 1 C) (29Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This set of observations demonstrate that the trimeric convulxin is a more powerful agonist than CRP, possibly because of its ability to cross-link multiple GPVI receptors leading to a greater degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain. Evidence that convulxin signals solely through the GPVI-FcR γ-chain pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was provided by studies on Syk-deficient murine platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 induced by convulxin was completely inhibited in Syk-deficient mouse platelets (Fig. 1 D).Figure 1Time course of whole cell phosphorylation by convulxin or CRP (A), dose response of tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain in convulxin- and CRP-stimulated platelets (B andC), and loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 by convulxin in Syk-deficient mice platelets (D). Platelets were stimulated by convulxin (cvx; 1 μg/ml) or CRP (1 μg/ml) for the time indicated. Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer (A). The FcR γ-chain was immunoprecipitated using anti-FcR γ-chain mAb from lysates stimulated by convulxin (cvx; 30 s) or CRP (30 s) at the concentration as indicated (B) or precipitated using the tandem SH2 domains of Syk expressed as a GST fusion protein (C). These proteins were separated by 8–18% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. D, Syk+/+ or Syk−/− platelets were stimulated by convulxin (1 μg/ml) for 30 s and then lysed by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were immunoprecipitated for PLCγ2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (D, upper panel) and reprobed for PLCγ2 with anti-PLCγ2 mAb (D, lower panel). The results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functional consequence of the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain was determined by measurement of [3H]5-HT release from dense granules. The maximal response to convulxin was approximately 2.5-fold greater than that to CRP, and considerably greater than that to collagen (Fig.2). A candidate for the transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated 38-kDa protein is the adapter LAT, which has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in platelets following stimulation by collagen, CRP, and FcγRIIA cross-linking (7Pasquet J.-M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of LAT demonstrated that it is also heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in convulxin-stimulated platelets (Fig.3 A). Phosphorylation by convulxin peaks at 15 s and declines thereafter. Major tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 52–55 and 75 kDa, and a minor band of 130 kDa, were observed in LAT immunoprecipitates in convulxin-stimulated samples. The same bands were also seen in collagen- and CRP-stimulated platelets, albeit to a lesser degree (7Pasquet J.-M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 52–55- and 76-kDa bands were identified as Lyn, which exists as a doublet in platelets, and SLP-76 by reimmunoprecipitation and probing for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3, B and C). The 130-kDa band migrates close to Cbl and PLCγ2, both of which are also tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to convulxin in platelets (28Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Well T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The presence of either of these proteins, however, was not established by Western blotting, possibly because of a low level of expression. To determine whether PLCγ2 and/or Cbl associate with LAT, a re-immunoprecipitation strategy was used as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Re-immunoprecipitates were blotted for phosphotyrosine using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 to identify the position of reprecipitated proteins. Fig. 3 (D andE) shows that PLCγ2 and Cbl co-precipitate with LAT, demonstrating that both are component of the 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band. The converse experiment in which LAT was immunoprecipitated and the sample re-immunoprecipitated with anti-PLCγ2 or anti-Cbl gave the same result. We were unable to demonstrate an association between PLCγ2 and Cbl in convulxin-activated platelets following immunoprecipitation of either protein, suggesting that they are not associated with each other or in a trimeric complex with LAT. Immunoprecipitation of SLP-76 from platelets lysates following stimulation by convulxin revealed that it undergoes marked tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 38, 52–55, and 130 kDa (Fig.4 A). The time of peak tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 by convulxin, like that of LAT, was 15 s. Re-immunoprecipitation studies identified the 38-kDa protein as LAT, and the 52–55- and 130-kDa proteins were identified as Lyn and SLAP-130 by reprobing (Fig. 4, B–D), respectively. We were unable to detect an association between SLP-76 and PLCγ2. Although we have shown that LAT associates with SLP-76 and PLCγ2 in convulxin-stimulated platelets, we did not observe coprecipitation of PLCγ2 and SLP-76 suggesting that a complex of all three proteins was not precipitated. The observation that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is slightly reduced in LAT-deficient platelets suggests that the two adapters are regulated through independent pathways, but that a small amount of SLP-76 is regulated downstream of LAT (7Pasquet J.-M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adapter protein Grb2 has been previously reported to associate in vitro with LAT and SLP-76 via its SH2 and SH3 domains, respectively, following T cell receptor engagement (10Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in investigating whether Grb2 interacts with LAT and SLP-76 in convulxin-stimulated platelets. A major tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 38 kDa is observed in Grb2 immunoprecipitates from convulxin-stimulated platelets under reduced and nonreduced conditions (Fig.5 A), and this was identified as LAT by reimmunoprecipitation and blotting for phosphotyrosine ("

In addition to conferring resistance to various antineoplastic agents, MRP1 is a transporter of conjugated organic anions, including the cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4). We previously characterized the ATPase activity of reconstituted immunoaffinity-purified native MRP1 and showed it could be stimulated by its organic anion substrates (Mao, Q., Leslie, E.

Thus LTC4 uptake by MRP1 proteoliposomes was osmotically sensitive and could be inhibited by two MRP1-specific monoclonal antibodies.

Transport of vincristine required the presence of both ATP and GSH. Conversely, GSH transport was stimulated by vincristine and verapamil.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein and MRP1 both belong to the large ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transport proteins but share less than 20% amino acid identity (3Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 4Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar). Despite this limited sequence similarity, both proteins confer resistance on cancer cells by reducing intracellular drug concentrations in an ATP-dependent fashion (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein, like many ABC proteins, contains two hydrophobic membrane spanning domains (MSDs) each followed by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). On the other hand, in addition to a four-domain core structure, MRP1 and several of its more closely related proteins contain a third NH2-proximal MSD (MSD1) of approximately 200 amino acids with an extracytosolic NH2 terminus (2Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J.

The precise function of MSD1 is presently unknown, although certain modifications of MSD1 and/or the intracellular loop linking it to MSD2 by truncation or deletion can inactivate MRP1 (6Gao M.

Another distinctive structural feature of MRP1 and its related proteins is that the sequence similarity between their two NBDs is significantly lower than between the NBDs of P-glycoprotein and related protein transporters (2Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J.

This relative dissimilarity in the MRP-related proteins may reflect the non-equivalent functions of their two NBDs, as we and others have recently demonstrated for MRP1 (8Gao M. Cui H.-R. Loe D.W.

Although P-glycoprotein transports drugs across membranes in their unmodified forms, MRP1 transports conjugated xenobiotics, including organic anions such as the cysteinyl leukotriene LTC4, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 17β-estradiol 17-β-(d-glucuronide) (E217βG), and GSH-conjugated aflatoxin B1 (2Hipfner D.R.

However, MRP1 can also actively transport certain unconjugated xenobiotics (e.g. aflatoxin B1, vincristine, and daunorubicin) but only in the presence of GSH (13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G.

In the case of vincristine, there is strong evidence that GSH is co-transported in this process (17Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). MRP1 and its five homologs MRP2–6 (20Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), together with the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8) proteins (21Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Curr. Opin.

Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), form one of the largest human ABC transport protein subfamilies described to date. The physiological functions of these MRP subfamily members are diverse, and although several of them are known to transport conjugated organic anions (20Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), the substrates transported by others are less certain (20Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both MRP1 and MRP2 (ABCC2) have been purified, and the reconstituted proteins have been shown to possess constitutive ATPase activities that can be stimulated by their substrates (31Chang X.-B. Hou X.-Y. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Results from these and other studies are consistent with the concept that MRP1 and MRP2 are organic anion and drug efflux pumps that transport their substrates concomitant with ATP hydrolysis. However, direct substrate transport by purified reconstituted MRP1 or MRP2 has not yet been reported. In the present study, we have further characterized MRP1 by demonstrating ATP-dependent uptake of LTC4 and E217βG by proteoliposomes containing purified MRP1. The kinetic parameters of substrate transport by the MRP1 proteoliposomes were found to be comparable with those obtained previously in transport studies using MRP1-enriched plasma membrane vesicles. We also present evidence that vincristine and GSH are co-transported by the MRP1 proteoliposomes. These results represent the first functional reconstitution of substrate transport in a lipid vesicle system containing purified MRP1. E217βG, verapamil, VCR, GSH, GSSG,S-decyl-GSH, ATP, AMP, AMP-PCP were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). LTC4 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). DTT and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ). CHAPS was from ICN (Aurora, OH). Creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, and protease inhibitor mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Dorval, Quebec, Canada). [14,15,19,20-3H]LTC4 (128 Ci mmol−1), [6,7-3H]E217βG (49 Ci mmol−1), and [glycine-2-3H]GSH (44.8 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and [G-3H]vincristine sulfate (6.2 Ci mmol−1) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Bovine brain lipid extract was from Sigma (Type V). All purified and synthetic phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Isolation and purification of the human MRP1-specific murine mAbs QCRL-1, -3, and -4 have been described (34Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hipfner D.R. Mao Q.

Fab fragments of mAbs QCRL-1, -3, and -4 were prepared using the ImmunoPure Fab kit (Pierce). The doxorubicin-selected, MRP1-overexpressing multidrug-resistant H69AR small cell lung cancer cell line was maintained as described previously (4Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar, 37Mirski S.E.L. Gerlach J.H. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2594-2598PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes enriched in MRP1 were prepared from H69AR cells as described (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C before use. MRP1 from H69AR plasma membranes was solubilized as before (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the process was modified slightly as follows. 5 mg of plasma membranes was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (5 mg ml−1 CHAPS and protease inhibitor mixture in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). Thus, the final protein concentration and the ratio of detergent to protein were approximately 0.5 mg ml−1 and 10:1 (w/w), respectively. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h with gentle and frequent vortexing. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing solubilized MRP1 was immediately subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography. Purified mAb QCRL-1 was cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin as described (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resin was then washed with 25 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 25 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, and 25 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture), all by brief centrifugation (30 s, 100 × g, each time). Solubilized MRP1 (10 ml) was mixed with the washed resin and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The resin with bound protein was packed into a 15-ml spin column (Bio-Rad) and washed 10 times with 50 ml of buffer B as above. The heptapeptide (8 mg) corresponding to the QCRL-1 epitope (SSYSGDI) (35Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar) was dissolved in 2 ml of buffer B and mixed with the resin. The mixture was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. MRP1 was eluted, and the immunoaffinity column regenerated as described previously (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified MRP1 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes using rapid detergent removal by gel filtration as follows. Bovine brain lipid extract was dissolved in chloroform, dried under a stream of argon, pumped under vacuum for 2 h at room temperature, and then resuspended at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 in reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2). The lipid suspension was sonicated under argon for 30 min in a bath-type sonicator at room temperature and then stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. For reconstitution, 3.8 mg of bovine brain lipid and 220 μl of 30% (w/v) CHAPS were added in an Eppendorf tube and vortexed 30 s at room temperature. 10 μg of purified MRP1 was then added to the lipid/detergent solution, bringing the final volume to approximately 1 ml. The solution was mixed gently, incubated on ice for 1 h, and passed through a Sephadex G-50 (1 × 25 cm) column. Turbid fractions were collected and proteoliposomes harvested by centrifugation at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose) for measurement of LTC4 transport. For [3H]E217βG transport, the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer and for [3H]VCR and [3H]GSH transport in 10 μl of buffer. Proteoliposomes were homogenized by passing five times through a 27.5-gauge needle and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Recovery of MRP1 in the proteoliposomes was typically 30–50%. Control liposomes were prepared as described for the proteoliposomes except that MRP1 was omitted. Electrophoresis was performed using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels in a Bio-Rad Mini Protein II electrophoresis cell, and proteins were stained with alkaline silver (38Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the plasma membrane preparations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, and proteins in detergent solutions were quantitated using a modified Lowry assay (39Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7064) Google Scholar), both with bovine serum albumin as standard. The effect of different lipids on ATPase activity of purified MRP1 was determined essentially as described (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Typically, 0.5–1.5 μg of purified MRP1 was incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of assay buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2 for 4 h. The ATP concentration used was 2.5 mm. Lipids were resuspended in assay buffer by sonication and added to the reaction mixture over a range of concentrations (0.25–2 mg ml−1). Reactions were stopped by adding 33.3 μl of 18% SDS, and the amount of inorganic phosphate was determined immediately as described (40Chifflet S. Torriglia R. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 41Doige C.A., Yu, X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Latex-free 1-ml syringes plugged with glass wool were filled with Sephadex G-50 Fine resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with transport buffer. Syringes were then placed in 13- × 100-mm test tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm (Sorvall RT6000D). The syringes were filled until the bed volume reached approximately 1 ml by repeated fills and centrifugations and subjected to a final spin for 10 min at 2500 rpm to ensure that the resin was uniformly packed and that excess buffer was removed. ATP-dependent transport of MRP1 substrates was measured using spin column gel filtration as follows. Frozen proteoliposomes, typically containing 1–2 μg of protein, were thawed on ice and then mixed with 3H-labeled substrates in transport buffer such that the final reaction mixture contained substrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm AMP, or 4 mm ATP (with 10 mm creatine phosphate and 100 μg ml−1 creatine kinase) in a final volume of 70 μl. [3H]LTC4 (100 nCi) was added at an initial concentration of 50 nm, and transport was measured at 37 °C. In certain experiments, Fab fragments of mAbs QCRL-1, QCRL-3, and QCRL-4, and inhibitors were also included in the transport mixture. At various times, 20 μl of proteoliposomes were removed, diluted into 80 μl of ice-cold transport buffer, and immediately subjected to purification by spin column gel filtration (400 ×g, 3 min) at room temperature. More than 90% of the proteoliposomes passed through the column in the first fraction, and the free radiolabeled substrates [3H]LTC4, [3H]E217βG, [3H]VCR, and [3H]GSH, were eluted in later fractions when the column was rinsed with transport buffer (100 μl) and recentrifuged. Radioactivity in the first fraction (containing the proteoliposomes) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To measure transport of the MRP1 substrates [3H]E217βG, [3H]VCR, and [3H]GSH, experiments were performed at initial substrate concentrations of 400 nm(120 nCi), 500 nm (75 nCi), and 100 μm (70 nCi), respectively. Typically, 5–10 μg and 10–20 μg of protein were used, for [3H]E217βG and for [3H]VCR and [3H]GSH transport, respectively. Except for the ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]VCR and [3H]GSH, all values were calculated by subtracting the uptake in control liposomes in the presence of ATP. Values for ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]VCR and [3H]GSH were obtained by subtraction of uptake by the proteoliposomes in the presence of AMP. We previously described a differential two-step procedure for solubilization of native MRP1 from H69AR plasma membranes (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that more than 90% of MRP1 could be solubilized with 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS after incubation for 1 h at 4 °C at a membrane protein concentration of approximately 0.5 mg ml−1 in phosphate-buffered saline (results not shown). We subsequently used this simpler one-step procedure for protein solubilization prior to immunoaffinity chromatography (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With this modified approach, approximately 200 μg of MRP1 could be purified from 5 mg of plasma membranes, a yield comparable with that obtained previously (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The purity of MRP1 was at least 80%, as judged by densitometry of a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1,lanes 1–3). This estimate of purity is very conservative and analysis by electron microscopy indicates that the MRP1 preparations are homogeneous and suitable for single particle image analysis. 2M. F. Rosenberg, Q. Mao, R. G. Deeley, and S. P. C. Cole, unpublished observations. In addition, at a loading of 1 μg per lane, no additional proteins were detectable on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel (not shown). To determine the effect of different lipid environments on MRP1, various purified and synthetic phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol, were examined individually, and in a limited number of combinations, for their ability to stimulate MRP1 ATPase activity. None of the individual lipids, nor the combinations tested, significantly enhanced MRP1 ATPase activity relative to basal ATPase activity in the absence of lipid. Indeed, several synthetic phospholipids such as 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (sodium salt) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine had a moderate inhibitory effect (data not shown). In contrast, bovine brain lipids, which are comprised of a mixture of phospholipids containing a minimum of 40% phosphatidylethanolamine, stimulated MRP1 ATPase activity 2.5-fold above basal activity at a concentration of 2 mg ml−1 lipid (data not shown). Purified brain phosphatidylserine (which contains different phosphatidylserine molecules with varied fatty acid content) also stimulated MRP1 ATPase activity by approximately 2.5-fold. Because of the ready availability of the bovine brain lipids, they were used routinely in subsequent reconstitution experiments. Proteoliposomes were formed by rapid removal of detergent by gel filtration. Bovine brain lipids were used in approximately 100,000-fold molar excess to MRP1, assuming an average lipid molecular mass of 700 Da. Typically, 30–50% of MRP1 was recovered in the proteoliposome preparations isolated by gel filtration, compared with the 20–30% recovery obtained previously using rapid dilution (32Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A gel of purified MRP1 in the proteoliposomes stained with alkaline silver is shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 4–6). CHAPS was used during both purification and reconstitution, because it permitted formation of homogeneously large proteoliposome populations that were well suited for transport measurements (42Cladera J. Rigaud J.-L. Villaverde J. Dunach M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MRP1 proteoliposomes stained with uranyl acetate were determined to have diameters of 150–200 nm by electron microscopy (not shown). In early experiments using nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.22 μm) to measure LTC4 uptake, we observed that a large proportion of the proteoliposomes passed through the filters. To avoid this problem, a spin column method was used to separate proteoliposomes from free [3H]LTC4(43Mao Q. Schunk T. Flukiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Buchler M. Bohme M. Ortlepp H. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). [3H]LTC4 uptake was measured at 37 °C, and the membrane potential was not experimentally manipulated; except for Mg2+, no other cations were present in the transport mixture. ATP hydrolysis was required for transport, because [3H]LTC4 uptake by the proteoliposomes was significantly less in the presence of AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP (Fig.2 A). ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by control liposomes without MRP1 was very low (Fig. 2 B), indicating that ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by the proteoliposomes was mediated by MRP1. The low level [3H]LTC4 uptake by the control liposomes is likely to be attributable to the passive diffusion of [3H]LTC4 across the lipid bilayers. Consequently, the net ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by the proteoliposomes was calculated by subtracting the corresponding low level uptake in the control liposomes. ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 transport in the MRP1 proteoliposomes appeared linear at least up to 10 min, and the initial rate was approximately 30 pmol min−1 mg−1MRP1 at a substrate concentration of 50 nm in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (Fig. 2 B). [3H]LTC4 uptake did not reach equilibrium (steady state) by 10 min, suggesting that there is a continued inward pumping of LTC4 by MRP1 and that the outward passive diffusion of LTC4 back across the membrane is low. To confirm that the ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake by the proteoliposomes truly represents transport into the vesicle lumen, rather than surface or intramembrane binding of substrate, the effect of changes in osmolarity on uptake was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, [3H]LTC4 uptake decreased as the concentration of sucrose in the transport buffer increased, indicating that ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4uptake by the proteoliposomes is osmotically sensitive, as expected for a true transport process. To further characterize LTC4 transport mediated by MRP1 proteoliposomes, the effects of the competitive inhibitorS-decyl-GSH and"

Gα deactivation kinetics mediated by RGS are too fast to be directly studied using conventional radiochemical methods. We describe a stopped-flow spectroscopic approach to visualize these rapid kinetics by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence decrease of Gα accompanying GTP hydrolysis and Gα deactivation on the millisecond time scale. Basal k cat values for Gαo, Gαi1, and Gαi2 at 20 °C were similar (0.025–0.033 s−1). GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing RGS4 and an RGS7 box domain (amino acids 305–453) enhanced the rate of Gα deactivation in a manner linear with RGS concentration. RGS4-stimulated rates could be measured up to 5 s−1 at 3 μm, giving a catalytic efficiency of 1.7–2.8 × 106m−1 s−1 for all three Gα subunits. In contrast, RGS7 showed catalytic efficiencies of 0.44, 0.10, and 0.02 × 106m−1s−1 toward Gαo, Gαi2, and Gαi1, respectively. Thus RGS7 is a weaker GTPase activating protein than RGS4 toward all Gα subunits tested, but it is specific for Gαo over Gαi1 or Gαi2. Furthermore, the specificity of RGS7 for Gαo does not depend on N- or C-terminal extensions or a Gβ5 subunit but resides in the RGS domain itself.

GTP-binding protein regulator of G-protein signaling glutathione S-transferase GTPase-activating protein dithiothreitol guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside phosphate-buffered saline G-protein1-coupled receptor-mediated signal transduction governs many important physiological functions. Upon binding of a ligand, such as light, neurotransmitter, hormone, chemokine, etc., to heptahelical receptors, the heterotrimeric G-proteins composed of α, β, and γ subunits are stimulated to release GDP and bind GTP. In the GTP-bound form, Gα dissociates from Gβγ and both interact with downstream effectors. This pathway is terminated when Gα hydrolyzes the bound GTP, thereby promoting reassociation of Gα and Gβγ and returning the system to inactive state (reviewed in Refs. 1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

The GTPase-activating property (GAP) of RGS proteins has been demonstrated by direct in vitro biochemical studies (13Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Further studies using GDP-AlF4− suggest that RGS proteins enhance GTP hydrolysis by stabilizing the transition state conformation of Gα (16Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which leads to the crystal structure of the RGS4·Gαi1 complex (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis analyses have also illustrated the importance of specific residues on the interface between Gα and RGS proteins (18Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Besides being GAPs, many RGS proteins have also been found to serve as links to other cellular signaling pathways through non-RGS domains such as GGL, DEP, DH/PH, and PDZ domains (reviewed in Refs. 11Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and 12De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The wide expression of RGS in various tissue and cell types (see Ref. 12De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar for review) thus indicate that RGS proteins may play important physiological roles directly or indirectly. The specificity of RGS proteins for interactions with Gα subtypes (Gαs, Gαi/Gαo, Gαq, and Gα12) is now being vigorously explored. The majority of the RGS proteins are GAPs for Gαi and Gαq but not for Gαssubunit (reviewed in Refs. 10Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 22Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies on the specificity between RGS proteins and Gα subunits have been reported using biochemical, immunochemical, and functional methods. RGS4 is one of the most extensively studied RGS protein and is a highly effective GAP for all Gαi/Gαo family members (reviewed in Refs. 10Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 11Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol.

In contrast, limited and apparently inconsistent data on RGS7 have been reported. The RGS domain of RGS7 has been shown to have effective GAP activity toward Gαi1 and Gαo (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Shuey D.J. Betty M. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. Cockett M.I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas it preferentially bound Gαo, Gαi3 and Gαz, but not Gαi1 or Gαi2 (28Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, accurate quantitation of GAP activity is difficult, because rates of GTP hydrolysis are too fast to measure with standard assays (see below). Furthermore, full-length RGS7 was recently found to form a complex with Gβ5 (29Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this complex was shown to have moderate but significant GAP activity toward Gαo but not Gαi1 or Gαi2 (31Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), despite the fact that it did not seem to favor the physical binding of RGS7 to Gαo (32Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether the specificity of full-length RGS7 for Gαo over Gαi1 and Gαi2 is encoded in the RGS domain or it depends on Gβ5. Direct measurement of the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis and deactivation of Gα mediated by RGS would be the most straightforward approach to determining specificity. The current challenge in this regard is that the conventional biochemical assays can only delineate kinetics as fast as t 12 ∼ 10 s, whereas the RGS-mediated Gα deactivation, as well as the turn-off of many physiological processes, takes place on the subsecond scale. One recent study in a m1AchR-Gq vesicle system using a quench-flow method has reported more than a 1000-fold enhancement of GTP hydrolysis rate mediated by RGS4 witht 12 ∼ 50 ms, indicating that data acquisition on the millisecond time scale is required to study the effect of RGS on Gα deactivation kinetics under physiological conditions (33Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The present study aimed to develop a stopped-flow spectroscopic approach to visualize these rapid kinetics and to quantitatively assess RGS·Gα specificity. The rapid-mix stopped-flow florescence spectroscopy utilizes the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Gα. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is high in GTP-bound, active Gα subunits and low for GDP-bound Gα (34Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Ross E.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6954-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence change is due to alterations in the environment of the α2 helix tryptophan residue, Trp212 in Gαo(38Lan K.-L. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 837-843Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Trp207 in transducin (39Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With purified Gαo, Gαi1, and Gαi2 proteins in solution, we successfully employed this stopped-flow method to quantitate catalytic efficiencies of RGS4 and RGS7 and obtained new evidence on the specificity of RGS4 and RGS7 (box domain) toward Gα subunits. [γ-32P]GTP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Glutathione was from Sigma. Rat RGS4 (full-length) and RGS8 (nucleotides 315–857) in expression vectors pGEX-2T and pGEX-4T, respectively, were provided by Dr. Robert Mackenzie (Parke-Davis Research). The human RGS7 box cDNA fragment (nucleotides 915–1359, or amino acids 305–453) in the expression vector pGSTag2 was from Dr. Ron Taussig (University of Michigan). The Gαo, Gαi1, and Gαi2 cDNA in expression vector pQE were generously provided by Dr. Maurine E. Linder (Washington University). The myristoylated Gαoprotein was provided by Dr. Ron Taussig. His6Gαo and His6Gαi1 were expressed from the vector, pQE60, in Escherichia coli strain BL21/DE3 and purified as described previously (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). His6Gαo and His6Gαi1 eluted from nickel resin columns (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA) were approximately 80% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels. Myristoylated Gαi1 and Gαi2 were expressed from the pQE6 expression vector cotransformed in the E. coli strain BL21/DE3 with theN-myristoyl transferase vector based on the protocol of Mumby and Linder (40Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the Gα proteins determined by [35S]GTPγS binding assay (41Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ranged from 6 to 18 pmol/μg. The GST-RGS fusion proteins were expressed and purified using PGEX expression vectors inE. coli strain BL21/DE3 as described previously (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The bacterial supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with ice-cold PBS buffer (pH 7.3), the GST-RGS fusion proteins were eluted with 15 mm glutathione in PBS and dialyzed against PBS buffer. Where indicated, the fusion proteins were cleaved by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 10 units of thrombin/mg of fusion protein followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose to remove GST and any uncleaved GST-RGS proteins. Cleavage of the GST to yield RGS4 alone did not alter the rate constants for Gα deactivation (data not shown). RGS proteins were approximately 60–90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels. Slow time-based fluorescence measurements were determined using a PTI Alphascan fluorometer (Photon Technology, Monmouth Junction, NJ) with a water-cooled 150-watt xenon arc lamp as described (42Remmers A.E. Posner R. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His6Gαo proteins were diluted into buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 ppm of deionized Lubrol, pH 8.0 (HEDML buffer), placed in customized 5-mm round quartz cuvettes in temperature-controlled (20 °C) sample holders, and continuously stirred. Time course measurements of intrinsic fluorescence (λex 280, λem 340 nm, 2-nm slits) were performed with 500 nmHis6Gαo proteins and 2 μm GTP in the presence of various concentrations of RGS4 (0–30 nm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. The rapid kinetics of Gα deactivation in the presence or absence of RGS proteins was measured in an Applied Photophysics DX-17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. The intrinsic fluorescence change of Gα proteins was measured at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm with 2.3-nm slits. Emission light was detected with a photomultiplier tube behind a WG320 band pass filter (Corion, Holliston, MA). Gαo (400 nm), Gαi1 (600 nm), or Gαi2 (600 nm) proteins were preloaded with 2 μm GTP in the absence of magnesium in HED buffer (50 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, pH 8.0). Incubations were for 20 min at 20 °C for Gαoand for 15 min at 30 °C for Gαi1 and Gαi2. Samples were then stored on ice until use (<2 h). GTP-loaded G-protein was equilibrated in the instrument at 20 °C for at least 3 min, then samples were mixed 1:1 with magnesium-containing HEDM buffer (50 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 30 mm MgSO4, pH 8.0) in the absence or presence of RGS proteins as indicated. Tryptophan fluorescence was recorded for at least 100 s in the absence of RGS and for 20 or 50 s in the presence of RGS, depending on the rates achieved. Data from four to six shots were averaged and fit to a one-phase exponential decay equation using Prism v.3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Single turnover [γ-32P]GTPase assays at low temperature (4 °C) were performed as described previously (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Single turnover [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis was also determined at room temperature (24 °C) as below. His6Gαo or His6Gαi1 (10 nm) was preloaded in magnesium-free HEDL buffer (50 mm Hepes, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 ppm deionized Lubrol, pH 8.0) with 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (7500 cpm/pmol). The preloading incubations were for 20 min at room temperature for Gαo and for 15 min at 30 °C for Gαi1. After equilibration at room temperature, the single turnover hydrolysis reaction was then started by addition of MgSO4 and GTPγS to final concentrations of 20 mm and 200 μm, respectively. MgSO4 activates His6Gαo and triggers catalysis, while GTPγS prevents [γ-32P]GTP from rebinding to the G-protein. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken and diluted in 1 ml of 15% (w/v) charcoal solution (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.3, 0 °C) at the indicated time points. Background hydrolysis was determined in the absence of protein and represents less than 10% of total [γ-32P]Pi release. The amount of [γ-32P]Pi released at each time point was fit to an exponential function, cpm(t) = cpmo + Δcpm × (1 −e −kt). To determine the feasibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy to study RGS function, we first examined the intrinsic fluorescence changes of Gαo upon addition of GTP. The time course of intrinsic fluorescence changes of Gαo (500 nm) was monitored using a slow time-based fluorometer before and after addition of 2 μm GTP in the presence of 10 mmMg2+ (Fig. 1 A). Similar to the findings reported previously (34Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GTP and Mg2+ caused a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity followed by a slow decrease in fluorescence. Fluorescence approached the baseline level at approximately 30 min (1800 s). The fluorescence increase represents GTP binding to Gαo to induce an active conformation. As the bound GTP is hydrolyzed and GDP produced, an increasing percentage of Gαo becomes GDP-bound, which displays a lower intrinsic fluorescence. When a small amount of RGS4 (3 nm) was added with GTP and Mg2+, the peak of intrinsic fluorescence decreased and the time for the fluorescence to return to baseline was shortened. A more dramatic effect was observed when a higher concentration of RGS4 (30 nm) was added.Figure 4Specificity of his6Gαo and his6Gαi1 deactivation kinetics accelerated by RGS4, RGS7, and RGS8. The rate of deactivation of GTP-preloaded His6Gαo (200 nm final) or His6Gαi1 (300 nm final) was determined by stopped-flow fluorescence at 20 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 2. Data were collected for at least 100 s in the absence of RGS and for 20–100 s in the presence of RGS. Aand B, the effect of RGS4 and RGS7 on the intrinsic fluorescence changes (ΔF) of His6Gαo. The rate of intrinsic fluorescence decrease (or Gα deactivation) was obtained by fitting the data to a single exponential decay curve. A and B are each from a single experiment representing a total of four and seven determinations, respectively. C–F, plots of rates as determined in A and B versus RGS concentrations. Linearity was shown for RGS4 up to 3 μmand similarly for RGS7 and RGS8 up to 1 μm for both His6Gαo (C, D) and His6Gαi1 (E, F). All lines shown are the linear fits of averaged data points at various RGS concentrations from at least three experiments (except for RGS8,n = 2).

A, single round GTP hydrolysis by His6Gαo was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” His6Gαoprotein (10 nm) was incubated at room temperature (24 °C) in magnesium-free buffer (HEDL) with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (7500 cpm/pmol) for 20 min. The hydrolysis reaction was started at time zero by addition of 20 mmMgSO4 and 200 μm GTPγS. Nonenzymatic [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis, determined in the absence of Gαo protein, represented less than 10% of total [γ-32P]Pi release and was subtracted from the data. Data are averages (±S.E.) of five experiments, expressed as the fraction of the total GTP hydrolyzed and are fitted to single exponential association function (GraphPad Prism). B andC, intrinsic fluorescence changes of Gα were measured using stopped-flow as described in “Materials and Methods.” Reactions took place in HED buffer: 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT. His6Gαo (400 nm) and His6Gαi1 (600 nm) were incubated with 2 μm GTP for 20 min at 20 °C or for 15 min at 30 °C, respectively. Samples were then loaded into the stopped-flow fluorimeter, GTP hydrolysis was triggered by mixing with an equal volume of 30 mm MgSO4 in HED buffer (15 mm final free Mg2+), then the intrinsic fluorescence changes were recorded with 290-nm excitation and a WG320 filter for emission. Intrinsic fluorescence at the first time point was set to zero. Graphs are averages of multiple experiments (His6Gαo, five; His6Gαi1, three), each averaged from four to six shots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Slow time-based measurement of Gαo fluorescence changes induced by GTP and RGS4. A, His6Gαo (500 nm) was equilibrated 3 min at room temperature in HEDM (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, DTT 2 mm, and 2 mm MgSO4). At 1 min, GTP and RGS4 were added to give the final concentrations of 1 μm and 0–30 nm, respectively. The time course of Gαo intrinsic fluorescence was monitored (290-nm excitation, 340-nm emission); B, GTP (1 μm) was added to 500 nmHis6Gαo as in A, however, RGS4 was added at the peak of fluorescence (t = 150 s). For all traces, the fluorescence contributed by RGS4 (400–1350 counts per second for 10–30 nm RGS4) was subtracted starting from the point where RGS4 was added. Displayed are the results from a representative experiment, which was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because our stopped-flow approach required preloading of Gα with GTP, we also tested the effect of adding RGS4 at the peak of the intrinsic fluorescence increase (Fig. 1 B). RGS4 markedly accelerated the rate of fluorescence decrease. Most previous studies of RGS-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by G-proteins have been done at 0–4 °C to slow the single turnover kinetics (13Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Although low temperature allows the measurement of thek cat of basal GTPase, which had rates of 0.002 and 0.004 s−1 for Gαo and Gαi1, respectively, the RGS4-enhancedk cat was still too fast to be measured (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of His6Gαo (Fig.2 A) and His6Gαi1 (not shown), as determined by [γ-32P]GTP single turnover assays at room temperature, were 0.019 ± 0.002 s−1 (n = 5) and 0.028 ± 0.002 s−1(n = 5), respectively, corresponding to half-times of 36 and 25 s. This is almost as fast as can be measured by manual methods, making the kinetics accelerated by RGS virtually inaccessible. We therefore tested the feasibility of using stopped-flow methods to measure the intrinsic fluorescence decrease of GTP-preloaded Gα upon addition of Mg2+. This depends on GTP hydrolysis by the Gα subunit (34Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both His6Gαo (Fig.2 B) and His6Gαi1 (Fig.2 C) showed rapid Mg2+-induced fluorescence decreases. The rate constants were 0.022 s−1 for His6Gαo, and 0.027 s−1 for His6Gαi1, corresponding to half-times (t 12) of 32 and 25 s, respectively. These rates of fluorescence decrease were in excellent agreement with the rates of GTP hydrolysis (k cat) as determined by single turnover [32P]GTPase assays described above. Similar results were obtained for myrGαo, myrGαi1, and myrGαi2 (graphs not shown), and the rates are summarized in TableI.Table IComparison of kdeact and kcatGαGTPase assayStopped-flow assayk catt 1/2k deactt 1/2s −1ss −1sHis6Gαo0.019 ± 0.002 (5)360.022 ± 0.002 (8)32myrGαo0.045 ± 0.002 (4)15His6Gαi10.028 ± 0.002 (5)250.027 ± 0.006 (3)25myrGαi10.024 ± 0.002 (6)28myrGαi20.033 ± 0.001 (4)21The rate of fluorescence decrease (k deact) by stopped-flow and the rate of GTP hydrolysis (k cat) by single-turnover [32P]GTPase assay were both determined at 20 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rates are expressed as mean ± S.E. from the number of experiments indicated in parentheses.

Half-times (t 1/2) were calculated from the rates. We further tested the effect of RGS on the rate of fluorescence decrease. In the presence of 100 nm RGS4, the rate of Gαi1 deactivation increased nearly 10-fold to 0.26 ± 0.03 s−1 (t 12, 2.7 s), whereas the magnitude of the fluorescence change was not affected (Fig.3 A). To be certain that the fluorescence decrease depended on the GTP hydrolysis and Gα deactivation rather than mere binding of RGS4 to Gα, the following controls were performed. His6Gαi1 was preincubated with GDP, GDP-AlF4−, or Gpp(NH)p, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, in the absence of Mg2+ followed by addition of Mg2+ with or without 100 nm RGS4. None of these reactions led to detectable fluorescence changes (Fig. 3 A). Thus it was not simply binding of RGS4 to either the active form (Gpp(NH)p) or the transition state (GDP-AlF4−) of Gα that produced the fluorescence signal. Furthermore, the RGS-insensitive mutant G183S Gαi1 (21Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman"

Alkylated peptides were sequenced completely through to the C-terminal amino acid as previously reported for full-length cryptdins isolated from mouse small intestinal tissues (3Ouellette A.J.

Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitroantibacterial activities of cryptdins were performed in buffers containing 10 mm PIPES or 10 mm HEPES as described (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (5 μl) of purified peptides dissolved at 3–300 μg/ml in 0.01% acetic acid were pipetted into wells formed in plates of 1% agarose buffered with 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, and containing 1 × 106 log-phase bacteria grown in trypticase soy broth. After 3 h at 37 °C, plates were overlayered with 0.8% agarose containing 2× trypticase soy broth and incubated overnight. Combined bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities were determined as the diameter of growth inhibition around each well as a function of peptide concentration. For measurements of bactericidal activity, exponentially growing bacterial cells were deposited by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, and 1 × 106 bacteria were exposed to peptide solutions in the PIPES buffer for 1 h at 37 °C (3Ouellette A.J.

Incubation mixtures were diluted 1:2000 with PIPES buffer and plated using a Spiral Biotech Autoplate 4000 (Spiral Biotech, Inc., Bethesda, MD), and surviving colony forming units (CFU) were quantitated after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Recombinant cryptdin-4 and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 were isolated after cloning and expression as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions using the pMAL bacterial expression system (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). A full-length cryptdin-4 cDNA clone was amplified with forward primers containing in the 5′- to 3′- orientation an EcoRI site, codons for the IEGR Factor Xa (Xa) protease cleavage site, and the 5 N-terminal codons of the mature cryptdin-4 or (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 peptides. Those primers were paired with a reverse primer complementary to the 5 C-terminal codons of cryptdin-4, including the stop codon, and a 5′-flanking SalI site. The sequences were pMalCrp4F (5′-GCGCGAATTCATCGAGGGAAGGGGTTTGTTATGCTATTGT) pMal-desGCrp4F (5′-GCGCGAATTCATCGAGGGAAGGTTGTTATGCTATTGT), and pMalCrp4R (5′-ATATATGTCGACTCAGCGACAGCAGAGCGTGTACAATAAATG). After plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis, plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and synthesis of MBP-cryptdin-4 fusion protein was induced in exponentially growing cells using 50 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 14 h at 16 °C. MBP fusion proteins were affinity purified from cell lysates using amylose resin (New England BioLabs), cleaved with Xa for 96 h at 25 °C using 1 μg Xa per mg of recombinant MBP fusion. Factor Xa-digested MBP-cryptdin-4 was applied to a C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) in an aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and eluted using a linear 0–40% acetonitrile gradient for 55 min at a solvent flow rate of 1 ml/min. Under these conditions, recombinant cryptdin-4 eluted with a retention time of 35 min. Recombinant cryptdin-4 was purified to homogeneity from the C-4 fraction containing cryptdin-4 by C18 RP-HPLC (Vydac). The protein sample was applied to the C18-column in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted at a solvent flow rate of 1 ml/min with 0–10% acetonitrile over 10 min, 10–45% acetonitrile over 55 min, and 100% over 30 min. Under these conditions, cryptdin-4 had a 51-min retention time. The protein concentration of recombinant cryptdin-4 was determined using Bio-Rad Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and by absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 3355 mcm−1). The molecular masses of purified recombinant peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Perkin-Elmer Voyager instrument in the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. The homogeneity and appropriate folding of recombinant cryptdin-4 were assessed by comparison with natural cryptdin-4 (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Ouellette A.J. Darmoul D. Tran D. Huttner K.M. Yuan J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 12.5% AU-PAGE gels and found to be identical to the natural peptide. Immunogold localization studies demonstrated that cryptdins are constituents of mouse Paneth cell secretory granules. In previous immunohistochemical experiments, cryptdin peptides were found only in Paneth cells (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Ouellette A.J. Darmoul D. Tran D. Huttner K.M. Yuan J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-cryptdin immunoreactivity was detected in secretory granules and diffusely in the crypt lumen (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 37Ouellette A.J. Greco R.M. James M. Frederick D. Naftilan J. Fallon J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using a rabbit polyclonal anti-cryptdin-1 antibody that reacts with cryptdins 1–3 and -6 but not with cryptdin-4 or -5, 3M. E. Selsted, and D. Tran, unpublished observations. the subcellular location of cryptdins in adult mouse Paneth cells was shown to be specific to Paneth cell granules (Fig. 2). The distribution of gold particles was uniform, and all apical granules were labeled to approximately the same extent (Fig. 2). Immunoreactive antigen was also visible in the trans-Golgi (not shown), but there was almost no cytoplasmic staining other than in secretory granules. These results are consistent with the detection of human enteric α-defensin HD-5 in human Paneth cells (22Porter E.M. Liu L. Oren A. Anton P.A. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that cryptdin release depends on Paneth cell degranulation. To test the prediction that functional cryptdin peptides are released into the extracellular space, α-defensins were recovered from rinses of adult mouse small intestinal lumen. The lumen of adult mouse small intestine contains intact cryptdins as well as cryptdin variants with modified N termini. Peptides with AU-PAGE mobilities characteristic of α-defensins had been detected previously in saline rinses of adult mouse jejunum and ileum (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Comparisons of cryptdins purified from intact small bowel with putative cryptdins from luminal washes showed that certain of the luminal peptides did not co-migrate with peptides from tissue, suggesting that cryptdins may undergo modification following secretion (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Putative luminal cryptdins were purified by combined gel filtration and RP-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The primary structures of these peptides were determined by Edman sequencing of each cryptdin through to the C terminus in all cases. This experimental approach, reported previously in determining the primary structures of full-length synthetic cryptdins (16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Ouellette A.J. Darmoul D. Tran D. Huttner K.M. Yuan J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as cryptdin peptides from mouse small intestinal tissue (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), showed that the peptides from the lumen were full-length or N-terminally modified cryptdins. Cryptdins recovered from the intestinal lumen consisted of both full-length and N-terminal-truncated peptides. Full-length cryptdin-2, -4, and -6 were present in washings of adult mouse small bowel, and those three peptides were structurally and functionally (Figs. 4 and5) indistinguishable from the corresponding tissue forms. Variants of cryptdin-1, -4, and -6 with shortened N termini also were recovered from the intestinal lumen, and they were identified as (des-Leu)-cryptdin-6, (des-Leu-Arg)-cryptdin-6, (des-Leu)-cryptdin-1, and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 by peptide sequencing (Fig. 3). Thus, following secretion by Paneth cells, cryptdins may be isolated both as intact activated mature peptides and as N-terminal variants that have been altered by apparent aminopeptidase activity that modifies the peptides during or after exocytosis.Figure 5Antimicrobial activities of luminal mouse cryptdin-4 and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4.

Primary structures determined by peptide sequencing (see “Experimental Procedures”) are shown aligned with the primary structure of cryptdin-1 in which the disulfide connectivities are noted. The sequences of full-length luminal cryptdin-2, -4, and -6 are identical to the tissue forms of these peptides. Dashes (—) were introduced in the cryptdin-4 and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 sequences as before (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) to maintain alignment of cysteine residues. Cryptdin-4 is an unusual α-defensin, because the loop formed between the Cys3–Cys5disulfide bond lacks three amino acids that are found in α-defensins as a class. Residues N-terminal of the first Cys residue areboxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antimicrobial assays of cryptdin-6, cryptdin-4, and their N-terminally modified congeners showed that removal of the N-terminal residue(s) diminished antibacterial activity. The combined bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of the peptides were measured in agar diffusion assays (see “Experimental Procedures”) and quantitated as zones of clearing (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of whether they were cellular or luminal in origin, full-length cryptdin-2 and -6 had equivalent activities against these three species of bacteria. In these assays, cryptdin-2 (not shown) and cryptdin-6 (Fig. 4) were more active against Staphylococcus aureus than against Gram-negative bacterial species. Loss of Leu and Leu-Arg residues from the cryptdin-6 N terminus caused little effect on activity against S. aureus (Fig. 4 A), but the activity of (des-Leu)-cryptdin-6 and (des-Leu-Arg)-cryptdin-6 against E. coli ML35 (not shown) and the attenuatedphoP − mutant of S. typhimurium (Fig.4 B) was greatly reduced. The limited quantity of purified (des-Leu)-cryptdin-1 precluded a comparison with full-length cryptdin-1. Comparisons of cryptdin-4 and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 antimicrobial activities showed further that the N terminus is a determinant of cryptdin activity. Cryptdin-4 is the most potent of the known mouse cryptdins in vitro (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is equally active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 5). On the other hand, (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 had only ∼30% the activity of the full-length peptide against S. aureus (Fig. 5). Furthermore, when the cryptdin-4 congeners were tested against E. coli andS. typhimurium, (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 completely lacked activity under the assay conditions, even though the peptides differ only by an N-terminal glycine (Fig. 5). Thus, the cryptdin-4 N terminus is a critical determinant of the overall antibacterial activity of this peptide. To compare the microbicidal activities of cryptdin-4 and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4, recombinant forms of both peptides were expressed as fusions with MBP in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). After purification to homogeneity by successive C4 and C18 RP-HPLC, recombinant cryptdin-4 (rCrp4) and (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 [r(des-G)-Crp4] peptides had correct molecular masses of 3756 and 3700 atomic mass units, respectively, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Also, rCrp4 and r(des-G)-Crp4 co-migrated as single bands in AU-PAGE (Fig.6), a system that resolves defensins effectively (38Selsted M.E. Genet. Eng. 1993; 15: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Rf values of the two recombinant peptides were indistinguishable from that of natural cryptdin-4, evidence that both peptides were homogeneous and folded correctly (Fig.6). Consistent with the diminished activity of natural (des-Gly)-cryptdin-4 isolated from the small intestinal lumen, r(des-G)-Crp4 had no in vitro bactericidal activity, whereas rCrp4 was potently microbicidal. Against E. coli ML35 and S. typhimurium (39Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Groisman E.A. Parra-Lopez C. Salcedo M. Lipps C.J. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11939-11943Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), r(des-G)-Crp4 had no measurable microbicidal activity under conditions (5 μg/ml or greater) in which rCrp4 sterilized the culture of 1 × 106 bacteria/ml (Fig.7). These results confirm that the recombinant molecules are equivalent to the natural forms and provide an opportunity for further investigations of mechanisms by which N-terminal residues modulate cryptdin-4 microbicidal activity. These experiments show that full-length cryptdins are released into the intestinal lumen and that functional peptides can be isolated from the lumen of the small intestine. Immunogold-detection experiments localized mouse cryptdins to Paneth cell secretory granules (Figs. 1and 2), and, therefore, luminal cryptdins result from the secretory responses of Paneth cells and not those of other enteric epithelial lineages. Also, immunohistochemical experiments provided no evidence that cryptdins were associated with apical microvilli or the brush border of the mucosal epithelium (data not shown). These findings suggest that the peptides remain soluble following secretion or that they diffuse rapidly out of the crypt. Although approximately equal quantities of full-length cryptdins and cryptdins with N-terminal truncations of 1 or 2 amino acids were isolated, truncated variants have not been detected among cryptdins purified from mouse intestinal tissue. Whether the truncations occur in the crypt lumen or after diffusion above the crypt-villus junction is unknown. Because no Paneth cell secretory stimuli (30Satoh Y. Ishikawa K. Oomori Y. Yamano M. Ono K. Anat. Rec. 1989; 225: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Satoh Y. Ishikawa K. Oomori Y. Takeda S. Ono K.

Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were administered to the mice in these studies, the luminal peptides that were isolated represent molecules released by Paneth cells under steady-state conditions. In the human neutrophil α-defensins, the N terminus is known to modulate certain activities. For example, the respective N termini of human neutrophil α-defensins HNP-1–3 are ACYC, CYC, and DCYC, but otherwise the primary structures are identical (41Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, HNP-1 and 2 are chemotactic for monocytes and T lymphocytes, but HNP-3 lacks both activities (42Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 43Chertov O. Michiel D.F. Xu L. Wang J.M. Tani K. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Taub D.D. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2935-2940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Similarly, HNP-3 is the only peptide of the three that does not kill Candida albicans (44Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, those comparisons showed that the charge at the N terminus affected activity but that removal of the N-terminal Ala had little effect. Perhaps these differences reflect the differential activities of peptides that function primarily in neutrophil phagolysosomes as compared with the external environment of the intestinal lumen. One or two residue truncations of cryptdin N termini attenuate or eliminate peptide antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Figs. 4, 5, 7). For both cryptdin-6 and cryptdin-4, the effect of truncation was greater against Gram-negative bacteria than against S. aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium. Because the molecular details of cryptdin bactericidal activity are not known, it is not immediately apparent how the deletion of a single glycine residue from the cryptdin-4 N terminus could eliminate bactericidal activity so thoroughly. α-Defensin tertiary structures show that the N and C termini are juxtaposed (45Bach A.C. Selsted M.E. Pardi A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4389-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Pardi A. Zhang X.L. Selsted M.E. Skalicky J.J. Yip P.F.

Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and we speculate that N-terminal truncation may disrupt hypothetical associations with the C terminus, leading to impaired peptide interactions with target cell membranes. The variability of N-terminal length among certain luminal cryptdins does not appear to result from inaccurate precursor processing and activation by MMP-7, the procryptdin activating enzyme in mouse Paneth cells. In vitro, MMP-7 cleaves recombinant procryptdin substrates with high fidelity (27Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Also, extensive processing of cryptdin precursors occurs intracellularly, because mouse Paneth cell granules contain high levels of fully activated cryptdins. 4D. P. Satchell, T. Ayabe, C. L. Wilson, S. J. Hagen, and A. J. Ouellette, unpublished observations. Furthermore, N-terminal cryptdin variants have not been detected in mouse intestinal tissue (3Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is unlikely that an error-prone MMP-7 introduces variation at cryptdin N termini during post-translational activation. Current evidence supports the view that N-terminal truncation of cryptdin peptides in the lumen is caused by the modification of activated peptides following secretion. We thank Dana Frederick, Robin Huffman, and Khoa Nguyen for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2130486085,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is implied in the activation of multiple targets of erythropoietin (Epo) signaling, but its exact role in Epo receptor (EpoR) signal transduction and in the regulation of erythroid proliferation and differentiation remained elusive. We analyzed the effect of PKC inhibitors with distinct modes of action on EpoR signaling in primary human erythroblasts and in a recently established murine erythroid cell line. Active PKC appeared essential for Epo-induced phosphorylation of the Epo receptor itself, STAT5, Gab1, Erk1/2, AKT, and other downstream targets. Under the same conditions, stem cell factor-induced signal transduction was not impaired. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphoinositol 3-kinase, also suppressed Epo-induced signal transduction, which could be partially relieved by activators of PKC. PKC inhibitors or LY294002 did not affect membrane expression of the EpoR, the association of JAK2 with the EpoR, or the in vitro kinase activity of JAK2. The data suggest that PKC controls EpoR signaling instead of being a downstream effector. PKC and phosphoinositol 3-kinase may act in concert to regulate association of the EpoR complex such that it is responsive to ligand stimulation. Reduced PKC-activity inhibited Epo-dependent differentiation, although it did not effect Epo-dependent renewal divisions induced in the presence of Epo, stem cell factor, and dexamethasone."

Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 4Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P.

In addition, vertebrate cells can activate a checkpoint during early prophase in response to DNA damage resulting in return of damaged cells to G2 (6Rieder C.L. Cole R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Traditionally defined, the prophase stage of mitosis starts with the first visible sign of chromosome condensation and ends at nuclear envelope breakdown. While the exact biochemical mechanisms controlling the onset of prophase are incompletely understood (for recent review, see Ref. 7Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), chromosome condensation is associated with extensive phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of chromatin structure. For example, the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase IIα which is known to play an important role in chromosome condensation (8Adachi Y. Luke M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1991; 64: 137-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 9Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M.

These events lead to the generation of mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites which are recognized by the monoclonal MPM-2 and 3F3/2 antibodies (13Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30622-30629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Among these phosphorylation sites, the MPM-2 epitope appears to be particularly important, since its presence on mitotic chromosomes is closely associated with the condensed state (6Rieder C.L. Cole R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The MPM-2 monoclonal antibody was originally raised against mitotic HeLa cells. Subsequent studies show, that it specifically recognizes a cell cycle-regulated phosphoepitope present in mitotic and meiotic proteins from a wide variety of species (16Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). These proteins become phosphorylated at the G2/M transition and are dephosphorylated at the end of mitosis (17Engle D.B. Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to topoisomerase IIα, more than 50 other phosphorylated proteins are recognized by the MPM-2 antibody including microtubule-associated proteins, components of the anaphase-promoting complex, phosphatases, and a number of protein kinases including protein kinase CK2 (16Davis F.M.

Interestingly, some MPM-2 kinases as, for example, NIMA are themselves activated by other MPM-2 kinases indicating the complexity of the signaling pathways which regulate mitotic entry (22Ye X.S.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2013-2025PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase CK2 is a serine/threonine kinase which has shown to be dramatically phosphorylated in mitotic cells (34Litchfield D.W. Luscher B.

Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and a stable topoisomerase II-CK2 molecular complex has been demonstrated (12Bojanowski K. Filhol O. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Larsen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22920-22926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, CK2 differentially phosphorylates topoisomerase II in a cell cycle-dependent manner: some phosphoacceptor sites are preferentially phosphorylated in G1, while others are preferentially phosphorylated in mitosis (36Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified CK2 as a topoisomerase II-directed MPM-2 kinase and characterized the phosphorylation site which leads to generation of the MPM-2 epitope on human topoisomerase IIα. We have also investigated the influence of this phosphorylation on the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II as well as on the ability of topoisomerase II to form molecular complexes with CK2.

Anti-topoisomerase IIα mouse monoclonal antibodies SWT3D1 and SWR1C2, herein designated T3D1 and R1C2, were generous gifts from Gary Gorbsky (University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and donkey anti-mouse antibodies were supplied by Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. The YepWOB6 plasmid containing hTopoIIα cDNA under the Gal1 promoter (39Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by James C. Wang (Harvard University, MA). The plasmid was overexpressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae DBY 745 strain and purified as described (40Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified enzyme preparations contained no detectable DNA topoisomerase I activity as determined by relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA in the absence of ATP. C-terminal truncated forms of hTopoIIα were constructed from the YepWOB6 plasmid. Recombinant CK2 was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described (41Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase was generously provided by Laurent Meijer (Station Biologique, Roscoff, France). HeLa S3 cells were grown in 0.5-liter spinner flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 60 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. To arrest cells in mitosis, cells were incubated for 14 h in the presence of 75 ng/ml nocodazole. The mitotic index was determined by microscopic analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells and ranged from 70 to 90% for nocodazole-blocked cells. Mitotic chromosomes were isolated as described previously (15Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30622-30629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For Western blot analysis, membranes were first blocked for 45 min at room temperature with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblotting, the MPM-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was diluted to 0.5 μg/ml, the rabbit polyclonal anti-CK2 α antibody diluted 1000 times and the anti-htopoIIα mouse monoclonal T3D1 antibody 400 times in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Incubation with the first antibody was carried out for 90 min at room temperature. Membranes were then washed two times for 10 min with TBST followed by 1 h incubation with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The goat anti-rabbit antibodies were diluted 80,000 times in TBST whereas the donkey anti-mouse antibodies were diluted 40,000 times in the same buffer. Membranes were washed again with TBST and the results were revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit. Purified hTopoIIα (150 ng) was incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with either 25 ng of purified CK2 or cdc2 kinase or with both enzymes together in a 15-μl final volume containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 μmATP. Reactions were stopped by addition of 15 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Nocodazole-blocked HeLa S3 cells (5 × 106) were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature at 200 × g. Cell pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4 (TEM), 1% CHAPS, 200 nmmicrocystin-LR (Calbiochem), 200 nm okadaic acid (Sigma) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and Pefabloc SC) was added. Extraction mixtures were incubated 20 min at 4 °C with intermittent vortexing followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatants were saved and protein concentrations determined. For CK2 immunodepletion or heparin depletion experiments, protein concentrations were adjusted to 500 μg/ml prior to addition of anti-CK2 antibodies or heparin-Sepharose. In addition, the lysis buffer also contained 300 mm NaCl. Mitotic cell extracts were prepared as described and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C under rotation in the absence or presence of a 1/100 dilution of a polyclonal antibody directed against the regulatory β subunit. Extracts were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were saved and the precipitation repeated overnight with or without the CK2 β-directed antibodies. After incubation with protein A-Sepharose, supernatants were saved and new precipitations were carried out for 3 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of a 1/100 dilution of a polyclonal antibody directed toward the catalytic α-subunit of CK2 in order to eliminate CK2 activity which is not associated with the β subunit. Supernatants were collected after incubation with protein A-Sepharose and their remaining MPM-2 kinase activity was determined Mitotic cell extracts were prepared as described above followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of Sepharose or heparin-Sepharose beads. The incubation was then repeated overnight and the remaining MPM-2 kinase activity of supernatants was determined. Depleted and non-depleted mitotic extracts were diluted to 20 ng/μl with TEM (20 μl final volume), containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The reaction buffer was supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP or GTP as indicated. Three hundred ng of purified mutant or wild type htopoIIα were incubated with diluted extracts for 25 min at 37 °C. Heparin at 25 μg/ml was included in some assays to determine if this would inhibit the MPM-2 kinase. Reactions were stopped with 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer (30% glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 187 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and bromphenol blue). Nocodazole-blocked HeLa S3 cells (1 × 106) were centrifuged 5 min at room temperature at 200 × g. Pellets were washed three times with PBS prior to extraction with 200 μl of a lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.75% IGEPAL CA-630, 200 nm microcystin-LR, 200 nm okadaic acid and protease inhibitor mixture. The salt concentration of this buffer is elevated in order to extract tightly bound chromosomal proteins such as hTopoIIα. Extraction mixtures were then incubated with DNase I for 5 min at 37 °C followed by 20 min incubation at 4 °C with intermittent vortexing and centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 (immunoprecipitation buffer). Two hundred μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were then combined with 300 μl of each antibody in a total volume of 5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-conjugated beads were washed three times in the corresponding immunoprecipitation buffer prior to immunoprecipitation. One hundred μl of mitotic extracts prepared by high salt extraction were incubated with 15 μl of antibody-conjugated or non-conjugated protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. Two μl of control or TopoII immunodepleted mitotic extracts were dephosphorylated by 80 units of λ-phosphatase in a 10-μl final volume reaction mixture for 30 min at 30 °C. Dephosphorylated extracts were then incubated with 200 ng of purified CK2 for 25 min at 30 °C in 20 μl final volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm GTP, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Reactions were stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Isolated mitotic chromosomes (prepared from 2.5 × 106 HeLa S3 cells) were suspended in 25 μl of 60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 1% CHAPS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 2.5 μl of DNase I. To determine the overall presence of MPM-2 phosphoepitopes, chromosomes were diluted 1:1 with 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with the MPM-2 antibody. For rephosphorylation experiments, 2 μl of DNase-treated chromosomes were dephosphorylated by 80 units of λ-phosphatase in a 10-μl final volume. Then, chromosomes were incubated with 200 ng of purified CK2 for 25 min at 30 °C in a 20-μl final volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm GTP, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmvanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. Peptides (250 μm) were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with 100 ng of purified CK2 in a 10-μl final volume containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 40 μm ATP in the presence or absence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 mm NaCl. The ability of the peptides to compete with hTopoIIα for binding of the MPM-2 antibody was determined as described below. Two hundred ng of purified hTopoIIα was incubated either overnight at 4 °C or alternatively, for 2 h at 37 °C in 96-well immunoplates followed by blocking with 200 μl of 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. CK2-phosphorylated peptides were diluted in PBS containing 50 μg/ml heparin and 0.5 μg/ml anti-MPM-2 antibody to 100 μl final volume. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, added to hTopoIIα−coated wells, washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20-PBS (PBST), and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Wells were washed 5 times with PBST prior to incubation with secondary antibodies (1/2000 dilution in 2% BSA/PBST) for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed 5 times with PBST and MPM-2 binding revealed with soluble peroxidase substrate. Reactions were stopped after 15 min at room temperature by addition of H2SO4 followed by measurement of the optical density at 490 nm with a Dynex MRX microtiter plate reader (Dynex Technologies, Inc.). Peptides were phosphorylated by CK2 as described above. Reaction mixtures were loaded on Microcon centrifugal filters (molecular weight cut-off: 10 kDa) and centrifuged for 12 min at 10,000 × g. Eluates, containing only peptides, were saved and the final concentration adjusted to 15 μg/ml with PBS. One hundred μl of diluted peptides were loaded in 96-well immunoplates and kept 2 h at 37 °C. After three washes with 200 μl of PBS, each well was incubated with 200 μl of 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed 5 times with PBST prior to incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with the anti-MPM-2 antibody. MPM-2 reactivity was then determined as described above. Purified hTopoIIα (250 ng) was incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with 40 ng of purified CK2 in 15 μl final volume of phosphorylation buffer in the absence or presence of ATP. Then, 10 μl of anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody-conjuguated protein G beads were added, the mixture was diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of 1.5 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Purified topoisomerase II (400 ng) was first preincubated in the presence or absence of 100 units of λ phosphatase in a dephosphorylation buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mmMnCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. Alternatively, dephosphorylation was carried out with 0.1 unit of protein phosphatase 2A in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm KCl. These conditions result in complete dephosphorylation of topoisomerase II. Different amounts of topoisomerase II (1–5 ng/μl), preincubated with or without phosphatase, were then added to relaxation buffer (150 ng of pBR322 DNA, 125 mm KCl, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.75 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and reaction mixtures incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels with 1 × TBE buffer (2 mm EDTA, 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3) for 4 h at 6 V/cm at room temperature followed by staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Both protein kinase CK2 and cdc2 kinase are able to phosphorylate human topoisomerase IIα during mitosis (14Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,15Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30622-30629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine if one of these two protein kinases was also able to generate the MPM-2 epitope. The results show that the MPM-2 epitope is created on purified, recombinant human topoisomerase IIα after phosphorylation with CK2, but not after phosphorylation with cdc2 kinase (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3). Since CK2 is extensively phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase during mitosis (34Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the influence of the simultaneous presence of both CK2 and cdc2 kinase was also determined. The results show that the presence of cdc2 kinase greatly stimulates the ability of CK2 to generate the MPM-2 phosphoepitope on topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). The ability of extracts from mitotic cells to generate the MPM-2 phophoepitope was determined. The results show that the MPM-2 epitope can be created both in the presence of ATP and GTP (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3). In contrast, no MPM-2 epitope is created if low concentrations of heparin (25 ng/μl) are included in the incubation mixture (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5). These data are consistent with a role for CK2 as a topoisomerase II-directed MPM-2 kinase. To further confirm the role of CK2 as the kinase creating the MPM-2 phosphoepitope on topoisomerase IIα, mitotic extracts were either depleted with heparin-Sepharose beads, which selectively remove proteins with strong affinity to heparin such as CK2 or immunodepleted with a CK2-directed antibody. Whereas treatments with Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose beads by themselves have little effect on formation of the MPM-2 epitope (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 4), both depletion of heparin-binding proteins and CK2 immunodepletion result in complete loss of MPM-2 kinase activity (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 5). Together, these results strongly suggest that the mitotic MPM-2 epitope on topoisomerase II is generated by CK2. Recent results show that although all proteins which carry MPM-2 phosphoepitopes contain a loose MPM-2 consensus motif, peptides carrying the same sequences are only phosphorylated by a limited number of MPM-2 kinases (42Che S. Weil M.M. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Ashorn C.L. Kuang J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional interaction domains may be required for the specific phosphorylation of MPM-2 proteins by a given MPM-2 kinase. We therefore wished to determine how many of the MPM-2 reactive proteins present in isolated mitotic chromosomes might be substrates for CK2. Immunoblot analysis of isolated human prometaphase chromosomes with the MPM-2 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) reveals the presence of seven major bands in agreement with previous findings (32Logarinho E. Sunkel C.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2897-2909PubMed Google Scholar, 33Renzi L. Gersch M. Campbell M. Wu L. Osmani S. Gorbsky G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2013-2025PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of isolated chromosomes leads to almost complete loss of MPM-2 epitopes (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), which are not restored by reincubation of the dephosphorylated chromosomes with ATP or GTP (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and6). However, rephosphorylation of chromosomes by purified CK2 in the presence of either ATP or GTP results i"

Here we show that the oncogenic form of Neu is constitutively associated with the product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene and is part of a large complex that includes the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Shc. Ectopic expression of c-Cbl, a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase specific to activated tyrosine kinases, causes rapid removal of Neu from the cell surface and severely reduces signaling downstream of oncogenic Neu. c-Cbl-induced down-regulation of Neu involves covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules and requires the carboxyl-terminal domain of Neu. The negative effect of c-Cbl is antagonized by v-Cbl, a virus-encoded oncogenic truncated form of c-Cbl. In an in vivo model, infection of a Neu-transformed neuroblastoma with a c-Cbl-encoding retrovirus caused enhanced down-regulation of Neu and correlated with tumor retardation. Our results implicate c-Cbl in negative regulation of Neu and offer a potential target for treatment of HER2/ErbB-2-positive human malignancies.

The neu oncogene differs from c-neu/erbB-2 by a point mutation replacing a valine for a glutamate at position 664, which lies within the transmembrane region (7Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The resulting oncogenic protein is constitutively active as a tyrosine kinase (8Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This issue is important because recent studies have identified the c-Cbl adaptor protein as a negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for EGF (31Ettenberg S.A.

Recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGF receptor plays a key role in sorting the receptor to late endosomes, and it involves receptor ubiquitination and degradation (32Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L.

In view of the pathological significance of Neu/ErbB-2, identification of negative regulators of this oncogenic receptor is of clinical importance. We previously reported that the proto-oncogenic c-Cbl protein is specifically recruited by ErbB-1/EGF receptor but not by other ErbB proteins, including an EGFR/ErbB-2 chimeric protein, which we stimulated with EGF (40Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was drawn by Muthuswamy et al. (41Muthuswamy S.K. Gilman M. Brugge J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6845-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) who used ErbB receptor chimeras containing the synthetic ligand-binding domain of FK506-binding protein, although some residual recruitment of c-Cbl by ErbB-2 has been observed by these authors. Apparently, ErbB-2 can weakly interact with c-Cbl, either directly or indirectly through ErbB-1. Consistent with this model, recruitment of c-Cbl by ErbB-1 was reduced when newly synthesized ErbB-2 molecules were trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (42Graus Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Because Neu/ErbB-2 was shown to undergo both clathrin-mediated receptor down-regulation (43Gilboa L. Ben-Levy R. Yarden Y. Henis Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7061-7067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and poly-ubiquitination (44Magnifico A. Tagliabue E. Ardini E. Casalini P.

Here we report that c-Cbl is physically associated with and phosphorylated by the Neu oncoprotein. In agreement with this conclusion, overexpression of c-Cbl can attenuate oncogenic signaling by Neu. Our results attribute the negative effect of c-Cbl to rapid removal of Neu from the cell surface, which impairs activation of downstream effectors and early response genes. Streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Biotin-X-NHS was from Calbiochem. All other chemicals, including EGF, were purchased from Sigma. An antibody to the Shc protein was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-p85/PI 3-kinase was from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb 12CA5 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The murine mAb B10 to Neu has been previously described (8Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of Neu and c-Cbl we used a polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The active form of MAPK was detected with an antibody kindly provided by Rony Seger (Weizmann Institute). Mammalian expression plasmids for Neu, P1, c-Cbl, v-Cbl, and Cbl-C were previously described (32Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y.

The retroviral c-cbl vector was constructed by digesting pGEM4Z-c-Cbl (kindly provided by W. Langdon) with BamHI and SalI and sub-cloning into the corresponding sites of the pBabe-Puro plasmid. NIH-3T3, B104, B104-1-1 (neu-transformed 3T3-fibroblasts), 3T3-v-Src, 3T3-sp-FGF, Rat-1, and Rat1-EJ (ras-transformed fibroblasts) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Transfected CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (1:1 ratio). The 32D sub-line overexpressing either the human ErbB-2 or ErbB-2 together with ErbB-1 (denoted D2 or D12, respectively (47Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L.

Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Beit-hemeek, Israel). Expression vectors were introduced to CHO cells using the LipofectAMINETM transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In short, sub-confluent CHO monolayers, which were grown in 10-cm culture dishes, were co-transfected with 2 μg of neu constructs, either alone or in combination with 3 μg of wild type or mutant c-cbl vectors. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized with the pcDNA3 plasmid. The SRE-luciferase reporter assay was performed as described previously (48Waterman H. Alroy I. Strano S. Seger R. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3348-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) after transient transfection of the indicated vectors along with a reporter pSRE-Fluc (4 μg) containing one copy of SRE cloned upstream to thefos minimal promoter and a luciferase gene (49Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 10-cm culture dishes, washed briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm sodium fluoride (NaF), and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4). Cell lysates were cleared at 4 °C by centrifugation (12,000 × g; 10 min). Antibodies were coupled either to Sepharose-protein A or to goat anti-mouse-IgG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were incubated while shaking for 1 h at 4 οC. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), mixed with gel sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and saturated for 1 h at 22 °C in a blocking solution (1% low fat milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.025% Tween 20). Antibodies were added in the same solution and incubated at 4 °C for 12–16 h. Filters were washed extensively with TBST solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.025% Tween 20) and reacted for 40 min at 4 °C with HRP-conjugated protein A or with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins. Signals were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monolayers of cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml of a water-soluble Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) dissolved in borate buffer (10 mm boric acid and 150 mmNaCl, pH 8.0). Coupling of biotin was blocked by extensive washes with a solution of 15 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were then incubated for different time intervals at 37 °C. To evaluate the amounts of cell surface receptors, cleared cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Visualization of the biotinylated proteins was performed by probing the nitrocellulose filters with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ubiquitinated form of Neu was detected in immunoprecipitates prepared from cells that were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin (a gift from Dirk Bohmann, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) and a neu expression vector. The receptor was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody (B10), and its ubiquitination levels were determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. The pBabe-Puro-Cbl retroviral vector was transiently transfected to HEK-293T cells along with the ψ−-MLV helper-virus vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Two days later, conditioned media containing viral particles were sequentially collected every 6 h and used to infect the rat neuroblastoma B104 cell line. Puromycin-resistant clones that overexpressed c-Cbl were examined by Western blot analysis. Thein vivo tumor growth assay was performed with two groups of eight CD1/nude male mice at the age of 6 weeks (obtained from the Experimental Animals Center of the Weizmann Institute of Science). Animals were subcutaneously injected with either B104-Cbl or a control B104-Puro sub-line (2 × 106 cells per animal, suspended in 0.5 ml PBS), and tumor dimension parameters were measured after 24 days. Tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula: length × width × height. To validate volume measurements, a correlation between tumor volume and tumor weight was verified after mice were sacrificed. c-Cbl has previously been shown to associate with phosphotyrosine-containing protein complexes induced by different mitogenic signals (50Thien C.B.F. Langdon W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of a series of oncogene-transformed cells revealed that c-Cbl is constitutively associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated protein complexes in fibroblasts transformed by the oncogenic form of Neu, a transforming secreted fibroblast growth factor (sp-FGF (51Rogelj S. Weinberg R.A. Fanning P. Klagsbrun M. Nature. 1988; 331: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)) and viral Src (v-Src), but not in Ras-transformed cells (Fig.1 A). The respective untransformed control cells exhibited no such association of c-Cbl, but activation with EGF led to tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein in untransformed Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 A). A reciprocal experiment in which c-Cbl was first immunoprecipitated and then the resolved complexes were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody confirmed prominent phosphorylation of the 120-kDa c-Cbl protein (Fig.1 B). Intriguingly, the relative amount of the c-Cbl protein in v-Src-transformed cells was 10-fold lower than in other cell lines (Fig. 1, lower panels), suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms affecting the status of the c-Cbl protein. Because Neu/ErbB-2 is the preferred heterodimeric partner of the other ErbB proteins (42Graus Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 52Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), we suspected that transactivation of ErbB-1, which is endogenously expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, recruits c-Cbl to Neu. To test possible interactions between ErbB-2 homodimers and c-Cbl, we used ErbB-2-transfected cells derived from the 32D cell line, a myeloid cell line that expresses no endogenous ErbB family member (47Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). ErbB-2 homodimers were induced by using mAb N28 directed to the extracellular part of ErbB-2. Upon activation with the mAb, c-Cbl became associated with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein complex (Fig.2 A). This observation indicates that homodimers ErbB-2 can recruit c-Cbl with no involvement of ErbB-1. Nevertheless, experiments performed with 32D cells co-expressing ErbB-2 and ErbB-1 at comparable levels implied that phosphorylation of c-Cbl, which was induced by two ErbB-2-activating mAbs, N28 and N29, was significantly weaker than that induced by EGF (Fig. 2 B). In conclusion, homodimers of Neu/ErbB-2 that are induced by either a transforming mutation or bivalent antibodies can directly interact with c-Cbl, although this interaction appears significantly weaker than that exhibited by EGF-induced homodimers of ErbB-1. We have previously reported that the oncogenic form of Neu is constitutively associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (22Peles E. Lamprecht R. Ben-Levy R. Tzahar E. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12266-12274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, c-Cbl was shown to form a phosphotyrosine-dependent physical complex with this Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein in EGF-stimulated cells (53Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,54Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These observations, when combined with our conclusion that c-Cbl can directly interact with Neu, predict the existence of a ternary complex. Indeed, complexes of Neu·Cbl, Neu·p85 and p85·Cbl were detectable by using a co-immunoprecipitation assay in Neu-transformed cells. Interestingly, similar complexes apparently exist in v-Src-transformed fibroblasts but not in the relevant parental NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Experiments that are not presented suggest that the physical association observed in v-Src-transformed cells was due to tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous murine ErbB-2 by v-Src. Taken together, the results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 suggest that in addition to activation of positive effectors, like PI 3-kinase and Shc (see below), the oncogenic form of Neu recruits the negative regulator c-Cbl. Because overexpression of c-Cbl can enhance endocytic removal of ErbB-1/EGF receptors and subsequently accelerates their degradation (32Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 33Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we examined whether it similarly down-regulates the oncogenic Neu receptor. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding the oncogenic Neu protein, and thereafter the surface of cell monolayers was labeled with biotin. The rate of turnover of the surface-associated Neu protein was then traced by immunoprecipitation followed by blotting with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. In the absence of an overexpressed c-Cbl protein, Neu molecules remained at the cell surface for more than 3 h. However, when we co-expressed Neu and c-Cbl the receptor almost completely disappeared from the cell surface (Fig.4 A). Lack of expression of Neu at the cell surface was not a result of reduced transcription because the intracellular pool of Neu was hardly influenced by c-Cbl (Fig.4 A, middle panel). This conclusion was also supported by analysis of neu transcript levels by using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). Thus, c-Cbl primarily affects Neu molecules residing at the cell surface. Because high expression of c-Cbl led to close to complete disappearance of Neu from the cell surface, we used lower amounts of the expression plasmids and tested Neu-mediated signaling. As expected, c-Cbl-induced receptor down-regulation was accompanied by a decrease in receptor signaling; a marked decrement in both phosphorylation of Neu and its association with Shc molecules was observed upon gradual overexpression of c-Cbl (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, by using an antibody specific to the active form of MAPK, we found that overexpression of Neu stimulated MAPK activity, but moderate ectopic expression of c-Cbl inhibited the effect of Neu on MAPK (Fig. 4 B). In accordance with the ability of c-Cbl to enhance ubiquitination of ErbB-1, we found that covalent attachment of a co-expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin to Neu was significantly enhanced in the presence of an overexpressed c-Cbl (Fig. 4 C). Although c-Cbl-induced poly-ubiquitination of Neu was associated with enhanced degradation of the receptor, immunoblotting analysis indicated that only a small portion of Neu underwent poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). This observation is consistent with observations made with other c-Cbl-coupled receptors (32Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y.

The SH2 domain of c-Cbl mediates its interaction with cytoplasmic as well as membranal protein kinases (e.g. ZAP-70, and the receptors for platelet-derived growth factor and EGF, reviewed in Ref.50Thien C.B.F. Langdon W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By using a mutant form of c-Cbl, denoted Cbl-C, whose SH2 domain was deleted, we learned that this domain was essential for Cbl-induced down-regulation of Neu. Thus, Cbl-C exhibited an impaired ability to induce down-regulation of cell surface Neu molecules labeled with biotin, and it also failed to suppress Shc association with the oncoprotein (Fig. 5 A).

Recently, a novel class of cellular proteins characterized by a specific protein motif, the PDZ domain, has been shown to be targeted by viral transforming proteins. The PDZ domain, the name of which corresponds to the first letter of PSD-95 (a post-synaptic density protein), Discs-large (a Drosophilatumor suppressor), and ZO-1 (a tight junction protein), is known to be present in a rapidly increasing number of proteins exhibiting diverse functions (1Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 102-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The proteins E4 open reading frame 1 of adenovirus type 9, E6 of human papilloma virus type 16 or 18, and Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 have been shown to interact with hDlg, the human homologue of the Drosophila Discs-large tumor suppressor via its PDZ domains (3Lee S.S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The HTLV-11 Tax protein has also been shown to interact with a series of cellular proteins characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain (6Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid studies have shown that the PDZ domain recognizes the X-(S/T)-X-V-COOH motif, X being any amino acid, at the C-terminal ends of proteins (7Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This model of interaction stems from study of the interaction of PSD-95 with subunits of the glutamate receptor, as well as with shaker type potassium channels (8Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 9Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). These original observations have been extensively confirmed with various PDZ proteins and have also received support from resolution of the structure of the third domain of PSD-95 in complex with a 9-amino acid peptide (10Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). This showed that the peptide forms an antiparallel β-sheet with strand β-B of the PDZ domain that includes six β strands interrupted by two α helices (10Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acids of the peptide exchange several hydrogen bonds with a loop between strands β-A and β-B. A systematic study of peptides able to interact with particular PDZ domains has shown that many variations were possible on the basis of the X-(S/T)-X-V-COOH consensus (11Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The C-terminal valine can be substituted with other hydrophobic or aromatic residues in the case of particular PDZ domains. This suggests that a specific relationship exists between a given PDZ domain and the C terminus of the associated proteins. If a number of PDZ proteins are cytoplasmic or localized at the inner side of the membrane, where they can interact with transmembrane receptors, playing an important role in receptor clustering and signal transduction (12Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 209-233PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), this is not a general feature. Indeed PDZ domains have been identified in nuclear proteins (14Poulat F. Barbara P.S. Desclozeaux M. Soullier S. Moniot B. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Berta P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), as in Bridge-1, which acts as a coactivator for the E12 basic helix-loop-helix factor (15Thomas M.K. Yao K.M. Tenser M.S. Wong G.G. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8492-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). From what is currently known about PDZ proteins, it is clear that the presence of a PDZ domain correlates with association with a protein partner, but not with a specific function. In a previous study, several PDZ proteins were identified as able to bind to the C-terminal end of the HTLV-1 Tax protein (6Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here we report cloning of the complete cDNA of one of them, TIP-1. The protein corresponding to this cDNA has been characterized, and a two-hybrid study showed that TIP-1 binds to human rhotekin (h-rhotekin), an effector of the Rho GTPases. An effect of RhoA, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 on activation of the c-Fos serum response element is characterized. Full-length TIP-1 cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR using the Human Leukocyte Marathon-Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH). To generate pGB-TIP-1, TIP-1 cDNA was amplified using Pfupolymerase, digested with SalI restriction enzyme, and inserted between the SmaI and SalI restriction sites of pGBgly, which is a derivative of pGB-T9 (CLONTECH). The pTL-TIP-1 plasmid was made by subcloning the TIP-1 cDNA into the EcoRI restriction site of pTL1, which is a pSG5 derivative (16Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression vector pET1 was constructed by inserting the TIP-1 cDNA, amplified by PCR with an oligonucleotide creating an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end, between the NdeI and BamHI restrictions sites of pET11d (Novagen). The pSGF-h-rhotekin was constructed in two steps. h-rhotekin cDNA was amplified by PCR from the pACT yeast clone and inserted into pGEM-T (Promega). TheSalI restriction fragment obtained from this plasmid was inserted into the XhoI restriction site of pSG-Flag vector (17Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSGF-h-rhotekin Cm in which the C-terminal serine and valine residues were changed into alanine was obtained by amplification of the h-rhotekin c-DNA with a 3′ oligonucleotide creating the mutation and insertion of the resulting DNA fragment in pSGF. The presence of the mutation was verified by sequencing. The following plasmids have been described previously: EXV-RhoA.V14 (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), SRE, and SRE-APm (mSRE in original publication; Ref. 19Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The SRE and SRE-APm reporter constructs are derivatives of pBL-CAT4 bearing the SRE motif inserted in theSalI restriction site in the sense orientation. The sequences inserted in these constructs are 5′-tcgACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCGTCAGC-3′ and 5′-tcgACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCcTtAGC-3′, for SRE and SRE-APm, respectively. Plasmid pCEV29-RhoAN19 was kindly provided by Silvio Gutkind through Marc Billaud. TIP-1 protein was produced in E. coli from the pET1 expression vector. In induced bacteria TIP-1 protein was present within inclusion bodies. After lysis by sonication, these inclusion bodies were purified as described previously (20Wallis O.C. Wallis M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After solubilization in SDS loading buffer, TIP-1 was purified by electrophoresis through a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The 14-kDa band corresponding to TIP-1 was lyophilized and, after mixing with adjuvant, injected into a rabbit. Two-hybrid screen was carried out using the Matchmaker II kit (CLONTECH), according to manufacturer's instructions. HF7c yeast strain including pGB-TIP-1 was further transformed with a cDNA library of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphocytes (21Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were plated on SD medium complemented with Ura, Lys, and Ade, along with 5 mm aminotrizole. Isolation of transformants and β-galactosidase assays on filters were performed as described previously (6Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). From an initial screen of 7.4 × 106transformants, 265 clones grew on minimal medium lacking His and were positive for β-galactosidase expression. Plasmids from these colonies were recovered and transformed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue by electroporation as described previously (22Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). COS7 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for regular culture and 5% FCS for transfection, which was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. COS7 cells were grown in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes and were transfected with 1 μg of pTL-TIP-1 and 1.5 μg of vectors expressing RhoA.V14 or F-h-rhotekin. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 15 μg with pBSK+. HeLa cells were grown in 6-cm diameter Petri dishes and were transfected with the following amounts of plasmids: 0.4 μg of SRE or SRE-APm reporter plasmids, 1 μg of pTL-TIP-1, 1.5 μg of vectors expressing RhoA.V14, RhoA.N19, or F-h-rhotekin. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 7.5 μg, and the amount of SV40 promoter containing expression vectors was adjusted to 4.5 μg with pSG5. For COS7 cells, the precipitate was washed 16 h after its addition and cells were further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% FCS for 36 h before lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 447-470Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm, and supernatants were used for immunoblot or for immunoprecipitation, which were performed as described (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 447-470Google Scholar). All antibodies were diluted 1:250 for immunoprecipitation and 1:500 for immunoblotting. After transfection, HeLa cells were grown 16 h in medium with 5% FCS, and 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FCS. Induction by serum was made by incubating cells for 8 h in medium supplemented with 15% FCS. CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). 5 × 107 HeLa or NIH3T3 cells were harvested and washed twice in PBS. The cellular pellet was resuspended in five volumes of buffer A: 10 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated 10 min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged 10 min at 1000 rpm, and pellet was resuspended in three volumes of buffer A. 0.05% Nonidet P-40 was added and the suspension was homogenized with 20 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer to release the nuclei. After a centrifugation of 10 min at 1000 rpm, the supernatant was kept (solution 1) and the pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of buffer B (5 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 26% glycerol (v/v), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Total volume was measured and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 300 mm. After incubation for 30 min on ice and centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 rpm, the supernatant containing the nuclear fraction was snap-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Solution 1 was then centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm. Pellet containing membranes, resuspended in TE, pH 8.0, and supernatant corresponding to the cytoplasmic fraction were stored at −80 °C. Screening by the two-hybrid method with HTLV-1 Tax protein as bait led to isolation of six different proteins, including one or several PDZ domains (6Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Three of them were related to previously characterized proteins, PSD-95, β1-syntrophin, and lin-7. As a first step to characterize TIP-1 encoded by one of the clones previously identified, its full-length cDNA was isolated from a leukocyte library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cDNA included an in-frame stop codon 25 codons upstream from an AUG, which hence was considered as the initiation codon. The reading frame starting at this position encodes a 124-amino acid protein, which mainly corresponds to a PDZ domain flanked by 14 and 12 amino acids at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, respectively. The calculated molecular mass is 13.7 kDa. Data bank searches identified expressed sequence tags encoding a murine homologue and analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome showed the existence of a homologue in this distant organism. In these three species, the number of amino acids is conserved and an alignment with the ClustalW program (24Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) shows a good conservation (Fig.1). In particular, the high number of amino acids between strand βB and βC of TIP-1, as compared with other PDZ domains (6Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is observed in these three species. This part is likely to confer some specificity to the PDZ domain of TIP-1. In order to characterize the product of the human cDNA, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against TIP-1 protein produced in bacteria. Immunoblot analysis of a COS7 cells extract with this antibody gave some background, but a band was clearly revealed at 14 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–5). Transfection of the COS7 cells with a mammalian expression vector including the entire coding sequence increased the intensity of this 14-kDa band (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). These observations confirmed the proposed reading frame for the cDNA. Expression of TIP-1 was detected in various cell lines as COS7 (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), HeLa (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), CV1 (Fig.2 A, lane 4), and BHK21 (Fig.2 A, lane 5). However, by comparison with these cell lines, TIP-1 appeared weakly expressed in PBLs as well as in T-cell lines expressing Tax. 2C. Reynaud, unpublished data.Figure 1Sequence of TIP-1 protein.

Immunoblot analysis of these extracts unambiguously showed that the endogenous protein is in the cytoplasmic soluble fraction (Fig. 1 B), its presence being only detected in this fraction. It is now well established that PDZ domains bind to the C-terminal end of their partner proteins. In order to identify such partner proteins, a two-hybrid screen was performed with a bait corresponding to the entire TIP-1 coding sequence fused to that encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain. A total of 7.4 million transformants were analyzed. Analysis of 265 positive clones showed that many corresponded to the GAL4 DNA binding domain associated out of frame with a cDNA, the resulting fusion protein ending by a motif matching the consensus X-(S/T)-X-V-COOH known for proteins able to bind PDZ domains.2 Besides these artifactual constructs, two different clones corresponded to a cDNA encoding the human homologue of rhotekin, which was originally identified as a protein preferentially associating with a mutated form of RhoC that mimicked the GTP-bound form of this small GTPase (25Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The authors showed that rhotekin can associate with the activated form of RhoA and RhoC, but not with that of Rac or Cdc42, and they described the existence of three different splice variants of rhotekin (25Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The two cDNAs obtained in the two-hybrid screen performed with TIP-1 correspond to a different form, one that lacks part of the sequence at the N-terminal end. Alignment of the human and mouse forms shows a very good conservation between these two species, in particular in the Rho binding domain (Fig. 3). This latter domain is likely to fold into an antiparallel coiled-coil finger, which binds to Rho, as was recently shown for the homologous Rho binding domain of PKN (26Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a 6-amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end, WLQSPV-COOH, is perfectly conserved and fits with theX-(S/T)-X-V-COOH consensus. This strongly suggested that rhotekin binds to the PDZ domain of TIP-1 by its C-terminal end. To further validate the interaction between TIP-1 and h-rhotekin, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. COS7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing TIP-1 and h-rhotekin fused at its N-terminal end to the Flag epitope. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and analyzed with the antibody to TIP-1. This experiment showed that h-rhotekin associates with TIP-1 in these cells (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). To establish that this interaction indeed relies on the C terminus of rhotekin, a double point mutation was introduced to change the natural sequence QSPV-COOH to QAPA-COOH. This C-terminal mutant of Rhotekin was unable to precipitate TIP-1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), which was, however, clearly present in the extract (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Analysis of the blot with the anti-Flag antibody showed that equal amounts of wild type and mutated h-rhotekin were precipitated in this experiment.2 It was also verified that h-rhotekin indeed binds to the active form of Rho. COS7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing the Flag-tagged h-rhotekin and the active RhoA.V14 mutant fused to the Myc epitope. Immunoblot analysis with the antibody to Flag of proteins immunoprecipitated with the antibody to the Myc epitope clearly revealed presence of h-rhotekin (Fig. 4 B). Collectively, these results show that h-rhotekin binds to the activated form of RhoA and to TIP-1. The former interaction involves the Rho binding domain at the N-terminal end of h-rhotekin (25Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and the latter the C-terminal extremity of this protein as demonstrated here. Given the small size of Rho and TIP-1 proteins and that the domains involved are completely different, these interactions are likely not to be mutually exclusive. Rho GTPases are involved in many important cellular functions such as cytoskeleton reorganization, cell growth control, development, and transcriptional regulation (27Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Various effectors binding to the GTP-bound active form of Rho have been identified (25Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,28Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous observations (29Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a detailed analysis relying on mutants in the RhoA effector loop has clearly established the involvement of the ROCK kinase in stress fiber induction as well as cell transformation by Rho (30Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). By contrast, the effectors linking active Rho to activation of the SRE/CArG box are still uncharacterized. Therefore, the effect of h-rhotekin and TIP-1 in this pathway was investigated. HeLa cells were transfected with a CAT reporter construct including the wild type c-Fos SRE upstream of the TK promoter (19Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured in low amounts (0.5%) of fetal calf serum. Under these conditions, treatment of the cells by serum led to a clear activation of transcription (Fig.5, lane 1). Expression of RhoA.V14 in cells kept in low serum also stimulated transcription (Fig. 5, lane 2). Transfection of the cells with the vector expressing h-rhotekin did not cause a significant activation, nor did it modify the effect exerted by RhoA.V14 (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5). Expression of TIP-1 led to an activation similar to that exerted by RhoA.V14 and did not significantly modify the effect of this latter protein (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6). The stimulatory effect of TIP-1 was also observed in COS7 cells.2 Interestingly, coexpression of all three factors, RhoA.V14, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 led to a strong activation, above that exerted by serum treatment (Fig. 5, lane 7). This effect was dependent on RhoA.V14 since h-rhotekin and TIP-1 in combination gave an effect similar to that exerted by TIP-1 alone (Fig.5, lane 8). Expression of h-rhotekin, TIP-1, or both proteins together did not modify the amount of RhoA.V14 produced in the transfected cells,2 indicating that activation did not result merely from an increase of the RhoA activator. This effect was also tested with the reporter construct SRE-APm, which includes a SRE mutated in the flanking AP-1 site (19Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similarly to what was observed previously, TIP-1 was as active as RhoA.V14 (Fig.6, lanes 2 and4) and combination of RhoA.V14, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 led to a marked increase (Fig. 6, lane 5). Under the same conditions, the parental plasmid pBL-CAT4 was unresponsive to expression of these proteins.2 These data show that the combination RhoA.V14, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 markedly enhances the activity of the SRE and that this effect does not involve the flanking AP-1 site. It was checked whether this effect is indeed dependent on the active form of Rho. This was done by testing the effect of the overexpression of h-rhotekin and TIP-1 with RhoA.N19 that is a dominant negative mutant. These experiments were performed with the SRE-APm reporter construct. Whereas the strong activation with RhoA.V14 was clearly seen, a much lower effect was observed with RhoA.N19 (Fig.7, compare lanes 3and 5). This clearly shows that the effect observed with the combination of all three proteins depends on the active state of Rho. It was further asked whether the observed activation depends on the binding of rhotekin to TIP-1. To analyze this point, the effect exerted by wild type rhotekin was compared with that of the C-terminal mutant, which is unable to bind TIP-1. These experiments showed that this mutation clearly reduces the activation (Fig.8, compare lanes 5and 6). These results show that the strong effect produced by the combination of RhoA, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 depends on the active form of RhoA as well as on the binding of h-rhotekin to TIP-1. Taken together these data support the notion that activation of the enhancer activity of the SRE results from formation of a complex between active RhoA, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1. The Rho small GTPases have multiple functions and affect key regulatory cellular processes (27Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar, 28Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). In agreement with these pleiotropic effects, numerous effectors able to bind these GTPases in their active state have been identified. Some of these effectors exhibit kinase activity, whereas the others have no known enzymatic activity. Previous studies have implicated the kinase ROCK in induction of stress fibers and also cell transformation (29Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our results show that h-rhotekin and TIP-1 markedly increase transactivation of the c-Fos SRE by RhoA.V14. The PDZ protein TIP-1 can by itself produce a significant activation of the same intensity as that exerted by RhoA.V14. h-rhotekin alone showed no or weak effects. This indicates that TIP-1 is probably downstream of h-rhotekin in the pathway leading to SRE activation. However, it is clear that TIP-1 alone cannot produce the strong activation seen with all three components. This indicates that the complex of all three proteins is necessary to trigger maximal activation. The results of fractionation experiments show that TIP-1 is cytoplasmic. This observation is in agreement with immunofluorescence analyses, which showed that overexpressed RhoA.V14, h-rhotekin, and TIP-1 are co-localized in the cytoplasm. 3S. Fabre, unpublished data. The nature of the signal emitted by the association of RhoA.V14, h-rhotekin, and TIP1 that causes activation of the SRE within the nucleus remains to be understood. Interestingly, Sotiropoulos et al. (31Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) have shown recently that LIM kinase-1 (LIMK-1) is able to activate SRF by acting on the actin dynamics. This kinase would exert its effect by increasing the amount of monomeric actin versus polymerized actin. How the increased monomeric actin modifies the activity of SRF is presently unknown. Interestingly, LIMK-1 includes a PDZ domain. One can wonder whether a specific effector might bridge activated Rho and LIMK-1 by interacting both with GTP-bound Rho and LIMK-1 via the PDZ domain. Rhotekin might exert such a function. When the C-terminal ends of the various Rho effectors are compared, it appears that rhotekin is not the only protein exhibiting a PDZ domain binding site (PDZ-BS). The C-terminal end of Citron also fits with the PDZ-BS consensus (TableI). In agreement with this observation, an interaction of Citron with PSD-95 in GABAergic neurons from the hippocampus has been reported (32Zhang W. Vazquez L. Apperson M. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 96-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rhophilin exhibits a threonine at position −2, but the C-terminal residue is a proline. In the study by Songyang et al. (11Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), a proline was never observed as C-terminal residue, raising doubts about the notion that this Rho effector C-terminal end can represent a functional PDZ-BS. The other kinase Rho effectors do not include a PDZ-BS. Additional studies will be required to determine whether or not rhotekin and Citron can bridge activated Rho with LIMK-1.Table IComparison of the sequences of the C-terminal ends of Rho effectorsRhotekin Mm...FYSKSQLGPWLQSPV-cCitron Mm...TPLSQVNKVWDQSSV-cRhophilin Mm...SHPDPCTNRNCVTCP-cPKN Hs...EQAAFLDFDFVAGGC-cRock-1 Mm...QSFRKVVKNTSGKTS-cRock-2 Mm...SIRRPSRQLAPNKPS-cP140mDia Mm...PTILEEAKELVGRAS-cThe residues matching the X-(S/T)-X-V-COOH consensus for binding to PDZ domains are in bold.

A number of PDZ proteins are known to interact with the cytoskeleton (33Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 34Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A.

Despite its small size, it is possible that TIP-1 also has this property. Such a possibility could be related to an effect of TIP-1 on actin polymerization. It could also allow the anchoring of Rho-containing protein complexes at specific sites. A way to explain the multiplicity of the effects of Rho, as well as the high number of its effectors, could be that it is present at different specialized subcellular sites. A PDZ protein as TIP-1 could allow anchoring of the effector and, as a consequence, of active Rho at a particular position, leading to a given effect. A scaffold role for proteins with multiple PDZ domains is now well established (36Scott K. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Tsunoda S. Sierralta J.

Biol. 1997; 7: R770-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precise studies of the subcellular localization of the Rho effectors and of the corresponding PDZ proteins, when appropriate, should allow the testing of such an hypothesis. Our results establish that PDZ proteins could be important molecules in the Rho pathways, in particular activation of the SRE, and that an effector like rhotekin can act as a bridge between Rho and such PDZ proteins. Interestingly, another class of molecules participating in the regulation of the Rho activity exhibit PDZ domains: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF). Such a domain is indeed present in KIAA0380, a Rho-specific GEF (39Rumenapp U. Blomquist A. Schworer G. Schablowski H. Psoma A. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, another GEF, NET1 (40Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar), includes a functional PDZ-BS. 4S. Fabre and C. Reynaud, unpublished data. These observations raise the possibility that PDZ domains play an important role in the organization of the Rho effects, both upstream and downstream of these important cellular regulators.

Its essential physiological role in modifying the topology of DNA involves the generation of transient double-strand breaks. Anti-cancer drugs, such as mitoxantrone, that target this enzyme interrupt its catalytic cycle and give rise to persistent double strand breaks, which may be lethal to a cell. We investigated the role of such lesions in signaling the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) by this drug. Mitoxantrone activated NFκB and stimulated IκBα degradation in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 but not in the variant cells, HL60/MX2 cells, which lack the β isoform of topoisomerase II and express a truncated α isoform that results in an altered subcellular distribution. Treatment of sensitive HL60 cells with mitoxantrone led to a depletion of both isoforms, suggesting the stabilization of transient DNA-topoisomerase II complexes. This depletion was absent in the variant cells, HL60/MX2. Activation of caspase 3 by mitoxantrone was also impaired in the HL60/MX2 cells. NFκB activation in response to tumor necrosis factor and bleomycin, the latter causing topoisomerase II-independent DNA damage, was intact in both cell lines. An inhibitor rather than a poison of topoisomerase II, Imperial Cancer Research Fund 187 (ICRF 187) the mechanism of which does not involve the generation of double strand breaks, did not activate NFκB, nor did it induce apoptosis in parental HL60 cells. However, ICRF 187 protected against IκB degradation in parental HL60 cells in response to mitoxantrone. This protection was also shown with another topoisomerase II inhibitor, merbarone, which is structurally and functionally distinct from ICRF 187. Their effects were specific, as neither protected against tumor necrosis factor-stimulated IκB degradation.

Such genes may encode proteins that determine the commitment of a cell to mitotic arrest, damage repair, proliferation, or even apoptosis. The regulation and role of the inducible transcription factor NFκB has been studied intensely during recent years. NFκB is present in diverse cell types, activated in response to diverse stimuli by complex signaling pathways involving several protein-protein interactions and phosphorylations (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Typically, NFκB resides in the cytosol as a dimer composed of subunits belonging to the Rel family of proteins, the prototype comprising a p50 and p65/RelA subunit. p50/p65(RelA) heterodimers have a potent transcriptional activating potential, whereas p50 homodimers lack transactivation activity due to the absence of a transcriptional activation domain (9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 11Boland M.P. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). NFκB heterodimers are sequestered in the cytosol through interactions with an inhibitor protein termed IκB, of which there are a number of isoforms (13Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The classical pathway to NFκB activation involves the phosphorylation of IκBα on two critical serine residues at positions 32 and 36, within its amino-terminal regulatory domain (14Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, IκBα is subjected to polyubiquitination at two lysine residues, which also reside within this domain (15Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) and which target the protein for subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (16Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Bowie A.G. Moynagh P.N. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol.

Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The primary target for these drugs and/or the nature of the lesion induced that mediates the signal leading to NFκB activation is unknown, however. Like many chemotherapeutic agents, these drugs exert their anti-neoplastic effects in susceptible cells by inducing apoptosis (26Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which anthracycline-type drugs kill cells has been proposed to involve intercalation of the planar aglycone moiety into the DNA (affecting DNA replication and transcription) and redox cycling resulting in the oxidative damage of cellular macromolecules and lipid membranes (reviewed in Ref. 27Gerwirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). However, given that mitoxantrone causes minimal oxidative stress in target cells (28Fisher G.R. Patterson L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Vile G.F. Winterbourne C.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1989; 24: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), its apoptotic effects can be exclusively correlated with its ability to induce DNA damage, specifically DNA double strand breaks, by direct interaction with a family of enzymes known as type II topoisomerases (30Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Collectively, these enzymes affect the topology of DNA, and their importance is underscored by their involvement in virtually every aspect of DNA metabolism, chromosomal organization, and segregation (31Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 32Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of topoisomerase II enzymes in mammalian cells, an α and a β form, which differ in their molecular weight and are the products of two separate genes. Their amino-terminal sequence is highly conserved, but they only maintain 35% homology in their carboxyl termini, which has been proposed to account for differences in their cellular distribution (31Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 33Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The α form is localized to the nuclear matrix, whereas the β form is non-matrix-associated and localizes preferentially in the nucleoli. A nucleolar localization has, however, been disputed recently, with evidence being presented for the β form being nuclear but not nucleolar (34Cowell I.G. Willmore E. Chalton D. Marsh K.L. Jazrawi E. Fisher L.M. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 243: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These enzymes may have distinct and overlapping physiological roles, suggested by their differential expression and phosphorylation during mitosis and transformation (31Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 32Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The α form, a substrate for casein kinase II (35Redwood C. Davies S.L. Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), may be preferentially involved in DNA transcription accounting for its enhanced expression during mitosis (36Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been termed a proliferative marker. The β form has been proposed to have a preferential role in ribosomal RNA transcription and is excluded from the nuclear scaffold during mitosis, diffusing into the cytosol (32Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 33Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The expression of this isoform generally increases during transformation, in contrast with its more constitutive expression in normal cells, suggesting a role for it in transformation. Topoisomerase II enzyme action involves sequential DNA binding, cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone, intact second strand passage, religation of the cleaved DNA strand, and enzyme turnover, which is an energy-dependent process involving the hydrolysis of ATP (30Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Anthracycline and related anthracenedione drugs stabilize or “trap” the intermediate in this reaction, giving rise to a “cleavable complex” and are therefore termed “poisons.” This trapping is thought to block or prevent the religation step and gives rise to the presence of protein-associated double strand breaks. In effect, anthracyclines and anthracenediones form ternary complexes with DNA and the enzyme and stimulate DNA cleavage in a sequence-specific manner (37Capranico G. Binaschi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Correlations between the level of target enzyme, drug induced strand breaks, and sensitivity toward drug-induced cell killing have been shown (38Davies S.M. Robson C.N. Davies S.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17724-17729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there remains some controversy regarding the preferential targeting of different isoforms by different categories of topoisomerase II-targeted drugs (39Brown G.A.

Tilby M.J. Li L. Li G. Li W. Baguley B.C. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II β may be the more important target, however, as cells deficient in this form are less sensitive to killing by mitoxantrone (44Errington F. Willmore E. Tilby M.J. Li L. Li G. Li W. Baguley B.C. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of topoisomerase II in NFκB activation by mitoxantrone. We have utilized a resistant variant of the promyelocytic cell line HL60, termed HL60/MX2, which, compared with the parental line, is 34-fold more resistant to cell killing by mitoxantrone (45Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Dalton W.S. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4542-4549PubMed Google Scholar, 46Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Drake F.H. Parr R.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9953-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This resistance has been correlated with a complete absence of the expression of the topoisomerase II β isoform. Furthermore, the topoisomerase II α transcript has a deletion in its 3′ end, resulting in a truncated protein with altered subcellular distribution and possibly altered drug sensitivity (47Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Parr R.L. Hoguin M.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4962-4971PubMed Google Scholar). Our data support a direct relationship between cell killing, NFκB activation, and the targeting of topoisomerase II enzymes by this drug, indicating a novel pathway to NFκB activation involving DNA double strand breaks generated by the poisoning of topoisomerase II.

For treatments, cells in late log phase of growth were resuspended in complete medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air (for 16 h prior to stimulation). Following stimulation (4 h unless otherwise stated), incubations were discontinued by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and either nuclear or whole cell extracts (for IκB and CPP32 determinations) were prepared as described previously (2Boland M.P.

Treatments using the radiomimetic drug bleomycin were carried out for 2 h only. Where required, cells were preincubated with the topoisomerase II inhibitors ICRF 187 or merbarone for 1 h, prior to the addition of either drug (4 h) or cytokine (1 h). Cell extracts for the analysis of topoisomerase II isoform content were prepared according to the method described by Drake et al. (48Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M. Hall D.J.

Protein concentration determinations were made using the Bradford assay with bovine albumin as standard.

Equal amounts of whole cell lysate protein (as indicated) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% running gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and IκBα or CPP32 immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (2Boland M.P.

Samples for topoisomerase II protein detection were resolved on 7% gels and, following transfer, incubated with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:250 (0.4 μg/ml) in 1% dry milk in 1× phosphate buffered saline and 0.5% Tween 20. Secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000. The blots were developed by chemiluminescent detection (ECL) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Following treatment, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (48Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M. Hall D.J. J. Biol.

Samples were resolved on 7% gels and, following transfer, incubated with primary antibody to both topoisomerase II isoforms (as described above) or with isoform-specific antibodies (polyclonal) at a dilution of 1:500; samples were resolved in 1% dry milk in 1× phosphate buffered saline and 0.5% Tween 20. Secondary antibody concentrations and detection were also as described above. Previously we have shown that mitoxantrone could activate NFκB in a dose-dependent manner in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (2Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we have compared this activation with that in a derived variant of this cell line, HL60/MX2 (42McPherson J.P. Deffie A.M. Jones N.R. Brown G.A. Deuchars K.L. Goldenberg G.J. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 4243-4252PubMed Google Scholar, 43Son Y.S. Suh J.M. Ahn S.H. Kim J.C. Yi J.Y. Hur K.C. Hong W.-S. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Cancer Chemother.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which has reduced levels of both topoisomerase II α and β and is resistant to cell kill by mitoxantrone. NFκB activation was not observed in the HL60/MX2 cell line, compared with a dose-responsive activation in the parental cell line, demonstrated by the detection of protein-DNA complexes in nuclear extracts from drug-treated cells (Fig.1 A). Concentrations of 50–1000 nm mitoxantrone activated NFκB (lanes 2–6) in the parental line, whereas these concentrations were ineffective in the HL60/MX2 cell line (lanes 8–12). However, both cell lines showed comparable NFκB activation following stimulation with the cytokine, TNF (2 ng/ml) (lanes 13 and14, respectively). A dose-dependent degradation of the inhibitor protein, IκBα, a key signal for NFκB activation (9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar), was also observed in the parental but not the HL60/MX2 cell line in response to mitoxantrone (Fig. 1 B). Concentrations from 500 nm clearly induced IκB degradation in the parental line (lanes 3–5) but not in the HL60/MX2 cell line (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9–11), which supported the NFκB activation data. This degradation was comparable in both cell lines in response to TNF (2 ng/ml) (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 6 and 12). We also tested another DNA damaging agent in both cell lines, bleomycin, the effects of which are not topoisomerase II-dependent (49Sikic B.I. Cancer Surv. 1986; 5: 81-91PubMed Google Scholar). This agent induced IκBα degradation in both HL60 and HL60/MX2 cells (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4), although its effect was less pronounced than mitoxantrone in parental HL60 cells or TNF in both cell lines (Fig.1 B). Although bleomycin was a weaker activator of NFκB, this may be explained by its ability to cause DNA strand scission resulting in both single and double strand breaks, the former perhaps being a less potent signal for this effect. Densitometric scanning performed on the immunoblot data (Fig. 1 C) showed similar levels of IκBα degradation (47 and 45%) when compared with control values for both parental and variant HL60/MX2 cells in response to bleomycin. Non-topoisomerase II-targeted drugs that damage DNA can therefore activate NFκB and are independent of the topoisomerase II levels in target cells. To confirm the phenotype of both cell lines, Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts was performed with an antibody that recognized both the α and β isoforms of the topoisomerase II enzyme (Fig.2 A). Both isoforms were detected in the parental cell line (Fig. 2 A, lane 1–3), whereas expression of the β isoform was negligible in extracts from the HL60/MX2 cells (lane 4–6). The expression of both isoforms was unaffected by treatment of cells with mitoxantrone (250 and 500 nm, Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–3 and5–6). Formation of transient DNA-topoisomerase II complexes is stabilized by some topoisomerase II poisons, such as mitoxantrone. Employing a band depletion assay on nuclear extracts from treated cells, the functionality of either the drug or the topoisomerase II target can be determined (50Mo Y.-Y. Beck W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following treatment of parental HL60 cells with mitoxantrone (Fig. 2 B), the intensity of a band representing both isoforms decreased as drug concentration increased (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4). The extraction protocol used in the band depletion assay prevented the resolution of both topoisomerase II isoforms, which migrated as a single band. Importantly, no band depletion was seen following treatment of the resistant variant cells, HL60/MX2 (lanes 5–7). Furthermore, employing an antibody that recognizes the α isoform of topoisomerase II (Fig.2 C), its specific depletion was shown in parental HL60 cells (lanes 1–4) but not in the variant cells, HL60/MX2 (lanes 5–8), confirming the resistance of the α isoform to mitoxantrone in the HL60/MX2 line. In addition, when an antibody that specifically recognizes the β isoform of topoisomerase II was used, mitoxantrone treatment caused a depletion of the β isoform in parental HL60"

The rapid kinetic of the down-regulation has suggested that it may result from a primary mechanism. We show here that p53 also suppresses the transcription of a presenilin-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter synthetic gene in transient infection assays in neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines. Only a minimum promoter including sequences from −35 to + 6 from the transcription initiation is sufficient to confer down-regulation. We have previously defined a crucial DNA element controlling 90% of the expression of the gene within the same short area, and the identification of the transcription factors involved should also provide insights into the regulation ofPS1by p53. This region contains an Ets transcription factor binding motif, and a 2-base pair alteration within the core sequence (GGAA to TTAA) of the Ets consensus also reduced transcription by more than 90%. We now show that Ets1 and Ets2 indeed transactivate a PS1promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter including the (−35 to +6) fragment. Furthermore, in vitro translated Ets2 binds specifically to the −10 Ets motif in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Therefore, Ets1/2 factors bind specifically to the −10 Ets element and activatePS1transcription. We also show that the coactivator p300 enhances the activation by Ets1 and Ets2 as well as the repression by p53. p300 is known to interact with p53 as well as with Ets1 and Ets2. We show that p53 does not bind directly to the PS1promoter. Hence the repression of PS1transcription by p53 is likely to be mediated through protein-protein interactions.

Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that PS1 itself may contain γ secretase catalytic activity (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence that an endoprotease activity crucial for normal biological function is contained in PS1 or requires PS1 has also been derived from examining the function of PS1 in Notch receptor cleavage and activation. The PS1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans, SEL-12, is required for Notch receptor signaling and cell fate determination (12Li X. Greenwald I. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1015-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similar to APP, Notch undergoes intramembrane proteolysis, freeing the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of specific genes by interacting with transcription factors (13Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Mutations in SEL-12 can be rescued by human wild type PS1 or PS2 (14Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Baumeister R. Leimer U.

This demonstrates the homologous function of PS1 and SEL-12. In mice, knock out of the PS1gene (PS1 KO) (16De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J., S. Schroeter E.H.

Because in mice PS1 KO can be rescued by FAD PS1 mutants (20Davis J.A. Naruse S. Chen H. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Wong P.C. Neuron. 1998; 20: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it appears that the point mutations in FAD lead to gain of malfunction of PS1. However, the global phenotype of PS1 KO indicates that PS1 function is required for mammalian embryogenesis including central nervous system and skeletal development (21Wong P.C. Zeng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 22Shen J. Bronson R.T.

Down-regulation of PS1 also appears to induce apoptosis in cultured cells (23Roperch J.P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M.

Cotman C.W. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 26Smale G. Nichols N.R. Brady D.R. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 133: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of the gene could contribute to the pathogenesis of FAD. Hence, the identification of the mechanisms controlling the expression of the PS1 gene should relate directly to further understanding of development and differentiation pathways and the pathogenesis of FAD. We have analyzed the control of transcription of the humanPS1 gene, and we have previously identified a promoter fragment (−22/+178) that promotes efficient transcription in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as well as in hepatoma HepG2 cells (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have shown that a 16-base pair (−22/−6) fragment is required for more than 90% of the expression of the gene. An Ets consensus recognition sequence is present in this region and a mutation altering two nucleotides of the core consensus reduces transcription of the gene by more than 90%. We now present direct evidence indicating the role of Ets transcription factors in the regulation of PS1. We also show that the transcription coactivator p300 acts as a coactivator ofPS1 transcription with Ets1 and Ets2. p53 protein has been shown by others to down-regulate the expression of the endogenousPS1 gene (23Roperch J.P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We now show that cotransfection ofPS1 with a p53 expression vector decreases drasticallyPS1 transcription in our system as well. We have begun to examine the interactions of the p53 protein with the PS1promoter and the transcription factors involved in its regulation. The construction of the human PS1 promoter-CAT reporter plasmids has been described previously (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The vectors EVRF0-Ets1 and EVRF0-Ets2 express the human Ets1 and Ets2 transcription factors from the CMV promoter (28Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schafner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and were a gift from Dr. B. J. Graves (University of Utah) and Dr. R. Maki (Burnham Institute). The empty vector EVRF0 was used as a control for Ets1 and Ets2 in transient infection assays. The pC53-SN3 and pC53-SCX3 vectors expressing the wild type and mutant p53 were a gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein (John Hopkins University) (29Baker S.J. Markovitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The control vector pCMV1 was obtained by releasing the p53 cDNA insert with BamHI and religation. The pCMVβp300 plasmid expressing the p300 protein from the CMV promoter was a gift from Dr. S. Grossman and Dr. D. Livingston (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) (30Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The empty vector (pCMV2) was obtained by releasing the p300 cDNA insert by double digestion withNotI and HindIII followed by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and religation. pEts2 was constructed by releasing the Ets2 cDNA from EVRF0-Ets2 withBamHI and inserting it downstream from the T7 promoter in Bluescript KS. The pGEX-p53wt and pGEX-p53 (m143) were constructed by inserting the p53-coding sequence from the second amino acid to the final ATG into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The p53 inserts were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the 5′ primer, 5′-gatcgaattcGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCG-3′, and the 3′ primer, 5′-gatcctcgagTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′, resulting in the addition of an EcoRI site at their 5′ end and an XhoI site at their 3′ end, enabling insertion into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-1. Neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized using the protein concentration in the extracts measured with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The transfection efficiency was measured after transfection of 12 μg of the pSV-β−galactosidase vector (Promega) and staining with X-gal after glutaraldehyde fixation (31Lim K. Chae C.B. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 18 h after glycerol shock. Plates were then washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The fixer was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were incubated with X-gal solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4 Fe (CN)6) at 37 °C for 3–18 h. Typically 5 to 8% of SK-N-SH cells or HepG2 cells appeared dark blue and appeared to express the transfected gene. To assay the binding of Ets2 to the PS1 promoter, the protein was synthesized from pEts2 by in vitro transcription-translation as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). The production of Ets2 protein was verified by Western analysis of aliquots from the reticulocyte lysate reactions using the sc-351X antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) raised against a C-terminal peptide of the human Ets2 (amino acids 450 to 469). In EMSAs, aliquots (2 μl) from in vitrotranslation reactions were added to 20-μl DNA binding mixtures including 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 10–50 pg of end-labeled DNA probe, and 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)]. Reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on native 6% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe including PS1promoter sequences from −22 to +6 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification using end-labeled p19 and p13 primers (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in supershift or complex inhibition assays were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. sc-351X (α-Ets2) is described above and recognizes specifically Ets2. sc-112X (α-Ets1/2) was raised against the C-terminal peptide of the human Ets1 (amino acids 362–374) and has a broad specificity for Ets1 and Ets2. Assays for DNA binding activity(s) recognizing specifically a p53 consensus motif were carried out using nuclear extracts (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) from cells transfected with p53 expression vector. The wild type p53 double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGG-3′ and mutant containing a CATG to TCGC substitution were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA binding mixtures (20 μl) contained 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg of poly[d(I·C)], 0.1 ng of oligonucleotide probe and 1.5–3 μg of nuclear extract. The preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was described previously (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 90 min at 22 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. p53 was detected by incubation with a 1/3000 dilution of the monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 60 min. Incubation with 1/2000 secondary anti-mouse antibody was for 45 min. Blots were developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformed with pGEX-p53wt or pGEX-p53(m143). Recombinant proteins were induced for 3 h by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended into 1/20 culture volume of extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (32Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher F.J. LeRoith D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8318-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed by mild sonication, and the lysis was allowed to complete by incubating for 30 min at room temperature. Cellular debris were eliminated by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. p53 was purified by batch fractionation. The supernatant was mixed with GST-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at 22 °C for 20 min. The resin was then sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and washed 3 times with 10 volumes of extraction buffer. p53 was then eluted by 2 successive incubations with 2 volumes of extraction buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. SK-N-SH cells were cotransfected with a PS1CAT reporter gene together with increasing amounts of p53 wild type expression vector, the p53 (m143) single amino acid mutant, or the empty vector pCMV1. Increasing the amount of wild type p53 vector from 0.25 to 2 μg resulted in greater suppression of PS1 expression. Promoter activity was reduced by more than 10-fold in the presence of 2 μg of p53 vector as compared with transfections with the control vector. Cotransfection with p53 (m143) did not affect significantly the expression of PS1 (Fig. 1). Virtually identical results were observed with HepG2 cells (data not shown). The production of p53 protein in transfected cells was verified by Western analysis of cellular proteins (Fig.2 A). Transfection of SK-N-SH cells with 2 μg of p53 expression vector increased the level of p53 protein in transfected cells (p53 lanes). As a result, the level of p53 in the transfected cell population appears significantly higher than the background of endogenous p53 (C lane). Furthermore, the transfection efficiency measured by transfecting the pSV-β−galactosidase vector and staining the cells for β-galactosidase activity was routinely 5 to 8%. Hence the increase in the level of p53 protein in cells tranfected with p53 expression vector as compared with cells transfected with the control vector that appears in Fig. 2 A is largely underestimated. p53 appears as multiple bands on our Western blots. The expression of p53 protein is tightly regulated, including at the posttranslational level, and covalent modifications by phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation have been described that can potentially affect p53 activities, stability, and nuclear localization (33Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels such as that displayed in Fig. 2 A typically enable resolution of different isoforms of p53 (34Abraham J. Kelly J. Thibault P. Benchimol S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the multiple bands observed represent alternative p53 isoforms differing by covalent modification. However we cannot rule out that some of the species represent degradation products. We also monitored the changes in specific DNA binding activity to a consensus p53 recognition motif (Fig. 2 B). EMSAs including nuclear extracts from SK-N-SH cells transfected with the p53 expression vector (lanes p53) show a specific complex A that appears with a wild type probe (lane 2) but is absent with a mutant probe containing a four-base pair alteration within the p53 consensus motif (lane 7). The specific recognition of the p53 DNA binding motif by the complex A is also indicated by its competition in the presence of an excess of cold wild type p53 oligonucleotide (lane 3), whereas it remains virtually unaffected by the addition of the mutant competitor (lane 4). Furthermore, the amount of complex A is higher in extracts from p53-transfected cells (lane 2) as compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (lane 5). Hence the data suggest that this complex may represent or include p53, in which protein level and binding activity both increase markedly in p53-transfected cells.Figure 2A, Western analysis of cellular proteins from SK-N-SH cells transfected with p53 expression vector. 10 μg of nuclear extract and 10 μg of cytoplasmic extract proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-p53 antibody DO-1. An arrow indicates the position of the p53 protein. p53 and C indicate extracts from cells transfected with the p53 expression vector or the empty vector respectively. B, changes in nuclear factors recognizing specifically the p53 binding motif in cells transfected with a p53 expression vector. Nuclear extracts were prepared from SK-N-SH cells transfected with p53 expression vector (p53) or the pCMV1 empty vector (C). Specific binding to an oligonucleotide probe (75 pg) containing a p53 consensus motif was analyzed by EMSAs. A wt and mutant oligonucleotide containing a CATG to TCGC substitution within the p53 motif (m) were used as probes. Nuclear extract (3 μg) was included in lanes 2–5 and 7. No extract was added in lanes 1and 6. An excess of cold p53 wild type oligonucleotide (20 ng) was added as competitor in lane 3, and lane 4contained 20 ng of p53 mutant competitor. An arrow indicates the position of the specific complex A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we compared the effects of p53 on the transcription of alternative PS1 promoter fragments in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 3). Elimination of 5′ sequences from −687 to −22 or reduction of 3′ sequences from +178 to +6 did not eliminate repression by p53. Indeed, transcription from constructs including sequences from −22 to +178 or −35 to +6 was reduced by about 10-fold when cotransfected with p53, which is comparable with the repression observed with the (−687, +178) PS1 construct. Thus the p53 response element(s) appears to be located within the short −22 to +6 region around the initiation site, which also contains a major positive determinant of PS1 expression (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained in HepG2 cells. The −22 to +6 region does not contain any sequence similarity to the consensus motif reported for p53. However we have examined directly the binding of p53 to the PS1 promoter. We used a GST-p53 fusion protein synthesized in E. coli and tested its ability to bind to the −22/+6 PS1 fragment, simultaneously comparing its binding to a p53 consensus oligonucleotide probe in parallel EMSAs (Fig. 4). Incubation of GST-p53wt protein with a wild type p53 oligonucleotide probe produced a specific DNA-protein complex (lane 2), whereas the probe remained free in the presence of GST-p53(m143) (lane 3). The addition of DO-1 anti-p53 antibody to the GST-p53 protein resulted in a supershifted complex (lane 4) with no supershift observed in the present of buffer alone or an unrelated αEts1 antibody (lanes 6 and 5, respectively). No complex was observed with wt or mutant GST-p53 with a p53 mutant oligonucleotide (lanes 8 and 9). No complex was observed using the −22/+6 PS1 probe (lanes 10–12). Therefore p53 does not appear to bind directly toPS1 promoter. To further analyze the mechanism of action of p53, we have begun to identify the transactivators acting over the −22 to +6 region. We directly tested the function of known Ets transcription factors since an Ets motif present at −10 plays a crucial role in the control of the gene. The analysis of the PS1 promoter was originally carried out in SK-N-SH and HepG2 cells where at least one of the protein-DNA complexes formed with the PS1 promoter appears to include a protein sharing an antigenic determinant with Ets2 (Fig. 10D of Ref.27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore we have examined whether Ets2 and the closely related factor Ets1 affect the expression of PS1 in transient infection assays. Cotransfection of a (−687, +178) PS1CAT promoter fusion gene with Ets1 or Ets2 resulted in 3–10-fold activation of PS1transcription as compared with the empty EVRF0 vector (Fig.5). Similar data were obtained in both SK-N-NH and HepG2 cell lines. Thus it appears that both Ets1 and Ets2 can act as transactivators of PS1. The deletion of promoter sequences outside of the interval −35 to +6 did not affect the activation by Ets1 or Ets2. Indeed Ets1 or Ets2 activated by 3–4-fold the expression of the (−35, +6) PS1CAT construct. Hence it is likely that the −10 Ets motif functions as a target site for Ets transcription factors. The considerable reduction in promoter activity resulting from deletion of 3′ sequences does not appear to result from deletion of Ets sites since point mutations eliminating individual or all Ets motifs present downstream did not affect PS1expression. 2M. Pastorcic, unpublished information. Transfection of p53 together with Ets1 or Ets2 expression vectors reduced transcription in similar proportion whether promoter activity was stimulated by Ets1 or Ets2 or not (data not shown). Indeed the induction effect of Ets1/2 is conserved in the presence of p53. As a corollary to these functional assays we have verified that Ets transcription factors indeed bind to the −10 region of PS1. The specific binding of in vitro translated Ets2 protein to an oligonucleotide including sequences from −22 to +6 was tested in EMSAs. The specific protein-DNA complex formed (bottom arrow) (Fig. 6, lane 2) could be eliminated by competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a heterologous Elk1 binding site (27Pastorcic M. Das H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24297-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (lanes 5 and 6), whereas the same oligonucleotide with a two-base pair mutation within the Ets consensus was no longer an effective competitor (lanes 3 and 4). The identity of the complex was confirmed by the supershift produced (top arrow) in the presence of the antibody sc-351 raised against Ets2 (lane 7) or by its inhibition in the presence of the antibody sc-112 raised against"

Here we address the extent to which N-glycosylation contributes to assembly, surface appearance, and ligand recognition of P2X1receptors. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis of glycan minus mutants carrying Gln instead of Asn at five individual NXT/S sequons reveals that Asn284 remains unused because of a proline in the +4 position. The four other sites (Asn153, Asn184, Asn210, and Asn300) carryN-glycans, but solely Asn300 located only eight residues upstream of the predicted reentry loop of P2X1acquires complex-type carbohydrates. Like parent P2X1, glycan minus mutants migrate as homotrimers when resolved by blue native PAGE. Recording of ATP-gated currents reveals that elimination of Asn153 or Asn210 diminishes or increases functional expression levels, respectively. In addition, elimination of Asn210 causes a 3-fold reduction of the potency for ATP. If three or all four N-glycosylation sites are simultaneously eliminated, formation of P2X1 receptors is severely impaired or abolished, respectively. We conclude that at least oneN-glycan per subunit of either position is absolutely required for the formation of P2X1 receptors and that individual N-glycans possess marked positional effects on expression levels (Asn154, Asn210) and ATP potency (Asn210).

P2X receptors open within milliseconds an intrinsic pore nonselectively permeable for small cations when activated by extracellular ATP (for reviews, see Refs. 13Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Stühmer W.

Büttner C. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Schmalzing G. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 61-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During prolonged activation, several P2X receptor channels develop permeability also to rather large cations such as organic dyes (18Virginio C. MacKenzie A. Rassendren F.A. North R.A. Surprenant A.

Like virtually all membrane proteins, P2X receptors are glycoproteins. A multitude of functional aspects of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins have been described (for reviews, see Refs. 20Varki A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), prevention of marginally stable proteins from unfolding, as well as protein-protein interactions, ligand binding (25Lapthorn A.J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The role of a particular N-glycan in a given protein, however, has been found to be rather unpredictable and may comprise several of the above mentioned functions, or it may have no known function at all and be completely dispensable. The protein sequence of the rat P2X1 subunit shows five putative N-glycosylation sites consisting of the NXT/S sequon (where X denotes any amino acid except proline), which are all located in the predicted P2X1 ectodomain (1Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that four of these five putative N-glycosylation sites of the rat P2X1 subunit are used in Xenopus oocytes (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Notably, only one of the four N-glycans acquires Endo H1 resistance en route to the plasma membrane. Since P2X1 subunits assemble rapidly and quantitatively to noncovalently linked homotrimers soon after synthesis while still in the ER, it seems likely that the three-dimensional structure of the fully assembled and properly folded P2X1 receptor sterically hindered the access of particular Golgi enzymes to three of the four N-glycans. Hence, we considered that one or several of these inaccessibleN-glycans play a role in stabilizing these interactions or even directly participate in subunit interactions in a lectin-like manner. To examine whether N-glycans are important for P2X subunit assembly, surface expression, or ligand recognition, we eliminatedN-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed the oligomerization and ATP-gated currents of the corresponding receptors in Xenopus oocytes by SDS-PAGE, blue native PAGE, and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements, respectively. An additional aim of the study was to examine the effect of N-glycans on the migration of P2X receptor complexes in the blue native PAGE system. Our results show that any two out of the four naturally occurring N-glycans are sufficient for robust functional expression of P2X1 receptors at the cell surface and that the N-glycan in position 210 contributes to ATP potency. The construction of the His-P2X1 plasmid encoding the rat P2X1 subunit with an N-terminal hexahistidyl tag has been described previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). His-P2X1 mutants lacking one or several consensus sequences for N-glycosylation were generated by changing the Asn of existing NXS/T codons to Gln using a commercially available kit (QuikChangeTMmutagenesis kit from Stratagene). The resulting His-P2X1mutants were named ΔN1–ΔN5 (in sequence order) for single mutants (Fig. 1), ΔN12, ΔN13, ΔN15, ΔN23, ΔN25, and ΔN35 for double mutants, ΔN123 and ΔN235 for triple mutants, and ΔN1235 for the quadruple mutant lacking allN-glycosylation sites. All mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Capped cRNAs were synthesized fromEcoRI-linearized templates with SP6 RNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), purified by Sepharose chromatography and phenol-chloroform extraction, and dissolved in 5 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.2, at 0.5 μg/μl, using the optical density reading at 260 nm for quantitation (OD 1.0 = 40 μg/μl). Xenopus laevis females received from South Africa were anesthetized with MS222 (tricaine) for surgical removal of ovaries. After collagenase treatment (28Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) defolliculated stage V or VI oocytes were manually selected and injected with 50-nl aliquots of cRNAs. Injected oocytes were kept in parallel with noninjected controls at 19 °C in sterile oocyte Ringer's solution (ORi: 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 μg/ml of gentamycin. cRNA-injected oocytes and noninjected controls were metabolically labeled by overnight incubation withl-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at about 100 MBq/ml (0.4 MBq per oocyte) in ORi at 19 °C and then chased as indicated. The His-P2X1receptor and its mutants were purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography from digitonin (1.0%) extracts of oocytes as detailed previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Protein was released from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose with nondenaturing elution buffer consisting of 200 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, and 1.0% digitonin. Eluted proteins were kept at 0 °C until analyzed. For selective labeling of His-P2X1 receptors at the plasma membrane, oocytes injected with cRNA 3 days earlier were incubated with125I-sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)proprionate (125I-sulfo-SHPP), a membrane-impermeant derivative of the Bolton-Hunter reagent (29Thompson J.A. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) exactly as described previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from digitonin extracts of the oocytes by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography as above. Blue native PAGE (30Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) was carried out as described previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Just before gel loading, purified proteins were supplemented with blue native sample buffer to final concentrations of 10% glycerol, 0.2% Serva blue G, and 20 mm sodium 6-amino-n-caproate and applied onto polyacrylamide gradient slab gels. Molecular mass markers (Combithek II™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were run on both borders of the gel and were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were supplemented with SDS sample buffer containing DTT and electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (RainbowTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. When indicated, samples were treated prior to SDS-PAGE with either Endo H or PNGase F (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1% octyl glucoside to diminish inactivation of PNGase F. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed at −80 °C to BioMax MR or MS film (Kodak) as appropriate. In some experiments, radioactive bands were quantified with an image analyzer (PhosphorImager 445 SI, Molecular Dynamics). Current responses were measured by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique on oocytes injected with His-P2X1 cRNA 3 days earlier. The electrodes contained 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–2 MΩ. The superfusion solution consisted of 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. Calcium salts were omitted to avoid activation of endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels. A fast and reproducible solution exchange was achieved as described previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Current signals were elicited by ATP at 1-min intervals, low pass-filtered at 100 Hz, and sampled at 200 Hz using the Turbo TEC-05 amplifier (NPI Electronics, Tamm, Germany). All measurements were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). The P2X1 cDNA has been originally cloned from rat vas deferens, where the P2X1 receptor plays a role in muscle contraction (1Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), which propels sperm into the ejaculate (34Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P. Lewis C.J. Vial C. Leckie B.J. Cobb A.L. Brown J.E. Conley E.C. Buell G. Pritchard C.A. Evans R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The P2X1 polypeptide chain is 399 amino acids long. For affinity purification after synthesis in Xenopus oocytes, we tagged the rat P2X1 polypeptide at its N-terminal end with six histidine residues, which had no effect on ATP-induced currents (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The His-P2X1 subunit can be isolated from cRNA-injected and [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes as a 57-kDa glycoprotein (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) that carries fourN-glycans making up ∼18% by mass of the protein (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the P2X1 subunit shows five asparagines for possible N-linked glycosylation (NXT/S): N153GT, N184FT, N210GT, N284LS, and N300GT. Replacement of Asn153, Asn184, Asn210, and Asn300 by Gln, one at a time, resulted in the synthesis of glycoproteins that had a 2–3 kDa lower mass than the wild type P2X1 glycoprotein (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4 and 7). Since 2–3 kDa corresponds to the mass of one N-linked oligosaccharide side chain, this finding implies that each of the replaced asparagines is occupied by an N-glycan in the wild type P2X1subunit. In contrast, replacement of Asn284 by Gln had no effect on the mass (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), indicating that Asn284 of the wild type P2X1 subunit is the asparagine that is not used as a glycosyl acceptor site. The inability to glycosylate Asn284 of the N284LS sequon may be attributed to the leucine residue in the X position, which has been found to impair core glycosylation (35Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Pro287 immediately following the N284LS sequon might be responsible, since proline inhibits core glycosylation not only at the X, but also at the +4 position (36Gavel Y. Von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Indeed, Asn284 was efficiently used as a glycosyl acceptor site when alanine was substituted for Pro287, as inferred from the reduced mobility of the His-Ala287-P2X1 polypeptide, indicating the presence of an additional (fifth) N-glycan (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). The occupancy of Asn284 by a glycan had no apparent effect on P2X1 receptor function, as deduced from the magnitude and concentration dependence of ATP-gated currents (results not shown). The efficient glycosylation at Asn284 after elimination of Pro287 argues against a significant role of Leu285 for the inability to glycosylate Asn284of the parent P2X1 polypeptide. From the four N-glycans per P2X1 receptor subunit, only one acquired Endo H resistance during transport to the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This suggests that processing by Golgi enzymes of three of theN-glycans is sterically hindered, most likely as a result of folding and oligomerization of the P2X1 chains. Fig.2 B shows that like the parent His-P2X1 receptor (lane 1) all the P2X1 receptor mutants (lanes 2–6) except ΔN5 (lane 7) acquired Endo H-resistant carbohydrates. Since the P2X1 receptor mutant ΔN5 appears at the plasma membrane (cf. Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), the absence of Endo H-resistant carbohydrates can be directly conferred to the lack of the sole N-glycan that can acquire complex-type carbohydrates during transit of the Golgi apparatus. This indicates that the glycan at Asn300 of the parent His-P2X1 receptor subunit is the one accessible for complex glycosylation.Figure 4Comparison of ATP potency between parent His-P2X1 and glycan minus mutants. Inward current traces were recorded at the indicated ATP concentrations and a holding potential −40 mV from oocytes injected 3 days earlier with 23 ng of cRNA for parent His-P2X1 (A) or the glycan minus mutant ΔN3 (B). C, the ratio between currents activated at −40 mV by 0.3 and 30 μm ATP was calculated as a measure of the ATP potency at the various glycan minus mutants (n = 5–6, mean ± S.E.).

This ATP concentration elicited different yet maximum responses at the parent P2X1receptor and all receptor mutants, since activation with 100 μm ATP did not result in a further increase of currents. Like the parent P2X1 receptor, also all receptor mutants lacking one N-glycan per subunit exhibited large ATP-gated currents, indicating that no particular N-glycan is essential for receptor function (Fig. 3). There are, however, marked positional effects of the N-glycans. While the glycans at N2 or N5 were without significant effect on the expression level of functional receptors, elimination of the glycan at N1 or N3 resulted in a 30% decrease or 70% increase, respectively, of the current response (Fig. 3). Likewise, reduced currents were recorded from double mutants that lacked N1 together with N2 or N5, whereas elimination of N3 consistently resulted in increased currents even when N1 was simultaneously eliminated (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the glycans at N1 and N3 play opposing roles for the expression level of functional P2X1 receptors. Elimination of any three N-glycans did also not prevent P2X1 receptor formation, but the functional expression level decreased markedly to <10% of that of the parent P2X1 receptor. The currents were particularly low when the three acceptor sites that were eliminated included N1 (Fig. 3). No ATP-induced currents could be recorded from oocytes after removal of all canonical N-glycosylation sites. Taken together, these results implicate that despite their marked positional effects, only one N-glycan at any locus is required for the formation of functional P2X1 receptors, and two such sites are sufficient for robust functional expression. Since N-glycans are bulky and can shield a large section of the protein surface, we examined whether elimination of N-glycans affects ATP potency. To this end, we recorded receptor currents elicited by 0.3 and 30 μm ATP and determined the ratio of the current responses at these two ATP concentrations. As apparent from Fig.4 C, all the receptor mutants lacking N3 (Asn210) showed a current ratio of 5–7% independent of simultaneous elimination of additionalN-glycosylation sites. In contrast, all glycan minus receptor mutants that contained N-glycan N3 showed a ratio of 26–37% similar to the 32% for the parent His-P2X1receptor. Since N3 turned out to be crucial for the reduced potency, concentration response curves for ATP of ΔN3 and parent His-P2X1 were recorded. Fitting the Hill equation to the data for the parent His-P2X1 receptor yielded an EC50 value for ATP of 0.7 μm (Fig.4 D). In contrast, the glycan minus receptor mutant ΔN3 exhibited an EC50 value of 2.1 μm,i.e. a 3-fold reduced potency for ATP. The Hill coefficients (1.1 versus 1.3) were not significantly different. An additional aim of the present study was to examine the influence of carbohydrates on P2X1 receptor assembly as assessed by blue native PAGE analysis. Parent His-P2X1 subunits combine rapidly to stable homotrimers that exit the ER (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), transit the Golgi where complex glycosylation of N5 occurs (Fig. 2), and finally appear at the plasma membrane. To visualize the plasma membrane form of the His-P2X1 glycan minus receptor mutants, we radioiodinated oocyte surface proteins with membrane impermeant125I-sulfo-SHPP and then isolated the His-tagged proteins by Ni2+-NTA chromatography. When resolved by blue native PAGE, the parent His-P2X1 receptor migrated at 250–290 kDa (Fig. 5) as reported previously (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Overall, elimination ofN-glycans resulted in a slight increase in electrophoretic mobility, corresponding maximally to 20 kDa when twoN-glycans per subunit were lacking (Fig.5 A). Within the technical limits of receptor quantification by surface radioiodination, all the receptor mutants lacking one N-glycan (Fig.5 A, lanes 3–6 and 8–11) and most of the mutants lacking two N-glycans (lanes 12–14) were present at approximately the same density at the plasma membrane as the parent His-P2X1 receptor. The amount of receptor protein decreased markedly when the two acceptor sites that were eliminated included N1 (Fig. 5 A, lane 15) or when three N-glycans per subunit were eliminated (lane 16). We did not attempt to directly correlate radioiodinated protein and current responses, because differences in the 50% range resolvable by electrophysiological analysis cannot be reproducible detected by surface radioiodination. To display the oligomeric state of these receptor complexes, we exposed the natively eluted His-P2X1 mutant receptors to DTT in the presence of Coomassie Blue and sodium 6-amino-n-caproate. This treatment causes a partial dissociation of the parent His-P2X1 receptor to the monomer and dimer of apparent masses similar to 80 and 170 kDa, respectively, indicating that the nondenatured 250-kDa protein band must be a His-P2X1homotrimer (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Likewise, also the His-P2X1 glycan minus receptor mutants lacking one or two N-glycans per subunit dissociated into dimers and monomers when exposed to DTT (Fig.5 B). Quantification of the bands by phosphor image analysis shows that the extent of dissociation induced by DTT is virtually identical for the three N-glycan minus mutant receptors. It should be noted that the dissociating effect of DTT does not result from a cleavage of intersubunit disulfide linkages, but from a perturbation of noncovalent subunit interactions. Dissociation of P2X1 complexes into monomers could also be produced by other denaturing additions such as urea or SDS, which by themselves will not affect disulfide bonds (9Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In summary, receptor mutants lacking up to three N-glycans per subunit exist in a homotrimeric state like the wild type P2X1 receptor. A mutant that lacked all four N-glycans could neither be detected by two-electrode voltage clamp measurements nor by Ni2+ chelate chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The P2X1 receptor influences its ownN-glycosylation at two levels: (i) at the level of its primary sequence and (ii) the level of its three-dimensional structure. First, the N284LS tripeptide (N4) is not used as a site forN-glycosylation because of a proline residue in the +4 position. Replacement by alanine resulted in unimpairedN-glycosylation at this site. This observation agrees well with previous reports that the presence of proline immediately following a sequon can inhibit core glycosylation (36Gavel Y. Von Heijne G.

Phosphorylation of the PKC site, Ser-18, appeared to be due to the activation of the α isoform of the kinase. In NRK-52E and L6 cells, this phosphorylation was reduced by prior activation of a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway with forskolin. In principle this would be consistent with direct interaction between the two phosphorylation sites, but further investigation suggested a more indirect mechanism. First, phosphorylation of Ser-938, the PKA site, could not be detected despite the presence of active PKA. Second, there was a major reduction in the phosphorylation of unrelated phosphoproteins as a consequence of elevation of cAMP, suggesting generalized reduction of kinase activity or activation of phosphatase activity. In NRK-52E and L6, phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase at Ser-18 paralleled this global change. In C6 cells, in contrast, there was no cAMP effect on Na,K-ATPase phosphorylation at Ser-18 and no global cAMP effect on other phosphoproteins.

The molecular mechanism of regulation is an open question, however, because seemingly inconsistent functional effects have been reported with different experimental systems, including either inhibition or activation ostensibly through the same kinase. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed, including direct inhibition or stimulation by kinases (11Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 518.1: 37-46Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the phosphorylation stoichiometry reached in intact cells in experimental conditions (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: F863-F869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between PKC and cAMP-dependent pathways in regulation of kidney Na,K-ATPase have been suspected for some time (22Bertorello A. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F924-F928PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that phosphorylation of the α1 subunit by protein kinase C is modulated by a cAMP-stimulated pathway (23Borghini I. Geering K. Gjinovci A. Wollheim C.B. Pralong W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6211-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and possibly by the state of phosphorylation of the protein kinase A site, Ser-938 (17Cheng X.J. Hoog J.O. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1981-C1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such cross-talk between cAMP-dependent and Ca2+, phospholipid-dependent signaling pathways might affect the final state of the enzyme and account for some of the complexity in the literature. Cross-talk could occur at several levels: regulation of kinase activities (24Zaheer A. Lim R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5183-5186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), regulation of phosphatase activities (18Fisone G. Snyder G.L. Aperia A. Greengard P. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 258-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or direct conformational changes of Na,K-ATPase affecting the accessibility of phosphorylation sites. The possibility that kinases interact through affecting the conformation of the Na,K-ATPase is supported by certain evidence. The α subunit is the catalytic subunit, and it undergoes conformational transitions upon binding its ligands during the working cycle. The Na+ binding conformation is known as E1, and the K+ binding conformation is known as E2. In the test tube, the enzyme can be arrested in various specific conformations by the choice of ligands added, and the conformational state can be probed by such means as fluorescence microscopy and protease sensitivity (25Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We observed that ligands that stabilize the Na,K-ATPase in different conformations affected phosphorylation by protein kinase C and protein kinase A in vitro in a reciprocal way (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A was maximal in the presence of ligands that promote the E1 conformation, whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase C was maximal in ligands that promote the E2 conformation. In related observations, Logvinenko et al. (12Logvinenko N.S. Dulubova I. Fedosova N. Larsson S.H. Nairn A.C. Esmann M. Greengard P. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9132-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) report that protein kinase C shifts the conformation from E2 to E1, as measured with eosin fluorescence. Furthermore, phosphorylation by protein kinase A in vitro requires the presence of Triton X-100 (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chibalin A.V. Vasilets L.A. Hennekes H. Pralong D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22378-22384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase C is prevented in the same conditions (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100 inactivates enzyme activity in these conditions, and kinetic effects on enzyme partial reactions suggests that the inactive enzyme is in the E1 conformation (27Robinson J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 598: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that accessibility of the two phosphorylation sites depends on the conditions, making it plausible that phosphorylation of the sites could interact in a complementary manner. Using an antibody-based method for quantifying phosphorylation at Ser-18 by protein kinase C, we were able to demonstrate very high levels of phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation in intact cells from three different rat cell lines: NRK-52E (normal rat kidney), L6 (muscle), and C6 (glioma). With these, we investigated the effect of activation of the cAMP pathway on Ser-18 phosphorylation. Calyculin A, forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and phorbol myristoyl acetate (PMA) were from RBI/Sigma (Natick, MA), and cyclosporin A was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Protein kinase A catalytic subunit (catalog #P8289), anti-mouse IgG-agarose, and BAPTA-AM were obtained from Sigma. Three rat cell lines, NRK (normal rat kidney, clone 52E), C6 glioma, and L6, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 IU of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml) in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. NRK and C6 cells used in phosphorylation experiments were near confluence. L6 cells were allowed to fuse and form myotubes in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 7–10 days. The Na,K-ATPase isoforms expressed by these cultures are: NRK-52E, α1 and β1; C6, α1 and β3; L6, α1 and β3, with a small amount of β1 (28Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22405-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 3E. Arystarkhova and K. J., Sweadner, unpublished observations. Monolayers of cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were preincubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM without serum. Then drugs (forskolin, IBMX, calyculin A, PMA, cyclosporin A) or their vehicle (Me2SO or ethanol) were added at concentrations and for times indicated in the figure legends, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. The medium was discarded, dishes were placed on ice, and 0.2 ml of 1% SDS at 100 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was added to each dish. The dishes were scraped, and the detergent extract was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 rpm. Supernatants were diluted 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer, and aliquots (30 μl/well, approximately 15 μg of protein) were loaded on SDS gels. Electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Monoclonal antibody McK1 (29Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A dialyzed ammonium sulfate concentrate was prepared and used at 1:20,000. Details on procedures for obtaining quantitative data are described elsewhere (31Feschenko M.S. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 834: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody 470 (a generous gift of Dr. A. C. Nairn, Rockefeller University), raised against a phosphorylated peptide derived from the PKA site of Na,K-ATPase, was used to detect phosphorylation at Ser-938 at 1:20,000 (1Fisone G. Cheng S.X.J. Nairn A. Czernik A. Hemmings Jr., H. Hoog J.O. Bertorello A.M. Kaiser R. Bergman T. Jornvall H. Aperia A. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9368-9373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This same antibody detected many other phosphoproteins. Polyclonal antibody to phosphoserine from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA) was used to detect phosphorylated proteins in cell lysates at 1:700. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma, and luminol reagents were from Pierce. Polyclonal antibody K1 (1:5,000) (32Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody 6F (1:500) (30Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) were routinely used for Na,K-ATPase α subunit detection independent of the state of phosphorylation. Although not shown in most figures, this control for uniform protein recovery and gel loading was always performed. Blots were also routinely stained with Amido Black to check protein loading. Protein kinase C isoforms were detected with antibodies from a kit (anti-PKC isozyme sampler set 10267-001) from Life Technologies, Inc. NRK-52E cells growing on multi-well glass slides (Falcon) were fixed for 6 min with −20 °C 100% methanol after incubation either with control medium or medium containing 1 μm PMA for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C overnight. Then they were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and 5% goat serum and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted (1:200) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, they were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:50), washed three times, and photographed with a Zeiss IM35 fluorescence microscope. For cAMP measurement, cells were seeded in culture medium in 96-well plates at 105cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM without serum, and cells were incubated for 2 h. Then forskolin and IBMX were added to final concentrations of 50 and 500 μm, respectively. Control cells were treated with the equivalent volume of Me2SO. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated, and intracellular cAMP was assayed by the non-acetylation method with kit RPN 225 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. This method employs competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibody against cAMP. C6 or NRK cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated with drugs as described in the text. The incubation medium was aspirated, and cells were immediately placed on ice. After a brief wash with ice-cold TBS buffer (10 mmTris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 1 ml of ice-cold TBS buffer containing three detergents, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease and protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) (TIPA buffer) was put in each dish and incubated on ice for 10–15 min. When cells had been treated with calyculin A, the protein phosphatase inhibitor was added to the dissociation buffer at the same final concentration to ensure continued inhibition. Cell extracts were disrupted by repeated aspiration through 21-gauge needles, and the detergent extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing 500 μg of total cellular protein were incubated (with rotation) overnight at 4 °C with 2–4 μg of monoclonal antibody 6H against Na,K-ATPase α subunit (a generous gift of Dr. M. J. Caplan, Yale University Medical School). The next day, 40 μl of anti-mouse IgG agarose (pre-washed and resuspended in TIPA buffer) was added and incubated for two more hours. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and washed 2 times with 1 ml of TIPA buffer per sample. After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were saved. Pellets were washed with an additional 20 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer and centrifuged again. The supernatants were combined and heated for 10 min at 65 °C before loading on the gel. For phosphorylation by protein kinase A in vitro and in cell extracts, purified Na,K-ATPase from rat renal medulla was obtained by the procedure of Jørgensen (33Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as described previously (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation with purified Na,K-ATPase and purified protein kinase A was performed as described previously (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 32P was used previously, and here phosphorylation was detected with a Ser-938 phosphoprotein-specific antibody. Triton X-100 at 0.05% was included because without it the Na,K-ATPase is not phosphorylated by this kinase. We previously showed that its addition did not alter the ability of protein kinase A to phosphorylate kemptide as an artificial substrate (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts of NRK and C6 cells were made as follows. NRK cells grown in 100 mmtissue culture dishes were washed two times with warm DMEM without serum and once with ice-cold TBS-buffer (10 ml/dish). The buffer was aspirated, and 1 ml/dish of ice-cold extraction buffer was added containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. The dishes were incubated on ice for 10 min, and the cell extracts were scraped and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in two bursts of 10–15 s. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, then supernatants were separated into aliquot and frozen at -80 °C. It is our experience that protein phosphatase remains active in disrupted cells when calyculin A is not present, and so the extracts should have had relatively low phosphoprotein levels, as suggested by the faint stain of background bands by antibody 470 seen in Fig. 8, compared with Fig. 5. The inhibitor was added only during the assay. For the phosphorylation assays, 30-μg samples of extract protein were supplemented with 0.5 mm cAMP, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 nm calyculin A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 from concentrated stocks (100-fold or more). 1 μg of purified Na,K-ATPase and 100 ng of PKA catalytic subunit were added where indicated, and incubations were for 30 min at 30 °C. Laemmli sample buffer was added from a 4× concentrate, and the entire sample was loaded on gels.Figure 3Activation of a cAMP-dependent pathway decreases PKC phosphorylation at Ser-18. NRK, L6, or C6 cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with forskolin (50 μm) and IBMX (500 μm) or vehicle. Then 100 nm calyculin A was added with or without 1 μmPMA, and cells were further incubated for 20 min. Detection of phosphorylation at Ser-18 was performed with McK1 antibody.A, a representative experiment in which NRK and L6 cells responded with a reduction in phosphorylation. B, densitometry from n = 4 experiments, expressed as percentage of McK1 stain in control samples. Panel B also includes results from experiments in which the sequence of treatments was changed so that cells were preincubated with calyculin A and PMA for 15 min, and then forskolin/IBMX (F+I) was added and incubated for 20 min more. In this case, activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway did not decrease phosphorylation at Ser-18 in any of the three cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Detection of active PKA in cell extracts. Homogenized NRK cell extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots containing 30 μg of total protein were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C after the addition of cAMP, ATP, MgCl2, calyculin A, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (lane 1), plus 1 μg of purified Na,K-ATPase (lane 2), and plus both purified Na,K-ATPase and 100 ng of exogenous PKA catalytic subunit (lane 3). Detection of phosphorylated Ser-938 was performed on blots with antibody 470. The endogenous PKA activity was sufficient to phosphorylate a large fraction of the added Na,K-ATPase even though the extract was quite dilute compared with kinase in intact cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously we developed a semi-quantitative, antibody-based assay for the detection of PKC phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase in intact cells (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The method has several advantages as follows. There is no need to starve cells of inorganic phosphate or load 32P, there is no need to perform immunoprecipitation, and with this method we were able to demonstrate close to stoichiometric levels of phosphorylation. Furthermore, the method is insensitive to phosphorylation turnover rates, unlike 32P. The epitope of monoclonal antibody McK1 includes Ser-18 (29Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Incorporation of phosphate at Ser-18, the major PKC phosphorylation site in rat α1, blocks binding of McK1 on Western blots. Thus, McK1 binding can be used to estimate the amounts of nonphosphorylated Ser-18 in a sample, and the loss of binding represents the amount of phosphorylated Ser-18. Fig.1 A shows a representative phosphorylation experiment with two different cell lines: NRK-52E and C6. Activation of PKC with PMA alone caused some phosphorylation (some reduction in McK1 binding), but much more was seen (70–90%) when PMA was added with protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A (shown) or okadaic acid (not shown). Calyculin A alone had no effect, suggesting that in the absence of stimuli the activity of PKC in these cell lines was low. Since calyculin A and okadaic acid are known to inhibit protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A, one or both of these phosphatases (or related phosphatases) is likely to be responsible for the dephosphorylation of Ser-18. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), failed to increase Ser-18 phosphorylation levels in the presence or absence of PMA in either cell line (Fig.1 A). Sensitivity to phorbol ester and to calcium narrowed down the isoforms of PKC that are likely to be phosphorylating the Na,K-ATPase in these cells. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged incubation with PMA completely abolished PKC phosphorylation in both cell lines (Fig.1 B). Preincubation of the cells in calcium-free DMEM and in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM abolished PKC phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase in both NRK and C6 cells (Fig.1 C). Taken together the results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-18 is carried out by a phorbol ester-sensitive, calcium-dependent PKC isoform, such as α, β, or γ. NRK-52E grows as an epithelial layer with tight junctions between cells and has organized apical and basolateral surfaces (34De Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Using PKC isoform-specific antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we observed that α, β, and γ isoforms were present in NRK-52E cells but α showed the most robust redistribution to the plasma membrane when treated with 1 μm PMA. Redistribution of α to the basolateral plasma membrane, where the Na,K-ATPase is found, could be seen as a sharp line of stain between cells (Fig. 2) compared with the cytoplasmic location in resting cells. PKC isoforms β and γ had a perinuclear distribution in resting cells (Fig. 2) and showed less robust relocalization to the plasma membrane. The ε isoform was found at the basolateral membrane in resting and stimulated cells (Fig.2), but since it is not calcium-sensitive, it cannot be the kinase that acts on Na,K-ATPase. PKC δ and ζ isoforms were also detected in NRK-52E cells with isoform-specific antibodies but did not show any detectable stain at the basolateral membrane (data not shown). The results were supported by Western blot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions of control and PMA-treated NRK-52E and C6 cells (data not shown). In aggregate, the data suggest that the PKC α isoform is the most likely candidate for Na,K-ATPase phosphorylation. McK1 antibody was employed to investigate whether activation of the PKA-dependent pathway through the elevation of cAMP concentrations would cause changes in PKC phosphorylation levels of Na,K-ATPase Ser-18 in intact cells (Fig."

To evaluate their potential to oxidize the pyridinoline (Pyd) cross-links found in collagen types I and II, we reacted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl−), and singlet oxygen (O2(1Δg)) with the Pyd substitutes, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride and vitamin B6, which share the same chemical structure and spectral properties of Pyd cross-links. Neither H2O2 (125–500 μm) nor O2(1Δg) (10–25 μm) significantly changed the spectral properties of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6. Reaction of HOCl/OCl− (12.5–50 μm) with pyridoxamine at pH 7.2 resulted in a concentration-dependent appearance of two new absorbance peaks and a decrease in fluorescence at 400 nm (excitation 325 nm). The new absorbance peaks correlated with the formation of anN-chloramine and the product of its subsequent reaction with pyridoxamine. In contrast, the extent to which HOCl reacted with vitamin B6, which lacks a primary amine group, was variable at this pH. At lysosomal pH 5.5, Cl2/HOCl/OCl− reacted with both pyridoxamine and vitamin B6. Four of the chlorinated products of this reaction were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and included 3-chloropyridinium, an aldehyde, and several chlorinated products with disrupted rings. To evaluate the effects of Cl2/HOCl/OCl− on Pyd cross-links in collagen, we exposed bone collagen type I and articular cartilage type II to HOCl. Treatment of either collagen type with HOCl at pH 5.0 or 7.2 resulted in the oxidation of amine groups and, for collagen type II, the specific decrease in Pyd cross-link fluorescence, suggesting that during inflammation both oxidations may be used by neutrophils and monocytes to promote the loss of matrix integrity. Reactive oxygen species produced by activated neutrophils and monocytes are thought to be involved in mediating the loss of collagen and other matrix proteins at sites of inflammation.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 751-774Google Scholar). These effects are thought to be mediated in part by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 a group of reactants that includes superoxide (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the highly reactive species hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (5Babior B.M.

Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 20: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ROS are produced by neutrophils and monocytes after they are recruited from the circulation to extravascular spaces. Once outside of the circulation, they adhere to extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) and undergo activation, which results in the production of ROS and release of proteolytic enzymes directly onto the matrix surface (4Harris E.D.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 751-774Google Scholar, 9Ginis I. Tauber A.I.

In inflammation associated with arthritic joints, the accumulation and activation of neutrophils and monocytes and increased synovial cell formation result in the loss of synovial membrane integrity and eventually to irreversible damage and destruction of articular cartilage in the afflicted joints (1Woolley D.E. et al.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1997; 56: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Harris E.D.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 751-774Google Scholar). Similarly, in periodontitis or inflammation associated with the tooth-supporting periodontal ligament, the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes from the circulation and the subsequent activation and release of ROS and proteolytic enzymes can eventually result in a significant and irreversible loss of underlying bone matrix at these sites (2Fredriksson M. Gustafsson A. Asman B. Bergstrom K. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1998; 25: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Fredriksson M.I. Figueredo C.M. Gustafsson A. Bergstrom K.G. Asman B.E. J. Periodontol. 1999; 70: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite the known participation of ROS in the inflammatory-mediated loss of underlying ECM, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs is not completely understood. This is particularly true for collagen, which is the major ECM protein in cartilage and bone. Neutrophils and monocytes contain two enzymes that are responsible for producing ROS. The first is NADPH oxidase, which catalyzes the formation of O⨪2 by the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen via cytochrome b 558 (14Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 15Segal A.W. Jones O.T. Webster D. Allison A.C. Lancet. 1978; 2: 446-449Abstract PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Superoxide is rapidly dismutated to H2O2 either spontaneously or via the enzyme superoxide dismutase (17McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5753-5760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither O⨪2 nor H2O2 exhibit significant reactivity with biologic compounds (18Gartner A. Weser U. Top. Curr. Chem. 1986; 132: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). The second enzyme is myeloperoxidase (MPO), which catalyzes the formation of HOCl from H2O2 and Cl− (19Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MPO has been localized to the primary granules of resting neutrophils and the extracellular space and phagolysosomes of phagocytically stimulated neutrophils (20Bainton D.F. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 39: 299-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21Briggs R.T. Drath D.B. Karnovsky M.L. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 566-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). MPO is also released from cytoplasmic granules of monocytes and some macrophages (22Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The cationic nature of MPO allows it to adhere to cell and matrix surfaces and localize to sites of inflammation (23Selvaraj R.J. Zgliczynski J.M. Paul B.B. Sbarra A.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1978; 137: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is at these sites that MPO produces HOCl, a highly reactive oxidant that readily reacts with primary amines to generate long lived N-chloramines (24Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 25Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). AlthoughN-chloramines exhibit a lower oxidizing potential than HOCl, their much longer effective lifetime (∼18 h) would enable them to cause damage at more distant sites than HOCl (26Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Under acidic conditions, similar to the environment found in phagolysosomes, MPO generates Cl2 (27Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). MPO is also one of the pathways by which neutrophils generate O2(1Δg) (28Steinbeck M.J. Khan A.U. Karnovsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13425-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determining the ability of HOCl to contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis is highly dependent on determining the relevant target(s) at these sites. The most likely protein target for neutrophil oxidants, including N-chloramines, is the ECM. ECM components found in or associated with articular cartilage or bone include hyaluronate, proteoglycans, fibronectin, several tissue-specific and nonspecific protein components, and collagen, the major component of these tissues. It has been reported that neutrophil-generated ROS mediate the degradation of hyaluronate (29Greenwald R.A. Moak S.A. Inflammation. 1986; 10: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), modify proteoglycan structure and/or synthesis, and alter the structure of fibronectin (29Greenwald R.A. Moak S.A. Inflammation. 1986; 10: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem.

Vissers and Winterbourn (32Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 889: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported an increase in proteolytic degradation of glomerular basement membrane collagen by elastase in response to myeloperoxidase/H2O2/Cl−. Davieset al. (33Davies J.M. Horwitz D.A. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported that >1.0 mm HOCl was required to cause extensive fragmentation of collagen type II isolated from bovine articular cartilage or collagen type I isolated from bovine tendon. Davies et al. (33Davies J.M. Horwitz D.A. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) also reported thatN-chloramines did not cause direct fragmentation but greatly increased the degradation of collagen by collagenase and elastase. In general, there are very few studies available as to the susceptibility of collagen to oxidation by HOCl. An important determinant for stability of the ECM is the degree of cross-linking. One important type of cross-link is pyridinoline (Pyd), which was first described by Fujimoto et al. (34Fujimoto D. Moriguchi T. Ishida T. Hayashi H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1978; 84: 52-57Google Scholar) and later confirmed to be a non-reducible intermolecular cross-link of mature fibrillar collagen type I of bone (35Eyre D.R. Veis A. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Connective Tissues. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1981: 51-55Google Scholar). These cross-links were also found to be especially abundant in mature fibrillar collagen type II of articular cartilage (36Eyre D.R. Science. 1980; 207: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), where they covalently link collagen type II to other type II helical regions, collagen type IX to the surface of type II, and bind collagen type IX to other molecules of collagen type IX. Their function is to stabilize the collagen fibrillar superstructure, or arrays, and make them more resistant to collagenolysis or proteolytic degradation (37Vater C. Harris Jr, E. Siegel R. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the susceptibility of Pyd cross-links of collagen to reaction with HOCl. Pyd cross-links were chosen as potential oxidation targets because of their importance in maintaining the collagen superstructure and because their chemical structure suggested they would be targets of oxidative modification by OCl−/Cl2. Our findings indicate that these cross-links react with OCl−, Cl2, andN-chloramines and suggest that Pyd would be a site for ROS modification of collagen type I and II in bone and cartilage, respectively. Pepsin-solubilized collagen types I and II isolated from human bone and articular cartilage, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. David Eyre (University of Washington, Seattle). Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, pyridoxine hydrochloride, 30% hydrogen peroxide, chloramine-T, 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene, methylene blue, and all other salts and buffer components were purchased from Sigma. Glacial acetic acid and dichloromethane were purchased from Fisher. Potassium iodide was purchased from Acros Organics (Fairlawn, NJ). Disodium anthracene-9,10-dipropionic acid was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (4–5% available chlorine) was purchased from Sigma, Acros Organics, Fisher, Alfa (Ward Hill, MA), and Cole-Palmer (Vernon Hills, IL); see comments about NaOCl below. 10 mm stock solutions of pyridoxamine dihydrochloride (pyridoxamine) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) were made fresh weekly and stored at 4 °C with protection from light. Stock solutions were made in one of the following buffers: 0.5m glacial acetic acid buffer, pH 3, or 0.5 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5 ± 0.2, pH 7.2 ± 0.2, or pH 8.0 ± 0.2. Where appropriate, 0.1 m NaCl was added to the buffers as a source of chloride ions. On the day of use, stock solutions of pyridoxamine and vitamin B6 were diluted in appropriate buffer to 20 μm. 7.5 ml of the 20 μmsolutions of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 were then added to control and treated sample tubes so the final concentration of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 in all samples was 15 μm in a total volume of 10 ml. Samples were brought to a total volume of 10 ml by the addition of 2.5 ml of appropriate buffer to control samples or 1.25 ml to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) samples. No buffer was added to samples treated with the combination of H2O2 and NaOCl (H2O2/NaOCl). H2O2 and NaOCl treatment solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution of H2O2 to 1, 2, or 4 mm and diluting the stock solution of NaOCl to 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mmin appropriate buffer immediately before use. 1.25 ml of a diluted solution of H2O2 or NaOCl or 1.25 ml each of diluted solutions of H2O2 and NaOCl were added to appropriate tubes. The final concentrations of H2O2 were 125, 250, or 500 μm, and the final concentrations of NaOCl were 12.5, 25, or 50 μm. H2O2 was always added first to either the H2O2 or H2O2/NaOCl samples, and NaOCl was added immediately after, where appropriate. Samples were mixed after each addition. At pH 12, the NaOCl stock solution exists predominantly as the conjugate base, hypochlorite (OCl−). H2O2 (30% or 12.92 m) and NaOCl (0.65 m) stock solutions as supplied by the manufacturer were stored tightly sealed at 4 °C with protection from light. Despite these precautions, both stock solutions decomposed over a period of 3–4 months after being opened. In general, decomposition of NaOCl could be identified by a yellowing of the solution. Yellowing was always accompanied by a distinctively greater reactivity of the NaOCl solutions, which we attributed to the breakdown of NaOCl to Cl− and eventually reactive chlorate (ClO3−) (38Sidgwick N.V. The Chemical Elements and Their Compounds. Clavendon Press, Oxford1950: 1213-1216Google Scholar, 40Downs A.J. Adams C.J. Bailar Jr., J.C. Emeleus H.J. Nyholm R. Trotman-Dickenson A.F. Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry. Pergamon Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1973: 1400-1408Google Scholar). Therefore, caution should be exercised when using NaOCl, since we found that even new solutions made by different companies showed signs of decomposition. After the addition of buffer, H2O2, NaOCl, or H2O2/NaOCl, control and treated samples were incubated for 15 min at RT (approximately 25 °C) in a Precision Scientific Low Temperature Incubator 815 (Chicago, IL). At the end of each incubation, the UV absorbance of a 50-μl aliquot of each sample was scanned from 400 to 200 nm in a Beckman DU-640 Spectrophotometer (Fullerton, CA), and the fluorescence intensity of a 3-ml aliquot of each sample was read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrophotometer. Optimal fluorescence excitation and wavelengths were determined by referring to UV absorbance peaks and by prescanning samples for maximal excitation and peaks. The known excitation and peak wavelengths for both pyridoxamine and vitamin B6 are 324 nm excitation and 400 nm emission. A 200-μl aliquot of each control and treated sample was also stored at 4 °C after incubation for laterN-chloramine analysis. The presence of N-chloramines was determined by the method of Witko et al. (41Witko V. Nguyen A.T. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1992; 6: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This method is based on the colorimetric measurement of triiodide ions formed by the oxidation of potassium iodide (KI) in solution. Chloramine-T (N-chloro-p-toluene-sulfonamide sodium salt), a commercially available source ofN-chloramine, was used to calibrate the assay. A 100 mm stock solution of chloramine-T was made fresh weekly in distilled H2O and stored at 4 °C with protection from light. The 100 mm chloramine-T solution was then diluted in appropriate buffer to final concentrations of 25, 50, 75, or 100 μm immediately before use. We extended the RT incubation from 2 (41Witko V. Nguyen A.T. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1992; 6: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) to 5 min and found no significant difference in results. The direct oxidation of KI by H2O2, NaOCl, or H2O2/NaOCl was also determined, and these values were subtracted as background from the correspondingly treated samples. The resulting difference represented the amount ofN-chloramine present in each sample. On the day of use, 10 mm stock solutions of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 were diluted to a concentration of 1 mm, and a 100 mm stock solution of chloramine-T was diluted to final concentrations of 25, 50, 75, or 100 μm in appropriate buffer. Control and chloramine-T-treated samples contained 15 μl of the diluted 1 mm pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 solution plus 1 ml of appropriate buffer (control) or 1 ml of 25, 50, 75, or 100 μm chloramine-T solution. The final concentration of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 for all control and chloramine-T-treated samples was 15 μm. Following preparation, samples were incubated for 15 min at RT. At the end of each incubation, the UV absorbance of a each sample was scanned from 400 to 200 nm to look for any changes in the absorbance of pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 due to a reaction with chloramine-T and to identify the absorbance peaks forN-chloramines and pyridoxamine-chloramine or vitamin B6-chloramine reaction products. In addition, theN-chloramine assay of Witko et al. (41Witko V. Nguyen A.T. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1992; 6: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was performed to determine if a reaction of chloramine-T with pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 had occurred as indicated by a decrease in the amount of chloramine-T available to oxidize KI. DNE, a pure chemical source of O2(1Δg) that thermally releases O2(1Δg) at 37 °C, was synthesized by the method of Wasserman and Larsen (42Wasserman H.H. Larsen D.L. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

A duplicate set of coverslips was coated with either dichloromethane or a solution of DNE in dichloromethane (3.6 mg/100 μl) by surface evaporation at 4 °C. 200 μl of either a 15 μm pyridoxamine or vitamin B6 solution in appropriate buffer was added to a duplicate set of dichloromethane- (control) and DNE-coated coverslips. One set of control and DNE-coated coverslips was incubated overnight at 4 °C and another at 37 °C. The release of O2(1Δg) from DNE was confirmed after overnight incubation at 37 °C by following the decrease in absorbance at 400 nm of anthracene-9,10-diproprionic acid (AAP) (1 × 10−4m) in 0.5 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, according to the method of Deby-Dupontet al. (44Deby-Dupont G. Deby C. Mouithys-Mickalad A. Hoebeke M. Mathy-Hartert M. Jadoul L. Vandenberghe A. Lamy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1379: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometries (GC-MS) using electron ionization-mass spectrometry were performed by M-Scan, Inc., West Chester, PA. In brief, reacted samples containing vitamin B6 alone or vitamin B6 in a 1:1 ratio with NaOCl were lyophilized, dissolved in 40 μl in dimethyl formamide, and sialylated derivatives prepared by the addition of 100 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyltrifluoro-acetamide with trimethylchlorosilane (Supelco, PA 16823) followed by heating to 35 °C for 5 min. Derivatized products were concentrated to ∼50 μl under anhydrous N2 and analyzed on capillary column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences PE-5MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 25 μm) by GC-MS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Auto System XL gas chromatograph with Turbomass Quadrupole mass spectrometer) in the positive electron ionization mode. Electron ionization-mass spectrometry was used to identify the structure of individual compounds in each GC peak. The source and interface temperatures were both 200 °C. The injector temperature was maintained at 280 °C, and the initial GC oven temperature was 70 °C for 2 min followed by an increase to 140 °C/min to 300 °C. The lyophilized collagen samples were dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid at a concentration of 1.2 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C with gentle stirring and protection from light. Samples were then dialyzed against 0.02m dibasic sodium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0, for 48 h at 4 °C using a dialysis cassette made by Pierce Slide-A-lyzer (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. The samples were split into 2 equal volumes and dialyzed for an additional 48 h at 4 °C with protection from light against 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer to bring the pH to approximately 5.0 ± 0.3 or 7.2 ± 0.3. After dialysis, samples were removed from cassettes and stored at 4 °C until use. The collagen suspensions were turbid and contained fibrils and/or a variety of polymorphic forms of collagen in equilibrium with monomers (45Brodsky B. Eikenberry E.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 46Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-39Google Scholar). These preparations represent a mixture of fibrils, cross-linked trimers, dimers, and α-subunits of collagen (γ-, β-, and α- bands, respectively) as visualized by PAGE. At pH 7.2, collagen type II preparations also contained a small amount of aggregated/particulate material, also in equilibrium with monomers. The collagen preparations did not require sonication for suspension (47SanAntonio J.D. Lander A.D. Karnovsky M.J. Slayter H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and could be quantitatively and reproducibly loaded onto nitrocellulose or into wells for SDS-PAGE fractionation. On the day of use, 50 μg of collagen type I or II were added to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Control samples received appropriate buffer only, and ROS-treated samples received appropriate buffer containing H2O2, HOCl, or the combination of H2O2 and HOCl (H2O2/HOCl). Final concentrations of H2O2 were 125, 250, or 500 μm; final concentrations of HOCl were 12.5, 25, or 50 μm in a total volume of 200 μl. Samples were mixed after each addition and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Carbonyl groups are formed as a consequence of protein oxidation and in the reaction of HOCl with pyridinium compounds. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine assay for carbonyls (48Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4980) Google Scholar) was performed according to kit instructions in the Oxyblot-oxidized protein detection kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) without SDS-PAGE separation. In brief, aliquots of each collagen sample were reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to derivatize carbonyl groups to the product 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone. After derivatization, aliquots of each collagen sample were diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and spotted onto dry nitrocellulose, and the derivatized product was detected by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody that specifically recognized 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone. The spot intensities were quantified by scanning densitometry (Arcus II flatbed scanner) using NIH Image version 1.57 software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Cold precipitation of collagen samples was performed according to the Pierce BCA Applications Note 13 (Pierce). 200 μl of −20 °C acetone were added to 50 μl of each sample, vortexed, and placed at −20 °C for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C; supernatants were removed, and the remaining acetone was evaporated by leaving samples uncovered for 30 min at RT. Fluorescamine reacts directly with primary amines or imino acids to yield highly fluorescent derivatives that emit fluorescence at 475 nm when excited at 390 nm (49Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar) and was used according to the method of Bohlen et al. (50Bohlen P. Stein S. Dairman W. Udenfriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar).o-Phthalaldehyde also reacts with primary amines and imino acids and was used according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Both assays were performed on aliquots of each collagen sample, acetone precipitates of each sample, or sample supernatants of acetone precipitates after ROS and/or protease treatments. Triplicates of each sample (200 μl) were placed in a 96-well cytoplate (CFCPN9610, Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA), and the fluorescence was read at an excitation wavelength of 340 ± 20 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 ± 20 nm (Cytofluor 2350, Perspective Biosystems, Inc.; Cambridge, MA). 4-μg aliquots of acetone-precipitated collagen or non-precipitated collagen samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis using a 5% stacking gel and a 10% separating gel prepared according to a modified Laemmli procedure previously described in detail (51Steinbeck M.J.

Treating the pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 with trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, increased MGMT mRNA and protein levels by 2–3-fold. Surprisingly, TSA treatment increased MGMT promoter-dependent luciferase activity by some 40-fold in a transient reporter expression assay. Deletion and point mutation analysis showed that two AP-1 binding sites in the MGMT promoter are involved in activation by TSA. Ectopic expression of the transcriptional coactivators cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, enhanced luciferase expression. Overexpression of adenovirus E1A, which binds CBP/p300, strongly inhibited both basal and TSA-inducible MGMT promoter activity, while a mutant E1A, defective in binding CBP/p300, did not. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TSA treatment increased histone acetylation in the endogenous MGMT promoter region, which also showed association with CBP/p300. Taken together, our results indicate that targeted histone acetylation results in the remodeling of chromatin by recruitment of the coactivator CBP/p300, and constitutes an important step in regulating MGMT expression.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). MGMT acts by transferring the O 6-alkyl group to a specific cysteine residue within its own sequence in a single step, stoichiometric reaction (4Foote R.S. Mitra S. Pal B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This transfer irreversibly inactivates MGMT. Hence, MGMT is a major contributor to cellular protection from the mutagenic, carcinogenic, and cytotoxic effects of DNA-alkylating agents. MGMT expression is highly variable in normal tissues as well as in tumor cells (5Citron M.R. Decker S. Chen S. Schneider S. Graver M. Kleynerman L. Khan L.B. White A. Schoenhaus M. Yarosh D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4131-4134PubMed Google Scholar, 6Washington W.J. Foote R.S. Dunn W.C. Generoso W.M. Mitra S. Mech. Ageing. Dev. 1989; 48: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A fraction of primary tumor cells, and 20% of human tumor cell lines, lack expression of MGMT (7Day III, R.S. Ziolkowski C.H.J. Seudiero D.A. Meyer S.A. Lubiniecki A.S. Giardi A.J. Galloway S.M.

Bobola S. Mueller D.A. Kolstoe D.D. Ojemann G.A. Berger M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conversely, some tumor cells express MGMT at a high level and are highly resistant to chemotherapy with BCNU (9Kokkinakis D.M. Ahmed M.M. Delgado R. Fruitwala M.M. Mohiuddin M. Albores-Saavedra J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5360-5368PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling MGMT expression is of major clinical significance. The MGMT gene encoding an mRNA of 950 nucleotides consists of five exons, and spans more than 170 kilobase pairs (10Tano K. Shiota S. Collier J. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11Nakatsu Y. Hattori K. Hayakawa H. Shimizu K. Sekiguchi M. Mutant. Res. 1993; 293: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 5′-regulatory sequence (including its promoter) has been cloned (12Harris L.C. Potter P.M. Tano K. Shiota S. Mitra S. Brent T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The promoter is extremely GC-rich, and lacks both TATA and CAAT boxes. Several cis elements were identified, including six putative Sp1 sites within the CpG island, two glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE), and two each of putative AP-1 and AP-2 elements (12Harris L.C. Potter P.M. Tano K. Shiota S. Mitra S. Brent T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The potential function of each of the GRE and AP-1 sites in activation of MGMT has been investigated previously (13Biswas T. Ramana C.V. Srinivasan G. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Chen Z. Tano K. Thompson E.B. Mitra S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Boldogh I. Ramana C.V. Chen Z. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Grosch S. Grombacher T. Mitra S. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3950-3956PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the lack of expression of MGMT in Mex− cell lines, in which no deletion or gross rearrangement in the gene was observed, is not understood (15von Wronski M.A. Harris L.C. Tano K. Mitra S. Bigner D.D. Brent T.P. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression driven by the MGMT promoter indicates that Mex− cells do not lack necessary trans-acting factors (16Harris L.C. Potter P.M. Remack S.O. Brent T.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6404-6406PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that gene silencing results from modification of cis elements, by mechanisms such as CpG methylation (17Qian C.X Brent T.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3672-3677PubMed Google Scholar) and/or chromatin alteration (18Costello J.F. Futscher B.W. Kroes R.A. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6515-6521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have established that chromatin remodeling via histone modifying enzymes, namely histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), is involved in transcriptional activation and repression, respectively (19Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 20Pazin J.M. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that acetylation of the ε-amino group of lysine residues at the NH2-terminal domain of histones promotes destabilization of histone-DNA interaction in the nucleosome, resulting in increased accessibility of the open chromatin to the transcriptional machinery (19Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar), while histone deacetylase reverses this process by removing the acetyl groups, and represses transcription (20Pazin J.M. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, several studies demonstrated enrichment of hyperacetylated histones within the transcriptionally active/competent chromatinin vivo, and hypoacetylated histones were shown to be concentrated in transcriptionally silenced domains (19Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 21Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A (TSA), a specific and potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase, modulates expression of only 2% of cellular genes, which implies that acetylation may be targeted to specific genes or chromosomal domains (22Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). A simple but attractive hypothesis is that targeted histone acetylation is achieved by recruitment of acetyltransferase to the signal-responsive promoters. Strong support for this idea was provided by the recent observations that transcription cofactors, including CBP, p300, PCAF, GCN5, ACTA, SRC-1, and TAFII 250 subunits of TFIID have intrinsic HAT activity, and are recruited to the promoter region in a signal-dependent process (for review, see Ref. 24Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300, originally identified as adenovirus E1A-binding proteins (25Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerds M. Decaprio J.A. Bentky-Lowrence J. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), have long been recognized as key molecules for gene regulation by communicating between transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. CBP and p300 are functional homologues and henceforth referred to as CBP/p300 (26Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 does not by itself interact with a specific DNA sequence; instead, it interacts with multiple transcription factors including AP-1 via dedicated domains, and form multiprotein complexes, named “enhanceosomes” (27Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

The functional requirements for the HAT activities of CBP/p300 (30Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) and PCAF have recently been examined, along with their roles in regulation of differentiation, transcription activation, and signaling pathways (19Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 24Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By examining the contribution of chromatin remodeling to transcriptional regulation of the human MGMT gene, we show in this report that histone hyperacetylation activates MGMT gene in MIA PaCa-2 cells, and transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 is involved in both basal and TSA-induced, AP-1-mediated MGMT promoter activation. We also discuss the possible mechanism for the remodeling of chromatin structure of the MGMT gene that is needed to regulate its expression. MIA PaCa-2 (ATCC CRL-1420) cells were grown at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Trichostatin A (TSA) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). After extraction of total cellular RNA with RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc.), 50 μg of RNA/lane was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and then transferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary electrophoresis (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and then hybridized with 32P-labeled MGMT cDNA or 18 S rRNA as probe. The MGMT cDNA probe was an EcoRI fragment of pKT100 (10Tano K. Shiota S. Collier J. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Both prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 65 °C with QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene), and the membrane was subsequently washed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The signal intensity was quantified by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). TSA-treated or untreated cells were lysed by incubating with lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 15 min. After three cycles of freezing and thawing, the lysates were centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants collected and stored at −80 °C. After protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad reagent, SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide) was carried out (50 μg of protein/lane). Western analysis was performed with polyclonal MGMT antibody as described previously (13Biswas T. Ramana C.V. Srinivasan G. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Chen Z. Tano K. Thompson E.B. Mitra S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Histones were extracted from TSA-treated or untreated cultured cells and SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide) was carried out (5 μg/lane). Polyclonal anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used at 4 μg/ml. The histones were extracted from the cells according to Cousens et al. (32Cousens L.S. Gallwitz D. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1716-1723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different isoforms of acetylated histones from TSA treated or untreated cells were analyzed by acid-urea-Triton (AUT) slab gel electrophoresis as described by Yoshida et al. (22Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of chromatin with anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody was performed by a modified procedure of Braunsteinet al. (21Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). After treatment of approximately 1 × 107 cells in the culture medium with TSA for 9 h, the treated and control cells were incubated in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min to allow reversible cross-linking of proteins, including histones, to DNA. The cells were harvested and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture), and sonicated 10 times for 10 s at 0 °C. After clarification of the lysate by centrifugation, 0.1 ml of supernatant containing solubilized chromatin was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. To reduce nonspecific background, the diluted chromatin solution was shaken for 40 min at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry as 50% suspension in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (TE), which was pretreated with salmon sperm DNA. For immunoprecipitation, the treated chromatin solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody. The immunocomplex was then purified by binding to 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry as before. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, sequentially washed twice with dilution buffer, once with dilution buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and once with a buffer containing 0.25% LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. Finally the beads were washed with TE, and the complexes eluted with two 250-μl aliquots of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3) at room temperature for 15 min. The pooled eluates were heated to 65 °C for 4–5 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links and then treated with proteinase K for 3 h. The DNA was subsequently extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and the precipitate dissolved in 20 μl of TE. PCR amplification of DNA was carried out with diluted aliquots, using oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCCAGGGAAGAGTGTCCTCTGCTCCCT and 5′-GGCCTGTGGTGGGCGATGCCGTCCAG as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, encompassing the two AP-1 sites in the MGMT promoter region. To ensure that PCR amplification was in the linear range, the PCR products with different dilutions of input DNA were quantitated. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and their sequences confirmed directly. In some experiments, cells were transfected with MGMT promoter-reporter (p−954/+24ML) and the CHIP assay was performed as before. In this case the 3′ primer for PCR, 5′-GGCCTGTGGTGGGCGATGCCGTCCAG corresponded to 3′ of the MGMT promoter and the 5′ primer 5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG to a sequence in the pGL2 basic vector. For PCR of non-coding region of the pGL2 basic vector, the 5′ primer was 5′-GGTAATACGGTTATCCACAGAAT and the 3′ primer was 5′-GTTACCAGTGGCTGCTGCCAGTGGC. Exponentially growing MIA PaCa-2 cells (5 × 106/dish) were suspended in 300 μl of PBS, electroporated at 960 microfarads and 220 V using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), and transferred back to dishes containing culture medium. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing TSA or ethanol, at 24 h after transfection. After TSA treatment for another 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity of the extracts was measured in a luminometer using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the protein concentration of the lysate. In some experiments, 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH) was included in the transfection procedure, so that β-gal activity could be used to correct for variation in transfection efficiency. The following plasmids were used in the transfection assays. All the deletion constructs of MGMT-luciferase (p−72/+24ML, p−575/+24ML, p−954/+24ML, and p−3500/+24ML) cloned in pGL2 basic vector (Promega) have been described previously (13Biswas T. Ramana C.V.

Site-directed mutation of two AP-1 sites in p−954/+24ML reporter plasmid was described by Boldoghet al. (14Boldogh I. Ramana C.V. Chen Z. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Grosch S. Grombacher T. Mitra S. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3950-3956PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pGL2-control vector (Promega), and pCMVβ (CLONTECH) were used as controls. pCMV-E1A encoding adenovirus E1A 12 S protein and mutant Δ2–36 E1A were kind gifts of Dr. P.

Grossman (Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Boston, MA). pCI-PCAF encoding the human PCAF and PCAF antibody were kind gifts of Dr. Y. Nakatani (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To investigate whether chromatin remodeling via histone acetylation plays a regulatory role in MGMT expression, we examined the effect of TSA, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, on MGMT expression. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of MGMT mRNA, when normalized with respect to the level of 18 S rRNA, was approximately 3-fold higher at 24 h after treatment with 100 ng/ml TSA (Fig.1 A). Concomitantly, we observed approximately a 3.5-fold increase in the MGMT protein level by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). Time course studies on the MGMT protein level showed that the increased level of the MGMT protein could be detected after 16 h of TSA treatment, with the protein level reaching the maximum by 24 h (Fig. 1 C). These results raised the possibility that inhibition of histone deacetylation was responsible for activating the MGMT gene. Because TSA was shown earlier to arrest cell cycle progression in some cell lines in the G1 or G2/M phase (33Hoshikawa Y. Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 214: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to investigate the effects of various amounts of TSA on cell cycle progression of MIA PaCa-2 cells. TSA at 100 ng/ml had a negligible effect on cell cycle progression in this cell line (Table I). Consequently, we used 100 ng/ml TSA for MGMT activation in all subsequent studies.Figure 1TSA-mediated activation of MGMT mRNA and protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells.

Because earlier studies indicated that the primary effect of inhibiting histone deacetylation is to modulate transcription of a subset of genes (23Van lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar), we determined whether TSA-mediated activation of MGMT occurred at the promoter level. An MGMT promoter-luciferase reporter construct (p−954/+24ML), containing the MGMT promoter sequence from −954 to +24 base pairs (13Biswas T. Ramana C.V. Srinivasan G. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Chen Z. Tano K. Thompson E.B. Mitra S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was used for transient expression of luciferase reporter in transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SV40 promoter-dependent luciferase expression plasmid was used as the control. TSA (100 ng/ml) activated MGMT promoter-driven luciferase expression by some 40-fold. Some promoter activation (∼4-fold) could be detected with TSA concentration of as low as 20 ng/ml. We also observed a ∼5-fold increase in luciferase activity driven by the SV40 promoter, consistent with an earlier observation (34Nakajima H. Kim Y.B. Terano H. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 241: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A time-course study on reporter expression with 100 ng/ml TSA showed that activation of luciferase could be detected after 4 h of TSA treatment, and the enzyme activity reached the maximum after approximately 24 h. To identify the factors that are responsible for TSA-induced activation of the MGMT promoter, we carried out promoter deletion and mutagenesis analysis. MIA PaCa-2 cells were transiently transfected with a series of 5′ promoter deletion constructs, treated with TSA, and the luciferase activity then measured with cell-free extracts. A 10-fold activation of the promoter activity by TSA was observed with the minimal promoter reporter construct (p−72/+24ML), whereas the maximum induction (∼ 45-fold) was observed with the (p−954/+24ML) promoter reporter (Table II). Interestingly, only a ∼25-fold increase was observed after TSA treatment with the longer, p−3500/+24ML, reporter construct. This result suggests the presence of a negative regulatory element in the upstream (−3500 to −954 bp) region of the MGMT promoter. The presence of a similar negative regulatory element was also observed in TSA-mediated activation of p21/WAF1 promoter (35Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa S. Nakanu K. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Deletion of the promoter sequence from −954 to −575 base pairs decreased TSA-mediated induction by 2.5-fold. Further deletion of the sequence to position −72 decreased TSA-mediated induction by 4-fold. In any case, we conclude from these data that the cis elements required for promoter activation by TSA are present within the −72 bp region and between −575 and −954 bp upstream of the transcription start site.Table IIDeletion and mutational analysis of MGMT promoter in reporter assay for TSA responseMGMT-promoter reporter 2-aThe plasmid constructs were described earlier (13, 14).

Examination of the sequence within the −72 bp region revealed the presence of three Sp1-binding sites. Earlier in vivofootprinting studies showed DNA protein interaction at six Sp1 sites, including these three sites, in an MGMT-expressing cell line (18Costello J.F. Futscher B.W. Kroes R.A. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6515-6521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the sequence between −954 and −575 bp revealed several transcription factor-binding sites (12Harris L.C. Potter P.M. Tano K. Shiota S. Mitra S. Brent T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), including two AP-1 sites and two GREs.

Resolving enzymes function as dimers, resolving the four-way DNA junction by the introduction of paired nicks in opposing strands with a magnesium-dependent endonuclease activity. Despite these functional similarities, the junction resolving enzymes are structurally diverse with no detectable sequence similarity among any of the known examples. Structural studies have highlighted this diversity because the crystal structures of RuvC (13Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K.

Lilley, personal communication. have radically different folds. These observations have led to the suggestion that resolving enzymes have arisen several times during the course of evolution, perhaps by recruitment of nucleases with other cellular roles. This is almost certainly the case for the eubacterial enzyme RuvC, which shares a fold and metal binding site with members of the RNase HI superfamily (13Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H.

Whereas the Archaea resemble their fellow prokaryotes in most respects, they share many similarities with the Eucarya in the information processing pathways including DNA replication, transcription, and translation (reviewed in Ref. 16Keeling P.J. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5761-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the archaeal processes constitute a useful model system for the much more complex eucaryal equivalents. We are investigating the pathway of homologous recombination in the Archaea and have detected two Holliday junction resolving enzymes, Hje and Hjc, in the CrenarchaeoteSulfolobus solfataricus (8Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The gene for Hjc has been identified and is conserved in all Archaea for which extensive genome sequence is available (8Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate manipulation of the global structure of the four-way junction substrate by Hjc and disruption of base stacking near the cleavage site. We report the identification of a structural motif in Hjc that is shared by a diverse group of nucleases and constitutes a binding site for the catalytic metal ions. Parallels between Holliday junction resolving enzymes and restriction enzymes that were first pointed out at a biochemical level for the yeast mitochondrial enzyme Cce1 (18Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) now achieve a firm structural basis in the archaeal Hjc enzyme. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and four-way DNA junctions assembled as described previously (18Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the sequences described in the following paragraphs. This fixed four-way junction was prepared with arms of 15 or 25 bp2 as described previously (45Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I.H. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Comparative gel electrophoresis experiments utilized a version of junction 3 with four arms of 60 bp in length. Six forms of junction 3 with two long and two short arms were derived from this junction as described previously (46Pöhler J.R.G. Giraud-Panis M.-J.E. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 678-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is a fixed junction with 20 bp in each arm assembled from four oligonucleotides, each of 40 nucleotides in length as described previously (47White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This junction is utilized for permanganate-probing experiments. The junction has arms of 15 bp including eight thymine residues centered around the point of strand exchange on the r strand: b, 5′-TCCGTCCTAGCAAGGAGTCTGCTACCGGAA; h, 5′-TTCCGGTAGCAGACTAAAAGGTGGTTGAAT; r, 5′-ATTCAACCACCTTTTTTTTAACTGCAGCAG; x, 5′-CTGCTGCAGTTAAAACCTTGCTAGGACGGA. Recombinant Hjc protein was expressed in E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene), and the protein was purified as described previously (8Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, Hjc was purified by chromatography on an SP-Sepharose high performance 26/10 column (Hi-Load, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). A 500-ml linear gradient of 0–1000 mm NaCl was used to elute cationic proteins. Fractions corresponding to a distinct absorbance peak were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a 26/70 gel filtration column (Superdex 200 Hi-Load, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed with Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and shown to contain essentially homogeneous Hjc protein. This protein was used for all subsequent analyses. Site-directed mutagenesis of Hjc was carried out in the plasmid pUC119 using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). After mutagenesis, DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no spurious mutations had been introduced. The Hjc mutants were subcloned into pET19b and were expressed and purified similar to the wild-type enzyme. The oligonucleotides used to introduce the mutations are listed as follows: E12Qfor, 5′-GGAAAGGTTCCGCAGTACAACGAAATATTGTGAG; E12Qrev, 5′-CTCACAATATTTCGTTGTACTGCGGAACCTTTCC; D42Nfor, 5′-GACCCTATACCGAATATTATCGCT; D42Nrev, 5′-AGCGATAATATTCGGTATAGGGTC; E55Qfor, 5′-CGTTATTATTTTAATTCAGATGAAGAGTAG; E55Qrev, 5′-CTACTCTTCATCTGAATTAAAATAATAACG; K57Afor, 5′-TTTTAATTGAGATGGCGAGTAGAAAGG; K57Arev, 5′-CCTTTCTACTCGCCATCTCAATTAAAA. Samples of purified Hjc protein (1 μm) were incubated with radioactive 5′-32P-labeled four-way DNA junction 3 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml calf thymus duplex competitor DNA) including either 1 mm EDTA or 0.1 mm MgCl2 in a 10-μl total volume for 5 min at 20 °C, prior to addition of loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, 15% Ficoll type 400) at a dilution of 1:6 (v/v). Samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer or Tris-borate and 0.1 mm MgCl2 with buffer recirculation. After electrophoresis, gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film for documentation. Binding affinity was measured by gel electrophoretic retardation analysis using radioactive 5′-32P-labeled junction 1 in EDTA binding buffer as described previously (8Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out using 1 μm purified recombinant Hjc protein in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2) using 80 nm 5′-32P-labeled junction as a substrate. Calf thymus DNA (0.2 mg/ml) was added as a competitor to minimize nonspecific endonuclease activity and DNA-binding proteins. Reactions were initiated by the addition of magnesium to the assay mix in a 5-μl total volume and incubated at 60 °C. At set time points aliquots were removed, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 μl of formamide/EDTA loading mix with heating to 95 °C. Products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and phosphor imaging as described previously (48White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Radioactive 5′-32P-labeled four-way DNA junction Z28 was incubated at room temperature for 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm Hjc protein in binding buffer. The total reaction volume was 20 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of freshly dissolved 25 mm KMnO4 and were stopped after 1 min with the addition of 1.5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. After ethanol precipitation, DNA samples were reacted with 100 μl of 1 m piperidine for 30 min at 95 °C. Piperidine was removed by vacuum desiccation, and the pellets were washed three times with 30 μl of water and were vacuum desiccated after each water addition. The dried samples were resuspended in formamide loading mix and analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The Holliday junction assumes a conformation known as the “stacked X structure” in the presence of divalent metal ions, folding by coaxial stacking of pairs of helices in an antiparallel 2-fold symmetric cross (reviewed in Ref. 19Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9513-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This structure has been studied by a wide variety of techniques and has recently been confirmed by x-ray crystallography (20Lilley D.M. Norman D.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Ortiz-Lombardia M. Gonzalez A. Eritja R. Aymam J. Azorin F. Coll M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Comparative gel electrophoresis has proven a powerful technique for the analysis of the global configuration of the four-way junction, both in solution and complexed with proteins. Using this technique, all Holliday junction binding proteins studied to date have been shown to alter the conformation of the Holliday junction on binding (reviewed in Ref. 22White M.F. Giraud-Panis M.-J.E. Pöhler J.R.G. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 647-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Hjc binding on the global conformation of the four-way junction J3 using comparative gel electrophoresis. In EDTA, the free junction species adopted the four-slow/two-fast pattern characteristic of the 4-fold symmetric junction with arms related by 90°. In the protein-DNA complex, this pattern was altered significantly with bound species adopting a distinctive “butterfly” (slow-fast-intermediate-intermediate-fast-slow) pattern (Fig.1). When the experiment was repeated in the presence of 0.1 mm Mg2+, the free junction adopted a slow-medium-fast-fast-medium-slow “smile” pattern, as observed previously for J3, which folds with B upon X and H upon R stacking (23Murchie A.I.H. Portugal J. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Again, the Hjc·DNA complexes adopted the butterfly pattern. These observations suggest that the four-way DNA junction is bound by Hjc in a 2-fold symmetric conformation with the B/X arms and H/R arms related by acute angles and the B/H and R/X pairs related by obtuse angles (Fig. 1). This X shape is reminiscent of that induced on J3 by the resolving enzyme RuvC, although in that case the structure deviated only slightly from 4-fold symmetry and tended toward acute angles between the B/H and R/X pairs (24Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas we cannot quantify the angles between the pairs of arms, the large differences in mobility of the 6 S species suggest that the angles deviate significantly from the 90° observed for Cce1 and RuvA and may approach or surpass a 120°/60° relationship for the obtuse and acute angles. Using a single turnover kinetic assay, we measured the rates of cleavage of each of the four strands of junction J3 individually. Cleavage was found to be biased, with a 5-fold faster rate observed for the b and r strands compared with the h and x strands (Fig.2). Relating this to the global structure of J3 in complex with Hjc, the more strongly cleaved strands are situated in the strands exchanging with acute angles, 3 nucleotides 3′ of the branch point (Figs. 1 and 2). Cleavages in the other two strands probably reflect a minor population of the junction that has been bound by Hjc in the other possible conformation with the B/X and H/R pairs of arms related by acute angles. Thymine residues in DNA are susceptible to modification by potassium permanganate but are protected from modification in the context of fully stacked duplex DNA. This modification renders the phosphodiester backbone susceptible to cleavage by piperidine. Modification by potassium permanganate is therefore a sensitive probe for base stacking in duplex DNA. Holliday junction binding proteins such as Cce1 and RuvA increase the sensitivity of thymines at the branch point to permanganate modification in the presence of magnesium ions, and this has been interpreted as evidence that the proteins unstack the DNA junction and possibly disrupt base pairing at the point of strand exchange (24Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,25White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Permanganate probing was used to analyze base stacking in the context of the Hjc-junction complex with junction Z28, which has eight thymines flanking the point of strand exchange on the r strand. In the absence of Hjc protein, all eight thymines were subject to modification by potassium permanganate, with the strongest reactivity at the 2 nucleotides flanking the point of strand exchange and symmetrical distribution with respect to the junction center (Fig.3 A, lane 3). The presence of magnesium in the reaction reduced the sensitivity of the flanking thymines to permanganate, consistent with junction stacking under these conditions (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). In the presence of saturating concentrations of the Hjc protein, we observed a marked increase in reactivity with potassium permanganate in both EDTA and magnesium (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 7). Quantification of the increase in reactivity for each of the thymine residues (from positions −4 to +4) revealed a pronounced bias in the reactivity toward the 5′ side of the junction center (Fig.3 B), suggesting the protein unstacks the duplex DNA in this region. Analysis of the cleavage of junction Z28 by Hjc reveals that, similar to junction J3, cleavage is biased, occurring predominantly in the h and x strands 3 nucleotides 3′ of the branch point (Fig.3 C). The position of cleavage of the h strand coincides with the area of enhanced reactivity toward permanganate detected on the r strand, suggesting that Hjc may introduce structural distortion in the DNA helix near the cleavage site. The base pairing in this region of the DNA duplex may be weakened or disrupted by Hjc on binding. Such distortions are common features of DNA recognition by restriction enzymes such as EcoRV (26Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and EcoRI (27McClarin J.A. Frederick C.A. Wang B.C. Greene P. Boyer H.W. Grable J. Rosenberg J.M. Science. 1986; 234: 1526-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Analysis of the residues conserved in a multiple alignment of all known Hjc sequences revealed a motif containing three acidic residues: Glu-12, Asp-42, and Glu-55 followed by lysine (Lys-57), similar to a conserved motif present in type II restriction enzymes (28Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). This motif constitutes part of the active site of the restriction enzymes, with the three acidic residues forming the metal binding pocket for the two catalytic magnesium ions (29Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and the conserved lysine predicted to play a role in stabilizing the transition state during catalysis (26Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To investigate the predicted secondary structure of Hjc in this region, we submitted a multiple alignment of seven Hjc proteins to the PredictProtein structure prediction program (30Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). The results are outlined in Fig. 4 with the conserved domain of Hjc aligned with the corresponding domains of EcoRV, PvuII, andBglI. The predicted secondary structure for Hjc consists of an α-helix containing the first acidic residue followed by three β-sheets, in remarkable agreement with the known secondary structures of the three restriction enzymes (31Venclovas C. Siksnys V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test our model for the metal binding site of the Hjc protein, we created site-directed mutants of the three conserved acidic residues (E12Q, D42N, E55Q) and the conserved lysine (K57A). The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as for the wild-type enzyme. The D42N mutant was poorly expressed inE. coli, and only small amounts of protein could be purified. The other three mutants were expressed at similar levels to the wild-type protein and retained the ability to bind specifically to the four-way junction J1 with an affinity comparable with the wild-type Hjc protein (Fig. 5 A). To compare the catalytic activities of the wild-type and mutant enzymes, we incubated the proteins with the four-way junction substrate Z28 in cleavage buffer at 60 °C and separated cleavage products from uncut substrate by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B). A weak residual activity in the mutant K57A represented a 1000-fold decrease in activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Mutants E12Q, D42N, and E55Q displayed no detectable catalytic activity. All four of these mutations thus appeared to have had a specific effect on catalysis rather than on substrate binding, consistent with the functional assignment made by analogy to the equivalent residues inEcoRV and other nucleases. Hjc contains a motif first identified as constituting part of the active site of the type II restriction enzyme EcoRV. Subsequent crystal structures of the restriction enzymesPvuII (32Athanasiadis A. Vlassi M. Kotsifaki D. Tucker P.A. Wilson K.S. Kokkinidis M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and BglI (33Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G. Greci J. Schildkraut I. Phillips S.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the metal binding pocket is structurally conserved in an αβ-barrel catalytic domain in the three enzymes, even though the overall folds are very different. The type II restriction enzymes EcoRI,BamHI, and Cfr101 also possess this αβ-barrel domain (reviewed in Refs. 34Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 35Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and more recently it has been identified in MutH (35Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), λ exonuclease (36Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7893-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and type I and III endonucleases (37Davies G.P. Martin I. Sturrock S.S. Cronshaw A. Murray N.E. Dryden D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes have a catalytic (usually N-terminal) domain in the form of an αβ-barrel with different domains that mediate subunit interactions and DNA recognition (35Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 38Venclovas C. Timinskas A. Siksnys V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The quaternary structures and functions of these proteins are remarkably divergent. Type II restriction enzymes are dimeric and recognize and cleave specific nucleotide sequences. MutH is monomeric, and its activity is regulated by the MutL and MutS proteins following mismatch DNA recognition (35Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, λ-exonuclease, a processive 5′→3′ exonuclease that degrades one strand of a DNA duplex after the formation of a double strand break, has a toroidal homotrimeric structure (36Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7893-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most striking example of the separation of recognition and catalysis is seen in the restriction enzymeFokI, which has the catalytic αβ-barrel domain separated from the DNA recognition domain by a linker (39Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nature has thus repeatedly utilized a catalytic metal ion binding domain efficient in phosphodiester bond hydrolysis coupled with an array of specific DNA and protein recognition elements to solve many diverse problems in nucleic acid metabolism. We have shown by site-directed mutagenesis that mutations in residues Glu-12, Asp-42, Glu-55, and Lys-57 of Hjc all result in at least a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic activity, though the mutants retain the ability to bind the four-way junction. By comparison, mutagenesis of the equivalent residues in EcoRV results in similar large decreases in catalytic activity without significantly affecting substrate binding (40Jeltsch A. Maschke H. Selent U. Wenz C. Kohler E. Connolly B.A. Thorogood H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6239-6246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Selent U. Ruter T. Kohler E. Liedtke M. Thielking V.

This is the first example of this domain in a Holliday junction resolving enzyme and the first in an archaeal protein of known function. Using the sequence alignments shown in Fig. 4, we used the crystal structure of the metal binding domain of EcoRV to generate a model of the catalytic domain of Hjc (Fig.6 A). The model encompasses the N-terminal half of the Hjc protein consisting of an α-helix and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The three acidic residues group in reasonable positions to act as ligands for two magnesium ions (magenta spheres in the model), and the orientation of the conserved lysine is consistent with a role in catalysis. By analogy with the other nucleases containing the metal ion binding domain, the C-terminal half of the protein, which is less conserved in Hjc proteins from different archaeal species, may play a role in dimerization and/or DNA recognition. Fig. 6 B shows a model for the complex of the catalytic domain of Hjc, positioned on the minor groove side of a four-way DNA junction, which is represented in the X conformation suggested by comparative gel electrophoresis. The presumed catalytic magnesium ion has been positioned within 5 Å of the known site of cleavage on the phosphodiester backbone. Using this constraint, the model suggests a possible mode of binding of the Hjc protein with the four-way DNA junction substrate. Basic residues in Hjc are in reasonable proximity to the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone, and in particular, the model suggests possible roles for two arginines, Arg-13 and Arg-28. These are the only basic residues other than the catalytic Lys-57 that are absolutely conserved in all Hjc sequences, and in the model of the complex they exist in suitable positions to form salt bridges with phosphates on an adjacent arm of the junction. On the basis of the model and the conservation of these residues we predict that they are important for DNA binding and possibly for recognition of the branched structure of the four-way DNA junction. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the archaeal Holliday junction resolving enzyme Hjc manipulates the global structure of the four-way DNA junction into a 2-fold symmetric X conformation on binding. Paired nicks in the phosphodiester backbone are introduced on the minor groove face in a region of duplex DNA 3 bp from the point of strand exchange, accompanied by local distortion of base stacking in the duplex. Hjc utilizes an αβ-barrel domain for the chemical step in the resolution of four-way DNA junctions, with four conserved catalytic residues found in many other nucleases of diverse function. The C-terminal half of the Hjc protein may complete the αβ-barrel domain and provide an interface for dimerization. Thus the Hjc dimer may consist of two nuclease domains capable of introducing nicks in duplex DNA on either side of the branch point of a four-way junction, with other structural elements providing structural specificity and forming the dimer interface. We thank Steve Halford for pointing out the sequence similarity between Hjc and the catalytic domain of the restriction enzymes."

The α-subunit has a characteristic glycine-rich segment in the middle portion. To elucidate the role of the region in processing functions of the enzyme, deletion or site-directed mutations were introduced, and effects on kinetic parameters and substrate binding of the enzyme were analyzed. Deletion of three residues of the region, Phe289 to Ala291, led to a dramatic reduction in processing activity to practically zero. Mutation of Phe289, Lys296, and Met298 to alanine resulted in a decrease in the activity, but these mutations had no apparent effect on interactions between the two subunits, indicating that reduction in processing activity is not due to structural disruption at the interface interacting with the β-subunit. Although the mutant enzymes, Phe289Ala, Lys296Ala, and Met298Ala, had an approximate 10-fold less affinity for substrate peptides than did that of the wild type, the deletion mutant, Δ289–291, showed an extremely low affinity.

Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All members, except the α-MPPs, have a metal-binding motif, His-X-X-Glu-His. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that this site is responsible for the catalytic activity of MPP (19Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem.

The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are also homologous to core 2 and core 1 proteins, respectively, of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc 1 complex), a component of the respiratory chain (21Rohlen D.A. Hoffmann J. van der Pas J.C. Nehls U. Preis D. Sackmann U. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plant MPP was purified as subunits of thebc 1 complex located in an inner membrane (9. 10). In Neurospora crassa, a core 1 protein of thebc 1 complex is identical with β-MPP in the matrix (22Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschung M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For correct recognition of the cleavage site, MPP requires information located within the extension peptides of the precursor proteins. Contrary to the strict substrate specificity of the enzyme, amino acid sequences of the extension peptides have a broad range of lengths with little similarity (23Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In the extension peptide, several basic amino acids intervene into a long sequence of neutral amino acid residues, and negatively charged residues are rarely present (24Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E.

Aromatic and bulky hydrophobic amino acids at position +1 and flexible linker regions containing proline and/or glycine between the two basic residues are required (28Ogishima T. Niidome T.

Amino acids at position +2 and +3 are also important for the specific recognition and cleavage reaction by MPP (31Song M.-C. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although β-MPP has a catalytic center containing a metal responsible for the reaction, the subunit alone has no apparent activity, and cooperative actions of the two subunits are essential for MPP activity (32Geli V.

Cross-linking analyses suggested that a substrate-binding domain might reside in α-MPP (35Yang M. Geli V. Oppliger W. Suda K. James P. Schatz G. J. Biol.

Indeed, mutation experiments revealed that acidic amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal portion of α-MPP are involved in substrate recognition and are mainly responsible for binding of distal basic amino acids of longer extension peptides (37Shimokata K.

Core 2 protein of the fungal or animal mitochondrialbc 1 complex that corresponds to α-MPP has a short stretch of glycine-rich segment. Crystal structures of thebc 1 complex from bovine and chicken heart mitochondria have been reported (39Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J.

Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar); hence, one can expect that MPP is similar in structure to the complex. The core 1 and core 2 proteins, which are structurally similar, consist of two domains of roughly equal size and almost identical folding topology. The two components representing these proteins were described as coming together in the form of a ball with a crack leading to internal cavity. Based on available data, the middle portion of core 2, which corresponds to the glycine-rich region of α-MPP conserved among many species, is located at the face toward the core 1 in the cavity. These findings suggest the possible involvement of segment characteristics of α-MPP in dimer formation, substrate recognition, or catalytic reaction of MPP. It thus seemed important to determine the role of the glycine-rich segment of α-MPP in the processing reaction. Several amino acid residues in the segment were mutated, and effects on kinetic parameters and substrate binding of the mutated enzymes were analyzed. Deletion of some amino acids in the segment led to an almost complete loss of the activity, without affecting formation of a stable heterodimeric complex. From these results, together with a simulation model calculated from the reported crystallographic data on the core proteins (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol.

A hexahistidine tag was introduced into the carboxyl termini of yeast α-MPP and rat β-MPP (42Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32547-32553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resultant cDNAs were finally inserted into a multiple cloning site of pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), leading to pTrcyα-His and pTrcrβ-His. To introduce mutations in α-MPP, site-directed mutagenesis was done using PCR, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with each plasmid were cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h at 25 °C. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g, the cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol, then lysed by sonication, followed by solubilization with the addition of Tween 20 to the final concentration of 0.1%. The soluble extract was recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The extract was loaded on a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; His-trap) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, 50 mmimidazole, 30% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20. After washing the column with the buffer, histidine-tagged MPP subunits were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified wild-type or mutant α-MPP was mixed with purified β-MPP, and then activity of the in vitro reconstituted MPP was measured using real time fluorometric assay, as described by Ogishima et al. (28Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A fluorogenic peptide, aminobenzoyl-LARPVGAALRRSFSTY(NO2)AQNN, synthesized based on the extension peptide of mouse malate dehydrogenase (MDH), was used as the substrate. Excitation was at 315 nm, and emitted light was measured at 420 nm. Fluorometry was done using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined using as substrate MDH1–21, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 21 amino acid residues of MDH precursor (27Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reconstituted MPP was incubated with the synthetic peptide in 440 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid and 200 mm NaCl. The processing products were analyzed by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, as described (27Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).K m and k cat values for MPPs were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Yeast β-MPP cDNA was inserted into the tetracycline-resistant region of pACYC184 (Nippon Gene). pTrcyα-His and pACYCyβ were co-expressed in BL21 strain. The cell extract was applied onto a nickel-chelating Sepharose column, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.5m imidazole. The co-eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Kitada et al. (42Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol.

The MDH5–25 peptide was labeled at the amino-terminal α-amino group with 7-diethylaminocoumarin (DAC), N-DAC-MDH5–25, as described by Kojimaet al. (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T.

The coumarin-labeled peptides of indicated concentrations added to the purified MPP were preincubated with 5 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min. Change in fluorescence was monitored at 470 nm (excitation at 390 nm) at 25 °C using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. K d values were calculated as described (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Modeling was performed using the Insight II/Homology Software Package (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). To build a model of MPP, core proteins cytochromebc 1 complex (1BCC, 1BGY, and 1QCR) was used as reference protein. The structurally conserved regions (SCRs) were assigned on condition that the value of the root mean square deviations of segment backbone atoms were under 0.5 Å. The intervening regions were defined as variable regions (VRs). Coordinates of side chains in the SCRs were automatically established according to reference proteins. The side chains that differed from the template were mutated to the corresponding amino acids in such a way that conformation of the common area was retained whenever possible. In the VRs, coordinates of the side chains were also automatically established according to reference proteins and were generated using the Loop-search command in homology. To avoid unacceptable van der Waals contacts, all side chains were optimized using the Auto-rotamer command. To refine the model structure, the energy minimization calculations were done using the Discover program and the consistent valence force field with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. We carried out energy minimizations in a two-step procedure. (i) All VRs were minimized using the conjugated gradient method while the backbone atoms were tethered (50 kcal mol-1A-2) and all SCRs were fixed. (ii) All VRs and the side chains of the SCRs were minimized using the conjugated gradient method while the backbone atoms of all SCRs were tethered (1000 kcal/mol·Å2). The two steps were carried out for 2000 iterations. To investigate the role of the characteristic glycine-rich region in α-subunit, which is a highly conserved segment among α-subunits of various MPPs but not other members of the related proteins, including β-MPP and two core proteins (Fig. 1 A,cf. Ref. 43Brumme S. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13143-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), conservative residues in the region with a large side chain, Phe289, Lys296, Met298, Tyr299, Arg301 and Leu302, were individually mutated to alanines or to similar amino acids, using PCR. Three, five, and eight amino acid residues at the center of this region, from Phe289 to Ala291, Ser288 to Gly292, and Gly287 to Pro294, respectively, were deleted (Fig. 1 B). Each mutant subunit was purified, and the role of these residues in substrate recognition and/or catalytic reaction was examined.Figure 1Alignment of α-MPP, β-MPP, andbc 1 complex core II protein from various sources and position of mutation.

The processing activity of mutant MPPs was measured using as substrate a fluorogenic peptide (Fig.2). No activity was detected in the enzyme deleted even three amino acid residues from Phe289to Ala291, Δ289–291. Phe289Ala, Phe289Leu, Lys296Ala, and Met298Ala also showed little activity, less than 1% of the wild-type MPP. On the other hand, other mutant proteins examined, including Met298Leu, Tyr299Ala, Tyr299Ser, Arg301Ala, Arg301Lys, and Leu302Ala, retained substantial activity, 40–80% of the wild-type MPP. Differential effects of mutation on Met298 to alanine and leucine indicate that the important feature of the methionine side chain is its hydrophobic character. Thus, Phe289, Lys296, and Met298 and residues 287–294 seem to be primarily involved in MPP function, including subunit assembly, substrate binding, and/or catalysis. Since both subunits of MPP are required for formation of a substrate binding pocket and different parts of the extension peptide of precursor protein interact with individual subunits at the interface (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), quantitative analysis of heterodimer formation between mutant α- and native β-subunits must be sensitive monitoring to detect structural change near substrate binding and/or catalytic sites in the mutant enzymes. To determine whether loss of processing activity of the mutant enzymes, as shown in Fig. 2, would result in failure in association of the subunits, we examined the association of the histidine-tagged wild-type and mutated α-subunits to non-tagged β-subunit on the nickel-chelating column (Fig.3 A). The histidine-tagged α-subunit was co-expressed with the non-tagged β-subunit inE. coli; the bacterial extract was applied onto a nickel-chelating column, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.5m imidazole. Nearly the same amount of non-tagged β-MPP was eluted together with the mutant α-MPP as well as with the wild-type one, indicating that mutation of the glycine-rich region of α-MPP has no effect on interactions between the two subunits. The same conclusion was derived from observations on quantitative analysis of the interaction between the mutant α-subunits and the wild-type β-subunit. We reported that addition of the inactive β-MPP mutated at either the putative active site or at essential glutamate residues efficiently decreased the wild-type MPP activity by replacing the wild-type β-MPP (19Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32547-32553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this system to examine interactions between the mutant α-MPP and the wild-type β-MPP (Fig. 3 B). When increasing amounts of mutant α-MPPs were added to the wild-type MPP, the mutant subunits clearly had decreased MPP activity, and a 50% reduction was observed when the equimolar amounts of the wild-type and mutant α-subunits were used. Thus, the mutant α-subunits can bind to the β-subunit with a similar affinity seen with the wild-type one. These results indicate that loss of processing activity observed in the mutants, even in the mutant-deleted 8-amino acid residues in the glycine-rich region, is not due to structural disruption of α-MPP at the interface interacting with β-MPP. To determine effects of the mutation on direct interactions between the enzyme and substrate, we synthesized the fluorescence-labeled peptide, in which an environment-sensitive coumarin derivative was covalently introduced into the peptide (MDH1–25) at the amino terminus, N-DAC-MDH5–25, and then we analyzed the substrate binding ability of the enzymes. The coumarin-labeled peptide gave a fluorescence emission spectrum with the maximum at 482 nm, and addition of the MPP, which had been inactivated in the presence of EDTA, led to a large increase in fluorescence intensity and to a blue shift in emission spectrum (emission maximum at 470 nm) (data not shown). As reported earlier (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,42Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32547-32553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), titration of the enzyme with the fluorescence-labeled peptide produced a simple saturation curve with an emission intensity at 470 nm. The dissociation constants, K d, were calculated from the titration curves (Table I). TheK d value of the wild-type MPP was determined to be 0.06 μm, a value essentially the same as noted earlier, 0.048 μm (38Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes, Lys296Ala and Met298Ala, had over a 10-fold less affinity than that of the wild type and a lesser effect on affinity to the N-DAC-MDH5–25 peptide was obtained with the Phe289 mutants. On the other hand, deletion mutants, Δ289–291, Δ288–292, and Δ287–294, showed an extremely low affinity to the peptide, i.e. theK d values were over 200-fold larger than that of the wild type.Table IEffects of mutations at the glycine-rich region on binding of fluorescence-labeled peptide to MPPMutantsK dμmWild type0.06 ± 0.01F289A0.46 ± 0.02F289L0.34 ± 0.01K296A1.10 ± 0.13M298A0.77 ± 0.26Δ289–29115.1 ± 3.4Δ288–29214.5 ± 3.4Δ287–29410.8 ± 1.8The fluorescence values at 470 nm of DAC-MDH 5–25 (0–4 μm) were measured in 1 ml of reaction mixtures containing 0.5 μm (wild type, F289A, F289L, K296A, and M198A) or 2 μm (deletion mutants) of MPP. The dissociation constants were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The fluorescence values at 470 nm of DAC-MDH 5–25 (0–4 μm) were measured in 1 ml of reaction mixtures containing 0.5 μm (wild type, F289A, F289L, K296A, and M198A) or 2 μm (deletion mutants) of MPP. The dissociation constants were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” To examine effects of mutations on the overall reaction, including substrate recognition and catalytic activity, we determined kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes, using the synthetic peptide substrate, MDH1–21 (TableII). As expected from the results for Fig. 2, the k cat values were dramatically decreased in the mutants, Phe289Ala, Phe289Leu, Lys296Ala, Met298Ala, and Δ289–291, although the extent of the effect varied among the mutants. Mutation at Phe289 and Lys296 led to reduction of the activity to less than 1% of the wild type. Although these mutants exhibited slight increases in the K mvalue, there was a marked decrease in the catalytic efficiency,k cat /K m, to less than 1% of that of the wild-type enzyme. The three deletion mutants exhibited no detectable activity. Thus, taken together with data in Table I, shortening the glycine-rich stretch led to a dramatic reduction of interactions between the enzyme and substrate peptides and cleavage reaction, whereas mutation of each amino acid in this region seemed to affect primarily the cleavage reaction.Table IIEffect of mutations on kinetic parametersMutantsK mk catk cat/K mμmmin −1min −1 μm −1Wild type0.12 ± 0.0465.3 ± 8.3315 ± 22F289A0.99 ± 0.250.19 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.03F289L0.97 ± 0.140.42 ± 0.050.44 ± 0.01K296A0.82 ± 0.050.14 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.01M298A0.52 ± 0.101.37 ± 0.402.58 ± 0.30Δ289–291<0.02Kinetics parameters of the wild type (0.01 μm) and mutant (0.05–0.4 μm) MPPs were measured using MDH1–21 peptide (0–2 μm) as substrate, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values were calculated from three independent experiments.

Our present observations indicate that the glycine-rich segment in the middle portion of α-MPP, which is characteristic of this subunit, is important for MPP functions. We found that lack of a part of the segment led to a dramatic reduction of interaction between the enzyme and substrate peptide and of the catalytic activity, thek cat value. Even in the deletion mutant, the subunit protein retained correct interaction with the wild-type β-MPP, demonstrating that the mutation caused little structural distortion of α-MPP at the interface interacting with β-MPP. The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are homologous to the core proteins of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome oxidoreductase (21Rohlen D.A. Hoffmann J. van der Pas J.C. Nehls U. Preis D. Sackmann U. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the bc 1 complex from mammalian and avian mitochondria have been reported (39Xia D., Yu, C.-A.

Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), and one can expect that MPP is similar in structure to the core proteins in the complex. Based on reported crystallographic data (39Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 40Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) on bovine core proteins, we generated an energy-minimized model of MPP (Fig.4). In dimer form, the two subunits (α- and β-MPP) form a crack leading to the internal cavity, the wall of which is lined with mostly hydrophilic amino acid residues. The glycine-rich region of α-MPP is predicted to form a loop structure that protrudes at the surface of internal cavity formed by two subunits and reaches close to the zinc-binding active center of β-MPP. We found that deletion of a part of the glycine-rich segment seemed to primarily affect binding of the extension peptides of the precursor proteins to the enzyme. The result suggests that the glycine-rich loop could open the crack in the molecule and present the extension peptide to the region near the active site. Shortening of the glycine-rich loop may lead to narrowing the crack. An extension peptide of the “Rieske” iron-sulfur protein, subunit 9, was reported to be caged and mainly interacts with some amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region of the core 2 protein, which corresponds to α-MPP. It is surmised from the findings that subunit 9 has been cleaved directly from the Rieske protein by these core proteins and remained in the crack, although the isolated bovine heart core proteins lack processing activity (40Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The core proteins in plant mitochondrial bc 1 complexes, however, have processing activity and do not contain subunit 9 in the molecule (9Braun H.-P. Emmerman M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 9: 3219-3227Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been reported that core proteins of bovine heartbc 1 complex exhibit peptidase activity after removal or weakening of the binding of the subunit 9 peptide with the core proteins in the complex by mild detergent treatment (44Deng K. Zhang L. Karchurin A.M., Yu, L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to note that α-MPPs from mammalian and yeast mitochondria and the core 2 protein from plant bc 1 complex have a long glycine-rich segment in the middle portion of the subunit, whereas the corresponding segments of the core 2 proteins in thebc 1 complexes from mammalian, avian, and yeast are all short (Fig. 1 A). Thus, evidence of processing activity seems to correlate with the lack of subunit 9 and the presence of a long glycine-rich segment. Alternative possible role of the glycine-rich segment might be promotion of rapid release of the extension peptide and mature protein from the enzyme after the processing reaction. Lack of a long loop would impair the process and result in a dramatic reduction in rates of reaction. We also found in the segment that Phe289, Lys296, and Met298 are responsible for catalytic activity rather than for interaction with the precursor proteins, because the k cat value is markedly decreased by mutation of these residues to alanine, whereasK d and K m values are not markedly affected. We reported that alteration of amino acid at position +2 in the peptide substrates had a greater effect on theV max value than on the K mvalue (31Song M.-C. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other residues near the cleavage site, i.e.positions −2, +1, and +3, are also essential for the processing reaction, and the catalytic activity was influenced by mutation of these amino acids, albeit to a lesser extent (27Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol.

(Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to state the precise orientation of each residue in the loop because the structure presented in Fig. 4 is a simulation model calculated from the data based on the core proteins, the well conserved amino acids in the glycine-rich segment, like Phe289, Lys296 and Met298, seem to interact directly with these essential amino acids near the cleavage site of the precursor proteins. Since Phe289 could not be replaced by leucine, the aromatic nature would be required for its function, suggesting that the residue could interact with the proximal arginine residue at position −2, which is one of the most important resides both for recognition of the substrate peptide and cleavage reaction (27Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), through cation-π interaction to fix the arginine residue at around reaction center. Lys296 could also interact with amino acids at position +2 and/or +3, where hydroxyl residues are highly effective for cleavage reaction (28Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Song M.-C. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), probably through hydrogen bonds, whereas Met298 might interact with aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position +1 through its flexible hydrophobic stalk. However, the precise structural information, such as crystallographic data on the MPP, is required for further discussion."

All of these mutants bind heme, but absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that the water coordinated to the iron atom is lost in several of the Gly-139 mutants, giving rise to mixtures of hexacoordinate and pentacoordinate ligation states. The active site perturbation is greatest when large amino acid side chains are introduced. Of the Gly-139 mutants investigated, only G139A catalyzes the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent oxidation of heme to biliverdin, but most of them exhibit a new H2O2-dependent guaiacol peroxidation activity. The Gly-143 mutants, all of which have lost the water ligand, have no heme oxygenase or peroxidase activity. The results establish the importance of Gly-139 and Gly-143 in maintaining the appropriate environment for the heme oxygenase reaction and show that Gly-139 mutations disrupt this environment, probably by displacing the distal helix, converting heme oxygenase into a peroxidase. The principal role of the heme oxygenase active site may be to suppress the ferryl species formation responsible for peroxidase activity.

Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin, which is then excreted as the glucuronic acid conjugate (2Schmid R. McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. VI. Academic, New York1979: 257-292Google Scholar). The excretion of bilirubin is frequently impaired in newborn children due to a lag in the expression of the necessary glucuronyl transferase and in individuals with a genetic glucuronyl transferase deficiency (3Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 203-266Google Scholar). High concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin are neurotoxic, and the prevention of its accumulation through phototherapy or the inhibition of HO is of clinical importance (4Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Kappas A. Drummond G.S. Manola T. Petmezaki S. Values T.

However, low concentrations of biliverdin and bilirubin appear to provide important antioxidant protection (7Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar, 8Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The iron released by HO is normally recycled and represents the major source of this metal in iron homeostasis, but increased iron release due to elevated heme oxygenase activity can trigger enhanced lipid and protein peroxidation (8Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 9Suttner D.M. Dennery P.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Finally, CO appears to play a role as a signaling molecule akin to that of nitric oxide (10Verma A. Hirsch D.L. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 11Stevens C.F. Wang Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Zhuo M. Small S.A. Kandel E.R.

A role for CO in signaling pathways has received strong support from studies of HO knockout mice (13Burnett A.L. Johns D.G. Kriegsfield L.J. Klein S.L. Calvin D.C. Demas G.E. Schramm L.P. Tonegawa S.

The existence of two HO isoforms, HO-1 and HO-2, is well established (15Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 16Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). HO-1 is induced by chemical agents and a variety of stress conditions, and is found in highest concentration in the spleen and liver. In contrast, HO-2 is not induced by exogenous stimuli and is found in highest concentrations in the brain and testes. The HO enzymes are membrane-bound proteins (19Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but water-soluble, catalytically active versions of rat and human HO-1 without the C-terminal 23-amino acid membrane anchor have been expressed inEscherichia coli (21Wilks A.

Biophys. 1993; 317: 253-258Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of HO-1 have been used to obtain crystal structures of both the human and rat enzymes (24Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The truncated human hHO-1 crystal structure shows that the heme pocket is primarily formed by two helices, one on the proximal and the other on the distal side of the heme (24Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The proximal helix includes His-25, the residue shown to be the proximal iron ligand by site-directed mutagenesis and resonance Raman (RR) studies (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These spectroscopic studies indicate that His-25 is coordinated to the iron as a neutral rather than strongly hydrogen-bonded or deprotonated imidazole (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Replacement of His-25 by an alanine produces a catalytically inactive protein to which heme binds without the detectable coordination of a strong axial iron ligand (27Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the proximal iron coordination and the catalytic activity can be restored in the H25A mutant by the addition of exogenous imidazole (28Wilks A. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2925-2926Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proximal histidine ligand is therefore catalytically important, but its precise orientation relative to the heme and its low imidazolate character do not appear to critically influence catalysis. The distal active site helix in hHO-1 is kinked by about 50° directly over the heme (Fig. 1) (24Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Unlike the myoglobins and peroxidases, the distal HO-1 active site does not have a histidine or other obvious polar residue positioned to stabilize iron-bound ligands. The only polar moieties that appear to be sufficiently close to directly hydrogen bond to the distal water ligand are the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Gly-139 and Gly-143, respectively (24Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). If the α-helical hydrogen bond involving these residues does not remain intact, Gly-139 and Gly-143 may be able to form polar contacts with the iron-bound ligands. In addition, these conserved glycine residues directly contact the heme and may provide the flexibility required to allow the distal helix to approach closer to the heme than it does in the myoglobins and peroxidases (24Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the distal helix is thought to enable the opening and closing of the active site required to bind heme and release biliverdin. To determine the importance of the two conserved glycine residues in hHO-1-catalyzed heme oxidation, we have constructed, expressed, and characterized a series of mutants in which the glycines have been replaced by amino acids with larger aliphatic, aromatic, or charged side chains. The structural and catalytic properties of these hHO-1 mutants establish that Gly-139 and Gly-143 are critical determinants of the catalytic outcome. H2O2 (30%), NADPH, heme, bovine serum albumin, sodium dithionite, sodium ascorbate, guaiacol, and phenol were obtained from Aldrich or Sigma. High purity argon (99.998%), CO (99.95%), and O2 (99.9%) were obtained from Matheson and Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification. Human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and rat biliverdin reductase were expressed and purified according to previously described protocols (32Dierks E.A. Davis S.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5297-5307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The HO-1 construct that was used encoded the human liver protein without the 23 C-terminal amino acids (22Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis was carried out by the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California at San Francisco on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. The hHO-1 Gly-139 and Gly-143 mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Antibiotic selection (ampicillin) was used to obtain a high frequency of mutants. Transformants were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequence analysis. Plasmid purification, sequencing, subcloning, and bacterial transformations were carried out by standard procedures (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α (F′ara D(lac-proAB)rpsL f80dlacZDM15 hsdR17) was used for expression of the hHO-1 constructs. The hHO-1 proteins were purified and reconstituted with heme using previously reported methods with a yield of purified protein of 3–4 mg/liter (21Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments using the purified proteins were performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (standard buffer), unless otherwise stated. The UV-visible spectra of hHO-1 and the hHO-1 mutants were recorded in the standard buffer on a Cary Varian Model 1E spectrophotometer. The FeII and FeII·CO complexes were formed by reduction of the FeIII complexes with sodium dithionite or anaerobically with NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase, in the absence or presence, respectively, of CO bubbling in the solution. Typical enzyme concentrations for RR experiments were 150–250 μm in standard buffer solution. Microcon 10 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon) were used for buffer and water exchange. A final enrichment of 80% 18O- or2H-labeled water (95% 18O, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory; 99.9% 2H, Aldrich) was achieved in the experiments using labeled water. Reduction to the FeIIstate was achieved by adding microliter aliquots of a 10 mmsodium dithionite solution to an argon-purged sample in the Raman capillary cell and was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy in the same cell (35Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 431-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 12CO (CP grade, Air Products) and13CO (99% 13C, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) adducts were obtained by injecting CO through a septum into a closed capillary containing ∼20 μl of argon-purged, reduced enzyme. RR spectra were obtained on a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (set at 0.67 m with variable gratings) equipped with a Princeton Instruments liquid-N2-cooled charge-coupled device detector (LN-1100PB). Kaiser Optical supernotch filters were used to attenuate Rayleigh scattering. Excitation sources consisted of an Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm) and a Liconix 4240NB He/Cd laser (442 nm). Spectra were collected in a 90°-scattering geometry on samples at room temperature with a collection time of a few minutes, whereas longer times and a back-scattering geometry were used for low-temperature experiments. Frequencies were calibrated relative to indene and CCl4 standards and are accurate to ± 1 cm−1. CCl4 was also used to check the polarization conditions. Optical absorption spectra of the Raman samples were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 9 spectrophotometer to monitor the samples (fully oxidized, fully reduced, and reduced CO complex) both before and after laser illumination. A solution of hHO-1 or one of its mutants (1 μm), cytochrome P450 reductase (1 μm), biliverdin reductase (4 μm), heme (30 μm), and bovine serum albumin (1 μm) in standard buffer was preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (500 μm) and the formation of bilirubin was monitored at 468 nm. Cytochrome P450 reductase (2 μm) and the hHO-1 mutant (5 μm) in standard buffer (final incubation volume, 500 μl) were preincubated at 23 °C in a cuvette. The reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH (1 mm), and the progress of the reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. When no further changes were observed (∼20 min), the incubation was extracted and the biliverdin regioisomer formed was determined by HPLC as described previously (21Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution of hHO-1 or one of its mutants (6–10 μm) in standard buffer (final incubation volume, 500 μl) was preincubated at 23 °C in a cuvette. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1–2 eq of H2O2, and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded until no further changes occurred. The concentration of H2O2 was quantitated by titration with iodide (36Ramette R.W. Stanford Jr., R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 82: 5001-5005Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm (ε240 = 43.6 m−1 cm−1). A solution of hHO-1 or an hHO-1 mutant (10 μm) and guaiacol (300 μm) in standard buffer (final incubation volume 500 μl) was preincubated at 23 °C in a cuvette. The reaction was initiated by addition of H2O2 (300 μm) and peroxidase activity was monitored at 470 nm (ε470 = 3.7 × 104m−1cm−1). In separate experiments, cytochrome P450 reductase (1.5 μm) and NADPH (1 mm) were substituted for H2O2. The peroxidation rate of hHO-1 and the hHO-1 mutants was determined using the initial rate of guaiacol oligomer formation at 470 nm. The change in the 470-nm absorbance was converted into moles using the extinction coefficient, and then into turnover numbers by dividing the number of moles product per time by the number of moles of hHO-1 used in the assay. The G139A, G139L, G139F, G139W, G139H, G139D, G143D, G143H, G143K, and G143L hHO-1 mutants were expressed and purified as described previously for wild-type hHO-1 (21Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each mutant was obtained in a yield of approximately 3–4 mg of purified protein per liter and was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The FeIII heme complexes of the mutants exhibited slightly different Soret absorption maxima, with a low value of 384 nm for the G143H mutant (Table I) and a high value of 411 nm for the G139F mutant (Fig. 2). The heme complexes of the Gly-139 (Figs. 2 and3) and Gly-143 mutants (not shown) had FeII, FeII·O2, and FeII·CO Soret maxima at 430, 410, and 420 nm, respectively. These values are similar to those for wild-type hHO-1 (21Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These spectroscopic results suggest that the heme coordination and ligation states for the wild-type and mutant hHO-1 enzymes are the same in the FeII, FeII·O2, and FeII·CO states but differ in the resting FeIII state.Table IHeme oxygenase and peroxidase activities of the Gly-139 and Gly-143 mutantsEnzymeSoret maximumSoret band shiftFeIII-spin state, pH 7.0 1-aThe dominant spin state is shown in bold letters.HO-1 activityPeroxidase activitynmpKa%s −1WT406∼86cHS/6cLS1000.0016G139A409∼76cHS/6cLS580.02 5cHSG139L4037–85cHS30.05 6cHS/6cLSG139F4116–76cLS/5cHS10.05 G139W393None5cHSNot detected0.02 G139H4096–76cLS10.02 G139D404None6cHSNot detected0.11 G143D406NoneNot determinedNot detectedNot detectedG143H384NoneNot determinedNot detectedNot detectedG143K410NoneNot determinedNot detectedNot detectedG143L394NoneNot determined2Not detectedThe NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent HO activity was determined from the initial rate of bilirubin formation at 37 °C, pH 7.4.

The peroxidase activity, given as turnover numbers, was determined at 23 °C, pH 7.4, using a 300-fold excess of H2O2 and guaiacol. The details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” As previously reported, the Soret maximum for wild-type hHO-1 undergoes a red shift with a pK a value of ∼8 (Table I (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)). In contrast, the Soret maxima of the Gly-143 mutants did not shift at pH values up to 11 and those of the Gly-139 mutants exhibited varying responses as the pH was increased. The Soret band of the G139A mutant underwent a red shift with a pK a of ∼7, whereas those of the G139H and G139F mutants underwent a red shift with pK a values between 6 and 7. The G139D and G139W mutants did not exhibit a pH-dependent Soret shift, and the G139L mutant exhibited anomalous behavior in that it shifted to the red with a pK a of 7–8 but then appeared to shift back above pH 9. These results suggest that the G139A, G139H, G139F, and possibly G139L mutants retained the distal water ligand characteristic of wild-type hHO-1, but its properties were modified by the alterations in its environment caused by the mutations. In contrast, the G139D, G139W, and Gly-143 mutants did not appear to retain a distal water ligand. RR spectra of the FeIII wild-type, G139A, and G139L heme complexes were obtained with Soret excitation (Fig. 4). The ν3 modes at 1483 and 1503, and ν2 modes at 1565 and 1582 cm−1 observed in the wild-type enzyme are characteristic of a six-coordinate high spin/low spin mixture (6cHS/6cLS) with a predominance of the HS state (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the mutant proteins, the 6cHS/6cLS equilibrium was perturbed and a pentacoordinate high spin (5cHS) species emerged with ν3 at 1492 and ν2 at 1572 cm−1 (Fig. 4). In fact, this 5cHS species dominated the G139L RR spectrum (Fig. 4). The RR data indicate that as bulkier side chains were introduced into the heme distal pocket, the distal water ligand bound to the heme iron in the wild-type enzyme (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was destabilized. In accord with the above conclusion, addition of an aromatic side chain in the distal pocket in the G139F and G139W mutants strongly perturbed the heme configuration. In the FeIII G139W heme complex, the major species was a 5cHS species, whereas in the G139F complex, the heme was in a mixture of HS and LS states (Table I). As in the FeII wild-type, G139A, and G139L complexes, the G139F and G139W mutants adopted a pure FeII HS configuration, but in the FeII·CO complexes of the G139F and G139W mutants, the observation of multiple Fe–C–O vibrations indicates the existence of a heterogeneous active site environment (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the G139F and G139W mutations significantly perturbed the heme binding pocket and gave rise to several heme-protein conformers. For the FeIII G139H heme complex at neutral pH, RR spectra revealed a mixture of heme coordination and spin states, but the major species in this complex was 6cLS rather than the predominant HS state observed in the wild-type enzyme (Fig.5). In the low frequency RR spectra of the G139H complex, a band at 508 cm−1 downshifted by 4 cm−1 in D2O and 16 cm−1 in18O-labeled water and was assigned to the ν(Fe·OH) of a 6cLS hydroxo adduct (Fig. 5). The low frequency of the ν(Fe·OH) and small deuterium shift are indicative of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the hydroxo group and the distal pocket in the mutant. In wild-type HO-1, a higher pH is required to deprotonate the distal water ligand (Table I), and the Fe-·OH vibration is observed at 546 cm−1 (29Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The new imidazole side chain in the G139H mutant (Table I) is likely to hydrogen-bond the aqua/hydroxo distal ligand, lowering its pK a from ∼8.0 in the wild-type (26Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to less than 7.0 in the G139H mutant. The FeIII G139D heme complex was a 6cHS species (Fig. 5). However, raising the pH from 5.0 to 11.0 and incubating the enzyme in deuterated and 18O-labeled water had no effect on its RR spectrum at either room temperature or 90 K. Either the carboxylate side chain of Asp-139 in the G139D mutant replaced the distal water as the heme sixth ligand or the local pH in the distal pocket was so perturbed by the carboxylate group that deprotonation of a water ligand was prevented. The G139A hHO-1 mutant retained 58% of the wild-type hHO-1 bilirubin forming activity, whereas all the other Gly-139 and Gly-143 hHO-1 mutants exhibited little or no (<3%) activity (Table I). The G139A mutant formed biliverdin IXα, the same biliverdin isomer formed by the wild-type protein (not shown). Addition of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to the G139A hHO-1 mutant, as with wild-type hHO-1 (37Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Hildebrand D. Wilks A. Loehr T.M. Mauk A.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulted in formation of the FeII·O2 and, subsequently, FeII verdoheme·CO complexes. Addition of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to the G139L, G139F, G139H, G143D, G143K, and G143L hHO-1 mutants also resulted in formation of the FeII·O2 complex with a Soret maximum at 410 nm and distinct α and β bands in the visible region (Fig. 3). However, with these proteins the verdoheme·CO complex characteristic of normal turnover was not observed, although gradual loss of the Soret bands due to the FeII·O2 complex and heme itself indicates that the heme was gradually destroyed. HPLC analysis revealed that no more than a trace of biliverdin IXα was produced by these mutants. The G139W, G139D, or G143H hHO-1 mutants yielded FeII·CO but not detectable FeII·O2 complexes with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (Figs. 2 and 3). These results show that the two roles of the heme group in heme oxygenase, as a prosthetic group and as a substrate, can be dissociated by mutations in the protein active site. Addition of 1–2 eq of H2O2 to the G139A heme complex resulted, as with wild-type hHO-1, primarily in FeIII·verdoheme formation, as shown by the appearance of a broad absorption with a maximum at 680 nm (Fig. 6). In contrast, addition of 1–2 eq of H2O2 to the G139L and G139F heme complexes caused a red shift of the Soret band to 418 nm and the appearance of α and β bands at 544 and 580 nm, respectively, without an increase in absorption at 680 nm (Fig. 6). Under the same conditions, the absorption maximum of the G139D mutant underwent a similar but smaller red shift with the development o"
https://openalex.org/W2005330465,"Retinoid receptor-related testis-associated receptor (RTR)/germ cell nuclear factor is a nuclear orphan receptor that plays an important role in the control of gene expression during early embryonic development and gametogenesis. It has been shown to repress transcriptional activation. In this study, we further characterize this repressor function. We demonstrate that RTR can suppress the transcriptional activation induced by the estrogen receptor related-receptor α1 through its response element. The latter is at least in part due to competition for binding to the same response element. In addition, RTR inhibits basal transcriptional activation, indicating that it functions as an active repressor. Mammalian two-hybrid analyses showed that RTR interacts with the co-repressor nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) but is unable to interact with the co-repressor SMRT or RIP140. Pull-down analyses with glutathione<i>S</i>-transferase-RTR fusion protein demonstrated that RTR physically interacts with N-CoR <i>in vitro</i>, suggesting a potential role for N-CoR in the transcriptional repression by RTR. To identify the regions in RTR essential for the binding of RTR to N-CoR, the effect of various deletion and point mutations on this interaction was examined. This analysis revealed that this interaction requires the hinge domain, helix 3 as well as the helix 12 region of RTR. The residues Ser<sup>246</sup>-Tyr<sup>247</sup> in the hinge domain, Lys<sup>318</sup> in helix 3, and Lys<sup>489</sup>-Thr<sup>490</sup> in helix 12 are identified as being critical in this interaction. Our results demonstrate that RTR can function as an active transcriptional repressor and that this repression can be mediated through interactions with the co-repressor N-CoR. We show that this interaction exhibits several characteristics unique to RTR. Through its repressor function, RTR can suppress the induction of transcriptional activation by other nuclear receptors. These repressor activities may provide important mechanisms by which RTR regulates gene expression during development and gametogenesis."

We have previously designed a series of dominant negative proteins to several B-ZIPs in order to examine in vivo B-ZIP function. All dominant negatives, termed A-ZIPs, have the B-ZIP basic region replaced with an amphipathic acidic α-helical sequence that heterodimerizes with the basic region in the B-ZIP·A-ZIP heterodimer.

In the present study, we have examined the VBP (vitellogenin promoter-binding protein) leucine zipper, the chicken ortholog (16Iyer S. Davis D. Seal S. Burch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4863-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) of the mammalian TEF (thyroid embryonic factor) protein (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W.

Two related mammalian B-ZIP proteins have also been identified: DBP (albumin site D-binding protein) (18Mueller C. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and HLF (hepatocyte leukemia factor) (19Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L.

This subclass of B-ZIP proteins is called PAR because it contains a proline- and acidic amino acid-rich region N-terminal to the B-ZIP domain. The PAR proteins share extensive sequence similarity (65–73%) in the B-ZIP domain, with four pairs of conserved attractive g ↔ e′ interhelical charge interactions containing glutamate and arginine. PAR proteins are expressed in the brain, liver, and thyroid and may be required for a functional circadian clock inDrosophila (21Blau J. Young M. Cell. 1999; 99: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein consisting of the B-ZIP domain of HLF and the E2A transactivation domain mediates a lethal form of childhood leukemia (19Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L.

Science. 1992; 257: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A dominant negative specific to the PAR family would therefore be a valuable reagent both for biochemical studies and as a clinical reagent. We describe A-VBP, a dominant negative protein that inhibits VBP DNA binding in an equimolar competition assay, but does not inhibit the DNA binding of other B-ZIP domains. To gain insight into dimerization specificity in the PAR family, we used a C/EBPα mutant with the same g ↔ e′ interhelical salt bridges as VBP. This mutant protein interacts with A-VBP, suggesting that the g ↔ e′ salt bridges are important structural determinants in regulating VBP dimerization specificity with other leucine zippers.

The first 13 amino acids are from φ10, the next three amino acids are a cloning linker, and the remaining 80 amino acids are the C terminus of VBP. All B-ZIP proteins described in this paper contain the φ10 leader and 37 amino acids N-terminal of the first d leucine position of the leucine zipper (Fig.1). All A-ZIP proteins, except for FOS and ATF2, which are truncated, contain the leucine zipper region starting at the first leucine position (Fig. 1) and extend until the natural C terminus. All A-ZIPs, except for A-CREB, contain the acidic extension LEQRAEELARENEELLEKEAEELEQENAELE (12Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A-CREB contains a leucine instead of an asparagine (in bold) in the acidic extension (14Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov M. Ginty D.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The LE in bold is the XhoI site that is the border between the first d position in the leucine zipper and the N-terminal acidic extension. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible system (22Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). B-ZIP domains were purified over a heparin column and subsequently purified on a Rainin high performance liquid chromatography system using a C18 column chromatographed from 0% to 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (12Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The A-ZIP and O-VBP (the VBP leucine zipper without an N-terminal extension) constructs were purified over a hydroxylapatite column, eluting with 200 mm phosphate and subsequently purified as for the B-ZIPs. Circular dichroism (CD) studies were performed using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. All protein stock solutions were in 12.5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, and 0.25 mm EDTA. For the assay, 1 mm DTT and 4 μm protein sample in 1.5 ml of stock buffer (described above) was heated to 65 °C for 20 min to reduce the cysteines, cooled to room temperature for 5 min, and added to a 5-mm rectangular CD cell. Melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy (ΔH) values were determined from denaturation curves assuming a two-state equilibrium dissociation of α-helical dimers into unfolded monomers using ΔCp of −1.2 kcal mol−1 (12Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ΔG values are reported at 37 °C. Purified B-ZIP domains (5 × 10−6m dimer) were heated for 10 min at 65 °C in the presence of 1 mm DTT. These proteins were then diluted to a final concentration of 20–100 nm in 20 μl of the gel-shift reaction buffer (12.5 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 0.25 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% glycerol). This solution was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C, then mixed with 0.1 pmol of the probe (32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide). A-ZIP proteins were similarly heated with DTT and added at the indicated molar equivalence before the second heating step. The binding complexes were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at room temperature. The sequence of the four 28-mer DNA probes is as follows (reported consensus binding site is underlined): AP1, GTCAGTCAGAATGACTCATATCGGTCAG; CREB, GTCAGTCAGATGACGTCATATCGGTCAG; VBP, GTCAGTCAGATTACGTAATATCGGTCAG; C/EBP, GTCAGTCAGATTGCGCAATATCGGTCAG. The VBP B-ZIP domain is 80 amino acids long, containing a 37-amino acid basic region and a 43-amino acid leucine zipper. The B-ZIP domain is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (16Iyer S. Davis D. Seal S. Burch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4863-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Krylov D. Mikhailenko I. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1849-1861Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Native VBP, including the transactivation domain, is 313 amino acids long. The VBP leucine zipper homodimer is schematically presented in Fig.1. The lower panelof Fig. 1 presents a sequence alignment showing the conserved amino acids in the PAR family of leucine zippers. Four pairs of attractive g ↔ e′ interhelical salt bridges in VBP are highlighted bybold arrows. The first pair is R ↔ E, and the next three are all E ↔ R pairs. Biochemical studies indicate that PAR proteins can readily form heterodimers within the family but not with C/EBP (16Iyer S. Davis D. Seal S. Burch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4863-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L.

However, the ability of VBP to heterodimerize with a range of leucine zippers has never been tested. We mixed VBP with C/EBPα (Fig. 2) and saw no increase in thermal stability of the mixtures by CD spectroscopy. Similar results were obtained for mixtures of VBP with CREB, JUND, or FOS B-ZIP domains (data not shown). This indicates that VBP does not preferentially heterodimerize with B-ZIPs from other subfamilies. From these data, it is clear that homodimers are thermodynamically significantly favored over heterodimers, but does not reveal whether heterodimers are thermodynamically unfavored relative to monomers. To inhibit VBP DNA binding, we generated a dominant negative version of VBP termed A-VBP. The A-VBP dominant-negative contains the VBP leucine zipper, but the basic region is replaced with an amphipathic acidic protein sequence that forms a heterodimeric coiled coil with the basic region. We used A-VBP in two assays: circular dichroism at 222 nm to measure thermal stability of A-ZIP and B-ZIP protein mixtures, and a gel shift competition assay to examine if A-VBP can inhibit VBP DNA binding. Thermal denaturations, monitored at 222 nm by CD spectroscopy in 12.5 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 150 mm KCl are shown for mixtures of the VBP B-ZIP domain (VBP) with either the VBP leucine zipper (O-VBP) (Table I; Fig.3 A) or A-VBP (Table I; Fig.3 B). The CD trace for the VBP B-ZIP domain thermal denaturation has an inclined low temperature base line that probably represents the non-cooperative denaturation of the basic region. Deleting the basic region from VBP to produce O-VBP reduced the ellipticity (θ) from −42 mdeg to −35 mdeg at 6 °C and increased the Tm, suggesting that the basic regions are destabilizing by 1.1 kcal/mol/dimer. The low temperature base line of O-VBP is nearly level, suggesting that the VBP leucine zipper domains denatures more cooperatively than the VBP B-ZIP domain. A-VBP is 0.4 kcal/mol less stable than O-VBP, indicating that the acidic extension is also slightly repulsive in the A-VBP homodimer. Unlike the basic region that unfolds non-cooperatively at low temperatures, the acidic extension displays a cooperative unfolding at around 20 °C that is independent of the VBP leucine zipper cooperative unfolding at 50 °C.Table ICD thermal stability of VBP, O-VBP, and A-VBPProteinHomodimer (Θ, T m(ΔG, ΔH)K d(37 °C))Heterodimer with VBP (Θ, T m(ΔG, ΔH)K d(37 °C))VBP−42, 50(−11.4,−92)8.6 × −9O-VBP−35, 56(−12.5,−85)1.4 × −9 −81, 56(−11.9,−73)3.8 × −9A-VBP−48, 53(−12.1,−88)2.7 × −9−120, 60(−13.4,−83)3.3 × −10The table presents the thermal stability, measured by circular dichroism at 222 nm, for VBP, O-VBP, and A-VBP and mixtures of VBP with either O-VBP or A-VBP.

If the mixture has a higher melting temperature than either homodimer alone, we infer that the mixture sample is composed of heterodimers. Open table in a new tab The table presents the thermal stability, measured by circular dichroism at 222 nm, for VBP, O-VBP, and A-VBP and mixtures of VBP with either O-VBP or A-VBP. Ellipticity at 6 °C (Θ, mdeg), melting temperature (T m, °C), dimerization free energy extrapolated to T = 37 °C (ΔG in kcal/mol), ΔH (kcal/mol), and K d at 37 °C (in m) are presented. If the mixture has a higher melting temperature than either homodimer alone, we infer that the mixture sample is composed of heterodimers. The mixture of A-VBP and VBP is 2.0 kcal/mol more stable than the VBP homodimer. The 43% increase in ellipticity at low temperatures implies that the basic region and acidic extension form an α-helical coiled coil extension of the leucine zipper. The absence of a low temperature transition for the B-VBP·A-VBP heterodimer suggests that the basic and acidic regions form an extended coiled-coil that denatures cooperatively with the VBP zipper in the heterodimer. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the B-VBP·A-VBP mixture indicates the sample is a dimer (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows the results of a gel shift assay after adding varying concentrations of either O-VBP or A-VBP to a DNA binding reaction containing 20-nm VBP and its cognate DNA site (ATTACGTAAT) in a 28-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide. O-VBP inhibits VBP DNA binding at between 10 and 30 molar eq. A-VBP, in contrast, almost completely abolishes DNA binding at equimolar concentrations. Fig.3 D presents a schematic of the heterodimer between A-VBP and the VBP B-ZIP domain. CD thermal denaturation experiments of the mixture of A-VBP and the C/EBPα B-ZIP domain show increased ellipticity at low temperatures but no increase in thermal stability (Fig.4). Analytical ultracentifugation of the mixture at 6 °C indicates a greater than dimer molecular weight (data not shown). We interpret this to be a A-VBP homodimer and a C/EBPα homodimer whose acidic and basic regions are interacting, resulting in both an increase in ellipticity and molecular weight. The 2.4 kcal/mol interaction between the acidic extension and the basic region of C/EBPα (12Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) did not overcome the repulsion between their leucine zipper regions. Similarly, A-VBP did not heterodimerize with CREB, FOS, or JUND (data not shown). We also used gel-shift assays to measure inhibition of DNA binding by A-VBP. Fig. 5 C shows that A-VBP did not inhibit the DNA binding of C/EBP, CREB, or JUND/FOS bound to their cognate sites, even at 100 molar excess. In a corollary experiment (Fig. 5 B), we examined the ability of seven A-ZIP leucine zippers to inhibit the DNA binding of VBP. The leucine zipper protein sequences used in these experiments are shown in Fig. 5 A. The number of putative attractive or repulsive g ↔ e′ interactions in homodimer or heterodimer with VBP is also calculated. The control A-VBP inhibited binding at equimolar concentration. However, none of the other zippers inhibited VBP DNA binding, even at 100-fold molar excess. All of these A-ZIPs did inhibit DNA binding of their normal dimerization partners. We have designed a C/EBPα leucine zipper mutant protein, called C/EBPα-L, that has the same g ↔ e′ salt bridges that are found in VBP (25Vinson C.R. Hai T.W. Boyd S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This required changing four amino acids in the g and e position of C/EBPα leucine zipper (Fig.6). We examined the interaction of C/EBPα-L with A-VBP to investigate the importance of these g ↔ e′ salt bridges to VBP dimerization specificity. The thermal stabilities of C/EBPα and C/EBPα-L homodimers are shown in TableII.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of C/EBPα mutantsProteinFour g ↔ e′ pairsΘT mΔGΔHK d(37 °C)4.0 μmmdeg°Ckcal/molkcal/molmC/EBPαK ↔ T, D ↔ R, R ↔ S, E ↔ R−3949−9.9−589.9 × 10−8C/EBPα-JK ↔ E, E ↔ R, R ↔ E, E ↔ R−4171−15.7−817.8 × 10−12C/EBPα-LK ↔ E, E ↔ R, E ↔ R, E ↔ R−4474−16.9−871.1 × 10−12The table presents the thermal stability measured by circular dichroism at 222 nm for three proteins, including ellipticity at 6 °C (Θ, mdeg), melting temperature (T m, °C), dimerization free energy extrapolated to T = 37 °C (ΔG in kcal/mol), ΔH (kcal/mol), andK d at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab The table presents the thermal stability measured by circular dichroism at 222 nm for three proteins, including ellipticity at 6 °C (Θ, mdeg), melting temperature (T m, °C), dimerization free energy extrapolated to T = 37 °C (ΔG in kcal/mol), ΔH (kcal/mol), andK d at 37 °C. Fig. 7 (A and B) presents the CD thermal denaturation curves for C/EBPα-L alone or mixed with either O-VBP or A-VBP. O-VBP did not preferentially heterodimerize with C/EBPα-L (Fig. 7 A). However, A-VBP did heterodimerize with C/EBPα-L as shown by a 10 °C increase in the melt line relative to the sum line at ∼50 °C (Fig. 7 B). Previous work has shown that the acidic extension heterodimerizes with the C/EBP basic region contributing 2.4 kcal/mol to stability (12Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, heterodimerization between C/EBPα-L and A-VBP implies that repulsion between the two zippers is less than 2.4 kcal/mol. In contrast, heterodimerization is not observed between A-VBP and another mutant C/EBPα protein called C/EBPα-J. C/EBPα-J has the g and e residues in the third heptad reversed (compared with C/EBPα-L) so that there are six attractive and two repulsive g ↔ e′ interactions with the VBP leucine zipper (Fig. 6 B). The lack of interaction between C/EBPα-J and A-VBP indicates that there are repulsive interactions between the zippers that destabilize the heterodimer by more than 2.4 kcal/mol (Fig. 7, C andD). Fig. 8 is a gel shift that shows that the DNA binding of C/EBPα-L is abolished by A-VBP of between 1 and 10 molar eq. This is consistent with the CD results. In contrast the DNA binding of C/EBPα-J is not inhibited by 100 molar eq of A-VBP. These data indicate that the attractive g ↔ e′ salt bridges play an important role in regulating the dimerization specificity of the VBP leucine zipper. We describe A-VBP, a dominant negative to the VBP B-ZIP protein. A-VBP contains the VBP leucine zipper and an appended acidic amphipathic protein sequence that replaces the basic region critical for DNA binding. The acidic extension forms a coiled coil structure with the VBP basic region in the VBP·A-VBP heterodimer that stabilizes the complex −2.0 kcal/mol as shown by CD thermal data. A-VBP abolishes VBP binding to its cognate site at equimolar concentrations in EMSA, but does not interact with other B-ZIPs, even at 100-fold excess. Using eight A-ZIP dominant negatives, we show by EMSA and CD thermal melts that the PAR B-ZIPs do not interact with the other four known subfamilies of mammalian B-ZIP proteins: FOS, C/EBP, JUN, and CREB. These data strongly suggest that A-VBP may be a potent and specific reagent for inhibiting both the activation and repressive properties of the VBP family of B-ZIP proteins in biological systems. To facilitate further design of A-ZIP dominant negatives, we need to have a detailed understanding of the interactions that govern dimerization specificity. We have used A-VBP to investigate the structural determinants regulating the preferential dimerization within the PAR subfamily. We find that conserved attractive interhelical g ↔ e′ (i, i′+5) salt bridges play a major role. C/EBPα-L protein, containing the VBP g ↔ e′ salt bridges in a C/EBPα background, interacts with A-VBP while C/EBPα does not. This suggests that these g ↔ e′ salt bridges are critical for regulating homodimerization of the PAR subfamily. Their importance is reinforced by the observation that a reversal of a single E ↔ R salt bridge to R ↔ E in the mutant C/EBPα-J prevented heterodimerization with A-VBP. The expected difference in stability between the A-VBP·C/EBPα-L and A-VBP·C/EBPα-J heterodimers is 2.9 kcal/mol (Fig.9) (10Krylov D. Barchi J. Vinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Krylov D. Mikhailenko I. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1849-1861Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Of this, 2.5 kcal/mol is due to coupling energy. 40% of the coupling energy is from attractive g ↔ e′ interactions (−1.0 kcal/mol), and 60% is from repulsive interactions (+1.5 kcal/mol). The C/EBPα-L·A-VBP heterodimer would be stabilized by −1.3 kcal/mol for each of the two E ↔ R salt bridges relative to A ↔ A in the third heptad, resulting in a stabilization of −2.6 kcal/mol and a coupling energy of −1.0 kcal/mol. In contrast, the C/EBPα-J·A-VBP heterodimer would be destabilized by 0.3 kcal/mol because repulsive E ↔ E and the R ↔ R interactions result in a destabilizing coupling energy of +1.5 kcal/mol. These attractive g ↔ e′ interactions are not observed in the GCN4 leucine zipper (26Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1995; 268: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A general strategy to measure repulsion between protein surfaces is to entropically constrain them. The strategy we present in this report is more limited, the heterodimer between the basic region and the acidic extension must denature cooperatively with the leucine zippers. Additionally, to measure the repulsion between the leucine zippers of interest, it must be less than the basic region and acidic region interaction. PAR proteins are expressed in the brain (27Hitzler J.K. Soares H.D. Drolet D.W. Inaba T. O'Connel S. Rosenfeld M.G. Morgan J.I. Look A.T.

Inukai T. Yoshihara T. Seyschab H. Ashmun R.A. Canman C.E. Laken S.J. Kastan M.B. Look A.T. Nature. 1996; 382: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Expression of this dominant negative in UOC-B1 cells, a human leukemia cell line that contains a chimeric protein containing the TEF B-ZIP domain, lead to apoptosis. The VBP/TEF dominant negative described in this manuscript should be more effective because the acidic extension confers higher affinity to the target B-ZIP domain. When gene therapy procedures are in place, A-VBP could be an effective therapy for this particular leukemia. We thank Jaideep Moitra and Alain Mir for comments on the manuscript."

To date, only three missense mutations in G6PT have been shown to abolish microsomal G6P transport activity. Here, we report the results of structure-function studies on human G6PT and demonstrate that 15 missense mutations and a codon deletion (ΔF93) mutation abolish microsomal G6P uptake activity and that two splicing mutations cause exon skipping. While most missense mutants support the synthesis of G6PT protein similar to that of the wild-type transporter, immunoblot analysis shows that G20D, ΔF93, and I278N mutations, located in helix 1, 2, and 6, respectively, destabilize the G6PT. Further, we demonstrate that G6PT mutants lacking an intact helix 10 are misfolded and undergo degradation within cells. Moreover, amino acids 415–417 in the cytoplasmic tail of the carboxyl-domain, extending from helix 10, also play a critical role in the correct folding of the transporter. However, the last 12 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail play no essential role(s) in functional integrity of the G6PT.

Therefore, G6PT and G6Pase work in concert to maintain glucose homeostasis. GSD-1b patients display symptoms associated with functional G6Pase deficiency, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, kidney enlargement, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia (1Chen Y.-T.

The resulting three amino acid substitutions, R28H, G149E, and C183R, abolish microsomal G6P transport activity as shown by heterologous expression of mutant proteins in COS-1 cells. Here we report the identification of four novel G6PT mutations among 14 GSD-1b patients. Fifteen missense mutations and a codon deletion mutation completely abolish microsomal G6P transport activity, and two splicing mutations cause exon skipping. Our studies establish that mutations in the G6PT gene cause GSD-1b. At present, very little is known about the structural requirements for the correct folding and G6P transport activity of the G6PT protein. In this study, we undertake structure-function studies and demonstrate that G20D, ΔF93, and I278N mutations, located in helix 1, 2, and 6, respectively, destabilize the transporter. Further, we show that intactness of helix 10 in G6PT is essential for proper folding and stability of the transporter. However, the last 12 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the C-domain in G6PT, including the ER transmembrane protein retention motif, are not essential for membrane insertion, stability, or microsomal G6P transport activity. Finally, we establish the minimal length of the cytoplasmic tail of the C-domain essential for functional integrity of the G6PT. We have analyzed the G6PTgene of 13 GSD-1b patients that presented with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and recurrent bacterial infections; each also lacks a genetic defect in the G6Pase gene. We have also analyzed the G6PTgene of one GSD-1 patient diagnosed clinically as GSD-1a who proved to have no mutation in the G6Pase gene. The lymphoblast line of GSD-1b patient 1 reported by Beaudet et al. (6Beaudet A.L. Anderson D.C. Michels V.V. Arion W.J. Lange A.J. J.

Genomic DNA preparations were extracted from lymphoblasts or blood samples using a Nucleon II kit (Scotlab Bioscience). All peripheral blood samples were obtained with the informed consent of the patients and/or parents. The G6PT gene in GSD-1 patients was characterized by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (23Orita M. Iwahana H. Kanazawa H. Hayashi K. Sekiya T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mutation-containing fragments identified by single strand conformation polymorphism were subcloned and characterized by DNA sequencing. The template for G6PT mutant construction by PCR was nucleotides 166–1496 of the human G6PT cDNA in a pSVL vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which contains the entire coding region at nucleotides 170–1459, with the translation initiation codon, ATG, at nucleotides 170–172 (8Gerin I.

The PCR primers for mutants that contained mutations located upstream of the BstEII site are nucleotides 166–186 (sense) and 851–878 (antisense) in the G6PT cDNA. The primers for mutants that contained mutations located downstream of the BstEII site are nucleotides 851–878 (sense) and 1476–1496 (antisense). The amplified fragments were ligated into either the pSVLhG6PT-BstEII-3′ or the pSVLhG6PT-BstEII-5′ fragment. The mutant primers are as follows: G20D (nucleotides 218–237), GGC → GAC at position 20; R28C (nucleotides 241–260), CGC →TGC at position 28; S55R (nucleotides 323–342), AGC →CGC at position 55; G68R (nucleotides 361–380), GGG →AGG at position 68; L85P (nucleotides 413–432), CTC → CCC at position 85; G88D (nucleotides 422–441), GGC → GAC at position 88; ΔF93 (nucleotides 436–457), deleting TTC at nucleotides 446–448; W118R (nucleotides 511–530), TGG →CGG at position 118; G150R (nucleotides 607–626), GGG →AGG at position 150; N198I (nucleotides 752–771), AAC → ATC at position 198; I278N (nucleotides 992–1011), ATC → AAC at position 278; R300H (nucleotides 1058–1077), CGC → CAC at position 300; G339C (nucleotides 1174–1193), GGT →TGT at position 339; A373D (nucleotides 1277–1296), GCC → GAC) at position 373. The antisense primer for each mutant has the corresponding complementary sequence. Boldface letters indicate nucleotide changes.

The C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification using a sense primer containing nucleotides 851–878 and an antisense primer (20 bases) containing a termination codon at position 401 (GAA → TAA), 408 (ACG → TAG), 415 (CGA → TGA), 416 (AAC → TAA), 417 (ATC → TAA), 418 (CGC → TAA), 419 (ACC → TAA), 420 (AAG → TAG), 426 (AAG → TAG), or 427 (AAG → TAG).

Chem. 1999; 274: 13865-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) containing the 8-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.) at the 5′- and 3′-end of the G6PT coding region, respectively, were used as templates for constructing the FLAG-tagged mutants. The nucleotide sequence in all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum. The G6PT construct in a pSVL vector was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strahl K.

Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 days, the transfected cultures were harvested for microsomal G6P uptake assay, Western blot analysis, or RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (25Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde, and transferred to a Nytran membrane by electroblotting. The membranes were hybridized with either a uniformly labeled G6PT or β-actin riboprobe. For Western blot analysis of FLAG-tagged G6PT, microsomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and trans-blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems). The immunocomplex was detected with the horseradish peroxidase-linked chemiluminescent system containing the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate obtained from Pierce. In vitro transcription-translation of G6PT cDNA constructs in a pGEM-7Zf(+) vector was performed using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system obtained from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI).l-[35S]methionine was used as the labeled precursor. The in vitro synthesized proteins were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis and fluoroautoradiography. G6P uptake measurements were performed essentially as described previously (12Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mmsucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]G6P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and washed with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 250 mm sucrose. Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate, which abolished G6P uptake, were used as negative controls. Two to three independent experiments were conducted, and at least three G6P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation. We have previously shown that microsomal G6P uptake in COS-1 cells transfected with a G6PT and a G6Pase cDNA reached a plateau at 3 min of incubation (12Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 3-min G6P uptake values were used to compare microsomal G6P uptake activities of wild-type (WT) and mutant G6PT proteins. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with The GraphPad Prism Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify mutations in theG6PT gene of 13 GSD-1b patients and one putative GSD-1a patient, although the G6Pase gene had no identifiable mutation in the coding region. G6PT mutations were identified in all 14 patients, indicating that the GSD-1a patient was misdiagnosed. Fourteen different mutations were identified, including nine missense (G20D, R28C, L85P, W118R, G149E, G150R, I278N, G339C, and A393D), two nonsense (W96X and W393X), one splicing (550+2t → g), and two deletion (1211delCT and ΔF93) mutations (TableI). Four novel mutations identified in this study are L85P, ΔF93, I278N, and A373D.Table IMutations identified in the G6PT gene of GSD-1b patientsPatientExonMutationEffect on coding sequenceComments1VIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 400Homozygote2I251C→T/R28CArg → Cys at 28Compound heterozygoteVIII1184G→T/G339CGly → Cys at 3393III615G→A/G149EGly → Glu at 149Homozygote4VIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 400Homozygote5IX1348G→A/W393XTrp → Stop at 393Consanguine6II521T→C/W118RTrp → Arg at 118Compound heterozygoteVIII1287C→A/A373DAla → Asp at 3737I228G→A/G20DGly → Asp at 20Compound heterozygoteII550+2t→gAGgt → AGgg at 550 + 2, 5′ splice site8II456G→A/W96XTrp → Stop at 96Compound heterozygoteVIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 4009III615G→A/G149EGly → Glu at 149Consanguine10III617G→A/G150RGly → Arg at 150Compound heterozygoteV1002T→A/I278NIle → Asn at 27811VIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 400Homozygote12VIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 400Homozygote13II446delTTC/ΔF93del Phe at 93Compound heterozygoteVIII1211delCTFrameshift at 348, stop at 40014 1-aPatient 14 was initially diagnosed as GSD-1a but contains no G6Pase mutations.

However, only three missense mutations, R28H, G149E, and C183R, uncovered in this laboratory were shown to abolish microsomal G6P transport activity (12Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that other missense mutations uncovered in GSD-1b patients cause the disease, we constructed a series of G6PT mutants and examined the ability of each mutant to transport G6P in transient expression studies. We also examined G6P transport activity of the ΔF93 and N198I mutants; the latter was identified as a possible polymorphic marker in a GSD-1b patient homozygous for a splicing mutation (15Veiga-da-Cunha M. Gerin I. Chen Y.-T. de Barsy T. de Lonlay P. Dionisi-Vici C. Fenske C.D. Lee P.J. Leonard J.V. Maire I. McConkie-Rosell A. Schweitzer S. Vikkula M. Van Schaftingen E. Am. J. Hum.

The combined transfection of the G6Pase and WT G6PT cDNAs into COS-1 cells shows that G6P was efficiently taken up by intact microsomes isolated from these cells (TableII). In contrast, microsomal G6P transport activity was undetectable when G20D, R28C, S55R, G68R, ΔF93, L85P, G88D, W118R, G150R, I278N, R300H, G339C, or A393D mutant G6PT cDNA was co-transfected with the G6Pase cDNA (Table II). The N198I construct retained at least 95% of WT G6P transport activity (Table II), indicating that it represents a sequence polymorphism in the G6PT gene.Table IIMicrosomal G6P uptake activity following transfection of WT or mutant G6PT construct into COS-1 cellsConstructsG6P uptake activity 2-aMicrosomal G6P uptake activity from WT or mutant G6PT cDNA-transfected cells in the presence of a co-transfected G6Pase cDNA was measured after a 3-min incubation and is presented as the mean ± S.E.

Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t test. Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis confirmed that similar levels of G6PT transcripts were expressed in WT or mutant G6PT-transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 A). Our data, therefore, demonstrate that the decrease in G6P uptake was due to a defective G6PT protein and not due to a decrease in efficiency of expression of the transfected cDNA construct. In earlier studies (10Pan C.-J. Lin B. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13865-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we have shown that G6PT-WT and G6PT-WT-5′FLAG constructs had similar microsomal G6P uptake activities, indicating that the 8-amino acid FLAG tag at the N terminus of G6PT did not interfere with its G6P transport function. We therefore constructed a series of 5′-FLAG-tagged G6PT mutants and examined their biosynthesis in COS-1 cells by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope. WT, R28C, R28H, S55R, G68R, G88D, W118R, G149E, G150R, C183R, R300H, G339C, and A373D mutant constructs supported the synthesis of similar amounts of G6PT proteins of 37 kDa (Fig. 1 B). However, G20D, ΔF93, and I278N mutant constructs supported the synthesis of G6PT proteins that were approximately 30, 40, and 20%, respectively, of that in WT G6PT-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Our data indicate that G20D, ΔF93, and I278N mutations, located in helix 1, 2, and 6 (Fig.2), respectively, destabilize the transporter. We also constructed G6PT mutants containing the FLAG tag at the C terminus and examined their biosynthesis after transient expression in COS-1 cells (Fig.3 A). Again G20D-3′FLAG, ΔF93–3′FLAG, and I278N-3′FALG constructs supported the synthesis of markedly reduced amounts of G6PT proteins as compared with the WT-3′FLAG as well as the R28H-3′FLAG constructs. In vitro transcription-translation assays showed that WT, R28H, G2OD, ΔF93, and I278N constructs directed the synthesis of similar amounts of G6PT proteins (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the observed decrease in the synthesis of G20D, ΔF93, and I278N mutants may result from misfolding and rapid degradation of mutant proteins in a heterologous expression system. The 550+2t→g splicing mutation (Table I) is likely to cause exon-2 skipping from the G6PT transcript. Sequencing of six G6PT cDNA clones obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR of RNA isolated from lymphoblasts of patient 7 showed that exon 2 (233-bp) sequences were absent from half of the cDNA clones. The other half contained the 228G→A/G20D mutation. We have previously identified a splicing mutation (550 + 1g→t) in a compound heterozygous patient also harboring a 716T→C/C183R mutation (12Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

The counterregulatory actions of insulin on catecholamine action are well known and include phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor on Tyr350, Tyr354, and Tyr364 in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, as well as enhanced sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Both β-adrenergic agonists and insulin provoke sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors in a synergistic manner. In the current work, cross-talk between insulin action and β2-adrenergic receptors revealed that insulin activation of Erk1,2 was amplified via β2-adrenergic receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, expression of β2-adrenergic receptors enhanced 5–10-fold the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin and prolonged the activation, the greatest enhancement occurring at 5 min post-insulin. The potentiation of insulin signaling on Erk1,2 was proportional to the level of expression of β2-adrenergic receptor. The potentiation of insulin signaling requires the integrity of Tyr350 of the β2-adrenergic receptor, a residue phosphorylated in response to insulin. β2-adrenergic receptors with a Y350F mutation failed to potentiate insulin activation of Erk1,2. Expression of the C-terminal domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor (Pro323-Leu418) in cells expressing the intact β2-adrenergic receptor acts as a dominant negative, blocking the potentiation of insulin activation of Erk1,2 via the β2-adrenergic receptor. Blockade of β2-adrenergic receptor sequestration does not alter the ability of the β2-adrenergic receptor to potentiate insulin action on Erk1,2.

For insulin action, activation of 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is an early event, following temporally the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (9White M.F.

In response to insulin stimulation, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K binds the IRS-1 via SH2 domain(s), activating the catalytic p110 subunit, which phosphorylates various phosphoinositides at the 3′ position of the inositol ring (11Rordorf-Nikolic T.

Ample reports support the premise that PI3K and its 3′-phosphoinositide products are critical to intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound elements in general (12Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and of downstream elements of TKR signaling, particularly insulin (13Heller-Harrison R.A.

We have shown that insulin, much like β-adrenergic agonists, provoke rapid sequestration of β2AR in a synergistic manner (14Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

We probed for possible cross-talk between insulin and β2ARs in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Remarkably, the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was found to be amplified by β2AR expression, i.e. the higher the level of cellular complement of β2AR, the greater was the potentiation of insulin activation of Erk1,2. Further studies reveal that the ability of the β2AR to amplify the insulin response was dependent on the integrity of the Tyr350 residue, which is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor and constitutes a binding site for an SH2 domain to which Grb2, and other proteins, can bind (16Shih M.

A new paradigm is proposed in which G-protein-linked receptors function as a receptor-based scaffold via a binding site for SH2 domains, amplifying signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CHO stably expressing wild-type and mutant β2ARs and human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively (17George S.T.

Prior to analysis for insulin action, the cells were serum-starved overnight (4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The CHO clones stably expressing the hamster β2AR were characterized earlier (17George S.T. Berrios M. Hadcock J.R. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the hamster β2AR (Pro323-Leu418) was cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector and employed to stably transfect A431 clones. Cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (50 ng/ml) or insulin (100 nm) for the indicated times and then lysed (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described earlier (21Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The blots were stained with antibodies purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) that specifically recognize only the dually phosphorylated, active forms of Erk1,2. For inhibitor studies, A431 cells and CHO clones stably transfected to express β2-adrenergic receptors were pretreated for 12 h in the absence or presence of one of the following agents: the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY; 20 μm), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm), or the Src inhibitor PP2 (50 nm). After an overnight exposure to an inhibitor, the cells were incubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 5 min, and the amount of Erk1,2 activated was measured. The number of β2AR was determined by radioligand binding. Intact A431 cells were incubated with 0.5 nm [125I]iodocyanopindolol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 10 μm propranolol at 23 °C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. The cells were collected on GF/C membranes at reduced pressure and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained by the filter was quantified by use of a γ-counter (17George S.T. Berrios M. Hadcock J.R. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Receptor sequestration was assayed using the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 (18Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A431 cells were preincubated with isoproterenol (10 μm) for periods up to 60 min or preincubated with insulin (100 nm) for 5 to 30 min. The cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 70 nm [3H]CGP-12177 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 4 °C for 6 h. The cells were diluted, collected on GF/C membranes, and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained on the filter was counted by use of liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was defined as the radioligand binding insensitive to competition by the unlabeled, β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 μm). A431 cells stably transfected with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor were treated with or without insulin in the absence or presence (overnight) of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm). The cells were incubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 5 min, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and washed 3 times with modified Shields' medium (MSM)-Pipes buffer (18 mm MgSO4, 5 mmCaCl2, 40 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Pipes, pH 6.8). The cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy on an Odyssey instrument (Noran Instruments). The construct pCDNA3-β2AR-GFP, encoding a β2-adrenergic receptor fusion protein with GFP at its carboxyl terminus (22Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. J. L. Benovic. The confocal microscopy was performed at the University Microscopy Imaging Center at Stony Brook. Unless otherwise noted, the values presented are means ± S.E. The autoradiograms are representative of multiple (at least three) independent experiments. In all figures, an asterisk denotes a mean value with statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) compared with the mean values of the control, time 0, or with the control group as indicated in the legend to the figure. Initial studies of the time-course for activation of Erk1,2 revealed a biphasic response to insulin stimulation of CHO clones. In CHOK cells, which express very low numbers of endogenous β2ARs, the activation of Erk1,2 displayed an initial peak of activation (as measured with phosphospecific antibodies for activated Erk1,2) in response to insulin at 0.5–1.0 min (Fig.1, inset), followed by a gradual decline in activation observed in analyses of multiple experiments performed on separate occasions (Fig. 1, bar graph). The activation of Erk2 (p42Erk) in response to insulin exceeded that of Erk1 (p44ErK). When examined in CHO cells expressing a modest level of β2ARs (18.2 fmol/100,000 cells), the activation of Erk1,2 in response to insulin shows both a biphasic response, as well as an amplified response to stimulation by insulin. The Erk1,2 response to insulin showed an early (0.5–1.0 min) peak of activation followed by a robust later response, peaking at 5 min, declining to unstimulated levels within 10 min (not shown). The response for activation of p42Erk in the CHO-β2AR clones was 5–7-fold greater than that in the β2AR-deficient CHOK clones. The response for activation of p44Erk by insulin was similar to that observed for p42Erk,i.e. 5–7-fold greater in the CHO-β2AR clones as compared with the CHOK clones. The simplest interpretation of the data is that the expression of β2AR potentiates and prolongs the ability of insulin to activate Erk1,2, a novel hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that the expressed level of the G-protein-linked receptor β2AR regulates the temporal nature and magnitude of the Erk1,2 activation by insulin, we examined the Erk1,2 response to activation by insulin in cells that stably express varying levels of β2AR (Fig. 2). Four clones were included in the analysis that displayed few receptors with CHOK (wild-type; 0.6 ± 0.08 fmol/100,000 cells), low (βL; 4.5 ± 1.1 fmol/100,000 cells), middle (βM; 18.3 ± 2.3 fmol/100,000 cells), and high (βH; 27.9 ± 3.0 fmol/100,000 cells) levels of expressed β2AR ([125I]iodocyanopindolol binding; mean values ± S.E., n = 3). The activation of Erk1,2 was measured in response to insulin challenge after 5 min. Immunoblots of the cell lysates were stained with antibodies to the phosphospecific, activated forms of Erk1 and Erk2. In the absence of insulin, levels of activated Erk1,2 were very low. Often, as shown here, the basal levels of phosphorylated, activated Erk1,2 were suppressed in the clones expressing β2AR. The greater the expression of β2AR, the greater was the apparent suppression of basal levels of Erk1,2 activation. Challenge with EGF provokes an activation of Erk1,2 in wild-type cells with low levels of β2AR, whereas the EGF response is attenuated in the clones expressing significant levels of β2ARs. The Erk1,2 activation in response to insulin, in sharp contrast, is clearly amplified in cells expressing β2ARs. Although not strictly proportional, the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin, but not EGF, was amplified to a greater extent with increasing levels of β2AR expression. These data suggest that the β2AR appears to facilitate insulin signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade to the level of Erk1,2.Figure 1The activation of Erk1,2 in response to insulin is potentiated by β2AR. CHOK cells and CHO clones stably transfected to express the β2AR (CHO-β2AR) were challenged with insulin (100 nm) for the time (min) indicated, and the activation of Erk1,2 was determined using antibodies specific for the dually phosphorylated, active forms of p44 and p42 Erk (phospho-Erk). The results of three independent assays in which the amount of the phosphoactivated forms of p44 and p42 Erk were quantified are summarized in the bar graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2The activation of Erk1,2 in response to insulin is increased with increasing expression of β2AR. CHO clones were stably transfected and selected to express different levels of β2AR, indicated as wild-type (WT, with very low expression of β2AR), low (βL), middle (βM), and high (βH) expressing clones. The activation of Erk1,2 was determined, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1, in clones incubated in the absence (-) or presence of either 100 nm insulin (+Insulin) or 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (+ EGF) for 5 min. The results of three independent assays in which the amount of the phosphoactivated forms of p44 and p42 Erk were quantified are summarized in the bar graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was important to evaluate whether co-stimulation of the insulin- and β2AR-stimulated pathways leads to activation of Erk1,2 and whether some adrenergic agonist activity derived from serum might contribute to the insulin response. Treating A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with isoproterenol (10 μm) or insulin (100 nm) stimulated the activation of both Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig.3). Insulin and isoproterenol, in combination, do not produce an additive response. Propranolol (10 μm) blocked isoproterenol-stimulated activation of Erk1,2 but not the response to stimulation by insulin. These data rule out the possibility that co-stimulation by some serum-derived agent via a β2AR-mediated pathway is an explanation for the enhanced insulin-stimulated activation of Erk1,2 in cells expressing β2AR. The diterpene activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin stimulates cyclic AMP accumulation and also provoked a weak activation of p44Erk and an activation of p42Erk similar to that of isoproterenol. These same results were obtained in CHO clones stably transfected to express β2ARs (data not shown). The inverse agonist compound ICI118551 was without effect on Erk1,2 activation in these cells (data not shown). We extended these studies by examining the ability of insulin to activate Erk1,2 in A431 cells that were challenged simultaneously with either 1 or 10 μm isoproterenol (Fig.4). The response to insulin alone is provided for comparison. Treatment with 1 μmisoproterenol alone provokes activation of Erk1,2. Increasing the concentration of insulin leads to further activation of Erk1,2. Increasing the concentration of isoproterenol alone to 10 μm leads to additional activation of that produced by 1 μm. Challenging the A431 cells with 10 μmisoproterenol in combination with increasing concentrations of insulin leads to a dampening of the activation of Erk1,2 especially at the lower concentrations of insulin (1 and 10 nm). These data suggest that the ability of isoproterenol to activate Erk1,2 is intrinsically lower than that of insulin to activate Erk1,2. In combination, insulin and isoproterenol do not activate Erk1,2 in an additive manner but rather appear to compete for the activation process in a weakly competitive manner. The observations both in vivo (4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Karoor V. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrate that insulin treatment leads to the phosphorylation of the β2AR on tyrosyl residues, particularly Tyr350. Phosphorylation of Tyr350 creates a binding site for SH2 domains that can act as a protein module for the docking and regulation of a wide spectrum of adaptor molecules, as well as interesting molecules such as Src and PI3K (6Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to counterregulate the ability of the β2AR to activate adenyl cyclase is dependent upon the availability of the Tyr350 for phosphorylation. Mutation of this tyrosyl residue abolishes the counterregulation of β2AR-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation (4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Karoor V. Malbon C.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ability of insulin to provoke profound sequestration of the β2AR is dependent upon the availability of Tyr350, i.e. the Y350F mutant fails to display insulin-induced sequestration (14Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We tested whether mutation of the wild-type β2AR to Y350F, likewise, might influence the ability of insulin to signal to the level of Erk1,2 activation (Fig. 5). As displayed in the immunoblot of whole-cell extracts stained with antibodies to the phosphospecific, activated forms of Erk1,2, insulin stimulates an enhanced activation of Erk1,2 in CHO cells expressing the wild-type (Tyr350) β2AR. To address the nature of the effect of expressing a mutant receptor on the insulin response, we selected clones that express nearly equivalent levels of β2AR (3.5 ± 0.7 and 3.0 ± 0.6 fmol/100,000 cells for mutant Y350F and wild-type β2AR-expressing cells, respectively). The effect of the Y350F mutation was clear; the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin in the cells expressing the mutant receptors was largely abolished. Analysis of data from multiple experiments confirms the data displayed in the immunoblot. Mutation of Tyr350 of β2AR blocks the ability of insulin to counterregulate β2AR-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as well as the ability of the insulin receptor to phosphorylate Tyr350both in vivo (4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in vitro (5Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results further implicate the β2AR acting as a receptor-based scaffold for insulin signaling in which phosphorylation of the Tyr350 residue of the β2AR creates a binding site for SH2 domains in response to insulin, a key element to activation of Erk1,2. The Tyr350 residue is located in the C-terminal, cytoplasmic tail of the β2AR. If the β2AR is acting as a template or scaffold for insulin signaling to the level of Erk1,2, then expression of the C-terminal domain of the receptor that is not localized to the plasma membrane may influence this novel ability of the β2AR to potentiate insulin signaling. Human epidermoid A431 cells were employed because of their relatively high native expression of β2AR. A431 clones were stably transfected with an expression vector (pCDNA3) harboring the entire cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the β2AR (BAC1). Expression was confirmed for the A431 cells stably transfected to express BAC1 by accumulation of the peptide (M r = 11,000) in sufficient quantities to permit ready detection in immunoblots of the whole-cell extracts from these cells, probed with an antibody to BAC1 (Fig.6 A). Insulin challenge of A431 cells yields a significant activation of Erk1,2 (Fig. 6 B). The expression of BAC1 in A431 clones resulted in a total loss of the ability of insulin to signal to the level of Erk1,2. Probing immunoblots of extracts from the A431 clones with antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (Anti-pY) revealed, indeed, that BAC1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin (Fig. 5 A). Expression of BAC1 had no effect on the ability of isoproterenol (10 μm) to stimulate a normal elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation by A431 cells (data not shown). Several slower migrating species that are recognized by the BAC1 antibody and are phosphorylated in response to insulin are likely to represent palmitoylated forms of BAC1 (25Bouvier M. Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Loisel T.P. Moffett S. Mouillac B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 300-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, with respect to the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin in cells expressing native β2AR, BAC1 acts as a dominant-negative molecule that is phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation and suppresses the ability of insulin to signal. PI3K plays an important role in many cellular process, including intracellular trafficking of molecules (26Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 27Galetic I. Andjelkovic M. Meier R. Brodbeck D. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The microbial product wortmannin and the LY294002 compound both inhibit PI3K and many facets of intracellular trafficking. Inhibitors of P13K block various aspects of insulin action, and we evaluated whether the LY294002 compound would influence the ability of the β2AR to enhance insulin activation of Erk1,2 and perhaps influence the sequestration of β2ARs (Fig.7). Insulin, as well as isoproterenol, stimulates the sequestration of β2AR (14Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of the β2AR was defined by use of a GFP-tagged version of the β2AR, characterized earlier (18Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Using A431 cells stably transfected with an expression vector harboring the GFP-tagged β2AR, in tandem with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we observed the GFP-tagged β2AR display a pattern of distribution largely confined to the cell membrane (Fig. 7, panel a). Challenge with insulin induces a dramatic sequestration of the β2AR from the cell membrane to intracellular locales (Fig. 7, panel b), as previously observed (14Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the presence of the LY294002 inhibitor (20 μm), in contrast, the ability of insulin to induce sequestration of the β2AR was abolished (Fig. 7,panel c). Analysis of β2AR internalization using the hydrophilic, beta-adrenergic antagonist ligand [3H]CGP-12177, confirms in an independent manner that inhibition of PI3K with the LY compound suppresses insulin-stimulated β2AR sequestration, measured at 5 min post-insulin (TableI). Taken together, these data suggest that the ability of insulin, but not the ability of isoproterenol, to stimulate sequestration of the β2AR was dependent upon PI3K,i.e. inhibition of PI3K by LY compound suppresses sequestration of β2AR in response to insulin. These novel data prompted us to probe further the possible role for β2AR internalization in the ability of β2AR to potentiate insulin activation of Erk1,2.Table IInhibition of PI3 kinase by LY294002 suppresses the sequestration of β2AR in response to insulin but not in response to isoproterenolTreatmentSequestration of β2AR%30-min Incubation None (Control) 0 + Isoproterenol (10 μm)25.8 ± 1.8 + Isoproterenol (10 μm) and propranolol (10 μm) 0 + Isoproterenol (10 μm) and LY294002 (20 μm)27.6 ± 2.45-min Incubation None (Control) 0 + Insulin (100 μm)19.5 ± 1.6 + Insulin (100 nm) and LY294002 (20 μm)04.9 ± 0.7A431 cells were treated in the absence (Control) and presence of either 10 μm isoproterenol or 100 nm insulin.

The incubation with isoproterenol was for 30 min, whereas the incubation with insulin was measured at 5 min, as employed in the experiments shown in Fig. 6. The isoproterenol-stimulated sequestration was blocked by addition of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 μm). Aliquots of cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm) and then stimulated with either isoproterenol or insulin.

To probe further the potentiation of insulin signaling to Erk1,2 by β2AR, we tested inhibitors of Src, MEK, and PI3K. The studies were performed in both A431 cells and CHO clones stably transfected to express β2AR. Recent data have implicated the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src in the biology of β2AR (28Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar); for this reason the PP2 inhibitor of Src was tested first. Treatment with the PP2 inhibitor (50 nm) failed to influence the ability of cells expressing β2AR to potentiate insulin activation of Erk1,2 (Fig.8). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 (29Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) (10 μm, overnight), in sharp contrast, abolishes all activation of Erk1,2, suggesting that the potentiation of insulin-stimulated Erk1,2 activation by β2AR is, in fact, mediated via MEK. The LY294002 compound, which inhibits 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, was without effect on the ability of β2AR to potentiate Erk1,2 activation by insulin (Fig. 8), although LY294002 was found to suppress insulin-stimulated β2AR sequestration (Fig. 7). We wondered whether inhibition of PI3K activity and blockade of β2AR sequestration might alter either the time-course or decay of the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin. A431 cells pretreated with the LY compound for 2 h prior to challenge with insulin display the same onset, activation, and decay of the response as cells not treated with LY294002 (Fig. 9). The results suggest that insulin and isoproterenol can both activate Erk1,2 independently of each other but that their activation in combination is non-additive. To test further the notion that these two agents may compete on one level with each other for the activation of Erk1,2, we investigated the effects of pretreating A431 cells with isoproterenol for 30 min on the ability of a subsequent challenge of insulin to activate Erk1,2. Cells were challenged with isoproterenol for 30 min and then challenged directly without or with increasing concentrations of insulin (Fig. 10). When challenged sequentially, the ability of isoproterenol to counterregulate the activation of Erk1,2 by insulin was revealed. The activation of Erk1,2 by insulin was diminished in cells challenged 30 min prior with isoproterenol. When challenged simultaneously, this ability of isoproterenol to counterregulate insulin action was not so obvious (Figs. 3 and 4). The counterregulatory effects of catecholamines on insulin action are well known. We reveal the activation of Erk1,2 to be the target of both insulin and beta-adrenergic agonists, with beta-adrenergic agonists and insulin, at one level, competing for β2AR (Fig.11). Because the extent of Erk1,2 activation is less for beta-adrenergic agonists than for insulin, this competition dictates the final level of Erk1,2 activity, which in turn can modulate other members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase network. On another level, the current work identifies a novel role for the β2AR and perhaps other GPLRs, i.e. acting as a receptor-based scaffold enhancing the signaling of other pathways. Expression of the β2AR clearly can potentiate the ability of insulin to activate Erk1,2. The evidence to support this notion is as follows: activation of Erk1,2 by insulin is potentiated severalfold and prolonged in cells expressing elevated levels of β2AR; the extent of the potentiation of insulin action on Erk1,2 correlates with the amount of β2AR expressed; mutation of the β2AR tyrosyl residue (Y350F) that is both phosphorylated in response to insulin and creates a binding site for SH2 domains abolishes the potentiation of insulin action; the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR (BAC1), when expressed in cells, is phosphorylated in response to insulin and acts as a dominant negative with respect to enhanced activation of Erk1,2 by insulin; and, blockade of β2AR internalization does not suppress the ability of the β2AR to potentiate insulin activation of Erk1,2. Several well known GPLRs themselves activate the Erk1,2 pathway (2Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In some cases, the activation of Erk1,2 requires internalization of the GPLR, whereas in others the activation of Erk1,2 proceeds in the absence of internalization (30Della Rocca G.J. Mukhin Y.V.

The ability of the β2AR to cross-talk to and potentiate insulin action on Erk1,2 also does not require large-scale β2AR sequestration. GPLR-based scaffold functions have been implicated for direct effects of GPLR-agonists action on the mitogen-activated protein kinase network (28Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We propose that the potentiation of insulin activation of Erk1,2 is yet another example of a GPLR-based scaffold. The β2AR, upon phosphorylation in response to insulin (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Karoor V.

Malbon C.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sequestration of β2AR in response to agonist requires G-protein-linked receptor kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation, arrestin binding, and the involvement of clathrin, dynamin, and Src. The activation of Erk1,2 by insulin as compared with isoproterenol shares many common features (Fig. 11) and some interesting differences. Insulin, as well as beta-adrenergic agonists, stimulate phosphorylation of the β2AR, the former by intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and the latter by G-protein-linked receptor kinases. Both beta-adrenergic agonists and insulin can sequester β2AR into a vesicle-associated form and activate Erk1,2 independently. The sequestration by insulin, but not that by isoproterenol, is sensitive to LY. Blockade of insulin-induced sequestration by LY294002, however, does not block activation of Erk1,2 by insulin. The extent of the activation of Erk1,2 is greater for stimulation by insulin than it is for beta-adrenergic agonists. Pretreatment with isoproterenol for 30 min leads to a diminished capacity of insulin to activate Erk1,2, suggesting that at one level the two pathways compete for β2AR. Taking these observations into account, we speculate that the β2AR acts as a receptor-based scaffold for the MEK kinase, MEK, and/or Erk1,2 elements of the pathway, targeting one or more of these elements to the cell membrane. Although insulin clearly sequesters β2AR, the activation of Erk1,2 proceeds even when the internalization is blocked, suggesting that the tyrosine-phosphorylated β2AR may organize the elements leading to Erk1,2 activation. Scaffold proteins, such as the A-kinase anchoring protein 250 gravin, have been shown only recently to play an integral role in the signaling of GPLRs (16Shih M. Malbon C.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,18Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Expression of the β2AR potentiates and prolongs the insulin signaling event, and mutation of the Tyr350 residue abolishes the binding site for SH2 domains, as well as the potentiation. Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of the β2AR with respect to activation of adenyl cyclase (and cyclic AMP accumulation), while simultaneously providing a scaffold via a binding site for SH2 domains on the β2AR that can facilitate a second wave of signaling to the activation of Erk1,2. This proposal complements the notion that GPLRs can act as scaffolds for transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (2Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin.

Some of translation factors catalyzing individual steps in all these phases are GTP/GDP-dependent proteins (1Spirin A.S. Ribosome Structure and Protein Biosynthesis. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1986Google Scholar). While complexed with GTP they bind to the ribosome and after GTP hydrolysis dissociate as GDP-bound inactive proteins. Elongation factors (EFs)1 Tu and G are involved in the elongation phase of protein biosynthesis. The tertiary structure of EF-Tu from Thermus aquaticus in both GTP and GDP forms are known at 2.5 and 2.7 Å resolutions, respectively (2Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J.

The structure of the ternary complex of Tu with tRNA, and the uncleavable analog of GTP (GMPPNP) was also determined (4Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar).The crystallographic studies of EF-G from Thermus thermophilus resulted in determination of the EF-G structure in complex with GDP and its empty form (5Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 6Ævarsson A. Brazhnikov E. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Chirgadze Y. Al-Karadaghi S. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These studies revealed structural similarities (“molecular mimicry”) between tertiary structures of EF-G and the EF-Tu-aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex (7Liljas A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 247-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Clark B.F.C. Trends Biochem. 1996; 21: 81-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is interesting that domains III, IV, and V of EF-G mimic the tRNA structure in the EF-Tu ternary complex, whereas domain IV can be related to the tRNA anticodon arm. The G domains in both factors are nucleotide-binding domains.These findings encouraged the studies of the molecular mechanism of EF-G interaction with the ribosome and the functional role of its domains. It was reported that EF-G lacking domain V was deficient in nucleotide-dependent association with the ribosome (9Hou Y. Yaskowiak A.S. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7038-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also shown that EF-G domain IV (10Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Martemyanov K.A. Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, in particular, the intact conformation of its distal end (12Martemyanov K.A. Yarunin A.S. Liljas A. Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are very important for translocation in the ribosome, whereas GTPase activity and nucleotide-dependent ribosome association of factor G are unaffected by domain IV excision.To further study the functional role of EF-G domains, we have obtained a truncated variant of T. thermophilus EF-G lacking domain III (EF-GΔIII). The effects of EF-GΔIII on (a) GTP hydrolysis, (b) its interaction with nucleotides and fusidic acid, and (c) stimulation of translocation were studied. It was found that the rate of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by EF-GΔIII was markedly decreased, and the mutated protein was unable to promote translocation, whereas the affinity of EF-GΔIII to GDP and its interaction with fusidic acid in the presence of ribosomes were not affected. These results are discussed in the light of structural rearrangements in the EF-G and the ribosome upon their interaction.DISCUSSIONThe results reported above demonstrate that GDP-dependent interactions of the truncated factor are not impaired, both in the absence and in the presence of ribosomes (TableI). This fact may reflect that the GDP bound form of EF-G is a final product of its functional cycle and that domain III is not important for GDP binding.By contrast, both intrinsic and ribosome-dependent GTPase activity (Fig. 2) of EF-GΔIII was markedly affected (see “Results”). The GTPase activity of the truncated factor in the presence of ribosomes was 940 times lower than that of wt EF-G, whereas only a 2-fold decrease of its affinity for the ribosome was revealed (Table II). These results mean that low rate of GTPase reaction catalyzed by the truncated factor, compared with wt EF-G, is mainly due to a 103-fold decrease of its catalytic activity rather than to a small decrease in the affinity of binding to the ribosome. Inasmuch as domain III has no direct contact with the nucleotide binding center located on the G domain (5Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Al-Karadaghi S. Ævarsson A. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Liljas A. Structure. 1996; 4: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that domain III influences the GTP-binding center of EF-G as well as interaction of the factor with the ribosome and subsequent induction of GTP hydrolysis. Hence, it can be suggested that conformational changes in EF-G and in the ribosome might occur upon factor binding to the ribosome. Indeed, conformational changes were revealed in the elongation factors (27Bubunenko M.G. Gudkov A.T. Biomed. Sci. 1990; 1: 127-132PubMed Google Scholar) and in ribosomal proteins (28Gudkov A.T. Gongadze G.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Gudkov A.T Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) by limited proteolysis of ribosomes complexed with EF-G or EF-Tu in the presence of GDP or GMPPNP, i.e. in the complexes modeling post- or pre-hydrolysis states of nucleotide bound to ribosomes.As stated in the report on interaction of fusidic acid with the ribosome and EF-G, the antibiotic binding occurred after GTP hydrolysis (26Bodley J.W. Zieve F.J. Lin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5662-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also proposed that hydrolysis of the nucleotide might generate or uncover the fusidic acid-binding site (30Willie G.R. Richman N. Godtfredsen W.O. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data given in Table I are consistent with this suggestion. It is interesting to note that formation of the ribosomal complex with fusidic acid in the presence of GTP was somewhat increased in comparison with that when GDP was added (Table I). Thus, it seems likely that fusidic acid binding in concert with GTP hydrolysis is more efficient than in the presence of GDP because EF-G may have an intermediate conformational just after GTP hydrolysis that can favor the antibiotic binding.The tertiary structure of EF-G complexed with GTP is unknown to be compared with the structure of EF-G·GDP complex. Yet, the x-ray scattering studies of nucleotide-free EF-G and its binary complexes with GDP or GTP in solution have not revealed any remarkable structural changes of the molecule, although small scale variations in the EF-G structure were not ruled out, and possible changes in EF-G bound to ribosomes were discussed (31Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10327-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By contrast, comparison of the EF-Tu·GDP structure (3Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C Nyborg J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with that of EF-Tu·GTP (2Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 32Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Shirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) reveals major rearrangement of domains within the EF-Tu molecule in the last complex. These differences between factors G and Tu can be explained by their interactions with guanine nucleotides and ribosomes.The exchange of GTP for GDP in EF-Tu is catalyzed in the solution or cytoplasm by EF-Ts. On the other hand, no protein analogous to EF-Ts was found for EF-G. However, in the living cell the GTP concentration is 10 times higher than that of GDP (33Neuhard G. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar), and affinity of GTP to EF-G is greatly increased in the presence of ribosome (34Baca O.G Rohrbach M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4570-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (59 nm) has been reported for uncleavable GTP analog complexed with E. coli EF-G and ribosomes (34Baca O.G Rohrbach M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4570-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is over 800 times less than K d(50 μm) for the GTP interaction with E. coliEF-G without ribosomes (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and 200 times less thanK d value for GTP (12 μm) with T. thermophilus EF-G in the absence of ribosomes (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides, it should be noted that GDP affinity to EF-G is always lower than affinity to EF-Tu. For example, K d for GDP complexed with EF-G is 600 times higher than that of the EF-Tu·GDP complex (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to believe that particular EF-G features and the conditions in the cell described above are favorable for the GDP/GTP exchange. The binary complex of EF-G with GTP appearing as a result of such an exchange can be readily bound to the ribosome and some adjustments or rearrangements of its domains may be involved in this process. In any case, the binding of EF-G with GTP (or with its uncleavable analogs) to the ribosome promotes translocation (reviewed in Ref. 35Spirin A.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1985; 32: 75-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and after GTP hydrolysis EF-G complexed with GDP dissociates from the ribosome.As an additional evidence for the conformational changes discussed above, we would like to note that synergism between GTPase activities of EF-Tu and EF-G on ribosomes was revealed, and it was proposed that such positive cooperativity of elongation factors might correlate with different conformations of the ribosome accepting these factors (36Mesters J.R. Potapov A.P. Martien de Graaf J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this connection it is noteworthy that sensitivity of the ribosomal protein L7/L12 to trypsin depends on the elongation factors Tu and G bound to the ribosome, and these results mean that conformation changes may occur in the ribosomal components (29Gudkov A.T Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in the 70 S ribosome and EF-G induced by GTP hydrolysis were recently visualized also by cryo-electron microscopy (37Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 38Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.-J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that after dissociation of a factor, the ribosome is in a state favorable for accepting another.The data discussed above are also in good agreement with the observation that EF-G domains III, IV, and V mimic the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the EF-Tu ternary complex (4Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 7Liljas A. Curr.

Trends Biochem. 1996; 21: 81-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The molecular mimicry of elongation factors implies that dissociation of the EF-G·GDP complex leaves the ribosome being in a state ready for the codon-dependent binding of the EF-Tu ternary complex (39Clark B.F.C. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results of this study shows that: (a) both intrinsic and ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-GΔIII are significantly decreased; (b) the interaction of the truncated EF-G with GDP as well as fusidic acid-dependent stabilization of the EF-G·GDP complex with the ribosome are not influenced; and (c) the mutated factor is virtually inactive in stimulation of translocation despite the physical presence of domain IV that is also very important for translocation. As discussed above, these results are consistent with conformational changes occurring in elongation factor in accordance with GTP binding and its hydrolysis The process of protein biosynthesis by the ribosome includes three main phases: initiation, elongation, and termination.

These results mean that low rate of GTPase reaction catalyzed by the truncated factor, compared with wt EF-G, is mainly due to a 103-fold decrease of its catalytic activity rather than to a small decrease in the affinity of binding to the ribosome. Inasmuch as domain III has no direct contact with the nucleotide binding center located on the G domain (5Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Al-Karadaghi S. Ævarsson A. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Liljas A. Structure. 1996; 4: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that domain III influences the GTP-binding center of EF-G as well as interaction of the factor with the ribosome and subsequent induction of GTP hydrolysis. Hence, it can be suggested that conformational changes in EF-G and in the ribosome might occur upon factor binding to the ribosome. Indeed, conformational changes were revealed in the elongation factors (27Bubunenko M.G. Gudkov A.T. Biomed. Sci. 1990; 1: 127-132PubMed Google Scholar) and in ribosomal proteins (28Gudkov A.T. Gongadze G.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Gudkov A.T Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) by limited proteolysis of ribosomes complexed with EF-G or EF-Tu in the presence of GDP or GMPPNP, i.e. in the complexes modeling post- or pre-hydrolysis states of nucleotide bound to ribosomes.As stated in the report on interaction of fusidic acid with the ribosome and EF-G, the antibiotic binding occurred after GTP hydrolysis (26Bodley J.W. Zieve F.J. Lin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5662-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also proposed that hydrolysis of the nucleotide might generate or uncover the fusidic acid-binding site (30Willie G.R. Richman N. Godtfredsen W.O. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data given in Table I are consistent with this suggestion. It is interesting to note that formation of the ribosomal complex with fusidic acid in the presence of GTP was somewhat increased in comparison with that when GDP was added (Table I). Thus, it seems likely that fusidic acid binding in concert with GTP hydrolysis is more efficient than in the presence of GDP because EF-G may have an intermediate conformational just after GTP hydrolysis that can favor the antibiotic binding.The tertiary structure of EF-G complexed with GTP is unknown to be compared with the structure of EF-G·GDP complex. Yet, the x-ray scattering studies of nucleotide-free EF-G and its binary complexes with GDP or GTP in solution have not revealed any remarkable structural changes of the molecule, although small scale variations in the EF-G structure were not ruled out, and possible changes in EF-G bound to ribosomes were discussed (31Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10327-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By contrast, comparison of the EF-Tu·GDP structure (3Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C Nyborg J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with that of EF-Tu·GTP (2Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 32Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Shirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) reveals major rearrangement of domains within the EF-Tu molecule in the last complex. These differences between factors G and Tu can be explained by their interactions with guanine nucleotides and ribosomes.The exchange of GTP for GDP in EF-Tu is catalyzed in the solution or cytoplasm by EF-Ts. On the other hand, no protein analogous to EF-Ts was found for EF-G. However, in the living cell the GTP concentration is 10 times higher than that of GDP (33Neuhard G. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar), and affinity of GTP to EF-G is greatly increased in the presence of ribosome (34Baca O.G Rohrbach M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4570-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (59 nm) has been reported for uncleavable GTP analog complexed with E. coli EF-G and ribosomes (34Baca O.G Rohrbach M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4570-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is over 800 times less than K d(50 μm) for the GTP interaction with E. coliEF-G without ribosomes (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and 200 times less thanK d value for GTP (12 μm) with T. thermophilus EF-G in the absence of ribosomes (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides, it should be noted that GDP affinity to EF-G is always lower than affinity to EF-Tu. For example, K d for GDP complexed with EF-G is 600 times higher than that of the EF-Tu·GDP complex (19Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to believe that particular EF-G features and the conditions in the cell described above are favorable for the GDP/GTP exchange. The binary complex of EF-G with GTP appearing as a result of such an exchange can be readily bound to the ribosome and some adjustments or rearrangements of its domains may be involved in this process. In any case, the binding of EF-G with GTP (or with its uncleavable analogs) to the ribosome promotes translocation (reviewed in Ref. 35Spirin A.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1985; 32: 75-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and after GTP hydrolysis EF-G complexed with GDP dissociates from the ribosome.As an additional evidence for the conformational changes discussed above, we would like to note that synergism between GTPase activities of EF-Tu and EF-G on ribosomes was revealed, and it was proposed that such positive cooperativity of elongation factors might correlate with different conformations of the ribosome accepting these factors (36Mesters J.R. Potapov A.P. Martien de Graaf J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this connection it is noteworthy that sensitivity of the ribosomal protein L7/L12 to trypsin depends on the elongation factors Tu and G bound to the ribosome, and these results mean that conformation changes may occur in the ribosomal components (29Gudkov A.T Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in the 70 S ribosome and EF-G induced by GTP hydrolysis were recently visualized also by cryo-electron microscopy (37Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 38Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.-J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that after dissociation of a factor, the ribosome is in a state favorable for accepting another.The data discussed above are also in good agreement with the observation that EF-G domains III, IV, and V mimic the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the EF-Tu ternary complex (4Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 7Liljas A. Curr.

Trends Biochem. 1996; 21: 81-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The molecular mimicry of elongation factors implies that dissociation of the EF-G·GDP complex leaves the ribosome being in a state ready for the codon-dependent binding of the EF-Tu ternary complex (39Clark B.F.C. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results of this study shows that: (a) both intrinsic and ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-GΔIII are significantly decreased; (b) the interaction of the truncated EF-G with GDP as well as fusidic acid-dependent stabilization of the EF-G·GDP complex with the ribosome are not influenced; and (c) the mutated factor is virtually inactive in stimulation of translocation despite the physical presence of domain IV that is also very important for translocation. As discussed above, these results are consistent with conformational changes occurring in elongation factor in accordance with GTP binding and its hydrolysis The results reported above demonstrate that GDP-dependent interactions of the truncated factor are not impaired, both in the absence and in the presence of ribosomes (TableI). This fact may reflect that the GDP bound form of EF-G is a final product of its functional cycle and that domain III is not important for GDP binding.

In avian, HSF1 and HSF3 are maintained in a cryptic monomer and dimer form, respectively, in the cytoplasm in the absence of stress. Upon heat stress, they undergo conformational change associated with the formation of a trimer and nuclear translocation. In this study, we identified regions that are necessary for the dimer-to-trimer transition of chicken HSF3 (cHSF3) upon stress conditions. One of these regions coincides with a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) of cHSF3 that was recognized by a nuclear transport receptor importin α. Point mutations of basic amino acids in the NLS inhibit both nuclear translocation and trimer formation of cHSF3. These results demonstrate that the NLS acts positively on the trimer formation of cHSF3 upon stress conditions.

These inducible systems of gene expression are regulated by transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences. Many transcription factors that govern inducible gene expression remain in the cytoplasm in a cryptic form, and in response to signaling they are transported to the nucleus where they bind to and activate specific sets of genes. One of the examples of inducible gene expression is heat shock gene expression induced by heat stress (1Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The expression of eukaryotic heat shock genes is controlled by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs)1 that bind to heat shock element located in the promoter regions of all heat shock genes. In mammals, HSF1 is activated by heat stress and induces expression of heat shock genes (2Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 3Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

HSF1 not only protects cells subjected to stresses by inducing a set of heat shock genes but also is involved in normal development (5Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HSF1 induces apoptosis of spermatocytes subjected to thermal stress (7Nakai A. Suzuki M. Tanabe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the absence of stress, HSF1 is mostly located in the cytoplasm in an inactive monomeric form. HSF1 is activated in roughly two steps (1Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 8Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E.

First, HSF1 is translocated to the nucleus, a process that is associated with a conversion to a trimer form that can bind to heat shock element with high affinity. Second, it acquires transcriptional activity probably by exposing a carboxyl-terminal activation domain (10Green M. Schuetz T. Sullivan K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell.

All members of the HSF gene family share common structural features including a conserved DNA-binding domain that exhibits a winged helix-turn-helix motif (13Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C.M.

With the exception of HSFs in budding yeasts and mammalian HSF4, HSFs also have another carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic repeat (HR-C) (17Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Wu C.

HSF1 is also negatively regulated in trans by molecular chaperone complexes (24Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell.

Sequestration of molecular chaperones to denatured substrates by heat stress is speculated to lead to the activation of HSF1. The existence of a bipartite type of NLS was suggested in HSF2, and these sequences are conserved among HSFs (28Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Avian cells respond to heat stress by activating HSF3 as well as HSF1. Chicken HSF3 (cHSF3) stays as an inactive dimer exclusively in the cytoplasm in normally growing cells and is translocated into the nucleus and converted to an active trimer upon heat stress (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). Activation of cHSF3 exhibits a delayed response as compared with the relatively rapid activation of HSF1 and occurs predominantly upon exposure to extremely high temperatures (30Tanabe M. Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Kawazoe Y. Tanabe T. Sasai N. Nagata K. Nakai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fundamentally, however, the activation mechanism of cHSF3 may be similar to that of HSF1 (32Nakai A. Cell Stress Chaperone. 1999; 4: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analysis of cHSF3-deficient B lymphocytes showed that cHSF3 is essential for the burst activation of heat shock genes even in the presence of cHSF1 (33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). cHSF3 is also specifically activated by the c-Myb proto-oncogene product through a direct interaction and may involve in cell growth and development (34Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, cHSF3 has significant roles in activating heat shock genes in response to heat stress and physiological stress. Studies using various experimental systems have attempted to identify cis-acting domains that regulate the monomer-to-trimer transition of HSF1. In addition to the core hydrophobic heptad repeat domains (HR-A/B and HR-C domains), several other domains play roles in maintaining HSF1 in an inactive form (35Orosz A. Wisniewski J. Wu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7018-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, no domain has been identified to participate positively in activating HSFs. In this study, we analyzed the dimer-to-trimer transition of a series of deletion mutants of chicken HSF3 and found domains that are necessary for trimer formation. One of them coincides with the NLS of cHSF3. We suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of HSF regulation. Chicken HSF3 expression vector pCMV-cHSF3 was constructed by ligating a 2665-base pairEcoRI fragment of pCHSF3–14a into the vector pCMV/Blue (Pharmingen). All of the expression vectors of cHSF3 with deletions or point mutations were created by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pCMV-cHSF3 plasmid as a template. To confirm mutations, sequencing reactions were performed by using ALFexpress AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), ALFexpress dATP labeling mix, and each synthetic oligonucleotide. Sequences were analyzed by using an ALFexpress sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To construct expression vectors pGFP-aa (), pGFP-aa (), and pGFP-aa (), each cDNA fragment was modified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce an EcoRI site and ligated into pEGFP2-C1 (which is an expression vector of a tandem repeat GFP (a gift from Y. Eguchi, Osaka University). To examine sequences, sequence reactions were performed by using a pEGFP-C1 primer (5′-CATGGTCCTGCTGGAGTTCGTG-3′). To construct pGEX2T-NLS vector, a cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 202–224 of cHSF3 was modified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce a SmaI site and ligated into pGEX2T plasmid vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX2T-NLS6, pGEX2T-NLS7, and pGEX2T-NLS8 were created by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pGEX2T-NLS vector as a template. To confirm mutations, sequence reactions were performed by using a pGEX2T primer (5′-GTATTGAAGCTATCCCAC-3′). DT40 cells were maintained as described previously (33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For generating cells expressing a mutant cHSF3, 1 × 107 of cHSF3-null cells (33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suspended in 0.7 ml of PBS were mixed with 0.1 ml of DNA solution that contained a linear pCMV-cHSF3 mutant plasmid vector (25 μg) digested with XhoI and a linear pZeoSV2(+) (3 μg) (Invitrogen) digested with XhoI. After keeping on ice for 10 min, cells were electroporated with a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 550 V and 25 microfarad and then incubated on ice for 10 min. After suspension in 20 ml of fresh medium, cells were divided into two 96-well plates and incubated for 20 h. Medium containing zeocine (Invitrogen) was then added to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. After 10–14 days, drug-resistant clones were expanded, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (30Tanabe M. Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15389-15395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing equal amount of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with αHSF3γ antiserum as described previously (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). The level of cHSF3 protein in each clone was compared with that of endogenous cHSF3 in wild type DT40 cells, and clones expressing less cHSF3 protein than wild type cells were analyzed further. To examine the oligomer form of cHSF3 mutant-2 (amino acids 392–467 were deleted), antiserum αHSF3β that recognizes the whole cHSF3 molecule was used (data not shown). Size fractionation of cell extracts was performed as described previously (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts (200 μl containing 500–1000 μg of protein) from each cell were applied to a Superdex 200 HR column for fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were eluted at 0.3 ml/min with a buffer containing 1% glycerol, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 200 mm KCl, and 1.5 mmMgCl2. The fractions (0.5 ml) were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, dried, suspended in gel sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Cells were washed with PBS and stuck to a slide glass by using a centrifugal cell collector (Tomy, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, cells were incubated with a 1: 300 dilution of antiserum (αHSF3γ) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS/10% normal goat serum in PBS, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1: 200 dilution) (Cappel). The cells were washed with PBS and mounted in 80% glycerol in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Immunolabeled cells were visualized by using fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot, Zeiss). QT6 quail fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2% chicken serum, and 2% tryptose phosphate broth. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 24 h and were transfected with each expression vector by the CaPO4 method. After 14 h in transfection salts, the plates were washed three times with PBS, fed with fresh medium, and incubated further for 24 h. Then the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed and mounted in 80% glycerol in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) on coverglasses. Photograph was taken by using by fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot, Zeiss). To examine the level of GFP fusion proteins, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Western blot analysis was then performed using anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and these extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cultures of Esherichia coli (strain JM109) transformed with pGEX2T, pGEX2T-NLS, pGEX2T-NLS6, pGEX2T-NLS7, and pGEX2T-NLS8 were treated with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were washed and suspended in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After sonication, soluble fractions were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on ice for 1 h. After being washed with PBS, beads (bed volume of 20 μl) were mixed with HeLa cell extracts on ice for 2 h. After being washed with PBS, the beads were added to SDS sample buffer (20 μl) and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blot analysis by using mouse monoclonal antibody against importin α (anti-Rch-1, Transduction Laboratories) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel) as a second antibody. The signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We transfected cHSF3 expression vector into DT40 cells in which HSF3 gene was disrupted (33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and isolated lines stably expressing cHSF3 under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. The heat shock response was restored in these cells (33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, cHSF3 was observed as two bands with molecular sizes of 65 and 85 kDa. The mobility of the lower band is identical to that of a translated product from cHSF3 transcript in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, whereas the mobility of the upper band is identical to that of endogenous cHSF3 in cells (Fig.1 A). These results suggest that cHSF3 polypeptide is modified post-translationally (see “Discussion”). We examined the oligomer form of the reintroduced cHSF3 by gel filtration analysis. The 85-kDa form of the reintroduced cHSF3 was eluted at the dimer position, fractions 21–24, and after heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min, it was eluted at the trimer position, fractions 18–20 (Fig. 1 B, panels d–f,upper arrows), just like endogenous cHSF3 (Fig.1 B, panels a–c) (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). In contrast, the 65-kDa form was eluted at a monomer position (Fig. 1 B, panel d, lower arrow). After heat shock, its elution peak was observed a little at a trimer position and disappeared from the soluble fraction at higher temperatures such as 45 °C (Fig. 1 B,panel f). These results suggest that a dimer-to-trimer transition of the 85-kDa form of reintroduced cHSF3 is correctly regulated just like endogenous cHSF3 irrespective of the presence of the 65-kDa form. In this study, we examined the oligomer form of only the 85-kDa form. We generated cells stably expressing a series of deletion mutants of cHSF3 (Fig.2). Because negative regulation of HSF1 activation was shown to be limited (3Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and was shared with negative regulation of cHSF3 activation (32Nakai A. Cell Stress Chaperone. 1999; 4: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we analyzed cells that expressed less cHSF3 mutant protein than endogenous cHSF3 protein in wild type DT40 cells (Fig. 2 B). cHSF3 mutants lacking an N terminus (see lines Z10, Z11, and Z12) or carboxyl terminus (line Z2; data not shown and see “Materials and Methods”) were not modified. The central region including HR-B was also necessary for the modification (see line Z8). We analyzed the oligomer forms of all of the cHSF3 mutants in control and heat shocked cells by gel filtration analysis (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar).Figure 2Structure and expression of cHSF3 mutants.

B, expression of mutant cHSF3 proteins in HSF3-deficient DT40 cells. Each expression vector was stably transfected into cells, and whole cell extracts from control and heat shocked (43 °C for 30 min) cells were prepared. Aliquots containing same amounts of protein (40 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an antiserum αHSF3γ. The protein levels of cHSF3 mutants were below that of endogenous cHSF3 in wild type (WT) DT40 cells.

Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 22Zuo J. Balar R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We reported a similar observation that a cHSF3 mutant lacking carboxyl-terminal region containing the hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR-C) exhibited a DNA-binding form in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (37Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1983-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We extended these works and showed that a mutant lacking a hydrophobic heptad repeat at the carboxyl terminus formed a trimer in the absence of heat shock (Fig.3 A, line Z3). Furthermore, substitution of isoleucine at amino acid 371 or leucine at amino acid 375 in the HR-C with glutamic acid made cHSF3 constitutively a trimer (data not shown). Although there is controversy about the role of HR-C (19Zandi E. Tran T.-N.T. Chamberlain W. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1299-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Saltsman K.A. Prentice H.L. Kingston R.E. Yeast. 1998; 15: 733-746Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), our data conclusively showed that this structure plays a role in maintaining cHSF3 in an inactive oligomeric state. Previous studies have identified some regions of HSF1 other than the HR-C that contribute to the suppression of HSF1 trimerization (21Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 35Orosz A. Wisniewski J. Wu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7018-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,36Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that suggests the existence of domain acting positively on the HSF1 trimerization. Surprisingly, we found that two deletion mutants of cHSF3, cHSF3 mutant-6 and mutant-14, remained as dimer even after cells were heat shocked at 45 °C for 30 min. Regions necessary for cHSF3 trimerization include one containing a putative NLS downstream of the trimerization domain (formerly denoted as NLS2 in human HSF2; see Ref. 28Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B, line Z6) and a carboxyl-terminal region of the DNA-binding domain (which corresponds to a linker region of hHSF1; see Ref. 36Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 C, line Z14). The significance of the latter region will be discussed elsewhere. The lack of trimer formation of cHSF3 mutant-6 and mutant-14 was observed not only when cells were heat shocked but also when cells were treated with sodium arsenite, hydrogen peroxide, high concentration of NaCl (osmotic shock), proline analogue azetidine, prostaglandin A1, and proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (data not shown). These results suggest that stress signals are not transmitted to cHSF3 without the putative NLS. To examine whether the putative NLS, which is necessary for the trimer transition of cHSF3, is functional, we analyzed first the subcellular localization of cHSF3 mutants. Endogenous and reintroduced wild type cHSF3 changed their localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after heat shock (Fig.4, lines wt andZ1). In contrast, the deletion mutant of the putative NLS did not move to the nucleus after heat shock (line Z6). The cHSF3 mutant-14 did not translocate to the nucleus after heat shock (Fig. 4,line Z14), nor did a mutant-15, which lacks another putative NLS between the DNA-binding domain and oligomerization domain (formerly denoted as NLS1 in human HSF2) (28Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), move to the nucleus (line Z15). Other cHSF3 mutants did translocate to the nucleus after heat shock (Fig. 4). Staining patterns of cHSF3 and cHSF3 mutants in the nucleus of heat shocked cells were same. We next examined whether each of the three regions necessary for nuclear translocation of cHSF3 could transport GFP when fused to one of these polypeptides. We expressed GFP-NLS fusion protein as well as GFP fused to another putative nuclear localization sequence (amino acids 111–139) or GFP fused to another region (amino acids 79–110), which is also necessary for trimer formation (Fig.5, A–C). GFP-NLS was accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 5 B, lane c), whereas GFP, GFP-aa (), and GFP-aa () located mostly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B, panels a, b, and d). We further examined whether the NLS of cHSF3 was recognized by a nuclear import receptor. The NLS of cHSF3 (amino acids 202–224) was fused to carboxyl terminus of GST (GST-NLS), and a GST-NLS column was generated. After mixing with HeLa cell extract, complexes bound to GST-NLS were examined (Fig. 5 D). Because importin α is known to bind to the typical bipartite NLS among various kinds of nuclear import receptors, we performed immunoblotting with antibody against importin α. It was revealed that importin α efficiently bound to the NLS of cHSF3 (Fig. 5 D, lane 3). These results indicate that the NLS (amino acids 202–224) in cHSF3 is a classical NLS. To further clarify which amino acids are responsible for both trimer formation and nuclear translation, we created a series of point mutations and examined their oligomer formation and subcellular localization before and after heat shock. The NLS in cHSF3 could be a bipartite nuclear localization sequence consisting of four charged amino acids (204KRKR207) and one charged amino acid (Lys219) spaced by 11 amino acids (Fig.6 A). Clusters of charged amino acids are known to be necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Therefore, we substituted one or two of charged amino acids into alanine in the NLS sequences (Fig. 6 A). Substitution of a single amino acid did not affect the heat shock-induced nuclear translocation (Fig. 6 A, mutants NLS1–NLS5; data not shown). cHSF3 could still move to the nucleus after heat shock, although less efficiently, by the substitution of two amino acids including Lys (amino acid 204) in a cluster of charged amino acids and R (amino acid 196 or 222) (Fig. 6, A andB, mutants NLS7 and NLS9). The nuclear translocation was clearly blocked when two Lys (amino acids 204 and 219) were substituted (Fig. 6, A and B,mutant NLS8). Deletion of the KRKR sequence (amino acid 204–207) also prevented nuclear translocation (Fig. 6, Aand B, mutant NLS6). These results suggested that KRKR (amino acids 204–207) and Lys (amino acid 219) are essential amino acids for nuclear translocation of cHSF3. These amino acids necessary for nuclear translocation in the NLS of cHSF3 were consistent with those of one of the putative NLS of human HSF2 (NLS2; see Ref.28Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of mutated NLS to bind to importin α. Although the amount of importin α coprecipitated with GST-NLS7 was greatly reduced compared with that coprecipitated with GST-NLS, it was above the background level (Fig. 5 D,lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, neither GST-NLS8 nor GST-NLS-6 bound to importin α at all (Fig. 5 D, lanes 5 and 6). These results showed that the abilities of NLS mutants to bind to importin α are well correlated with nuclear localization (Fig. 6). We then examined the oligomeric form of these cHSF3 mutants. cHSF3 mutant NLS6, which lacked a cluster of charged amino acids KRKR, remained a dimer after heat shock, and more than half of the mutant NLS8, which did not move to the nucleus, eluted at dimer fractions (fractions 21–23) after heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min (fractions 18–20) (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, NLS7 was eluted mostly at the trimer position (Fig. 6 C), and effects of other point mutations in the NLS sequences on the trimer formation were undetectable (Fig. 6 A and data not shown). These results indicated that mutations that block nuclear translocation also prevent trimer formation. The basic amino acids in the NLS are conserved among all of the vertebrate HSFs (Fig. 6 D). Our mutational analysis of cHSF3 provided unexpected results. We identified two regions that are essential for trimer formation of cHSF3 upon heat stress. One of these regions is coincident with a functional NLS that is a classical bipartite type and is recognized by a nuclear import receptor importin α. Point mutations of the basic amino acids in the NLS inhibit both stress-induced trimer formation and nuclear translocation of cHSF3. Among vertebrate HSFs, HSF1 and HSF3 respond to environmental stresses such as heat stress and change subcellular localization. In the absence of stress, HSF1 and HSF2 are located both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (2Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Wu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7018-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), HSF3 is mostly in the cytoplasm (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar), and HSF4 is in the nucleus (18Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 38Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22756-27845Google Scholar). Upon heat stress, HSF1 and HSF3 accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind to DNA and activate heat shock gene expression. Thus, HSF1 and HSF3 are strictly inactivated by unique mechanisms in the absence of stress. The first step of HSF1 and HSF3 activation is the conversion to a trimer that is associated with nuclear translocation. The trimer formation of HSF1 is shown to be partly under the negative control of chaperone complexes (24Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Zuo J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the sequestration of heat shock proteins under condition of stress may alleviate the negative regulation and lead to the activation of HSF1. Negative regulation of cHSF3 should share this mechanism because depletion of cHSF3 resulted in increased negative regulation to cHSF1 activation (32Nakai A. Cell Stress Chaperone. 1999; 4: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we suggest another mechanism that controls the first step of cHSF3 activation under stress conditions. Our results indicate that release from the negative regulator is not sufficient for the cHSF3 activation. How does the NLS act positively on trimer formation of cHSF3? One possibility is that the NLS may affect the structure of the trimerization domain (HR-A/B), which is located just upstream of the NLS. The HR-A/B is thought to interact with another hydrophobic heptad repeat HR-C on unstressed condition, and the interaction should be dissociated on stress conditions. Mutation of basic amino acids in the NLS may alter the structure of the HR-A/B and inhibit the stress-induced dissociation of the two hydrophobic heptad repeats. Another possibility is that positively acting factors may be necessary for trimer formation of cHSF3. These factors can interact to cHSF3 through the NLS. Nuclear import receptor is a candidate for a positively acting factor because they bind to the NLS of cHSF3 and could induce conformational change of cHSF3. Conformational change induced by binding of nuclear transport receptor is shown in the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 (39Chan C.-K. Jans D.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It may be possible that nuclear transport receptor affects an oligomeric form of cHSF3 in addition to transport it to the nucleus. We are aware of some discrepancies in the roles of the NLS and HR-C. The HR-C of human and Drosophila HSF1 were first shown to maintain HSF1 as an inactive monomer in the absence of stress, as examined by overexpression of mutant proteins in cells (21Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed by experiments conducted in Xenopusoocytes (22Zuo J. Balar R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (23Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, analysis of cells in which the expression of mutant HSF1 was from integrated promoter showed that HR-C is not necessary for maintaining Drosophila HSF1 in an inactive state (19Zandi E. Tran T.-N.T. Chamberlain W. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1299-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is hard to compare these results because the experiments were not performed under physiological conditions. Our experimental system has the advantage that cHSF3 gene-disrupted cells stably expressing cHSF3 mutants are used. Regulation of cHSF3 mutants was monitored in nearly physiological conditions. Our results conclusively indicated that HR-C is necessary for maintaining cHSF3 in an inactive state (Fig. 3 A; data of point mutations were not shown), suggesting that the HR-C of human and Drosophila HSF1 play a similar role. HR-C is expected to prevent trimer formation through HR-A/B by binding intramolecularly to HR-A/B (21Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 22Zuo J. Balar R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Heat stress may cause dissociation of the interaction and induce homo-trimerization of HR-A/B. cHSF3 exists as a dimer in normally growing cells. This dimer state is necessary for cHSF3 to be correctly converted to a trimer after heat shock. The unmodified form of cHSF3 (65 kDa) stayed a monomer and was converted to incorrectly aggregated after heat shock (Fig. 1). To understand the molecular mechanism of cHSF3 regulation, it is necessary to identify the nature of post-translational modification. We have tried to reveal the modification by examining phosphorylation, glycosylation, and covalent modifications in other polypeptides. Unfortunately, we could not identify the cHSF3 modification. The mobility of 85-kDa cHSF3 was not affected by phosphatase treatment of cell lysates (data not shown). cHSF3 did not bind to a concanavalin A column nor wheat germ agglutinin column (data not shown). cHSF3 was not conjugated by ubiquitin-like proteins such as ubiquitin, NEDD-8, sentrin-1 (Sumo-1), sentrin-2, or sentrin-3. 2T. Kamitani, personal communication. Because the 65-kDa cHSF3 is not degradation product (Fig. 1 A), 85-kDa cHSF3 must be post-translationally modified by unknown mechanism. Trimer formation of cHSF3 is shown to be specifically regulated by factors that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. A proto-oncogene product c-Myb induces trimer formation of cHSF3 through binding to a DNA-binding domain of cHSF3 (34Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor protein p53 also binds to cHSF3 and inhibits c-Myb-induced trimer formation of cHSF3 by competing c-Myb binding to cHSF3 (40Tanikawa J. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kanei-Ishii C. Nakai A. Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15578-15585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is possible that positively acting factors such as c-Myb may regulate trimer formation of cHSF3 more generally on stress conditions. We are grateful to N. Imamoto and R. I. Morimoto for critical discussion, Y. Eguchi for plasmid, T. Kamitani for analysis of HSF3 modification, and Y. Kawazoe and M. Tanabe for technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2115301477,"In plants and animals, RNA polymerase I (pol I) can be purified in a form that is self-sufficient for accurate rRNA gene promoter-dependent transcription and that has biochemical properties suggestive of a single complex, or holoenzyme. In this study, we examined the promoter binding properties of a highly purified <i>Brassica</i> pol I holoenzyme activity. DNase I footprinting revealed protection of the core promoter region from ∼−30 to +20, in good agreement with the boundaries of the minimal promoter defined by deletion analyses (−33 to +6). Using conventional polyacrylamide electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), protein-DNA complexes were mostly excluded from the gel. However, agarose EMSA revealed promoter-specific binding activity that co-purified with promoter-dependent transcription activity. Titration, time-course, and competition experiments revealed the formation or dissociation of a single protein-DNA complex. This protein-DNA complex could be labeled by incorporation of radioactive ribonucleotides into RNA in the presence of α-amanitin, suggesting that the polymerase I enzyme is part of the complex. Collectively, these results suggest that transcriptionally competent pol I holoenzymes can associate with rRNA gene promoters in a single DNA binding event."
https://openalex.org/W1980888037,"Many proteins involved in eukaryotic transcription are similar in function and in sequence between organisms. Despite the sequence similarities, there are many factors that do not function across species. For example, transcript elongation factor TFIIS is highly conserved among eukaryotes, and yet the TFIIS protein from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cannot function with mammalian RNA polymerase II and vice versa. To determine the reason for this species specificity, chimeras were constructed linking three structurally independent regions of the TFIIS proteins from yeast and human cells. Two independently folding domains, II and III, have been examined previously using NMR (1-3). Yeast domain II alone is able to bind yeast RNA polymerase II with the same affinity as the full-length TFIIS protein, and this domain was expected to confer the species selectivity. Domain III has previously been shown to be readily exchanged between mammalian and yeast factors. However, the results presented here indicate that domain II is insufficient to confer species selectivity, and a primary determinant lies in a 30-amino acid highly conserved linker region connecting domain II with domain III. These 30 amino acids may physically orient domains II and III to support functional interactions between TFIIS and RNA polymerase II."

Although in vitro systems have been valuable in characterizing the editing mechanism, only a limited number of mRNAs are accurately editedin vitro. We demonstrate here that in vitroediting of cytochrome b mRNA is inhibited by an A-U sequence present on both the 5′-untranslated sequence and on a cytochrome b guide RNA. Mutation of the sequence on the guide RNA stimulates directed editing and results in the loss of binding to at least one component within the editing extract.

Evidence is provided that suggests the A-U sequence interacts with the editing machinery both in vitro and in vivo. guide RNA NADH dehydrogenase 7 polymerase chain reaction In vitro studies suggest that editing of several mitochondrial mRNAs of the kinetoplastid protozoa occurs through a cleavage/ligation mechanism (1Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K.

Science. 1996; 273: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The binding of a guide RNA (gRNA)1 to the pre-edited mRNA immediately 3′ of the editing sites creates a recognition site for an endonuclease. U-addition by a terminal uridylyltransferase activity or U-deletions by an exonuclease activity occur at the 3′-OH created by the endonuclease. The number of U-insertions and deletions is determined by a guiding sequence on the gRNA. Re-ligation of the 5′ and 3′ fragments completes one editing cycle. The mRNA is progressively edited in an overall 3′ to 5′ direction through reiteration of the process at subsequent sites (reviewed in Ref.4Estevez A.M. Simpson L. Gene (Amst. ). 1999; 240: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although in vitro systems have been critical in defining the editing mechanism, they catalyze a complete editing cycle with only a limited number of mRNA substrates. Fractionated mitochondrial extracts prepared from Trypanosoma brucei catalyze both U-deletions from the first editing site and U-insertions into the second editing site of ATPase synthetase subunit 6 mRNA (2Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Cell. 1996; 84: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Kable M.L. Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Science. 1996; 273: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The same system also supports editing of a NADH dehydrogenase 7 (ND7)-ATPase 6 chimeric mRNA (3Kable M.L. Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Science. 1996; 273: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, a complete editing cycle of cytochrome b mRNA has not yet been demonstrated with these extracts, even though products are formed in the reaction that are consistent with the expected editing intermediates (5Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Leishmania tarentolae mitochondrial extracts support gRNA-directed U-insertions into the first editing site of ND7 mRNA, but the guiding of insertions into a cytochrome b transcript could likewise not be demonstrated with this system (6Byrne E.M. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is true, even though the cytochrome b mRNA isolated from theL. tarentolae mitochondria used to prepare the editing extracts is mostly edited (7Feagin J.E. Shaw J.M. Simpson L. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b mRNA is one of two known L. tarentolae pre-edited mRNAs that undergo in vitroU-additions independent of gRNA (8Connell G.J. Byrne E.M. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These insertions do not create a functional coding sequence, and their relevance to the gRNA-directed reaction remains unclear. Intermediates produced during the gRNA-independent reaction, however, are consistent with the cleavage/U-insertion/ligation mechanism proposed for the directed reaction (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 34-nucleotide untranslated A-U sequence element located immediately upstream of the cytochrome b editing sites was found to be necessary for the gRNA-independent U-insertions, and the majority of these U-insertions occur immediately 5′ and 3′ of the A-U sequence. The A-U element itself is sufficient to induce U-insertions when placed within an unedited mammalian transcript. This element was found to match a sequence within cytochrome b gRNA I at 20 out of 22 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The similarity in the two sequences suggested that it could also be involved in gRNA-directed editing, perhaps acting as a binding site for editing components (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the lack of an in vitro system supporting gRNA-directed editing of cytochrome b made it difficult to assess its significance. In this paper we describe an in vitro system that catalyzes gRNA-directed insertions into a cytochrome b mRNA transcript; accurate editing was confirmed by sequencing. Mutation of the A-U sequence on the gRNA stimulates gRNA-directed in vitro editing of the cytochrome b mRNA, whereas deletion of the corresponding mRNA A-U sequence significantly increases the fidelity of the guided reaction. In addition, mutations to the A-U sequence result in the loss of binding to at least one component of the editing extract, and results are suggestive that the A-U sequence also interacts with the editing machinery in vivo. A 500-ml culture ofL. tarentolae (UC strain) was grown to an approximate density of 5 × 107 cells/ml in BHI medium (Difco) supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin. The culture was then diluted 3-fold in fresh media and grown to a density of 1.6 ± 0.2 × 108 cells/ml, at which point the cells were harvested and mitochondria prepared as described previously (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were resuspended in 950 μl of solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and either 10% glycerol or 10 mg/ml BSA) for every 500 ml of starting culture. The resuspended mitochondria were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and stored frozen at −80 °C. Extracts stored in BSA were used without further fractionation in the editing assays. The protein concentration of the extract, prior to the addition of BSA, was approximately 2 μg/μl; protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid-based method (Pierce). The glycerol-containing extract was thawed on ice, and either it was loaded onto a 10–40% sucrose gradient as described (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or a 500-μl aliquot was fractionated on a 1-ml Q Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Q Sepharose column was equilibrated at 4 °C with Buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 100 mm KCl. After loading the mitochondrial extract, the column was washed for four column volumes with Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl at which point the column was eluted with a continuous 100–300 mm KCl gradient in buffer A. The column flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and 500-μl fractions were collected. The protein concentration of the fractions was determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) and the KCl concentration determined with a conductivity meter. With the exception of fractions used for gel shift assays, BSA was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to each of the collected 0.5-ml sucrose gradient or Q Sepharose fractions, and the fractions were concentrated 2–5-fold using Microcon 10,000 molecular weight cut-off microconcentrators (Millipore). The concentrated Q Sepharose fractions were diluted with Buffer A and re-concentrated to reduce the KCl concentration. T7 RNA polymerase was used to directly transcribe the cytochrome b gRNAs from the oligodeoxynucleotides listed below (10Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The cytochrome bmRNA transcripts were transcribed from PCR products amplified from plasmid pM1. This plasmid, which encodes the four point mutations within the gRNA binding site (Fig. 1 B), was constructed using a PCR overlap extension technique (11Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). A cloned maxicircle fragment encoding cytochrome b mRNA was used as a template. The overlapping mutagenic primers were forward primer 14772 and reverse primer 14683, and the two external primers were 8494 and 9473. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The PCR templates for the mRNA transcripts were then amplified from pM1 using either forward primer 5692 (wild-type A-U sequence) or 10210 (A-U deletion). The reverse primer 5691 was used for both reactions. This primer results in a 27-nucleotide tag at the 3′ end of these transcripts, facilitating their discrimination from endogenous cytochrome b mRNA. The transcript containing the mRNA A-U sequence used for both the gel-shift assay and the attempt to stimulate gRNA-independent U-insertions in transwas transcribed directly from oligodeoxynucleotide 10899. The gRNA-directed reaction conditions are a modification of a previous procedure (6Byrne E.M. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A mRNA transcript (1 pmol) and 5 pmol of a gRNA in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, were heated in a 10 μl volume at 65 °C for 3 min. The RNAs were added to 25 μl of editing buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 6 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm UTP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated at 27 °C for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 15 μl of the mitochondrial extract and incubated at 27 °C for 1 h. The addition of EDTA, pH 8.0, to 20 mm, SDS to 0.5%, and proteinase K to 200 μg/ml terminated the reactions. After an additional 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The gRNA-directed U-insertions were detected with a primer extension assay. cDNA was synthesized from the extract-treated transcripts using primer 5693, which is complementary to the 3′ tag sequence. The cDNA was ethanol-precipitated and half of it amplified by single-stranded PCR using either 32P-end-labeled 5692 or32P-end-labeled 10210. Within any given set of reactions, the same primer was always used. These primers are sense to sequences upstream of the editing site, which prevents the amplification of gRNA-mRNA chimeras that also form during editing. Both pre-edited and edited transcripts are amplified equivalently. The single-stranded PCR products were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide weight ratio of 19:1), 8 m urea gel and eluted at 37 °C for at least 12 h. After ethanol precipitation, the PCR product was re-suspended in 7 μl of distilled H2O and 1 μl was used for scintillation counting This permitted the amount of template to be quantified and equal amounts of template to be added to each reaction within a panel of extensions. The PCR template was heated at 65 °C for 5 min with 10 pmol of oligodeoxynucleotide 14955 and placed at 37 °C. The extension reactions were at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl volume and contained the annealed template, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3 μm dATP, 62.5 μm each ddGTP, ddCTP, ddTTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, and 1 unit of T7 polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The extension of oligodeoxynucleotide 666615, which encodes 3 T nucleotides at the first cytochrome b editing site was used to generate the +3 marker. Reactions were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel. Editing efficiency was estimated by comparing the intensity of the signal obtained from the extension of known quantities of template derived from extract-treated RNA with that obtained from the extension of 666615. All quantitation was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Enrichment for sequencing of mRNA transcripts containing gRNA-directed U-insertions required that the wild-type cytochromeb mRNA transcript be circularized; this prevented the endogenous terminal uridylyltransferase activity from adding uridines to the 3′ end of the molecule. By using 4-thio-UTP in place of UTP in the editing reaction, RNAs containing insertions at editing sites could then be enriched by partitioning through an organomercury matrix (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis of the enriched RNA was primed with oligodeoxynucleotide 7534, and the cDNA was amplified with 7534 and oligodeoxynucleotide 190703. Oligodeoxynucleotide 190703 contains a T at its 3′ end that overlaps the first editing site; this further favored the amplification of edited molecules, as the T would be mismatched when 190703 is annealed to cDNA derived from unedited transcripts. PCR conditions were chosen so as to minimize the amplification of a product derived from mismatched 190703; the dNTP concentration was reduced to 4 μm, and the total MgCl2 concentration reduced to 0.35 mm. The mRNAs and assay for the gRNA-independent U-insertions has been described previously (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Gel-shift assays were a modification of a previous procedure (12Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For the competition assays, 8 pmol of radiolabeled RNA 10899 and, where indicated, the unlabeled competitor RNA were added simultaneously to the binding reaction. Binding reactions were performed with the peak sucrose gradient fraction or fractions from a Q Sepharose column. The reactions were analyzed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 80:1) gel. Mitochondrial DNA and RNA were isolated as described previously (13Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Simpson L. Simpson A.G. Cell. 1978; 14: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide 7276 or oligodeoxynucleotide 21700 was used to prime the synthesis of cytochrome b cDNA from total mitochondrial RNA and oligodeoxynucleotide 1115005 was used to prime the synthesis of the ND7 cDNA. After gel purification of the cDNA, a poly(dA) extension was added to the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNA was PCR-amplified using forward primer 13780 and one of the following reverse primers: oligodeoxynucleotide 13781 for cDNA synthesized with 7276, oligodeoxynucleotide 21701 for cDNA made with 21700, and oligodeoxynucleotide 1115004 for the ND7 cDNA. All PCR products were cloned into pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene) for sequencing. Six clones derived from cDNA made with oligodeoxynucleotide 7276 were sequenced in entirety, while the other clones were sequenced by T-tracking or 4-base sequencing of selected regions. The region on the L. tarentolae maxicircle encoding the 5′ end of the cytochrome b sequence was amplified from mitochondrial DNA with a forward primer (15277) complementary to the upstream gene, cytochrome oxidase III, and reverse primer 7276, which is complementary to sequence downstream of the cytochrome bediting sites. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript KS(+) for sequencing. The oligodeoxynucleotides shown below were used in this study.

A primer extension assay was used to detect in vitrogRNA-directed U-insertions occurring within the first editing site of a pre-edited cytochrome b transcript (Fig. 2 A). This 205-nucleotide transcript contains all 15 cytochrome bmRNA editing sites and has four point mutations within the gRNA binding site (Fig. 1B). These mutations inhibit endogenous cytochrome b gRNA from interacting with the transcript and also permit it to be distinguished from the endogenous cytochrome b mRNA. Compensatory changes were made to the cytochrome gRNAs so as to maintain base pairing with the mutated gRNA binding site of the mRNA transcripts. In addition, the number of A nucleotides guiding U-insertions into the first editing site was increased from 1 to 3 (Fig. 1 B). This number of U-insertions results in a primer extension signal that is well removed from a background signal, facilitating quantitation. For the primer extension analysis, a DNA primer complementary to sequence immediately downstream of the first editing site was annealed to a template derived from the extract-treated mRNA transcript (Fig. 2 A). Extensions are with a DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, and the reactions are terminated by the incorporation of ddG immediately after the first editing site (Fig. 2 A). A synthetic cytochrome b DNA template containing 3 T nucleotides in the position corresponding to the first editing site was used as a size marker in the extension reaction (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The primer annealed to the marker template is extended by the addition of 3 labeled dA nucleotides, corresponding to the number of insertions at the first editing site, and the terminating ddG (Fig. 2 B, labeled +3). The primer extension product resulting from the assay of the non-extract treated pre-edited RNA should not be radiolabeled, as there would be no template for the labeled dA additions. A background level of misincorporated additions to the primer does occur, however, independent of extract treatment (Fig. 2 B, lane 11). These misincorporations appear to result from a structural feature of the template as they are not seen with the shorter marker template (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The intensity of the artifact band is directly proportional to the amount of template put into the extension reactions (data not shown), and can be used to normalize the editing signal. Without addition of gRNA to the editing reaction, only the artifact primer extension bands are visible (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), consistent with previous results indicating that gRNA-independent insertions do not occur to a significant extent at the first editing site (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the presence of the gRNA, the +3 primer extension signal, consistent with correct in vitro editing, was present but weak (Fig.2 B, lane 3). The signal varied with different mitochondrial extract preparations, yet efforts at further optimizing the mitochondrial extract and reaction conditions failed to improve the signal enough to allow characterization of the reaction. The same extracts, however, consistently supported accurate editing of a ND7 mRNA at quantifiable levels (data not shown, and Ref. 6Byrne E.M. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the editing system itself was not fundamentally flawed. The cytochrome b gRNA I contains an A-U rich region with a 20 out of 22 nucleotide match to a sequence within the 5′-untranslated region of the cytochrome b mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Since we had previously demonstrated that the mRNA A-U sequence stimulates the gRNA-independent reaction (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the effect of the gRNA A-U sequence on the gRNA-dependent reaction was investigated. Three blocks of A nucleotides within the aligned region of the cytochrome b gRNA I were mutated to C nucleotides (Fig. 1 A). These A nucleotides normally function as guiding nucleotides for the 3rd, 5th, and 6th editing sites and as such do not base-pair with the pre-edited mRNA transcript. Mutation of any one of the A blocks on the gRNA increased U-insertion activity (Fig.2 B, lanes 4–10). The predominant +3 product is consistent with correct editing, but a ladder of extension products also occurs that is presumably derived from subpopulations of transcripts having different numbers of inserted U nucleotides. Incubation of radiolabeled mutated gRNAs with the mitochondrial extract under the assay conditions indicated that the mutations did not alter the stability of the RNA (data not shown). Likewise, native gel analysis indicated that differences in the annealing efficiency of the mutated gRNAs to the mRNA cannot solely account for the differences in the gRNA-directed reaction (data not shown). Mutation of all three A blocks together (Fig. 2 B,lane 10) or a double mutation of blocks 1 and 3 (Fig. 1 B, lane 8) had the greatest effect on editing. Assigning the triple block mutation as 100% activation of gRNA-dependent editing, the effect of single block mutations ranged from 21 ± 1% (n = 2) activation for the block 1 mutation alone to 50 ± 10% (n = 3) activation for the block 3 gRNA mutation (Fig.2 B, lanes 4–6). The editing activity of the block 1+2 double mutant was also 50 ± 10% (n = 3), while mutation of blocks 2+3 had 60 ± 10% (n = 3) of the activity of the triple mutant. Thus, whereas mutation of the A-U sequence on the mRNA inhibits the gRNA-independent reaction, mutation of the same sequence on the gRNA activates the gRNA-dependent reaction. In order to determine whether the U-insertions are gRNA-directed, several gRNAs containing the triple block mutation and a different number of guiding nucleotides for the first editing site were used in the editing reaction (Fig. 2 C). Each band of increasing size within the primer extension ladder contains increasing numbers of incorporated radiolabeled dA, and as a result the absolute intensity of each needs to be normalized for this increase in specific activity. However, even without the normalization, it is clear that changing the number of guiding nucleotides results in an increased intensity of the primer extension band consistent with correct editing. As the number of guiding nucleotides is increased from 2 to 5, there is a clear decrease in the corresponding editing signal. In addition, the band immediately above the signal consistent with correctly edited molecules is diminished relative to the rest of the ladder, as is especially evident for the gRNAs directing 4 and 5 U-insertions. The reason for these effects is not completely clear but could be related to the structure of the gRNA duplex being impacted as the number of guiding nucleotides is increased. To confirm that the cytochrome b transcript is correctly edited in a gRNA-directed manner, individual RNAs with U-insertions were cloned and sequenced. The in vitro gRNA-directed reaction occurs at a low level (<1% of the RNA population) making direct cloning and sequencing of the edited subpopulation a challenge. We previously demonstrated that 4-thiouridine can be incorporated by the mitochondrial extract into the cytochrome b mRNA (9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mercaptide formation between the 4-thiouridine and an organomercurial matrix facilitated the partitioning of the RNAs containing U-insertions. To clone and sequence individual molecules, the enriched RNA was reverse-transcribed and used as template for PCR. For this set of reactions, an oligodeoxynucleotide annealing just upstream of the first editing site and containing a single T at its 3′ end was used as the forward primer. Use of this primer further favored the amplification of those cDNAs derived from edited transcripts, as the primer would be mismatched when annealed to an unedited sequence. However, even with this selection the discrimination is not absolute, as unedited molecules are still amplified, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Of the 40 clones sequenced, 11 had 3 T-insertions at editing site 1, which is consistent with the number of insertions expected from the +3 gRNA used in the editing reaction. A sequence representative of these clones is shown in Fig. 2 D. This is the first demonstration of in vitro gRNA-directed editing of a cytochromeb mRNA. The remaining clones had 1 T insertion. These clones could have resulted either from the insertion of 1 U during the editing reaction or alternatively, from the extension of the mismatched forward primer when annealed to an unedited molecule. No clones were sequenced with 2 insertions, nor were any found with more than 3 as would have been expected from the primer extension ladder (Fig.2 B, lane 10). However, this bias could have resulted from thioUTP not being as good a substrate for the editing reaction as UTP and RNAs with fewer numbers of thiouridine insertions not binding as well to the organomercury matrix. 2G. Connell, unpublished results. As deletion or substitution of the mRNA A-U element inhibits the gRNA-independent reaction and mutation of the A-U element of the gRNA activates guiding, the significance of this mRNA sequence to the gRNA-directed reaction was also investigated. Deletion of the mRNA A-U element did not abolish the gRNA-directed U-insertions (Fig. 3 A). Rather, this deletion increased the accuracy of the gRNA-directed reaction relative to mRNA transcripts containing the A-U sequence by a factor of 1.7 ± 0.3 (n = 3; Fig.3 B). The increased fidelity suggests that the presence of the mRNA A-U sequence in some manner constrains or hinders the editing machinery. It also indicates that, unlike the gRNA-independent reaction, the A-U element on the mRNA is not essential for the directed insertions. Paradoxically, A to C substitution mutations within the mRNA A-U element are inhibitory to both reactions (Ref.9Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem"
