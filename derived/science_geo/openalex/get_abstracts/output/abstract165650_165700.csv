https://openalex.org/W1590661973,"Entangled quantum states are not separable, regardless of the spatial separation of their components. This is a manifestation of an aspect of quantum mechanics known as quantum non-locality. An important consequence of this is that the measurement of the state of one particle in a two-particle entangled state defines the state of the second particle instantaneously, whereas neither particle possesses its own well-defined state before the measurement. Experimental realizations of entanglement have hitherto been restricted to two-state quantum systems, involving, for example, the two orthogonal polarization states of photons. Here we demonstrate entanglement involving the spatial modes of the electromagnetic field carrying orbital angular momentum. As these modes can be used to define an infinitely dimensional discrete Hilbert space, this approach provides a practical route to entanglement that involves many orthogonal quantum states, rather than just two Multi-dimensional entangled states could be of considerable importance in the field of quantum information, enabling, for example, more efficient use of communication channels in quantum cryptography."

https://openalex.org/W2154841861,"RNAi is a gene-silencing phenomenon triggered by double-stranded (ds) RNA and involves the generation of 21 to 26 nt RNA segments that guide mRNA destruction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 encode small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) of 22 nt that regulate stage-specific development. Here we show that inactivation of genes related to RNAi pathway genes, a homolog of Drosophila Dicer (dcr-1), and two homologs of rde-1 (alg-1 and alg-2), cause heterochronic phenotypes similar to lin-4 and let-7 mutations. Further we show that dcr-1, alg-1, and alg-2 are necessary for the maturation and activity of the lin-4 and let-7 stRNAs. Our findings suggest that a common processing machinery generates guide RNAs that mediate both RNAi and endogenous gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1544636356,"We explored the dynamics of how a Bose-Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing the size and shape of the condensate is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the inter-atomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally-applied magnetic field yields a wealth of detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wave function, and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. These all have curious dependencies on time, the strength of the interaction, and the number of condensate atoms. Although ours would seem to be a simple well-characterized system, our measurements reveal many interesting phenomena that challenge theoretical models."
https://openalex.org/W1971201699,"We identify a novel meiotic recombination intermediate, the single-end invasion (SEI), which occurs during the transition from double-strand breaks (DSBs) to double-Holliday junction (dHJs). SEIs are products of strand exchange between one DSB end and its homolog. The structural asymmetry of SEIs indicates that the two ends of a DSB interact with the homolog in temporal succession, via structurally (and thus biochemically) distinct processes. SEIs arise surprisingly late in prophase, concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. These and other data imply that SEIs are preceded by nascent DSB-partner intermediates, which then undergo selective differentiation into crossover and noncrossover types, with SC formation and strand exchange as downstream consequences. Late occurrence of strand exchange provides opportunity to reverse recombinational fate even after homologs are coaligned and/or synapsed. This feature can explain crossover suppression between homeologous and structurally heterozygous chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1600427108,"The priming step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis is thought to require the formation of the SNARE complex, which comprises the proteins synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin. In solution syntaxin adopts a default, closed configuration that is incompatible with formation of the SNARE complex. Specifically, the amino terminus of syntaxin binds the SNARE motif and occludes interactions with the other SNARE proteins. The N terminus of syntaxin also binds the presynaptic protein UNC-13 (ref. 5). Studies in mouse, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that UNC-13 functions at a post-docking step of exocytosis, most likely during synaptic vesicle priming. Therefore, UNC-13 binding to the N terminus of syntaxin may promote the open configuration of syntaxin. To test this model, we engineered mutations into C. elegans syntaxin that cause the protein to adopt the open configuration constitutively. Here we demonstrate that the open form of syntaxin can bypass the requirement for UNC-13 in synaptic vesicle priming. Thus, it is likely that UNC-13 primes synaptic vesicles for fusion by promoting the open configuration of syntaxin."
https://openalex.org/W2145009672,"The mitotic checkpoint acts to inhibit entry into anaphase until all chromosomes have successfully attached to spindle microtubules. Unattached kinetochores are believed to release an activated form of Mad2 that inhibits APC/C-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of components needed for anaphase onset. Using Xenopus egg extracts, a vertebrate homolog of yeast Mps1p is shown here to be a kinetochore-associated kinase, whose activity is necessary to establish and maintain the checkpoint. Since high levels of Mad2 overcome checkpoint loss in Mps1-depleted extracts, Mps1 acts upstream of Mad2-mediated inhibition of APC/C. Mps1 is essential for the checkpoint because it is required for recruitment and retention of active CENP-E at kinetochores, which in turn is necessary for kinetochore association of Mad1 and Mad2."

https://openalex.org/W1655394326,"Clustering of organisms can be a consequence of social behaviour, or of the response of individuals to chemical and physical cues. Environmental variability can also cause clustering: for example, marine turbulence transports plankton and produces chlorophyll concentration patterns in the upper ocean. Even in a homogeneous environment, nonlinear interactions between species can result in spontaneous pattern formation. Here we show that a population of independent, random-walking organisms ('brownian bugs'), reproducing by binary division and dying at constant rates, spontaneously aggregates. Using an individual-based model, we show that clusters form out of spatially homogeneous initial conditions without environmental variability, predator-prey interactions, kinesis or taxis. The clustering mechanism is reproductively driven-birth must always be adjacent to a living organism. This clustering can overwhelm diffusion and create non-poissonian correlations between pairs (parent and offspring) or organisms, leading to the emergence of patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1964318658,"Drosophila bicoid mRNA is synthesized in the nurse cells and transported to the oocyte where microtubules and Exuperantia protein mediate localization to the anterior pole. Fluorescent bicoid mRNA injected into the oocyte displays nonpolar microtubule-dependent transport to the closest cortical surface, and the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton lacks clear axial asymmetry. Nonetheless, bicoid mRNA injected into the nurse cell cytoplasm, withdrawn, and injected into a second oocyte shows microtubule-dependent transport to the anterior cortex. Nurse cells require microtubules and Exuperantia to support anterior transport of bicoid mRNA, and microtubules are required for bicoid mRNA-Exuperantia particle coassembly. We propose that microtubule-dependent Exuperantia-bicoid mRNA complex formation in the nurse cell cytoplasm allows anterior-specific transport on a grossly nonpolar oocyte microtubule network."

https://openalex.org/W2094636364,"The X-ray structure of a ternary complex of Negative Cofactor 2 (NC2), the TATA box binding protein (TBP), and DNA has been determined at 2.6 A resolution. The N termini of NC2 alpha and beta resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively, and form a heterodimer that binds to the bent DNA double helix on the underside of the preformed TBP-DNA complex via electrostatic interactions. NC2beta contributes to inhibition of TATA-dependent transcription through interactions of its C-terminal alpha helix with a conserved hydrophobic feature on the upper surface of TBP, which in turn positions the penultimate alpha helix of NC2beta to block recognition of the TBP-DNA complex by transcription factor IIB. Further regulatory implications of the NC2 heterodimer structure are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2059928250,"Molybdopterin (MPT) is a pyranopterin with a unique dithiolene group coordinating molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W) in all Mo- and W-enzymes except nitrogenase. In Escherichia coli, MPT is formed by incorporation of two sulfur atoms into precursor Z, which is catalyzed by MPT synthase. The recently solved crystal structure of MPT synthase (Rudolph, M. J., Wuebbens, M. M., Rajagopalan, K. V., and Schindelin, H. (2000)Nat. Struct. Biol. 8, 42–46) shows the heterotetrameric nature of the enzyme that is composed of two small (MoaD) and two large subunits (MoaE). According to sequence and structural similarities among MoaD, ubiquitin, and ThiS, a thiocarboxylation of the C terminus of MoaD is proposed that would serve as the source of sulfur that is transferred to precursor Z. Here, we describe the in vitrogeneration of carboxylated and thiocarboxylated MoaD. Both forms of MoaD are monomeric and are able to form a heterotetrameric complex after coincubation in equimolar ratios with MoaE. Only the thiocarboxylated MPT synthase complex was found to be able to convert precursor Z in vitro to MPT. Slight but significant differences between the carboxylated and the thiocarboxylated MPT synthase can be seen using size exclusion chromatography. A two-step reaction of MPT synthesis is proposed where the dithiolene is generated by two thiocarboxylates derived from a single tetrameric MPT synthase.

Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Mo-enzymes are important for such diverse metabolic processes like sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals (2Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar), nitrate assimilation in autotrophs, and phytohormone synthesis in plants (2Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar). With the exception of nitrogenase, in all Mo-enzymes studied so far, Mo is activated and chelated by the so-called molybdenum cofactor (Moco).1 In general, Moco consists of Mo covalently bound via a dithiolene group to the unique pterin compound molybdopterin (MPT) (3Kramer S.P. Johnson J.L. Ribeiro A.A. Millington D.S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a tetrahydropyranopterin (4Kisker C. Schindelin H.

Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, Eubacteria, and Archaebacteria. The basic structure of Moco shows further modifications like the attachment of nucleotide monophosphates to the terminal phosphate of MPT and the coordination of molybdenum by two pterins in prokaryotes, or variations in the number and nature of the substituents in the first coordination sphere of the metal. In addition, the same pterin compound was found to coordinate tungsten (W) in W-enzymes (5Kletzin A. Adams M.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 5-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McMaster J. Enemark J.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of Moco requires the multistep synthesis of the MPT moiety followed by the subsequent transfer of molybdenum (2Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar, 7Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; 203: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutational block in Moco biosynthesis leads to the combined loss of function of all Mo-enzymes. In humans, Moco deficiency as a rare inborn error is characterized by the loss of activity of sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase. Affected patients die early postnatally because no therapy is yet available (9Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Wadman S.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Genes encoding for Moco biosynthesis proteins have been identified in bacteria (10Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar), fungi (11Unkles S.E. Smith J. Kanan G.J. Millar L.J. Heck I.S. Boxer D.H. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6100-6107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the proposed starting compound GTP is first converted to the sulfur-free precursor Z (18Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second step, two sulfur atoms are incorporated into the precursor Z thereby forming MPT as structural moiety of the cofactor. In Escherichia coli, three gene products are essential for the synthesis of MPT from precursor Z. MoaD (small subunit) and MoaE (large subunit) form the MPT synthase (20Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that stoichiometrically converts precursor Z to MPT (21Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MPT synthase is activated (sulfurated) by MoeB (MPT synthase sulfurase). Pitterle et al. (22Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that it is the small subunit of MPT synthase that carries the sulfur because a 16-Da difference was observed in the molecular mass between MoaD derived from active MPT synthase and MoaD derived from inactive MPT synthase purified from E. coli moeB mutants. This difference was interpreted to be a MoeB-catalyzed replacement of an OH group for an SH group. Recently the high resolution crystal structure of E. coli MPT synthase has been determined demonstrating the heterotetrameric nature of the enzyme (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Heterodimers are formed between the small and large subunits that dimerize via the large subunits to form the functional heterotetramer. Sequence homologies of the small subunit MoaD to ubiquitin and of the sulfurase MoeB to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UbA1 from Saccharomyces cereviseae (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 25McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) suggested a functional role of the highly conserved C terminus of MoaD containing a double glycine motif (10Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). Furthermore, MoaD shows a three-dimensional fold very similar to ubiquitin, which interacts via its C terminus with MoaE thereby forming two distinct hypothetical active sites in the heterotetramer. (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, partially inactive MPT synthase shows a covalent linkage between the C terminus of MoaD and a lysine residue of MoaE. Therefore, it has been proposed that MoaD is thiocarboxylated, which serves as the sulfur donor for the synthesis of the dithiolene in MPT. For ThiS, a protein involved in thiamin biosynthesis in E. coli (26Begley T.P. Xi J. Kinsland C. Taylor S. McLafferty F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that shows striking homologies to MoaD and ubiquitin, the formation of a thiocarboxylate at the C-terminal glycine residue was demonstrated (27Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This glycine was shown to be essential for the transfer of a single sulfur atom in thiamin biosynthesis. MPT synthases identified in fungi (12Unkles S.E. Heck I.S. Appleyard M.V. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), plants 2R. R. Mendel, unpublished results. 2R. R. Mendel, unpublished results. and humans (15Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) show the same high degree of conservation in the C terminus with the typical double glycine motif. MOCS2A and MOCS2B are the human homologs for MoaD and MoaE (16Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The observed bicistronic expression of MOCS2A and MOCS2B (15Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) indicates the functional pressure for maintaining the free C terminus in MOCS2A. Here we present direct functional evidence that the C-terminal glycine residue of MPT synthase carries the sulfur that is transferred to precursor Z. Using an intein-based expression system, we generated preparative amounts of thiocarboxylated MoaD and show that this thiocarboxylate is essential and sufficient for the assembly of active MPT synthase. The two subunits of MPT synthase are monomeric when they are expressed and purified separately. Both the thiocarboxylated and the carboxylated form of MoaD are able to assemble a heterotetrameric MPT synthase complex. Finally, a two-step reaction for the synthesis of the dithiolene group in MPT is proposed. All chemicals used were from the highest grade available. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and the DNA polymerase from Peqlab. The E. coli strain ER2566, plasmid pTYB2 and the chitin matrix were obtained from New England Biolabs. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow matrix, plasmids pQE30 and pQE60 as well as the E. coli M15 strain were purchased from Qiagen. E. coli MPT synthase was cloned into pQE60 (NcoI/BglII) by amplifying moaD and moaE from pJR11 plasmid (28Reiss J. Kleinhofs A. Klingmuller W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) resulting in pGS100 for expression of MoaE with a C-terminal His tag (polymerase chain reaction deletion of the stop codon) or resulting in pGS101 for expression of unmodified MoaE. Both constructs were bicistronic expression vectors allowing the isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside-induced recombinant expression of MoaD and MoaE in E. coli. A plasmid expressing exclusively MoaE as His-tagged protein (pGG110) was generated in the same way as described above. For recombinant expression of the small subunit as an intein fusion protein, E. coli moaD was polymerase chain reaction-cloned into pTYB2 (NdeI/SmaI) yielding pGG130. His-tagged proteins were recombinantly expressed and purified according to the QIA-expressionist manual (Qiagen). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and pure protein fractions were subsequently rebuffered into nit-1 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) using Nick columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identity of the purified proteins was verified by N-terminal sequencing. For determination of protein concentrations the following calculated molar extinction coefficients were used: εMoaD = 5,690 m−1cm−1, εMoaE = 16,620m−1 cm−1. The expression vector pGG130 was transformed into E. coli strain ER2566, and grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. Expression was induced at A600 = 0.5 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside and growth was continued for 15 h at 18 °C. For protein purification, the manual of the IMPACT expression system (New England Biolabs) was followed. Elution of carboxylated or thiocarboxylated protein was induced by using a cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing either 30 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) or 30 mm ammonium sulfide (27Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), respectively. The cleavage reaction was performed at 4 °C for at least 24 h. Eluted proteins were checked using 14% tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) for purity and rebuffered on Nick columns into nit-1 buffer. Mass spectra were generated by a reflectron-type time-of-flight matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer from PerSeptive (Voyager DE-RP), equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Flight times are calibrated against protein standards using exactly the same parameters. Matrix samples are prepared (co-crystallized) from a saturated methanolic solution of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 9 × 10−5to 1 × 10−4 m analyte solution using 1 μl per spot of each component. Mass spectra were typically accumulated over 20–50 consecutive laser pulses. For functional complementation of Moco mutants, E. coli moaE mutants RK5216 and RK5204 were used (30Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Moco biosynthesis was performed by transformation of pGS100 and pGG110, followed by uninduced or induced expression of the encoded proteins, and determination of nitrate reductase activity by colony overlay assay (31Glaser J.H. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature on a Sephadex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in nit-1 buffer, and separation was run at a 0.3 ml/min flow rate. Samples of 200 μl (0.5–8 μmprotein) were loaded and 0.3-ml fractions were collected. Small and large subunits were coincubated in molar ratios ranging from 1:4 to 4:1 for a 5 min prior separation. Where indicated, standard deviations of retention times were calculated from 5–7 independent experiments. Neurospora crassa nit-1 extract was prepared as described (32Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. All reconstitutions were performed in nit-1 buffer (100-μl reaction volume) containing 50 μl of nit-1 crude extract in the presence of 4 mm reduced glutathione and 10 mm sodium molybdate. Where indicated, precursor Z was removed from the nit-1 crude extract by gel filtration on Nick columns. Complementation was carried out anaerobically for two hours at room temperature. After addition of 20 mm NADPH for 10 min, reconstituted NADPH-nitrate reductase activity was determined as described (32Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl.

MPT was detected and quantified by HPLC analysis of form A-dephospho (33Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of the entire reaction mixture (100 μl), dephosphorylation, QAE chromatography, and reversed-phased HPLC analysis were performed as described (34Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The large subunit of MPT synthase, MoaE, as well as MPT synthase were expressed and purified as His-tagged proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). The activity of the expressed proteins was proven by functional complementation ofE. coli moaD and moaE mutants (data not shown). In E. coli MoeB has been proposed to activate MoaD by forming a thiocarboxylate at the C-terminal glycine residue. To simulate the predicted reaction, MoaD was expressed as an intein fusion protein by cloning moaD in the pTYB2 vector allowing expression of the small subunit with a C-terminal intein tag and a chitin binding domain for affinity purification. The intein catalyzed self-cleavage reaction results in an N-S acyl shift at the target junction followed by transesterification of the resulting thioester with a cleavage reagent (Fig.1A). For elution of MoaD we used two different chemicals for cleavage reaction (Fig.1A). DTT results in the cleavage of a carboxylated unmodified protein while ammonium sulfide generates a thiocarboxylated cleavage product that was previously demonstrated for ThiS (27Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis of both cleavage products by mass spectrometry proved this system to work correctly for MoaD (Fig. 1C). MoaD eluted with DTT showed a mass peak of 8757.7 Da while MoaD eluted with ammonium sulfide was 16.3 Da larger, indicating the exchange of an oxygen atom to a sulfur atom. The 0.2-Da difference of the theoretical and experimentally measured masses can be neglected. Hence after cleavage the primary structures of the small subunits were identical to native MoaD carrying the C-terminal double glycine motif. They only differed in the modification of the C terminus. MoaD was purified from 1 liter of E. coli culture resulting in 6 mg of carboxylated and 2 mg of thiocarboxylated protein (Fig. 1B; lanes 2 and 3), respectively. E. coli MPT synthase was recombinantly expressed and purified using a His-tagged fusion at MoaE. The expressed protein was fully active, and after affinity purification of MoaE also the small subunit MoaD was copurified (data not shown). Therefore, the interaction between both subunits of MPT synthase seems to be of high affinity. We studied the assembly of E. coli MPT synthase from its subunits using analytical size exclusion chromatography. The large subunit MoaE, separately purified as His-tagged protein (Fig.1B, lane 1), eluted at 16.00 ± 0.02 ml, whereas the carboxylated and thiocarboxylated small subunits (MoaD) showed similar chromatograms with a single peak at 17.35 ± 0.06 ml elution volume (Fig. 2, Aand B, inset). According to the elution volumes of standard proteins, the experimentally determined molecular masses of MoaD and MoaE are 6.9 and 16.5 kDa, respectively. Because the theoretical molecular masses of MoaD and MoaE are 8.8 and 18.8 kDa, respectively, we conclude that both subunits of MPT synthase are monomers in solution (Fig. 2D). Coincubation of MoaE with carboxylated or thiocarboxylated MoaD in equimolar amounts resulted in the formation of protein complexes eluting between 14 and 15 ml (Fig.2, A–C, bold lines), while the peaks of the separated subunits simultaneously disappeared, demonstrating the formation of a heteromultimer. Prior to size exclusion chromatography, both subunits were coincubated for 5 min. Longer incubation times did not increase the amount of tetramers formed (data not shown) suggesting a rapid and high affinity interaction between MoaD and MoaE. Furthermore, mixtures of MoaD and MoaE in submolar ratios resulted in the fomation of a tetrameric complex and the appearance of one unbound monomeric subunit that was provided in excess (Fig. 2, A andB, thin and dashed lines) illustrating the high affinity of interaction and conformational behavior of unbound monomers. Comparison of the elution profiles of MPT synthase complexes formed either with a carboxylated (Fig. 2A) or a thiocarboxylated small subunit (Fig. 2B), revealed a significant shift of 0.19 ml in the elution volume between both forms (Fig. 2C). While thiocarboxylated MPT synthase eluted at 14.45 ± 0.03 ml, the carboxylated form eluted at 14.64 ± 0.02 ml, corresponding to molecular masses of 52.8 and 46.1 kDa, respectively. The determined molecular weights give rise to the conclusion that both carboxylated and thiocarboxylated MoaD are able to form a heterotetrameric complex (53.6 kDa) with MoaE. In addition, purified active MPT synthase (Fig.2C, control) eluted at 14.49 ± 0.02 ml from the column (Fig. 2C), which is identical to the elution volume of the MPT synthase complex formed by MoaE and thiocarboxylated MoaD. Based on these findings one can argue that the nature of the C terminus of MoaD influences the overall shape of the heterotetramer resulting in a different Stokes radius. Slight conformational changes or different hydrations near the active site might result in the observed different retention times on size exclusion chromatography between the thiocarboxylated and carboxylated form. However, different interaction of both MPT synthase forms with the gel filtration matrix are rather unlikely because in the crystal structure of MPT synthase the C terminus of MoaD is not exposed to the surface of the molecule (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and size exclusion chromatography was performed in the presence of 250 mm salt. Because the elution profiles of activein vivo-assembled and -purified MPT synthase as well asin vitro assembled MPT synthase with thiocarboxylated small subunits were identical and close to the theoretical molecular weight, we conclude that both enzymes have similar conformations. To analyze if the in vitro assembled MPT synthase complexes are active, in vitro synthesis of MPT was shown in two ways: 1) by using the nit-1 reconstitution assay and 2) by using purified precursor Z and demonstrating MPT formation by HPLC form A analysis. The N. crassa mutant nit-1 is defective in the second step of Moco biosynthesis and accumulates precursor Z that can be converted to MPT by MPT synthase, which is exogenously added to the crude nit-1 protein extract (20Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm molybdate, the resulting MPT is non-catalytically converted to Moco that reconstitutes N. crassa apo-nitrate reductase (20Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bicistronically expressed and purified E. coli MPT synthase (data not shown) was capable of forming MPT and showed an activity of 8.4 units/pmol of purified protein (Fig.3A, control). MPT synthase that was assembled from separately expressed and purified MoaE and thiocarboxylated MoaD subunits exhibited an even higher activity in MPT synthesis (Fig. 3A, 12.3 units/pmol of protein). In contrast, MPT synthase containing carboxylated MoaD was not active under the same conditions. Only when using 1000 times higher concentrations of carboxylated MPT synthase, a low activity was observed that might be due to an activation of the enzyme within the nit-1 crude extract by a MoeB-like sulfurase. Interestingly, the addition of free small subunit (MoaD) in its thiocarboxylated form in concentrations 100 times higher than the active enzyme, resulted also in the formation of MPT, suggesting that MoaD forms a chimeric complex with the endogenous large subunit of nit-1 MPT synthase or that MoaD has an activity by its own, which however is rather unlikely. In addition, like carboxylated MPT synthase also carboxylated MoaD alone exhibited nit-1 activities when used in high concentrations, supporting the possibility that a weak sulfuration of the small subunits takes place within the nit-1 crude extract. MoaE alone never showed any activity in the nit-1 assay, suggesting a lesion of the MoaD-homologous protein in the nit-1 mutant. Finally, no activity was observed with all MPT synthases when the protein fraction of the nit-1 extract (gel filtrated) was used or when molybdate was depleted from the reaction mixture (data not shown). To further analyze the activity of reassembled thiocarboxylated MPT synthase, the conversion of precursor Z to MPT was demonstrated using a fully defined system containing either MPT synthase, thiocarboxylated MoaD, or no protein (control) and purified precursor Z. When 55 pmol of reassembled MPT synthase was coincubated with an excess of purified precursor Z (1.84 nmol) the formation of 10.4 pmol of MPT (Fig.3B, middle chromatogram; form A) could be shown, while in the absence of any protein (Fig. 3B,control) no form A was detectable. However, the low but significantly detectable MPT synthesis by the thiocarboxylated small subunit itself in the nit-1 reconstitution assay was not found when using this fully defined in vitro system (Fig.3B, lower chromatogram) where 55 pmol of thiocarboxylated MoaD (MoaD-SH) was not sufficient to generate any detectable amounts of MPT. MoaD and small subunits of MPT synthases from other organisms (12Unkles S.E. Heck I.S. Appleyard M.V. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,15Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) show homologies to ubiquitin (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) and ThiS (26Begley T.P. Xi J. Kinsland C. Taylor S. McLafferty F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), proteins with similar small size and a highly conserved double glycine motif at the C terminus. It was shown that ThiS in the thiamin biosynthetic pathway inE. coli (35Begley T.P. Downs D.M. Ealick S.E. McLafferty F.W. Van Loon A.P. Taylor S. Campobasso N. Chiu H.J. Kinsland C. Reddick J.J. Xi J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) contains a thiocarboxylate at the C terminus that is the source of the incorporated sulfur (26Begley T.P. Xi J. Kinsland C. Taylor S. McLafferty F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Comparing thiamin biosynthesis with Moco biosynthesis, parallels in sulfur transfer and activation can be seen. However, in contrast to ThiS, the small subunit of MPT synthase needs to interact with the large subunit before gaining its activity. For synthesis of the dithiolene group in MPT two sulfur atoms must be incorporated, while in the thiamin pathway only one sulfur per reaction is needed. Further evidence for the functional importance of the C-terminal glycine residue of the small subunit is the finding that in humans both subunits of MPT synthase are expressed by a single bicistronic mRNA (15Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 698-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which allows the coexpression of both subunits and maintains the free C terminus of the small subunit. Our experiments to synthesize MPT with in vitro assembled MPT synthases demonstrate that the C-terminal glycine residue of the small subunit carries the sulfur that is incorporated into MPT. Furthermore, we show that the in vitro formation of a thiocarboxylated subunit and its subsequent assembly with the large subunit generates active MPT synthase. Based on these data and the conservation of MPT synthases among the phyli we propose that also the reaction catalyzed by MPT synthase and its substrate precursor Z are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Another line of evidence for the functional importance of the thiocarboxylate of the small subunit comes from size exclusion chromatography experiments where different retention times were observed for active and inactive MPT synthase indicating slight but significant conformational differences between thiocarboxylated and carboxylated MPT synthase. Both kinds of subunits induce the formation of a heterotetrameric MPT synthase whereas the separated subunits (MoaD and MoaE) behaved clearly as monomers under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, the crystal structure of MPT synthase (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) shows that heterotetramer formation is exclusively mediated by the dimerization of MoaE, while the small subunits have no contact to each other; rather they bind to the large subunits thereby forming two independent active sites. However, the dimerization of MoaE seems to be MoaD-dependent because we have found MoaE monomers only in the absence of MoaD suggesting that the large subunit MoaE undergoes large conformational changes during the binding of MoaD resulting in the heterotetramer formation. In the crystal structure of MPT synthase (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) a ∼50% active enzyme (50% thiocarboxylated) was analyzed showing a region of high mobility between residues 39 and 45 that are disordered in MoaE. These residues are not in direct contact with the C terminus of MoaD but they are in close proximity. In addition, it is important to note that the terminal glycine Gly-81 of MoaD is forming a strong salt bridge to Glu-126 of MoaE, which is altered after formation of an artificial covalent complex between MoaD and MoaE (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore it might be reasonable to argue that thiocarboxylation of MoaD influences the conformation of the active site within the MPT synthase complex, a phenomenon that might be reflected by our size exclusion chromatography results. The main advantage for the cell to possess a MPT synthase complex would be the donation of two sulfur atoms by a single heterotetrameric complex with two independent active sites harboring two reactive sulfurs as thiocarboxylates. Assuming that both sulfur atoms in MPT originate from the two small subunits within the heterotetrameric MPT synthase we present the following model for the reaction mechanism of MPT synthase (Fig. 4). A two-step reaction with the formation of a hypothetical intermediate (precursor G) carrying one sulfur atom as a thione is proposed. First, the carboxyl group of the C2 atom in the side chain of precursor Z is protonated followed by a nucleophilic attack of the sulfur from the first thiocarboxylate of MPT synthase. After carboxylation of the small subunit and formation of a thione, precursor G is released. Carboxylation of the first small subunit results in a conformational change of the MPT synthase heterodimer (Fig. 4, shaded), as observed in this study for the fully carboxylated enzyme. The conformational change of the first dimer would result in an induced fit of the second heterodimer (Fig. 4, gray) generating an active site with an increased affinity for the intermediate and a decreased affinity for precursor Z as compared with the starting enzyme. According to this model an equimolar ratio exists between high affinity binding sites and the intermediate allowing a rapid processing of the intermediate without any detectable accumulation of precursor G. In the second half-reaction, the oxygen atom of the cyclic phosphate could be protonated followed by nucleophilic attack of the thiocarboxylate from the second small subunit. The phosphate ring is opened, and a thioester bond is formed. For carboxylation of the second small subunit a water molecule is needed. Finally MPT is released and a fully carboxylated MPT synthase is formed that can be recharged by the sulfurase. The data presented here confirmed the postulated thiocarboxylation of the small subunit of MPT synthase. Thiocarboxylation seems to be an evolutionary old feature for sulfur mobilization and activation to perform complex C–S bond chemistry. Our proposed model for the reaction mechanism of MPT synthesis provides a first hint to explain how the dithiolene is formed by a single MPT synthase with two active sites. We thank H.

Bourne G.H. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Bone. I. Academic Press, New York1972: 127-189Google Scholar). The protein is very abundant as it comprises about 15% of the total noncollagenous proteins in bone. After cleavage of the signal peptide sequence the polypeptide chain of human BSP contains 301 amino acids. According to the cDNA sequence the molecular mass of the core protein is 33.6 kDa (2Fisher L.W. McBride O.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2347-2351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, after separation on SDS-PAGE the protein could be identified as an 80-kDa band (3Franzén A. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Fisher L.W. Hawkins G.R. Tuross N. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for these different sizes is most likely the high content of post-translational modifications, where carbohydrates were shown to contribute about 50% to the mass of the protein (5Fisher L.W. Whiston S.W. Avioli L.V. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12723-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of the carbohydrates on human BSP has not been described. Additionally the protein was shown to be sulfated and phosphorylated (6Midura R.J. McQuillan D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ek-Rylander B. Flores M. Wendel M. Heinegård D. Andersson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14853-14856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Close to the C terminus the molecule contains an RGD cell-binding motif that enables the protein to bind integrin αvβ3 (8Oldberg A. Franzén A. Heinegård D. Pierschbacher M. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19433-19436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are three tyrosine-rich regions and two clusters rich in glutamic acids (9Oldberg A. Franzén A. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19430-19432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bone sialoprotein is expressed by most cell types in bone, cartilage, and teeth. In the mineralized bone matrix the highest BSP concentrations were found in areas where bone is newly synthesized or remodeled (10Hultenby K. Reinholt F.P. Norgard M. Oldberg A. Wendel M. Heinegård D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 230-239PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ingram R.T. Clarke B.L. Fisher L.W. Fitzpatrick L.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Outside of the skeleton the protein was found in placental trophoblasts (12Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 49: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and in platelets (13Chenu C. Delmas P.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, BSP is expressed in certain carcinomas that predominantly metastasize to bone,i.e. breast, prostate, lung, thyroid tumors, as well as multiple myeloma and neuroblastoma. Bone metastases of breast and prostate cancer patients expressed significantly more BSP than visceral metastases (14Waltregny D. Bellahcène A. de Leval X. Florkin B. Weidle U. Castronovo V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 834-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The function of BSP in bone and cartilage is still not fully understood. Using the RGD sequence the protein can bind cell surfaces of different mammalian cells. Therefore it could mediate the attachment of osteoblasts (15Grzesik W.J. Robey P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and osteoclasts (16Flores M.E. Norgard M. Heinegård D. Reinholt F.P. Andersson G. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 530-536Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to the bone matrix during bone remodeling. In vitro BSP was shown to promote bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner (17Ross F.P. Chappel J. Alvarez J.I. Sander D. Butler W.T. Farach-Carson M.C. Mintz K.A. Robey P.G. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9901-9907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus the protein could be involved in bone degradation. As BSP expression is increased by glucocorticoids (18Oldberg A. Jirskog-Hed B. Axelsson S. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3183-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), hormones that support the differentiation of osteoblasts, it was postulated that the molecule is involved in the anabolic phase of bone remodeling (19Heinegård D. Oldberg A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Additionally, the protein has a very high affinity for hydroxyapatite (20Stubbs III, J.T. Mintz K.P. Eanes E.D. Torchia D.A. Fisher L.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1210-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and was shown to function as a de novo nucleator of hydroxyapatite crystals in vitro (21Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). For that reason BSP could be involved in the mineralization process of the bone, a functional role that is supported by the expression of BSP either right before or at the same time as when mineralization starts (22Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cowles E.A. DeRome M.E. Pastizzo G. Brailey L.L. Gronowicz G.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 62: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether BSP is involved both in bone formation and in bone resorption or if only one of these functions is relevant in vivo. BSP-deficient mice showed some skeletal and tooth abnormalities at an age of 6 weeks (24Aubin J.E. Gupta A. Zirngibl R. Rossant J. Bone. 1995; 17 (Abstr. 3a): 558Crossref Google Scholar). A detailed characterization of the animals has not yet been published. Using immunoassay techniques elevated levels of BSP were detected in patients with certain metabolic and malignant bone diseases and BSP can be used as a diagnostic marker for bone remodeling (25Woitge H.W. Pecherstorfer M. Horn E. Keck A.V. Diel I.J. Bayer P. Ludwig H. Ziegler R. Seibel M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, the protein has clinical relevance as a prognostic serum marker for bone metastases. Primary breast cancer patients with preoperatively elevated serum BSP levels are at high risk of subsequent bone metastases in the first years after primary surgery. (26Diel I.J. Solomayer E.F. Seibel M.J. Pfeilschifter J. Maisenbacher H. Gollan C. Pecherstorfer M. Conradi R. Kehr G. Boehm E. Armbruster F.P. Bastert G. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3914-3919PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of BSP in this context is still not clear, one hypothesis is that it is involved in the preferred attachment and metastasis of breast cancer cells in bone. Most of the published investigations are based either on BSP that was isolated from bone under denaturing conditions or BSP fragments obtained from bacterial expression systems, accordingly not carrying post-translational modifications. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was a comparative characterization of BSP expressed recombinantly in a human cell line with BSP isolated and purified under nondenaturing conditions from human bone with regard to folding and cell type specific post-translational modifications. Additionally, the influence of the molecular structure on functional properties of BSP was investigated. The cDNA clone for human BSP (plasmid B6-5g) was obtained from Dr. L. Fisher, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (2Fisher L.W. McBride O.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2347-2351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using B6-5g as a template, the BSP cDNA sequence was amplified without its signal peptide from nucleotides 72 to 1025 under standard polymerase chain reaction conditions and cloned into an N-terminal His6-Myc-enterokinase-tagged eukaryotic expression vector based on pCEP-Pu (27Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The His6, Myc, and enterokinase sequences were either amplified by polymerase chain reaction or synthesized as single stranded oligonucleotides that were then hybridized to double stranded DNA and cloned in 3′-direction of the BM-40 signal peptide of the pCEP-Pu vector. The correct reading frame was confirmed by sequencing both strands using the ABI Prism 377 Sequencer with the Taq FS Dye Deoxy-terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). Human embryonic kidney cells (EBNA-293, Invitrogen) were transfected with BSP expression plasmid DNA using the Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.25 mg/ml G418 (geneticin). BSP was purified from serum-free culture supernatants by using metal affinity chromatography. After addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride the supernatants were filtered and loaded onto a 20-ml column containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) matrix (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl. The column was then washed with equilibration buffer containing 35 mmN′-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The protein was eluted with buffer containing increasing amounts of imidazole (10 mm, 20 mm, 0.25 m). Recombinant BSP was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. Human bone powder (300 g) was produced from femoral heads of patients undergoing hip surgery. Blood residues were removed by a wash with 4 mGdn-HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The Gdn-HCl was then removed from the bone powder by extensive washing. The noncollagenous proteins were extracted three times for 2–3 days with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5. The EDTA extracts were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and eluted with a linear sodium chloride gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl followed by a second gradient from 0.5 to 1 m NaCl. All buffers were supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 1 mm 6-aminocapronic acid. BSP, eluted between 0.35m and 0.85 m NaCl, was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, concentrated, and further purified using the strong anion exchange column ResourceQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the same buffer. Finally the protein was purified to homogeneity by using reversed-phase HPLC as described (28Karmatschek M. Maier I. Seibel M.J. Woitge H.W. Ziegler R. Armbruster F.P. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), where BSP was eluted with 31% acetonitrile, 0.05% heptafluorbutyric acid. Conformational changes of the protein at the low pH in the elution buffer were reversible after dialysis into 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as shown by CD spectroscopy. Homogeneity of the proteins was shown by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions and staining with silver nitrate. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose following standard protocols (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). After blocking with a 5% non-fat powdered milk solution, primary antibody (mouse anti-human BSP 1.2, monoclonal, Immundiagnostik) was added (dilution 1:1000) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose was washed in TBS with 0.01% Tween 20 followed by a 1-h incubation with the second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, 1:2000, DAKO) in TBS with 5% non-fat powdered milk. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were employed for signal detection with x-ray film according to the manufacturers protocol. To exclude an interference of the His6-Myc tag with the interpretation of electron microscopy images, the His6-Myc sequence was cleaved from the fusion protein with enterokinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and separated on a second nickel column. Enterokinase was removed from the BSP containing sample by using enterokinase-away resin (Invitrogen), following the manufacturers protocol. For rotary shadowing, recombinant BSP (20 μg/ml) was dialyzed overnight against 0.2 mammonium formate, diluted 1:1 with 80% glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried in vacuum, and rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon as described previously (31Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The replicas were floated off onto distilled water and picked up on 400-mesh copper grids. For negative staining with 0.75% uranyl formate the protein (2 μg/ml) was adsorbed onto carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge (32Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rhode H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). All samples were examined in a Zeiss EM 902 electron microscope. Proteins were dissolved in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at concentrations of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml. BSP concentrations were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 29,440 liters mol−1cm−1, deduced from the amino acid sequence (33Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded in thermostatted (25 °C) quartz cells of 1-mm optical path length within a wavelength range of 190–250 nm using a Jasco 715 CD spectropolarimeter. The molar ellipticity (θ) expressed in degrees·cm2 dmol−1 was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. Five spectra were accumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio. A baseline with buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. Recombinant BSP was completely denatured by treatment with 6 m Gdn-HCl in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and renatured by dialysis against 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Recombinant BSP lacking the His6-Myc sequence was prepared as described in the electron microscopy section. The program CONTIN was used to calculate secondary structure content (34Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Recombinant BSP, dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was coated to 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C at different concentrations up to 5 μg per well. To analyze the influence of the BSP conformation on cell binding, equal amounts of denatured BSP (dialyzed against 6 m Gdn-HCl) and renatured BSP (dialyzed against 6 m Gdn-HCl, followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) were also immobilized. The coating efficiencies were shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be identical for native, denatured, and renatured BSP. Blocking was performed with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. MCF-7 cells (human adenocarcinoma cell line, mammary gland, ATCC) were trypsinized and 5 × 104cells in culture medium (minimal essential Eagle's medium with Earles salts, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1 mmsodium pyruvate) added per well. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, non-adhered cells were removed, the wells washed with phosphate-buffered saline and adhered cells fixed for 10 min with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were stained for 25 min with 0.1% crystal violet in H2O. Residual staining solution was removed with H2O and the cells lysed by addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. The absorption of the released stain was measured at 570 nm. A 1-ml Econo-Pac CHT-II cartridge (Bio-Rad) packed with hydroxyapatite was used in combination with an fast protein liquid chromatography system fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. After equilibration of the column with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 μg of each BSP preparation was loaded. After washing bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mm to 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, over a period of 20 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, followed by a 5-ml elution with 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, to ensure that the proteins were completely eluted from the column. Fractions of 0.5 ml size were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. N-Glycans were released from 20 to 200 μg of BSP by enzymatic cleavage with peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ethanol precipitated protein was dried and incubated in 5 μl of 1% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m EDTA for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of 40 μl of 0.2 msodium phosphate, pH 8.5, followed by a 5-min denaturation at 100 °C, 5 μl of 7.5% Nonidet P-40 was added to the mixture. 1 Unit of PNGase F was added and the digest was incubated for 18–20 h at 37 °C. To separate oligosaccharides from protein and to desalt the samples, the digests were applied to a 150 mg carbon column (Carbograph SPE, Alltech) according to the method of Packer et al. (35Packer N.H. Lawson M.A. Jardine D.R. Redmond J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Briefly, the column was activated with 2 ml of 100% acetonitrile, 2 ml of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 2 ml of water. After application of the sample the column was eluted with water to remove salts and detergent, then with 2 ml of 25% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid to elute the oligosaccharides which were then dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator. O-Glycans were released from 20 to 200 μg of BSP by anhydrous hydrazinolysis using the O-glycan release kit (Glyco) according to Patel et al. (36Patel T. Bruce J. Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jaques A. Parekh R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The salt-free and dried proteins were incubated for 5 h at 60 °C with hydrazine, which was subsequently removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. For the re-N-acetylation the samples were treated for 15 min at 4 °C with 2 mm acetic anhydride in ice-cold saturated bicarbonate. After desalting of the reaction mixture with the supplied ion exchange resin the glycans were dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator. The glycans were labeled with the fluorescent dye 2-aminobenzamide according to the method described by Bigge et al. (37Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The dried glycans were resuspended in 2 μl of 1 m 2-aminobenzamide in 100% acetic acid (2-aminobenzamide (Fluka) was recrystallized twice from ethanol and stored under argon at −20 °C) and 3 μl of 2m sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide. After a 2-h labeling reaction at 60 °C the samples were dotted onto chromatography paper (Schleicher & Schuell) and excessive labeling reagents were separated by chromatography inn-butanol:ethanol:water (4:1:1). The labeled glycans do not migrate under these conditions. After chromatography the application points were cut out, the labeled glycans eluted with 200–500 μl water by using centrifugal microfiltration tubes and stored at −20 °C. To determine the monosaccharide sequence of the N-linked oligosaccharides, the 2-aminobenzamide-labeled N-glycans were digested with specific exoglycosidases. 20 μl of each sample was incubated sequentially with neuraminidase (New England Biolabs), β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Glyco), β-galactosidase (Glyco), and α-fucosidase (Glyco) for a total of 18–20 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5. The digests were dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator, dissolved in 75% acetonitrile in water, and used for HPLC analyses. A Beckman System Gold HPLC station was used together with a Shimadzu RF-10A XL fluorescence detector and the Beckman Gold Nouveau software. The excitation wavelength was 330 nm and the emission wavelength 420 nm. Normal phase HPLC was performed with a polymer-based aminophase column (astec NH2 polymer, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The 2-aminobenzamide-labeled oligosaccharides (20 μl) were loaded onto the column dissolved in 75% acetonitrile in water. The linear elution gradient for O-glycans ranged from 80% acetonitrile and 20% 0.25 m ammonium formate, pH 4.5, to 20% acetonitrile and 80% 0.25 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, over a period of 120 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The linear gradient for the elution of the N-glycans started at 68% acetonitrile and 32% 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, went over 60 min to 50% acetonitrile and 50% 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, and in 3 min to 100% ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For anion exchange HPLC a polymer-based anion exchange column (Beckman, Q HyperD10, 10 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 20 μl of the 2-aminobenzamide-labeled oligosaccharides were loaded onto the column. Elution buffers were H2O and 0.5m ammonium formate, pH 9.0 (buffer B). Sialo-N-glycans were eluted for 1 min with 0% B, for 12 min with 0–5% B, for 13 min with 5–21% B, for 25 min with 21–80% B, and for 4 min with 80–100% B. Ammonium formate buffers were prepared by adjusting 50 mm or 0.25 m formic acid to pH 4.5 with 25% aqueous ammonia solution. Standard glycans (e.g. derived from bovine fetuin) and glucose ladders that were separated under the same conditions were used to identify the different structures. For peptides the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (saturated solution in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2:1) was mixed on the target 1:1 by volume with 0.5 μl of sample in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and air-dried. Reflectron and post-source decay (PSD) mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a Bruker Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) using a pulsed laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). Residual gas pressure was at <1.0 × 10−7 mbar. Ion spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode. Acceleration and reflector voltages were set to 20 kV (28.5 kV in PSD mode) and 22 kV (30 kV in PSD mode), respectively. The molecular parent ion was isolated with a pulsed field by deflection of all other ions. Complete PSD fragment ion spectra were obtained by stepwise reducing the reflector voltage to produce overlapping mass ranges and combination of the spectral sections. For protein analyses 5 μg of BSP was dissolved in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and digested with 1 unit of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18–20 h at 37 °C. After drying the digest in a Speed-Vac evaporator the mass of this sample and of an equal aliquot of undigested protein was determined on a Reflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker). N-Glycans were analyzed by reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using dihydroxy benzoic acid (10 mg/ml H2O, acetonitrile, 2:1, v/v) as a matrix. Average masses of pseudomolecular ions M+-Na were used for the structural assignments based on the incremental masses of HexNAc (203.2), Hex (162.2), and dHex (146.2). O-Glycans liberated from BSP by base-catalyzed methylation and β-elimination were taken up in 10 μl of methanol and 0.4 μl were mixed on the target with 1.6 μl of matrix solution (dihydroxy benzoic acid, 10 mg/ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile, 2:1). Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode under conditions described above for reflectron analysis, but higher laser energies were applied. O-Linked glycans on recombinant BSP were liberated from the protein by incubation in a mixture of powdered NaOH in dimethyl sulfoxide and methyliodide (38Anumula K.R. Taylor T.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). After overnight reaction at ambient temperature the methylated glycans were extracted with chloroform:water and the organic phase was washed three times with water prior to drying in a stream of nitrogen. Methylated glycans were either directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or converted into the partially methylated alditol acetates to obtain information on the glycosidic structures. For this purpose the oligosaccharides were cleaved by mild hydrolysis, followed by reduction with sodium borodeuteride and acetylation according to Levery et al. (39Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The monosaccharide derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography electron impact ionization mass spectrometry (MD800, Fisons, Manchester, United Kingdom) on a 15-m DB5ms capillary column heated from 50 to 250 °C (7.5 °C/min). The partially methylated alditol acetates were registered by monitoring the total ion current and single ions at m/z 118 (hexitols) and 159 (N-acetylhexosaminitols). The substitution isomers were finally identified via their primary fragmentation patterns. About 100 μg of recombinant BSP was treated with 0.1 m aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C (1 h) to cleave sialic acids. The asialo derivative was extensively digested with a mixture of β-galactosidase (Glyco) and β-hexosaminidase (Glyco) in order to reduce O-glycans to the level of the core-GalNAc. After desalting on NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), aliquots of the partially deglycosylated protein were proteolytically cleaved by sequential treatment with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, 1–2% enzyme:substrate in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0) for 2–4 h at 37 °C and V8 protease (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1–2% enzyme:substrate in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0) for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptides in the digest were separated by reversed phase HPLC on C18 (ultrasphere, 2 × 150 mm, Beckman-Coulter) and fractions were dried by Speed-Vac evaporation. A peptide mapping was performed by reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and (glyco)peptides were identified via their monoisotopic masses. Sequence analysis of (glyco)peptides was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the PSD mode (see above). BSP was recombinantly expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line EBNA-293 as a secreted His6-Myc fusion protein and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using a nickel column. The yield of recombinant BSP per liter of serum-free supernatant was about 3 mg. After SDS-PAGE and silver staining the protein was detected as a broad band between 70 and 80 kDa (Fig. 1), the His6-Myc tag contributing 5 kDa. BSP was also isolated from human bone powder. The noncollagenous proteins were extracted with EDTA at pH 7.5 and BSP purified using standard chromatography methods giving a distinct band at 70 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The different sizes and color yields after SDS-PAGE and silver staining of recombinant and bone-derived BSP presumably reflect differences in their post-translational modifications (see below).

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the first step, attack on the α phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ by ligase results in release of pyrophosphate or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)1 and formation of a covalent intermediate (ligase-adenylate) in which AMP is linked via a phosphoamide bond to lysine. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′ end of the 5′ phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form DNA-adenylate (AppN). In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by the 3′ OH of the nick on DNA-adenylate to join the two polynucleotides and release AMP. DNA ligases are grouped into two families, ATP-dependent ligases and NAD+-dependent ligases, according to the cofactor required for ligase-adenylate formation (1Lehman I.R.

The viral ATP-dependent enzymes consist of an ∼200 amino acid N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain and an ∼100-amino acid C-terminal OB-fold domain (Fig. 1A). Within the N-terminal domain is an adenylate binding pocket composed of five motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that define the polynucleotide ligase/mRNA capping enzyme superfamily of covalent nucleotidyltransferases (8Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).

The structure of full-length Tfiligase reveals that NAD+-dependent enzymes contain a catalytic core composed of nucleotidyltransferase and OB-fold domains (Fig. 1A). Although there is scant amino acid sequence similarity between NAD+ and ATP ligases, the tertiary structures of the catalytic cores are quite well conserved and the adenylate binding pocket of NAD+ ligases is composed of the same five nucleotidyltransferase motifs described originally in the ATP-dependent enzymes. (The nucleotidyltransferase motifs of the NAD+-dependent ligases are highlighted in Fig. 2.) A notable distinction between ATP and NAD+ ligases is that the NAD+ enzymes lack a recognizable counterpart of nucleotidyltransferase motif VI within their OB-fold domain. The catalytic core of Tfi ligase is flanked by a 73-amino acid N-terminal domain (Ia) and three C-terminal domains: a tetracysteine domain that binds a single Zn atom, a helix-hairpin-helix domain (HhH), and a BRCT domain (named after the C terminus of the breast cancer gene product BRCA1). No NAD+-dependent DNA ligase has been identified from a eukaryotic cellular source. However, recent reports of the genomic DNA sequences of two insect poxviruses, Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxvirus and Amsacta mooreientomopoxvirus, identified an open reading frame in each virus that encodes a polypeptide resembling the eubacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligases (20Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Oma E. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 533-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bawden A.L. Glassberg K.J. Diggans J. Shaw R. Farmerie W. Moyer R.W. Virology. 2000; 274: 120-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alignment of the 532-amino acid AmEPV ligase-like protein to the Tfi, Bst, and Eco ligases reveals conservation of domain Ia, the nucleotidyltransferase domain (including the five catalytic motifs) and the OB-fold (Fig. 2) as well as the HhH domain (not shown). However, the AmEPV protein lacks the Zn finger and the BRCT domains that are present in all eubacterial NAD+ ligases. Given that individual cysteines of the Zn finger have been shown to be essential for the nick joining activity of bacterial ligases (22Luo J. Barany F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the hypothesis that the BRCT domain plays an important role in DNA binding (3Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is of considerable interest to evaluate whether the insect poxvirus gene product is a DNA ligase and whether it uses NAD+ as a cofactor. Here we show that this is indeed the case and we provide new evidence that domain Ia is essential for the interaction of the AmEPV ligase with NAD+. Our findings have implications for the evolution of both poxviruses and the nucleotidyltransferase enzyme family, and they provide impetus and direction for efforts to identify new antibiotics that target bacterial NAD+ ligases. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends were used to PCR amplify the AMV199 open reading frame from a genomic DNA clone (21Bawden A.L. Glassberg K.J. Diggans J. Shaw R. Farmerie W. Moyer R.W. Virology. 2000; 274: 120-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The primers were designed to introduceNdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ligase gene. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI, then cloned into theNdeI and BamHI sites of the T7-based expression plasmid pET16b (Novagen) to yield pET-AmEPVLig. Dideoxy sequencing of the entire insert of pET-AmEPVLig confirmed that no alterations of the genomic DNA sequence were introduced during PCR amplification and cloning of the ligase gene. The NΔ70 deletion mutant, Lig-(71–532), was constructed by PCR amplification of the ligase gene with a sense-strand primer that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in place of the Ile71 codon. The CΔ216 deletion mutant, Lig-(1–316), was constructed by PCR amplification with an antisense-strand primer that introduced a stop codon in lieu of the codon for Pro317 and a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing the truncated genes were inserted into pET16b. The resulting plasmids were sequenced to exclude the introduction of any unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. Alanine mutations were introduced into the AmEPV ligase gene by using the two stage PCR-based overlap extension method. pET-AmEPVLig was used as the template for the first stage PCR reaction. NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments of the mutated second-stage PCR products were inserted into pET16b. The inserts of the resulting plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired alanine mutations and the absence of any unwanted coding changes. The wild-type pET-AmEPVLig expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A single ampicillin-resistant colony was inoculated into LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and a 1-liter culture was grown at 37 °C until theA600 reached 0.8. The culture was placed on ice for 30 min, then adjusted to 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and subsequently incubated at 17 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cell lysis was achieved by treatment of thawed, resuspended cells with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 80 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% sucrose. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 37,000 × gfor 20 min. The supernatants were mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) for 30 min with constant rotation. The slurries were poured into columns and the packed resins were washed with IMAC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was step eluted with 50 and 500 mm imidazole in IMAC buffer. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The His-tagged AmEPV ligase was recovered in the 500 mm imidazole eluate (14 mg of protein). The preparation was diluted 1:1 with buffer P (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol) and applied to a 2-ml phosphocellulose column that had been equilibrated with buffer P. The column was washed with 200 mm NaCl in buffer P and the AmEPV ligase was step-eluted with 600 mm NaCl in buffer P containing 1 mm EDTA. The phosphocellulose ligase preparation (8 mg of protein) was stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Truncated and alanine-substituted variants ofAmEPV ligase were produced and purified from 100-ml bacterial cultures using a scaled-down version of the wild-type ligase protocol described above. AmEPV open reading frame 199 encoding a ligase-like polypeptide was cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based bacterial expression vector so as to fuse the 532-aminoAmEPV protein to a 20-amino acid N-terminal leader peptide containing 10 tandem histidines. The expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain that contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a lacUV5 promoter. The recombinant His-tagged protein was purified from a soluble extract of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacteria by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography and phosphocellulose cation exchange chromatography steps. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the phosphocellulose preparation was highly enriched with respect to the 62-kDa AmEPV ligase polypeptide (Fig.1B). The identity of the 62-kDa protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis (see below). In addition, the preparation contained a cluster of smaller polypeptides (∼35–45 kDa) corresponding to N-terminal fragments of the AmEPV ligase. We assayed the ability of the recombinant AmEPV protein to seal a duplex DNA substrate containing a single nick (Fig.1C). NAD+ and magnesium were included in the assay mixtures. Ligation activity was evinced by conversion of the 5′32P-labeled 18-mer substrate to 36-mer product (Fig.1C). More than 90% of the input nicked DNA molecules were sealed. Thus the AmEPV protein is indeed a DNA ligase. The initial step in DNA ligation involves formation of a covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate. In order to assay adenylyltransferase activity, we incubated the recombinant AmEPV protein with [32P-AMP]NAD+ and magnesium. This resulted in the formation of a 32P-labeled covalent nucleotidyl-protein adduct that comigrated with the full-size ligase polypeptide during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D, WT). Additional labeled species were formed that corresponded to N-terminal fragments of theAmEPV ligase (see below). We conclude that AmEPV ligase is active in covalent nucleotidyl transfer with NAD+as the AMP donor. The KXDG sequence (motif I) is the signature feature of the ligase/capping enzyme superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases that form a covalent lysyl-NMP intermediate (Fig.2). The contributions of motif I residues Lys115 and Asp117 to the activity ofAmEPV ligase were gauged from the effects of single alanine substitutions. Mutant proteins K115A and D117A were produced in bacteria and purified from soluble lysates by nickel affinity and phosphocellulose chromatography (Fig. 1B). The K115A and D117A mutants were both inert in nick ligation (Fig. 1C). K115A was also inert in ligase-AMP formation with [32P-AMP]NAD+ (Fig. 1D), consistent with Lys115 being the site of covalent AMP attachment. The D253A protein reacted weakly with NAD+ to form trace amounts of the ligase-AMP intermediate (Fig. 1D). The essentiality of the motif I Lys and Asp positions for nick joining by AmEPV ligase is consistent with structure-function studies of other DNA ligases, including the NAD+-dependent Thermus thermophilusand E. coli DNA ligases, the ATP-dependentChlorella virus DNA ligase, and the ATP-dependent ligase of the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (5Sriskanda V. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Luo J. Barany F.

A low level of nick ligation could be detected in the absence of added nucleotide (Fig.3A). Cofactor-independent ligation was attributed to pre-adenylated ligase in the enzyme preparation. The linear dependence of nucleotide-independent strand joining on input enzyme indicated that 15–20% of the enzyme molecules had AMP bound at the active site (not shown). Inclusion of NAD+ in the reaction mixture stimulated nick ligation such that ∼90% of the input substrate molecules were sealed (Fig.3A). Inclusion of ATP failed to stimulate the joining reaction above the level achieved in the absence of added nucleotide. Indeed, none of the standard rNTPs or dNTPs were able to satisfy the requirement of AmEPV ligase for a high energy cofactor (Fig.3A). NADP was also inactive (not shown). We conclude that the AmEPV enzyme is a bona fideNAD+-specific DNA ligase, the first such enzyme identified from the eukaryotic domain. Titration experiments showed that nick joining activity at subsaturating levels of enzyme increased with NAD+ concentration from 1 to 50 μm and plateaued at 50–100 μm (not shown). AKm of 9 μm NAD+ forAmEPV ligase was calculated from a double-reciprocal plot of the data (not shown). The Km for nick joining by recombinant E. coli DNA ligase on a similar DNA substrate is 3 μm NAD+ (19Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nick joining by AmEPV ligase required a divalent cation cofactor and was optimal at 5 mm magnesium. Manganese and cobalt (5 mm) were also active, albeit less than magnesium, whereas calcium, cooper, and zinc did not support ligase activity (not shown). The AmEPV ligase was active in Tris-HCl buffer from pH 6.5 to 9.0 (not shown). The native size of the AmEPV ligase was gauged by zonal velocity sedimentation through a 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 0.2 m NaCl. The ligation activity profile comprised a single peak centered at fraction 25–27 and coincided with the sedimentation profile of the 62-kDa AmEPV ligase polypeptide (Fig. 3B). The lower molecular weight contaminants sedimented slightly slower, peaking at fraction 27. A comparison of the ligase peak to those of marker proteins catalase (248 kDa) and cytochrome c (13 kDa) that were centrifuged in a parallel gradient hinted that the AmEPV ligase was a monomer. In order to more accurately gauge the sedimentation behavior ofAmEPV ligase, we mixed the recombinant enzyme with globular marker proteins catalase, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c and sedimented the mixture through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. A plot of the marker S values versus fraction number yielded a straight line (not shown). The 62-kDa ligase cosedimented precisely with ovalbumin (45 kDa). These sedimentation results suggest that the AmEPV ligase is an asymmetrically shaped monomer. Recombinant His-tagged AmEPV ligase was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of trypsin and V8 proteases. N-terminal sequencing of the undigested AmEPV ligase polypeptide by automated Edman chemistry after transfer from an SDS gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the N-terminal sequence (GHHHHH) corresponded to that of the recombinant gene product starting from the second residue of the His-tag (Fig.4). Apparently, the ligase suffered removal of the initiating methionine during expression in E. coli. Initial scission of the ligase by 20–40 ng of trypsin yielded two major products: (i) a ∼60-kDa species (sequence HXNHIK, where X is predicted to be M) resulting from tryptic cleavage of the His-tag 2 residues upstream of Met1 of the AmEPV protein, and (ii) a ∼50-kDa species (sequence IGYTPE) resulting from cleavage between Lys70 and Ile71. The latter cleavage site, denoted by an arrow above the AmEPV sequence in Fig. 2, is conserved in other NAD+ ligases and is located at the distal margin of a short α helix at the end of domain Ia in the crystal structures of Bst and Tfi ligases. We surmise that the tryptic site demarcates a surface loop between domain Ia and the nucleotidyltransferase domain of AmEPV ligase. The 50-kDa proteolytic fragment became more abundant as trypsin was increased to 80 ng and it remained resistant to digestion by a concentration of trypsin in excess of that sufficient to cleave all the input ligase. A lower molecular weight product accumulated at higher trypsin concentrations; this species consisted of a mixture of two peptides with overlapping N termini derived from scission at Lys70/Ile71 and Lys69/Lys70 (Fig. 4). This product apparently resulted from a discrete secondary cleavage within the nucleotidyltransferase/OB domain, however, the C terminus of the tryptic product was not determined. Treatment of AmEPV ligase with V8 protease yielded two clusters of products that were resistant to digestion by V8 concentrations sufficient to cleavage all of the input ligase (Fig. 4). The higher molecular weight cluster consisted of a major component that retained the original N terminus of the His-tag (GHHHHH) and a minor species (sequence NSIRTV) arising from cleavage between Glu225 and Asn226 within the nucleotidyltransferase domain (see Fig. 2). The Glu/Asn site is conserved in Tfi ligase (as Glu246/Lys247), where it is exposed on the protein surface. The lower molecular weight cluster includes a fragment that retains the His-tag and a second species (sequence PIIID) generated by cleavage between Glu316 and Pro317within the second β strand of the OB-fold domain (see Fig. 2). The Glu/Pro V8 cleavage site is conserved in the other NAD+ligases and is exposed on the protein surface in the Tfiligase crystal structure (19Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In light of the proteolysis results, we engineered the N-terminal deletion mutant Lig-(71–532) and the C-terminal truncation Lig-(1–316), referred to henceforth as NΔ70 and CΔ216, respectively. The NΔ70 protein corresponds to the major trypsin-resistant species and it lacks all of domain Ia. The CΔ216 protein is truncated at the V8-accessible site in the middle of the OB-fold and its lacks all of the HhH domain. NΔ70 and CΔ216 were produced in bacteria as N-terminal His10 fusions and purified from soluble lysates by Ni-agarose and phosphocellulose chromatography (Fig. 5A). CΔ216 was incapable of sealing a 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick (Fig.5C), yet it retained the ability to react with NAD+ to form a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate (Fig.5B). We surmise that the OB and/or HhH domains are critical for AmEPV ligase function at a step subsequent to step 1 reaction chemistry. These findings echo those of Timson and Wigley (25Timson D. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) for an N-terminal domain of Bst ligase that was truncated within the first β strand of the OB-fold domain and also retained step 1 ligase-adenylation activity. The fact that we could detect no accumulation of a DNA-adenylate intermediate during the reaction of CΔ216 with nicked DNA in the presence of NAD+ hinted that the missing C terminus played a role either in step 2 chemistry or in DNA binding. Conceivably, the C terminus may also be required for step 3 of the ligase reaction: the formation of a phosphodiester bond. We assayed step 3 of the AmEPV ligation reaction using a pre-adenylated nicked DNA substrate. The adenylated strand used to form this substrate was synthesized using vaccinia virus DNA ligase via ligase-mediated AMP transfer to the 5′ 32P-labeled strand of a DNA molecule containing a 1-nucleotide gap (12Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 26: 4618-4625Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled AppDNA strand was purified by denaturing PAGE and then annealed to an unlabeled 36-mer template oligonucleotide and a 3′ OH 18-mer oligonucleotide to form the nicked DNA-adenylate molecule illustrated in Fig. 5C. This substrate was reacted with excess wild-type or truncated AmEPV ligase in the presence of magnesium without added NAD+. The wild-type enzyme generated a 36-mer ligation product, but CΔ216 was inert in phosphodiester formation (Fig. 5C, AppDNA). Thus, the ligation defect incurred by the loss of the C terminus could not be overcome by bypassing the DNA adenylation step. A novel finding that emerged from the deletion analysis was that elimination of the N-terminal Ia domain abrogated nick joining by a completely different mechanism than did the loss of the C terminus (Fig. 5). NΔ70 was inert in the overall ligation reaction (Fig.5C) and formation of a ligase-adenylate intermediate with NAD+ (Fig. 5B). However, NΔ70 was fully functional in synthesis of phosphodiester bond at a pre-adenylated nick (Fig. 5C). The latter point underscores that the step 1 defect of NΔ70 cannot be ascribed to a global folding defect, but instead reflects a specific requirement for domain Ia in the reaction of ligase with NAD+. Several instructive points were gleaned from a kinetic analysis of phosphodiester bond formation by wild-type ligase and NΔ70 at a pre-adenylated nick under conditions of ligase excess (Fig.6A). First, although the extent of sealing of the preadenylated nick in the absence of NAD+ was identical for wild-type ligase and NΔ70, the rate of the NΔ70 reaction was 50% faster than that of the wild-type enzyme. The implication of this result is that the presence of domain Ia constitutes a modest impediment to the interaction of the ligase with nicked DNA-adenylate (see below). Second, the inclusion of 50 μm NAD+ elicited a 5-fold decrement in the extent of step 3 ligation by the wild-type ligase, presumably by competition of NAD+ and nicked DNA-adenylate for the AMP-binding pocket within the nucleotidyltransferase domain. NAD+ had no effect whatsoever on step 3 catalysis by NΔ70, consistent with a critical role for domain Ia in NAD+ binding to AmEPV ligase. A"

An N-terminal EVH1/WASp homology 1 domain binds type II polyprotein helices in WASp Interacting Protein.WASp is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between VCA and residues overlapping the GBD (17Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This interaction inhibits the ability of VCA to activate Arp2/3 complex (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition is relieved by binding of PIP2 and CDC42 (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).While the VCA region of WASp/Scar proteins constitutively activates nucleation by Arp2/3 complex (9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 12Rohatgi R. Ma L.

Biol. 1999; 9: 501-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), two findings suggest that shorter constructs might suffice: i) microinjection of a GST fusion of the WASp VC region causes actin accumulations in primary macrophages (20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and ii) overexpression of a WAVE/Scar1 mutant lacking the last 15 amino acids can also stimulate actin nucleation in NIH3T3 cells in a process proposed to be independent of Arp2/3 complex (21Sasaki N. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).This study examines the abilities of VCA deletion constructs to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro and in cells. GST fusion proteins containing the A region (GST-VCA, GST-CA, GST-A) bind Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinities. However, Arp2/3 complex activation requires the C region. GST-VC displays almost undetectable interaction with Arp2/3 complex in biochemical assays, but activates actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex in vitro. When microinjected into macrophages or endothelial cells, both GST-VC and GST-CA induce actin-Arp2/3 complex-aggregates, while GST-A shows no such activity. Furthermore, only microinjection of GST-VC, but not of GST-CA, leads to a significant increase of cellular polymerized actin. Interestingly, all these constructs are able to disrupt endogenous Arp2/3 complex-dependent podosomes (actin-rich basal adhesion structures) in cells upon microinjection, suggesting that they compete with endogenous WASp for Arp2/3 complex binding.DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that the activity and regulation of WASp are not simply matters of additive or subtractive effects by isolated domain modules, but rather the sum of synergistic effects between them. The A region of WASp VCA confers high affinity binding to, but not activation of, Arp2/3 complex, while the V region increases the affinity of VCA for actin and is indispensable for activation. A construct lacking the A region (GST-VC) displays almost undetectable binding to Arp2/3 complex, yet still activates the complex in vitro. In contrast, the A region fused to GST (this study) or alone (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) binds to but does not activate Arp2/3 complex.Current nucleation activation models propose that, by binding both an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex, the VCA region of WASp/Scar proteins activates formation of a stable nucleus (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). From this model, a decrease in affinity for either actin or Arp2/3 complex would reduce the ability of VCA to activate nucleation. Our results support this model. Deletion of the V or A regions decrease affinity for actin or Arp2/3 complex, respectively, resulting in decreased nucleation efficiency. However, the fact that GST-VC activates nucleation at all is remarkable, given its low affinity for Arp2/3 complex. This suggests that a short-lived interaction between Arp2/3 complex and GST-VC can be productive. Additionally, the C region might participate in an activation step subsequent to binding of both actin and Arp2/3 complex to VCA (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The finding that the C region is indispensable for actin nucleation fits well with reports of mutations in this region leading to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (4Ochs H.D. Semin. Hamatol. 1998; 35: 332-345PubMed Google Scholar).We measured the affinities of the GST-VCA fusion for actin (0.29 μm) and for Arp2/3 complex (0.11 μm) to be 2-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, than those previously measured for VCA not fused to GST (“free VCA”, Ref. 8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These higher affinities may explain the 50-fold higher potency of GST-VCA over free VCA in nucleation activation (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and further support the model that VCA brings together actin and Arp2/3 complex to form an effective nucleus. We find a similar degree of affinity increase for GST-CA (8-fold) and GST-A (9-fold) for Arp2/3 complex over the previously determined values for the GST-free proteins (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The reason for these affinity increases is unclear at present. Possibilities include stabilization of the disordered VCA structure (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or low affinity binding of GST to Arp2/3 complex or actin (although no measurable binding of GST to either ligand was detected in our study).Microinjection of GST-VCA or GST-VC into either macrophages or HUVEC caused formation of polymerized actin-rich clumps in a high percentage of cells. Our evidence suggests that these clumps are generated through activation of endogenous Arp2/3 complex by the injected proteins. Polymerized actin content in GST-VCA and GST-VC injected cells increased 1.64- and 1.97-fold, respectively. Endogenous Arp2/3 complex, but not WASp, localized to actin clumps. Neither GST-V nor GST-A caused actin clump formation, paralleling their inability to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro.Conversely, microinjection of GST-CA or GST-C caused actin clump formation in a smaller percentage of cells, contrasting their inabilities to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro. However, these GST-CA-induced clumps were significantly less pronounced than those caused by GST-VC, and contained both Arp2/3 complex and cellular WASp, suggesting that they were generated by another mechanism. One such mechanism might be C region binding to the GBD of endogenous WASp, resulting in both its recruitment and activation (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 15Rohatgi R.H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 16Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Dyche Mullins R. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, GST fusions containing the C region did not bind WASp from macrophage extracts. Since we did not observe a net increase in total polymerized cellular actin upon injection of GST-CA, these aggregations might therefore represent not new-formed filaments but simply filaments released from structures disrupted through GST-CA.Previous studies showed that microinjection of GST-VC and GST-A caused podosome disruption in primary macrophages (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Podosomes are actin-rich basal adhesion structures containing polymerized actin, Arp2/3 complex, and WASp. Macrophages from WAS patients lack podosomes (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), suggesting that their formation depends upon WASp activation of actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex. Thus, injection of GST-VCA and certain truncations are proposed to disrupt podosomes by sequestering Arp2/3 complex, similar to proposed effects of injected/overexpressed WASp/Scar VCA in other cells (9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 11Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). However, these results might be complicated by the abilities of the employed constructs themselves to activate Arp2/3 complex. Our results provide new information on this issue. Microinjected GST-A disrupts podosomes but does not cause actin clump formation. Our in vitrostudies show that GST-A binds Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinity and inhibits Arp2/3 complex activation by WASp VCA but does not activate nucleation. These results suggest that disruption of podosomes is due to Arp2/3 complex sequestration and does not require Arp2/3 complex activation.Our results on WASp VCA may not be readily transferable to the WAVE1/Scar1 C-terminal domain since WAVE1/Scar1 GST-VC does not activate actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex in vitro(21Sasaki N. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, WASp GBD constructs that bind WASp VCA inhibit filament formation by WASp VCA but not by WAVE/Scar VCA (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The WASp and WAVE/Scar C termini are therefore clearly different, and WAVE/Scar VC may use an Arp2/3 complex-independent pathway for initiating actin polymerization, whereas WASp VC clearly does use an Arp2/3 complex-dependent pathway. This does not exclude the possibility of WASp VC also using an additional Arp2/3 complex-independent method. However, co-localization of Arp2/3 complex with GST-VC-induced actin clumps in cells suggests that Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin nucleation is the major pathway used here. The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp)1 and related proteins have emerged as major regulators of actin polymerization through their ability to activate actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex (reviewed in Refs. 1Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin.

The gene for WASp is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), a disease associated with aberrant regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of white blood cells and platelets (reviewed in Refs. 4Ochs H.D. Semin. Hamatol. 1998; 35: 332-345PubMed Google Scholar,5Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Besides hematopoietically expressed WASp, the mammalian WASp family currently comprises the more ubiquitously expressed N-WASp and three WAVE/Scar isoforms (6Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 7Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). WASp is a multidomain protein (Fig. 1). Its C-terminal region (VCA) activates Arp2/3 complex to nucleate branched actin filaments (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). VCA consists of a verprolin-like (V)/WASp homology 2 domain that binds monomeric actin (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Other WASp domains bind a variety of signaling molecules, linking WASp activation of Arp2/3 complex to signal transduction pathways. A GTPase-binding domain (GBD) binds Cdc42, a Rho family GTPase (14Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Polyphosphoinositides bind the WASp homologue, N-WASP, through a basic region N-terminal to the GBD (15Rohatgi R.H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 16Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Dyche Mullins R. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A domain rich in polyproline associates with a variety of proteins, including the adaptor proteins Nck and Grb2 as well as Src and Tec family kinases (reviewed in Ref.1Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An N-terminal EVH1/WASp homology 1 domain binds type II polyprotein helices in WASp Interacting Protein. WASp is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between VCA and residues overlapping the GBD (17Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This interaction inhibits the ability of VCA to activate Arp2/3 complex (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition is relieved by binding of PIP2 and CDC42 (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). While the VCA region of WASp/Scar proteins constitutively activates nucleation by Arp2/3 complex (9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 12Rohatgi R. Ma L.

Biol. 1999; 9: 501-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), two findings suggest that shorter constructs might suffice: i) microinjection of a GST fusion of the WASp VC region causes actin accumulations in primary macrophages (20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and ii) overexpression of a WAVE/Scar1 mutant lacking the last 15 amino acids can also stimulate actin nucleation in NIH3T3 cells in a process proposed to be independent of Arp2/3 complex (21Sasaki N. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This study examines the abilities of VCA deletion constructs to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro and in cells. GST fusion proteins containing the A region (GST-VCA, GST-CA, GST-A) bind Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinities. However, Arp2/3 complex activation requires the C region. GST-VC displays almost undetectable interaction with Arp2/3 complex in biochemical assays, but activates actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex in vitro. When microinjected into macrophages or endothelial cells, both GST-VC and GST-CA induce actin-Arp2/3 complex-aggregates, while GST-A shows no such activity. Furthermore, only microinjection of GST-VC, but not of GST-CA, leads to a significant increase of cellular polymerized actin. Interestingly, all these constructs are able to disrupt endogenous Arp2/3 complex-dependent podosomes (actin-rich basal adhesion structures) in cells upon microinjection, suggesting that they compete with endogenous WASp for Arp2/3 complex binding. DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that the activity and regulation of WASp are not simply matters of additive or subtractive effects by isolated domain modules, but rather the sum of synergistic effects between them. The A region of WASp VCA confers high affinity binding to, but not activation of, Arp2/3 complex, while the V region increases the affinity of VCA for actin and is indispensable for activation. A construct lacking the A region (GST-VC) displays almost undetectable binding to Arp2/3 complex, yet still activates the complex in vitro. In contrast, the A region fused to GST (this study) or alone (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) binds to but does not activate Arp2/3 complex.Current nucleation activation models propose that, by binding both an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex, the VCA region of WASp/Scar proteins activates formation of a stable nucleus (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). From this model, a decrease in affinity for either actin or Arp2/3 complex would reduce the ability of VCA to activate nucleation. Our results support this model. Deletion of the V or A regions decrease affinity for actin or Arp2/3 complex, respectively, resulting in decreased nucleation efficiency. However, the fact that GST-VC activates nucleation at all is remarkable, given its low affinity for Arp2/3 complex. This suggests that a short-lived interaction between Arp2/3 complex and GST-VC can be productive. Additionally, the C region might participate in an activation step subsequent to binding of both actin and Arp2/3 complex to VCA (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The finding that the C region is indispensable for actin nucleation fits well with reports of mutations in this region leading to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (4Ochs H.D. Semin. Hamatol. 1998; 35: 332-345PubMed Google Scholar).We measured the affinities of the GST-VCA fusion for actin (0.29 μm) and for Arp2/3 complex (0.11 μm) to be 2-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, than those previously measured for VCA not fused to GST (“free VCA”, Ref. 8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These higher affinities may explain the 50-fold higher potency of GST-VCA over free VCA in nucleation activation (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and further support the model that VCA brings together actin and Arp2/3 complex to form an effective nucleus. We find a similar degree of affinity increase for GST-CA (8-fold) and GST-A (9-fold) for Arp2/3 complex over the previously determined values for the GST-free proteins (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The reason for these affinity increases is unclear at present. Possibilities include stabilization of the disordered VCA structure (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or low affinity binding of GST to Arp2/3 complex or actin (although no measurable binding of GST to either ligand was detected in our study).Microinjection of GST-VCA or GST-VC into either macrophages or HUVEC caused formation of polymerized actin-rich clumps in a high percentage of cells. Our evidence suggests that these clumps are generated through activation of endogenous Arp2/3 complex by the injected proteins. Polymerized actin content in GST-VCA and GST-VC injected cells increased 1.64- and 1.97-fold, respectively. Endogenous Arp2/3 complex, but not WASp, localized to actin clumps. Neither GST-V nor GST-A caused actin clump formation, paralleling their inability to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro.Conversely, microinjection of GST-CA or GST-C caused actin clump formation in a smaller percentage of cells, contrasting their inabilities to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro. However, these GST-CA-induced clumps were significantly less pronounced than those caused by GST-VC, and contained both Arp2/3 complex and cellular WASp, suggesting that they were generated by another mechanism. One such mechanism might be C region binding to the GBD of endogenous WASp, resulting in both its recruitment and activation (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 15Rohatgi R.H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J.

However, GST fusions containing the C region did not bind WASp from macrophage extracts. Since we did not observe a net increase in total polymerized cellular actin upon injection of GST-CA, these aggregations might therefore represent not new-formed filaments but simply filaments released from structures disrupted through GST-CA.Previous studies showed that microinjection of GST-VC and GST-A caused podosome disruption in primary macrophages (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Podosomes are actin-rich basal adhesion structures containing polymerized actin, Arp2/3 complex, and WASp. Macrophages from WAS patients lack podosomes (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J.

A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), suggesting that their formation depends upon WASp activation of actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex. Thus, injection of GST-VCA and certain truncations are proposed to disrupt podosomes by sequestering Arp2/3 complex, similar to proposed effects of injected/overexpressed WASp/Scar VCA in other cells (9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 11Machesky L.M.

However, these results might be complicated by the abilities of the employed constructs themselves to activate Arp2/3 complex. Our results provide new information on this issue. Microinjected GST-A disrupts podosomes but does not cause actin clump formation. Our in vitrostudies show that GST-A binds Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinity and inhibits Arp2/3 complex activation by WASp VCA but does not activate nucleation. These results suggest that disruption of podosomes is due to Arp2/3 complex sequestration and does not require Arp2/3 complex activation.Our results on WASp VCA may not be readily transferable to the WAVE1/Scar1 C-terminal domain since WAVE1/Scar1 GST-VC does not activate actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex in vitro(21Sasaki N. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, WASp GBD constructs that bind WASp VCA inhibit filament formation by WASp VCA but not by WAVE/Scar VCA (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The WASp and WAVE/Scar C termini are therefore clearly different, and WAVE/Scar VC may use an Arp2/3 complex-independent pathway for initiating actin polymerization, whereas WASp VC clearly does use an Arp2/3 complex-dependent pathway. This does not exclude the possibility of WASp VC also using an additional Arp2/3 complex-independent method. However, co-localization of Arp2/3 complex with GST-VC-induced actin clumps in cells suggests that Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin nucleation is the major pathway used here. Our results suggest that the activity and regulation of WASp are not simply matters of additive or subtractive effects by isolated domain modules, but rather the sum of synergistic effects between them. The A region of WASp VCA confers high affinity binding to, but not activation of, Arp2/3 complex, while the V region increases the affinity of VCA for actin and is indispensable for activation. A construct lacking the A region (GST-VC) displays almost undetectable binding to Arp2/3 complex, yet still activates the complex in vitro. In contrast, the A region fused to GST (this study) or alone (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) binds to but does not activate Arp2/3 complex. Current nucleation activation models propose that, by binding both an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex, the VCA region of WASp/Scar proteins activates formation of a stable nucleus (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). From this model, a decrease in affinity for either actin or Arp2/3 complex would reduce the ability of VCA to activate nucleation. Our results support this model. Deletion of the V or A regions decrease affinity for actin or Arp2/3 complex, respectively, resulting in decreased nucleation efficiency. However, the fact that GST-VC activates nucleation at all is remarkable, given its low affinity for Arp2/3 complex. This suggests that a short-lived interaction between Arp2/3 complex and GST-VC can be productive. Additionally, the C region might participate in an activation step subsequent to binding of both actin and Arp2/3 complex to VCA (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The finding that the C region is indispensable for actin nucleation fits well with reports of mutations in this region leading to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (4Ochs H.D. Semin. Hamatol. 1998; 35: 332-345PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the affinities of the GST-VCA fusion for actin (0.29 μm) and for Arp2/3 complex (0.11 μm) to be 2-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, than those previously measured for VCA not fused to GST (“free VCA”, Ref. 8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These higher affinities may explain the 50-fold higher potency of GST-VCA over free VCA in nucleation activation (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and further support the model that VCA brings together actin and Arp2/3 complex to form an effective nucleus. We find a similar degree of affinity increase for GST-CA (8-fold) and GST-A (9-fold) for Arp2/3 complex over the previously determined values for the GST-free proteins (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The reason for these affinity increases is unclear at present. Possibilities include stabilization of the disordered VCA structure (8Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or low affinity binding of GST to Arp2/3 complex or actin (although no measurable binding of GST to either ligand was detected in our study). Microinjection of GST-VCA or GST-VC into either macrophages or HUVEC caused formation of polymerized actin-rich clumps in a high percentage of cells. Our evidence suggests that these clumps are generated through activation of endogenous Arp2/3 complex by the injected proteins. Polymerized actin content in GST-VCA and GST-VC injected cells increased 1.64- and 1.97-fold, respectively. Endogenous Arp2/3 complex, but not WASp, localized to actin clumps. Neither GST-V nor GST-A caused actin clump formation, paralleling their inability to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro. Conversely, microinjection of GST-CA or GST-C caused actin clump formation in a smaller percentage of cells, contrasting their inabilities to activate Arp2/3 complex in vitro. However, these GST-CA-induced clumps were significantly less pronounced than those caused by GST-VC, and contained both Arp2/3 complex and cellular WASp, suggesting that they were generated by another mechanism. One such mechanism might be C region binding to the GBD of endogenous WASp, resulting in both its recruitment and activation (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 15Rohatgi R.H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J.

However, GST fusions containing the C region did not bind WASp from macrophage extracts. Since we did not observe a net increase in total polymerized cellular actin upon injection of GST-CA, these aggregations might therefore represent not new-formed filaments but simply filaments released from structures disrupted through GST-CA. Previous studies showed that microinjection of GST-VC and GST-A caused podosome disruption in primary macrophages (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Podosomes are actin-rich basal adhesion structures containing polymerized actin, Arp2/3 complex, and WASp. Macrophages from WAS patients lack podosomes (13Linder S. Higgs H. Hüfner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), suggesting that their formation depends upon WASp activation of actin nucleation through Arp2/3 complex. Thus, injection of GST-VCA and certain truncations are proposed to disrupt podosomes by sequestering Arp2/3 complex, similar to proposed effects of injected/overexpressed WASp/Scar VCA in other cells (9Machesky L.M. Mullins D.M. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 11Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). However, these results might be complicated by the abilities of the employed constructs themselves to activate Arp2/3 complex. Our results provide new information on this issue. Microinjected GST-A disrupts podosomes but does not cause actin clump formation. Our in vitrostudies show that GST-A binds Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinity and inhibits Arp2/3 complex activation by WASp VCA but does not activate nucleation. These results suggest that disruption of podosomes is due to Arp2/3 complex sequestration and does not require Arp2/3 complex activation.

One OMT type is specific for esters of coenzyme A and is called caffeoyl-CoA OMT (CCoAOMT, Fig. 1) whereas the other type accepts as substrates the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters, hydroxycinnamyl alcohol and aldehyde derivatives and free acid forms (such as caffeic acid). This second type has been dubbed caffeic acid OMT I (COMT I). Two plant OMTs belonging to this latter family, namely chalcone OMT and isoflavone OMT, have recently been structurally characterized (19Zubieta C. He X.-Z. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To understand the structural basis of the high degree of specificity of plant CCoAOMTs for hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters, we constructed a three-dimensional model taking advantage of the structural conservation between plant CCoAOMT enzymes and animal OMTs whose three-dimensional structure is known. In animals, catechol OMTs (CatOMTs) are important in the central nervous system where they metabolize levodopa and catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and adrenaline into inactive compounds (20Assicot M. Bohuon C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Axelrod J. Tomchick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 702-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the therapy of Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder, inhibitors of CatOMT are used in combination with levodopa to prolong the availability of levodopa to the brain of the patients (22Bonifati V.

AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases originating from different kingdoms and methylating a large variety of substrates have been shown to share common structural features (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 27Bugl H. Fauman E. Stacker B. Zheng F. Kushner S. Saper M. Bardwell J. Jakob U. Mol.

CatOMTs from animal sources appear to be the methyltransferases closest to plant CCoAOMTs. Not surprisingly, most of the residues shown to interact withS-adenosyl-l-methionine and Mg2+cofactors in rat CatOMT crystals (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) are well conserved in plant CCoAOMTs that require the same cofactors. Concerning the phenolic acceptor substrates of animal and plant enzymes, catechol and caffeoyl-CoA have the same ortho-dihydroxy substitution on the aromatic ring although the CoA moiety is only present in the latter. Moreover, the CoA moiety has been shown to be essential to CCoAOMT activity since free caffeic acid is not a substrate for the plant enzyme (18Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine which part of the caffeoyl-CoA molecule is crucial for CCoAOMT activity, truncated derivatives of caffeoyl-CoA were prepared and tested as substrates of tobacco CCoAOMT. The data enabled us to model the interactions of the protein with the CoA moiety of the thioester molecule, revealing two possible substrate binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted by the model to be in close contact with the substrate, coupled with enzyme activity assays of the purified recombinant proteins, identified amino acid residues involved in the active site of the enzyme. Several mutant proteins in which one selected amino acid residue was substituted, were affected in enzyme activity. Moreover, deletions of the N terminus and of an internal loop present in the plant enzyme but not in animal CatOMT, were shown to abolish catalytic activity. All substitution and deletion mutants displayed circular dichroism (CD) spectra similar to that of the wild-type protein. These data indicate that the mutations did not induce a gross perturbation of protein folding and the mutated residues play a major role in the binding of the substrate by the enzyme. Interestingly, all the enzymes but the N terminus deletion mutant displayed changes in their CD spectra in the presence of the caffeoyl-CoA substrate. These results indicate that a conformational change of the enzyme is induced by theo-diphenolic substrate and the protein N-terminal extension plays a critical role in this process.

The mutations were carried out using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene. Unless otherwise indicated, standard molecular biology procedures were used.

Cells were lysed by two passages through a French Press (Aminco, Maryland). The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min, the pellet discarded, and beads of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) were added to the supernatant containing soluble proteins. The fixation of proteins was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the beads were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the fusion protein was directly cleaved by incubation of beads with thrombin for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant containing the recombinant CCoAOMT protein was concentrated on Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, Ranvers, MA). The different steps of purification were assessed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described by Geoffroy et al. (32Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Fritig B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant CCoAOMT protein in each sample was quantified by densitometry of bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Fluka, Switzerland). CCoAOMT activity was determined as described by Ye et al. (14Ye Z.-H. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Varner J.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Pig CatOMT (Sigma) and tobacco recombinant CCoAOMT were incubated with 40 μm AdoMet, 200 μm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 μm of theo-diphenolic substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. For Km determination, caffeoyl-CoA concentration varied between 30 and 300 μm. TheKm and Vmax values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots. The meta/para methylation ratio was determined after saponification of reaction products and separation of labeled ferulic and isoferulic acids by TLC on silica gel (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a benzene/acetic acid/water (6:7:3, v/v/v) system (organic phase). Caffeoyl-CoA was prepared according to the method of Stöckigt and Zenk (33Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30c: 352-358Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with some modifications (34Negrel J. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 31-34Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and identified and quantified spectrophotometrically as described by Lüderitz et al. (35Lüderitz T. Schatz G. Grisebach H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Dephosphocaffeoyl-CoA and caffeoyl-phosphopantetheine were prepared using phosphatase or pyrophosphatase (Sigma), respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The incubation products were then separated by TLC on cellulose (Merck) using n-butanol/glacial acetic acid/water (5:2:3, v/v/v) solvent, visualized under UV light, and eluted in water before spectrophotometric analysis. Circular dichroic spectra were recorded at 4 °C with a Jobin-Yvon VI dichrograph. A cell of 1-mm optical path length was used to record spectra in the ultraviolet region (260–190 nm) of purified recombinant enzyme preparations at a peptide concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The results are presented as normalized molar ellipticity values [θ] on the basis of the mean amino acid residue mass of 110 Da. Taking into account the sensitivity of the apparatus (Δ(ΔA) = 10−6), the polypeptide concentration and the optical path length of the cell, the precision of the measurements is Δ([θ]) = ± 10 deg·cm2dmol−1. Sequence alignment and analysis was performed with GCG software (Wisconsin Package version 10.0, Genetic Computer Group, Madison, Wisconsin). In a first step, an alignment was produced automatically with the program Pileup using the default parameter values. This alignment was then modified by hand, using the program Seqlab, to improve the score in the C-terminal end where it was obviously inappropriate for three crucial residues (Asp-169, Asn-170, and Glu-199 in 1VID) that are known from the crystallographic structure to be involved in AdoMet binding. To improve the alignment, two gaps were introduced by hand in all the CatOMTs. Modeling of CCoAOMT protein was carried out with the program Modeler (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) using sequence alignment data and 1VID coordinates. Residues from Asn-186 to Ala-191 and from Arg-205 to Leu-209 correspond to two insertions in the C-terminal part of CCoAOMT compared with the CatOMT protein (Fig.2A). These segments, absent in 1 VID, were built by imposing special restraints on the Modeler program as detailed in the Results section. The AdoMet molecule, Mg2+ ion, and the substrate aromatic ring bearing the two hydroxyls in the ortho position were kept in the same positions and conformations as seen in 1VID. Modeling of the CCoAOMT substrate into the homology model was done manually using program O (37Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Buggs C. Ealick S. Crystallographic Computing and Modelling Methods in Macromolecular Design. Springer, NY1989: 189-195Google Scholar). We made the assumption that the aromatic ring of the caffeoyl moiety occupies exactly the same position as the 3,5-dinitrocatechol ring in the structure 1VID. From this starting point, keeping the aromatic ring in a fixed position and using only rotations along the pantetheine chain of coenzyme A (see Fig. 3C), we docked the rest of the substrate molecule onto the surface of the protein. AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins share common sequence and structure motifs (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 27Bugl H. Fauman E. Stacker B. Zheng F. Kushner S. Saper M. Bardwell J. Jakob U. Mol.

In particular, animal CatOMTs and plant CCoAOMTs have similar molecular weight values, require Mg2+ ions for activity, and methylate ortho-diphenolic substrates. Fig. 2 shows sequence alignment and secondary structure elements of four animal CatOMTs with seven CCoAOMTs representative of more than twenty sequences that have been cloned in various plant species. Amino acid residues that have been demonstrated to interact with AdoMet or Mg2+ in CatOMT (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) appear well conserved in the plant enzymes. Together with the eightα-helices, the seven β-strands, and the typical α/β Rossmann fold found in both types of proteins (shown below the sequences in Fig. 2A), functionally important residues are conserved and provide anchoring points for the alignment process. Along the OMT sequences, several conserved amino acid stretches have been previously detected and proposed as characteristic OMT signatures (8Bugos R.C. Chiang V.L. Campbell W.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Ibrahim R.K. Bruneau A. Bantignies B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 38Collazo P. Montoliu L. Puigdomenech P. Rigau J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, it is worth noting that two internal regions and the N-terminal extension of CCoAOMTs are absent in rat CatOMT (Fig. 2A). From the sequence alignment of Fig.2A, we constructed a three-dimensional model for the tobacco CCoAOMT using the crystal structure of the rat CatOMT (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) as template. In AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases of animal or plant origin, the helices α4-α8 and the parallel β-strands β1–β5 are similar to the Rossmann fold found in alcohol dehydrogenase and implicated in NAD+ binding. The last residue of β1 of animal CatOMTs is Gly-66 and is conserved in all plant CCoAOMTs. In rat CatOMT the last residue in the β2-strand is Glu-90, which binds to the ribose hydroxyls of AdoMet (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In dehydrogenases this residue corresponds to an Asp residue as is also the case in all the CCoAOMT sequences (Fig. 2A). In all methyltransferases of known structure, the first five strands are parallel while the C-terminal part of the sheet contains two antiparallel β-strands (29Skinner M. Puvathingal J. Wajter R. Friedman A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1189-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The last parallel strand, β-5, connects to helix α-8, which connects to the outside strand, β-6. This overall structure has been demonstrated in the rat CatOMT and is also found in the tobacco CCoAOMT model (Fig.2B). The crystallographic study of rat CatOMT has shown that Met-40 orients the sulfur atom of AdoMet, with the electron-deficient methyl group pointing toward the nucleophilic hydroxyl of catechol (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The amino group of the methionine moiety of AdoMet has hydrogen bonds to Asp-141, to the main chain oxygen of Gly-66 and to the side chain oxygen of Ser-72. All these residues, which interact with the methyl group donor in the rat enzyme active site correspond to conserved amino acid residues in CCoAOMTs. The Mg2+ ion plays a major role in CatOMT catalytic activity. Inside the active site, Mg2+ is coordinated to the side-chain oxygens of Asp-141, Asp-169, and Asn-170 and to both catechol hydroxyls. The sixth position of the magnesium coordination has been suggested to be occupied by a water molecule (26Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As for the residues involved in AdoMet binding, those interacting with Mg2+ ion are conserved in the CCoAOMT sequences (Fig.2A). For CatOMT catalytic activity, the exact positioning of the ortho-diphenolic substrate to the methyl group of AdoMet is possible because of the binding of the two hydroxyl groups to the Mg2+ ion. One substrate hydroxyl has an important hydrogen bond to the carboxyl oxygen of Glu-199 whereas the other is surrounded by three positively charged moieties, namely the Mg2+ ion, the methyl group of AdoMet and Lys-144. Similarly to the residues implicated in the binding of AdoMet and Mg2+ cofactors, Glu-199 and Lys-144 are conserved in all the plant CCoAOMTs (Fig.2A). In sum, the sequence conservation between CatOMTs and CCoAOMTs has allowed us to construct the homology model presented in Fig.2C. Modeling of the CCoAOMT protein was carried out with the program Modeler (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) using the sequence alignment and the 1VIDcoordinates. No attempt was made to include residues from Met-1 to Leu-16 because of the lack of restraints; some residues (Leu-1 to Lys-13) do not have any counterpart in the rat sequence (Fig.2A), while others (Ser-14 to Leu-16) correspond to CatOMT residues that are not ordered and invisible in the crystal and hence have no coordinates in 1VID. Residues from Asn-186 to Ala-191 and from Arg-205 to Leu-209 correspond to two insertions in the C-terminal part of CCoAOMT protein. The first segment which is inserted between strand β5 and helix α8, was built in the conformation of a long loop. The second segment from Arg-205 to Leu-209 is located just after helice α8, and we imposed special restraints into the Modeler program to build Arg-205—Val-208 into an helical conformation, thus extending α8 by one supplementary turn. AdoMet and Mg2+ moieties were positioned as in 1VID and are presented in Fig. 2Ctogether with the substrate aromatic ring bearing the two hydroxyl groups. At this stage, the lateral chain of caffeoy-CoA molecule could not be modeled due to the lack of information about the role of CoA moiety in substrate-enzyme interactions. Important clues concerning this point were obtained, however, from the comparison of substrate specificities of the CatOMT and CCoAOMT enzymes. Commercially available pig CatOMT and recombinant tobacco CCoAOMT purified fromE. coli cells, were incubated in the presence of various putative substrates (Fig. 3). Substrate specificities of the two enzymes were strikingly different. CatOMT efficiently methylated catechol and caffeic acid (Fig. 3A) while CCoAOMT did not (Fig. 3B). Concerning CCoAOMT, previous studies have shown that the tobacco enzyme is specific for hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters and does not accept free acid forms as substrates (18Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate which part of the CoA moiety is required for C"

Their powered wheels do far more damage than the merely passive load of the coasting wheels. Daedalus sees the force of the engine being applied first to the tyre, and only then to the road. The tyre is canted, at least at the bottom, and the angle of cant applies a force to the vehicle."
