https://openalex.org/W2092296376,"Cancer stem cells have been proposed to be important for initiation, maintenance and recurrence of various malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have previously reported that CD34+CD38- human primary AML stem cells residing in the endosteal region of the bone marrow are relatively chemotherapy resistant. Using a NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) mouse model of human AML, we now show that the AML stem cells in the endosteal region are cell cycle quiescent and that these stem cells can be induced to enter the cell cycle by treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In combination with cell cycle-dependent chemotherapy, G-CSF treatment significantly enhances induction of apoptosis and elimination of human primary AML stem cells in vivo. The combination therapy leads to significantly increased survival of secondary recipients after transplantation of leukemia cells compared with chemotherapy alone."

The cellular targets for the therapeutic efficacy are often not unambiguously identified. Here, we describe the process of ribosome biogenesis as a target of a large variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. We determined the inhibitory concentration of 36 chemotherapeutic drugs for transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA by in vivo labeling experiments. Inhibitory drug concentrations were correlated to the loss of nucleolar integrity. The synergism of drugs inhibiting ribosomal RNA synthesis at different levels was studied. Drugs inhibited ribosomal RNA synthesis either at the level of (i) rRNA transcription (e.g. oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, methotrexate), (ii) early rRNA processing (e.g. camptothecin, flavopiridol, roscovitine), or (iii) late rRNA processing (e.g. 5-fluorouracil, MG-132, homoharringtonine). Blockage of rRNA transcription or early rRNA processing steps caused nucleolar disintegration, whereas blockage of late rRNA processing steps left the nucleolus intact. Flavopiridol and 5-fluorouracil showed a strong synergism for inhibition of rRNA processing. We conclude that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis by chemotherapeutic drugs potentially may contribute to the efficacy of therapeutic regimens.

Chemotherapeutic drugs (hereinafter drugs) are used for the treatment of neoplastic diseases for more than 50 years.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6068-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) showed that accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 in UV- or drug-damaged cells occurs only if nucleolar functions are affected. Local, severe UV irradiation of the nucleoplasm could not stabilize p53 accumulation. In contrast, UV damage in the nucleolus induced a strong p53 response suggesting that the major sensor controlling the stability and degradation of p53 is located in the nucleolus, the place of ribosome biogenesis. The stability of the p53 protein is controlled by the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 to the proteasome for degradation. Strikingly, several ribosomal proteins, including L5, L11, L23, and S7 proteins can bind and inactivate Mdm2 (11Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

Conditional knockdown of these ribosomal protein genes prevents Mdm2 inactivation and p53 stabilization in 5-FU-treated cells (15Sun X.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. J. Biol.

The inhibition of rRNA transcription by knockout of the gene for the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription factor TIF-1A (16Yuan X. Zhou Y. Casanova E. Chai M. Kiss E. Gröne H.J. Schütz G. Grummt I. Mol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6068-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), blocked transcriptional activity of Pol I and consistently led to stabilization of p53. Likewise, the inhibition of specific processing steps of rRNA, e.g. after knockdown of genes required for maturation of 18 S and 28 S rRNA results in p53 stabilization (17Grimm T. Hölzel M.

Thus, functional ribosome biogenesis is an essential prerequisite for inactivation of p53 in proliferating cells. Inhibition of this process at the level of rRNA transcription or rRNA maturation consistently leads to p53 accumulation, regardless of which level of the rRNA maturation processes is affected. Stabilization of p53 is a consistent response of cells treated with classical chemotherapeutic drugs. The cellular signaling pathways triggering the increase in p53 protein levels are often not illuminated. We asked therefore, whether inhibition of ribosome biogenesis could be the basis for p53 stabilization in response to chemotherapy. To answer this question we studied the potency of 36 drugs of different chemical categories to interfere with ribosome biogenesis at the levels of transcription and processing of rRNA. Human 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle (DME) complete medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories) at 37 °C and 8% CO2. Cells were incubated with 36 different drugs at increasing concentrations. All drugs were stored according to the manufacturers' instructions and freshly dissolved as stock solutions in the solvents listed below. Prior to incubation, drugs were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and DME complete medium, resulting in 1-ml medium samples with defined drug concentrations. Standard clinical therapy protocols were used to translate commonly used clinical doses into concentrations used in our experiments. We are aware that this is a very simplified calculation in respect to the often very different pharmacokinetic behavior of many substances in patients. Nevertheless it will allow the comparison of ranges. The clinical doses are typically indicated as [mg/m2]. To determine roughly the equivalent chemical concentration in [mol/liter], we considered a standard patient having 70 kg distributed over 2 m2. We calculated the maximal chemical concentration of drug applied per day, using the molar mass of each drug in [g/mol] and 70 liter-volumes/patient, which is equivalent to 70 kg body weight (see Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of cytostatic drugs on rRNA synthesis and nucleolar integrity For metabolic labeling, 2 × 105 2fTGH cells were grown in multiwell plates with DME/10% FBS complete medium for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of drugs, freshly dissolved in DME/10% FBS complete medium, for 2 h. For phosphate depletion, DME/10% FBS complete medium was replaced by phosphate-free DME/10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated in the presence of unchanged drug concentrations for 1 h. Medium was then replaced by DME/10%-dialyzed FBS medium containing 15 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Hartmann), and phosphate-depleted cells were labeled for 1 h. Medium was again replaced by DME/10% FBS complete, drug-containing medium, and total RNA was isolated after 3 h using the PeqLab Gold total RNA kit (PeqLab). RNA concentration was determined using a Biophotometer (Eppendorf), and 1 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. After electrophoresis, 28 S rRNA amounts were controlled under UV light, and gels were placed on Whatman paper and dried for 2 h at 80 °C under vacuum suction. Dried agarose gels were exposed to regular x-ray films (Kodak), and rRNA was visualized by autoradiography. A PhosphorImager (Fuji) was used for the quantification of signal intensities. Cells were grown on coverslips with DME/10% FBS complete medium for 24 h, and then incubated with several defined concentrations of drugs freshly dissolved in DME/10% FBS complete medium for 6h. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed with warm 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 4 min, permeabilized with PBS/Tween 0.04% for 7 min, and unspecific binding was blocked with PBS/10% FBS for 2 h. Nucleophosmin (NPM), Pescadillo1 (Pes1), and Fibrillarin (Fib) were detected with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-NPM (Sigma, B0556), a 1:1000 dilution of 8E9 anti-Pes1 hybridoma supernatant (18Hölzel M. Rohrmoser M. Schlee M. Grimm T. Harasim T. Malamoussi A. Gruber-Eber A. Kremmer E. Hiddemann W. Bornkamm G.W. Eick D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a 1:500 dilution of anti-Fib (Abcam, ab5821), respectively. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. After washing with PBS/Tween 0.04%, Cy3- (Jackson) or Alexa Flour 488- (Invitrogen) labeled secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed with PBS/Tween 0.04% again, and nuclei were counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 2 min. Prior to microscopy, cells were treated with Vectashield mounting medium (Vectalabs). Digital images were acquired using the Openlab acquisition software (Improvision) and a microscope (model Axiovert 200 m; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a 100× (1.30) plan oil objective connected to a 5 charge-coupled device camera (model ORCA-479; Hamamatsu). Exposure times: Cy3 10–150 ms, Alexa Flour 488: 50–700 ms, DAPI: 5–12 ms. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in warm SDS-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Total cell lysates were sonicated, heated, separated on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Immunodetection was performed with anti-Pes1 (8E9) and anti-p53 (DO-1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-126) antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. The impact of chemotherapeutic drugs on ribosome biogenesis was studied in the human sarcoma cell line 2fTGH. To measure the impact of drugs on transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) simultaneously, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate along the protocol depicted in Fig. 1A. The primary 47 S rRNA transcript is first processed into intermediate products and finally into the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S rRNAs (Fig. 1B). This process becomes apparent, if labeled total RNA is separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The amount of label incorporated into individual fragments was determined for the primary 47 S transcript, the 32 S major intermediate form, and for the mature 18 S and 28 S rRNAs by phosphorimager analysis (Fig. 1C). Precursor and mature rRNAs were sufficiently labeled when cells were pulsed for 1 h followed by a 3 h chase (supplemental Fig. S1, lane 5). Reduced incorporation rates into the 47 S rRNA were interpreted as inhibition of rRNA transcription (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Reduced amounts of label in the 32 S rRNA and rRNAs downstream thereof were interpreted as inhibition of early rRNA processing steps (lane 3) and reduction of only 28 S and 18 S rRNA as inhibition of late rRNA processing steps (lane 4). Cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone strongly inhibited transcription of rRNA genes. Labeling of the 47 S rRNA precursor was entirely blocked by these substances. The signals for the intermediate and mature rRNAs disappeared concomitantly, indicating that rRNA processing was not directly affected (Fig. 2, A–D). In detail, the drugs were titrated from nanomolar to micromolar concentrations. Half-maximal inhibition of rRNA synthesis was detectable at concentrations >50 μm for cisplatin, >3 μm for oxaliplatin, >0.4 μm for doxorubicin, and >0.8 μm for mitoxantrone. The strong inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone was achieved at concentrations at or below clinical relevance, whereas cisplatin was effective only at higher concentrations (Fig. 2, A–D; green bars). All four substances induced a sharp drop in the synthesis of the 47 S rRNA precursor at increasing concentrations. DRB (5, 6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole), roscovitine, MG-132, and homoharringtonine blocked processing of rRNA at different levels (Fig. 2, E–H). DRB and roscovitine, inhibitors of cellular kinases, blocked early rRNA processing steps. DRB and roscovitine inhibited the occurrence of the 32 S rRNA at concentrations of >12 μm and >6 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, E and F), whereas the signal intensity of the primary 47 S rRNA was only marginally or not affected. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked processing steps for maturation of 18 S and 28 S rRNA at concentrations >6 μm, and at higher concentrations for synthesis of the 47 S rRNA (Fig. 2G). A similar inhibitory profile was observed for homoharringtonine, an inhibitor of translation (Fig. 2H). All together, the impact of 36 substances on rRNA synthesis was studied (Table 1). Ten substances inhibited rRNA transcription, four early rRNA processing steps, and seven late rRNA processing steps (for further details, see supplemental Fig. S2). We conclude that chemotherapeutic drugs can inhibit ribosome biogenesis at the levels of (i) rRNA transcription, (ii) early rRNA processing, and (iii) late rRNA processing. Short pulse labeling for 15–60 min in the presence and absence of flavopiridol or 5-FU revealed a similar labeling index for the 47 S rRNA, whereas labeling of 47 S rRNA was entirely blocked by doxorubicin (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). To rule out that the block in rRNA processing by flavopiridol and 5-FU can feedback and block the Pol I transcriptional machinery, as recently reported for demethylated ribosomal gene loci (22Gagnon-Kugler T. Langlois F. Stefanovsky V. Lessard F. Moss T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 28: 414-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar), long term kinetic experiments were performed. Cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h and chased for 21 and 27 h. After this period, label was detectable in the mature 18 S and 28 S rRNAs in control cells, but no longer in the 47 S rRNA precursor (Fig. 3). In contrast, label in the 47 S rRNA precursor was still present in flavopiridol and 5-FU-treated cells after a chase of 27 h. This observation suggests a processing block. Importantly, we also noticed an accumulation of the 47 S rRNA precursor in the EtBr-stained gel 21 and 27 h after chase. The increase of steady-state 47 S rRNA levels is a clear indication for ongoing Pol I transcription in flavopiridol- and 5-FU-treated cells. Various substances have been reported to affect ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar integrity (23Shav-Tal Y. Blechman J. Darzacq X. Montagna C. Dye B.T. Patton J.G. Singer R.H. Zipori D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2395-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 24Sirri V. Hernandez-Verdun D. Roussel P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After defining three different levels for inhibition of ribosome biogenesis by chemotherapeutic drugs, we asked to which extent does inhibition of rRNA synthesis at different levels contribute to disintegration of nucleolar structures? For this purpose, we treated cells with methotrexate, flavopiridol, and 5-fluorouracil, which inhibit ribosome biogenesis at the level of transcription, early rRNA processing, and late rRNA processing, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C). For each substance the critical concentration range for inhibition was determined (blue box) and applied for experiments, in which the translocation of NPM from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm was studied (Fig. 4, right panels). Control cells show a preferred localization of NPM in the nucleolus, which steadily diminished, if cells were treated with increasing concentrations of methotrexate or flavopiridol (Fig. 4, A and B). Completion of the nucleoplasmic translocation of NPM coincided with either the complete inhibition of rRNA transcription or the complete inhibition of the occurrence of the 32 S rRNA precursor. In contrast, the complete inhibition of late processing steps by 5-fluorouracil did not provoke the translocation of NPM into the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4C). For further results see also supplemental Fig. S5. To verify whether inhibition of rRNA transcription and early processing steps, but not late processing steps, lead to disintegration of the nucleolar structure we extended the analysis to all 36 substances and the nucleolar factors fibrillarin (Fib) and pescadillo (Pes1), which are involved in early and late rRNA processing steps. Treatment of cells with substances that inhibit transcription and early processing of rRNA all resulted in translocation of NPM into the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5 and supplemental Figs. S6 and S7). The same substances affected also the localization of Pes1 and Fib, which translocated into nuclear spot and nucleolar cap structures (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S6). Divergent from these phenotypes, the kinase inhibitors DRB, roscovitine, and flavopiridol, which all inhibited early rRNA processing steps, induced necklace structures for Fib (Fig. 5, F and G and supplemental Fig. S6H). Inhibitors of late rRNA processing steps, MG-123, homoharringtonine, cycloheximide, and 5-fluorouracil apparently did not induce an altered nucleolar localization of NPM, Pes1, and Fib (Fig. 5, H and I and supplemental Fig. S6, G and J). The nucleolar integrity was maintained for drugs without inhibitory activity on ribosome biogenesis (supplemental Fig. S7). Having defined different inhibitory levels for production of rRNA, we asked, if chemotherapeutic drugs might synergize in their inhibitory activity. Therefore, we titrated increasing concentrations of flavopiridol and 5-FU, two drugs, inhibiting early and late processing steps of 28 S rRNA. The levels of 28 S rRNA were reduced to 0.19-fold by 25 μm 5-FU (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 4) and to 0.30-fold by 150 nm flavopiridol (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 7). The combination of both drugs reduced the levels of 28 S rRNA further to 0.06-fold (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 22), suggesting that both substances might act additively in inhibition of rRNA processing. The same additive effect was seen when cells were treated with 50 μm 5-FU (lane 5), 300 nm flavopiridol (lane 8), or a combination of both (lane 23). The result indicates that 5-FU and flavopiridol block two different maturation steps for 28 S rRNA, which are uncoupled from each other. This may establish the basis for a combinatorial analysis of more substances presented in this study. The strength of inhibition of rRNA processing correlated with the level of p53 induction (Fig. 6A). It is important to note in this context that the accumulation of p53 did not inhibit transcription of rRNA genes and labeling of the 47 S rRNA precursor. An inhibitory effect of p53 on Pol I transcription has been suggested earlier (25Budde A. Grummt I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Zhai W. Comai L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5930-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The identification of the cellular targets of chemotherapeutic drugs is an important challenge for the improvement of therapy regimens in the future. Previous molecular and biochemical approaches have characterized a number of potential molecular targets, but were faced with the limitation that these analyses are usually not comprehensive. In addition, many drugs have an impact on a variety of cellular structures and enzymatic activities and affect cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis at multiple levels and often indirectly. Moreover, if a cellular target has been identified for a specific drug at the molecular level the relevance of this target for the therapeutic use could often not ultimately be determined. The lack of a general overview for a cellular system has recently been overcome in yeast: the yeast fitness data base describes the impact of chemotherapeutic drugs on cell viability dependent on the genetic background (27Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M. Koller D. Altman R.B. Davis R.W. Nislow C. Giaever G.

The growth of a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae haplo-deficient strains was studied in response to different kinds of stresses by chemotherapeutic drugs, including 14 drugs investigated in our study. The rational of this approach is the identification of cellular targets (genes) or pathways with high sensitivity to a specific drug. The results obtained in yeast are useful for the identification of cellular targets in mammalian cells, because many cellular processes of DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism, as well as the factors involved are conserved between yeast and mammals. The identification of pathways affected in yeast should help to clarify the relevant pathways in mammals. 5-FU is a potent chemotherapeutic drug described as an inhibitor of the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to a depletion of dTTP pools accompanied by a misincorporation of deoxyuridine into newly synthesized DNA and irreversible DNA damage. The effects of 5-FU on DNA synthesis have been characterized in detail (29Dornfeld K. Johnson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Kouzminova E.A.

However, mounting evidence indicates that 5-FU also has important effects on RNA metabolism that contribute significantly to the toxicity of the drug. Incorporation of 5-FU into RNA inhibits rRNA processing, post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA as well as mRNA splicing (2Fang F. Hoskins J. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell.

Butler J.S. Genetics. 2008; 179: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, haplo-insufficiency of several components of the exosome, namely MTR3, Rrp4, Rrp6, Rrp42, and Rrp46, make yeast strains extremely sensitive to 5-FU (27Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M. Koller D. Altman R.B. Davis R.W. Nislow C. Giaever G. Science. 2008; 320: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), suggesting that exosome-linked processes are the major cellular targets of 5-FU in terms of its growth inhibitory and cytotoxic behavior in yeast. This is in line with the observations that yeast cells with a functional knock-out of the exosome accumulate huge amounts of unprocessed rRNAs in response to 5-FU (34Carneiro T. Carvalho C. Braga J. Rino J. Milligan L. Tollervey D. Carmo- Fonseca M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4157-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and that 5-FU enhances exosome-dependent accumulation of polyadenylated ribosomal RNA in a discrete domain within the nucleolus (2Fang F. Hoskins J. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10766-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of rRNA processing triggers inhibition of p53 degradation, the cellular response to 5-FU consistently involves the stabilization of p53. Disruption of p53 in vitro and in vivo renders cells strikingly resistant to the effects of 5-FU (1Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Whereas there is ample evidence in the literature for targeting of RNA metabolism by 5-FU, this question has not fully been addressed for substances like oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, mitoxanthrone, methotrexate, or actinomycin D, which all inhibited the synthesis of the 47 S rRNA precursor. Several of these substances have been studied in haplo-insufficient yeast strains (27Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M. Koller D. Altman R.B. Davis R.W. Nislow C. Giaever G. Science. 2008; 320: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 28Lum P.Y. Armour C.D. Stepaniants S.B. Cavet G. Wolf M.K. Butler J.S. Hinshaw J.C. Garnier P. Prestwich G.D. Leonardson A. Garrett-Engele P. Rush C.M. Bard M. Schimmack G. Phillips J.W. Roberts C.J. Shoemaker D.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 121-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, yeast strains haplo-insufficient for genes of RNA metabolism including several subunits of the exosome, but also essential factors for the formation of 90 S preribosome as well as nucleolar RNA helicases, displayed a particular high sensitivity to these drugs. Again, this observation identified the nucleolus and ribosome biogenesis as the cellular process with the highest sensitivity toward chemotherapeutic drugs. But how can the exosome be a critical factor for substances, if the production of the 47 S rRNA precursor is blocked? A recent study showed that actinomycin D, a global inhibitor of transcription, does not block cellular transcription entirely. In exosome-depleted cells, high levels of upstream promoter transcripts have been reported to accumulate in the presence of Actinomycin D (35Preker P. Nielsen J. Kammler S. Lykke-Andersen S. Christensen M.S. Mapendano C.K. Schierup M.H. Jensen T.H. Science. 2008; 322: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Thus, an imbalance of the RNAs produced could render cells particular dependent on exosome function after treatment with actinomycin D. Besides rRNA transcription, and late rRNA processing steps, chemotherapeutic drugs could also inhibit the early rRNA processing steps required for the production of the 32 S rRNA precursor. Several kinase inhibitors could specifically block the processing of the internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1, see Fig. 1) without having a detectable effect upstream on the production of the 47 S rRNA. The targets of these inhibitors involve several cyclin-dependent kinases, which are critical for RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression. Thus, the effect of these inhibitors on early rRNA processing could be indirect. However, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (supplemental Fig. S2I) had only a little effect on rRNA transcription and early rRNA processing steps, supporting the notion that short-lived proteins are not critical downstream targets of the applied kinase inhibitors. The kinase inhibitors used in our study have not yet been tested in the yeast fitness data base. However, treatment of haplo-insufficient yeast strains with 5-FU or methotrexate identified the kinases CMK1 and YCK2 (25Budde A. Grummt I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mammalian homologues of CMK1 and YCK2 are glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1, respectively. Interestingly, roscovitine and flavopiridol are currently used in clinical trials as CDK/GSK3 inhibitors for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (36Soos T.J. Meijer L. Nelson P.J. Drug News Perspect. 2006; 19: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and high risk chronic lymphatic leukemia patients (37Byrd J.C. Lin T.S. Dalton J.T. Wu D. Phelps M.A. Fischer B. Moran M. Blum K.A. Rovin B. Brooker-McEldowney M. Broering S. Schaaf L.J. Johnson A.J. Lucas D.M. Heerema N.A. Lozanski G. Young D.C. Suarez J.R. Colevas A.D. Grever M.R. Blood. 2007; 109: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In our study, we identified different cellular levels of rRNA synthesis as targets for inhibition by chemotherapeutic drugs. This raised the question, whether combinations of drugs were able to inhibit rRNA synthesis synergistically. We tested two drugs, which affected rRNA processing at different levels. Flavopiridol inhibited the formation of the 32 S rRNA precursor, while 5-FU specifically inhibited the formation of the mature 28 S and 18 S rRNAs. The flow diagram in Fig. 1 suggests that the formation of the 32 S rRNA is a major intermediate form of the processing cascade and appears to be a prerequisite for the formation of the 28 S rRNA. Surprisingly, flavopiridol and 5-FU inhibited the formation of the 28 S rRNA additively, suggesting that the flowchart in Fig. 1C does not necessarily reflect the quantitative order of processing steps in vivo. The flowchart may depict the stability of processing intermediates rather than their quantitative importance for the entire rRNA processing process. Otherwise, a plausible explanation for the synergism is difficult to achieve. An explanation could be that flavopiridol is inhibitory for the proper 3′-end processing of the 28 S rRNA while 5-FU inhibits the proper formation of the 5′-end of 28 S rRNA. Alternatively, the drugs act additively simply because neither drug gives absolute inhibition at the concentration tested, and the fractional decrease from one drug is maintained in the presence of the other. Thus, our assay does not only identify the cellular levels for action of drugs, but also may allow the testing for their synergism. In conclusion, we have identified a large panel of chemotherapeutic drugs with an inhibitory effect on ribosome biogenesis. These drugs inhibit either the production (transcription) of the 47 S rRNA precursor or different processing steps further downstream. The question, whether the drugs used in our study act as direct inhibitors of distinct steps of ribosome biogenesis has not been addressed. Many effects are probably indirect. Combinations of drugs, like oxaliplatin/5-FU, methotrexate/5-FU, are currently used in protocols for the treatment of various forms of cancer. Whether these drugs also act synergistically in therapeutic regimens in vivo is unknown and has to be clarified. The utilization of the yeast fitness data base identified the RNA metabolism, and in particular rRNA synthesis, as a major target of many chemotherapeutic drugs. If this holds true for cancer cells, the question arises: how important is the genotoxic activity of many drugs for their therapeutic efficacy? If the therapeutic efficacy is achieved mainly via the RNA metabolism, as already proven for 5-FU, the screen for new substances with less genotoxic activity can even be considered for inhibition of the RNA metabolism, with a focus on rRNA synthesis.

However, we currently have a limited number of mechanistically distinct classes of drugs that alter the relative activities of these two pathways. We screen for such compounds by scoring the ability of >3,500 small molecules to selectively impair growth and viability of human fibroblasts in media containing either galactose or glucose as the sole sugar source. We identify several clinically used drugs never linked to energy metabolism, including the antiemetic meclizine, which attenuates mitochondrial respiration through a mechanism distinct from that of canonical inhibitors. We further show that meclizine pretreatment confers cardioprotection and neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in murine models. Nutrient-sensitized screening may provide a useful framework for understanding gene function and drug action within the context of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2109559748,"Background Cross-sectional studies suggest an association between exposure to ambient air pollution and atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between outdoor air quality and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (common carotid artery intima-media thickness, CIMT). Methodology/Principal Findings We examined data from five double-blind randomized trials that assessed effects of various treatments on the change in CIMT. The trials were conducted in the Los Angeles area. Spatial models and land-use data were used to estimate the home outdoor mean concentration of particulate matter up to 2.5 micrometer in diameter (PM2.5), and to classify residence by proximity to traffic-related pollution (within 100 m of highways). PM2.5 and traffic proximity were positively associated with CIMT progression. Adjusted coefficients were larger than crude associations, not sensitive to modelling specifications, and statistically significant for highway proximity while of borderline significance for PM2.5 (P = 0.08). Annual CIMT progression among those living within 100 m of a highway was accelerated (5.5 micrometers/yr [95%CI: 0.13–10.79; p = 0.04]) or more than twice the population mean progression. For PM2.5, coefficients were positive as well, reaching statistical significance in the socially disadvantaged; in subjects reporting lipid lowering treatment at baseline; among participants receiving on-trial treatments; and among the pool of four out of the five trials. Conclusion Consistent with cross-sectional findings and animal studies, this is the first study to report an association between exposure to air pollution and the progression of atherosclerosis – indicated with CIMT change – in humans. Ostensibly, our results suggest that air pollution may contribute to the acceleration of cardiovascular disease development – the main causes of morbidity and mortality in many countries. However, the heterogeneity of the volunteering populations across the five trials, the limited sample size within trials and other relevant subgroups, and the fact that some key findings reached statistical significance in subgroups rather than the sample precludes generalizations to the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2015425841,"Notch receptors normally play a key role in guiding a variety of cell fate decisions during development and differentiation of metazoan organisms. On the other hand, dysregulation of Notch1 signaling is associated with many different types of cancer as well as tumor angiogenesis, making Notch1 a potential therapeutic target.Here we report the in vitro activities of inhibitory Notch1 monoclonal antibodies derived from cell-based and solid-phase screening of a phage display library. Two classes of antibodies were found, one directed against the EGF-repeat region that encompasses the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and the second directed against the activation switch of the receptor, the Notch negative regulatory region (NRR). The antibodies are selective for Notch1, inhibiting Jag2-dependent signaling by Notch1 but not by Notch 2 and 3 in reporter gene assays, with EC(50) values as low as 5+/-3 nM and 0.13+/-0.09 nM for the LBD and NRR antibodies, respectively, and fail to recognize Notch4. While more potent, NRR antibodies are incomplete antagonists of Notch1 signaling. The antagonistic activity of LBD, but not NRR, antibodies is strongly dependent on the activating ligand. Both LBD and NRR antibodies bind to Notch1 on human tumor cell lines and inhibit the expression of sentinel Notch target genes, including HES1, HES5, and DTX1. NRR antibodies also strongly inhibit ligand-independent signaling in heterologous cells transiently expressing Notch1 receptors with diverse NRR ""class I"" point mutations, the most common type of mutation found in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In contrast, NRR antibodies failed to antagonize Notch1 receptors bearing rare ""class II"" or ""class III"" mutations, in which amino acid insertions generate a duplicated or constitutively sensitive metalloprotease cleavage site. Signaling in T-ALL cell lines bearing class I mutations is partially refractory to inhibitory antibodies as compared to cell-penetrating gamma-secretase inhibitors.Antibodies that compete with Notch1 ligand binding or that bind to the negative regulatory region can act as potent inhibitors of Notch1 signaling. These antibodies may have clinical utility for conditions in which inhibition of signaling by wild-type Notch1 is desired, but are likely to be of limited value for treatment of T-ALLs associated with aberrant Notch1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2060012727,"Active eukaryotic regulatory sites are characterized by open chromatin, and yeast promoters and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) typically have low intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. Here, we show that in contrast to yeast, DNA at human promoters, enhancers, and TFBSs generally encodes high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. In most cases we examined, these elements also have high experimentally measured nucleosome occupancy in vivo. These regions typically have high G+C content, which correlates positively with intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, and are depleted for nucleosome-excluding poly-A sequences. We propose that high nucleosome preference is directly encoded at regulatory sequences in the human genome to restrict access to regulatory information that will ultimately be utilized in only a subset of differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005490820,"Modulation of ribosomal assembly is a fine tuning mechanism for cell number and organ size control. Many ribosomal proteins undergo post-translational modification, but their exact roles remain elusive. Here, we report that ribosomal protein s10 (RPS10) is a novel substrate of an oncoprotein, protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). We show that PRMT5 interacts with RPS10 and catalyzes its methylation at the Arg158 and Arg160 residues. The methylation of RPS10 at Arg158 and Arg160 plays a role in the proper assembly of ribosomes, protein synthesis, and optimal cell proliferation. The RPS10-R158K/R160K mutant is not efficiently assembled into ribosomes and is unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In nucleoli, RPS10 interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 and is predominantly concentrated in the granular component region, which is required for ribosome assembly. The RPS10 methylation mutant interacts weakly with nucleophosmin/B23 and fails to concentrate in the granular component region.

IntroductionRibosomes are complex macromolecular machines composed of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins and are responsible for the synthesis of polypeptide chains. Ribosome biogenesis is thus a critical process inextricably linked to cell growth and proliferation. The production of mature ribosomes competent to translate mRNAs is a highly coordinated multistep process (1Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins, including phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, affect their characteristics and ribosome biogenesis. Increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, for example, has been shown to result in enhanced translation efficiency of specific mRNAs (2Ruvinsky I. Sharon N. Lerer T. Cohen H. Stolovich-Rain M. Nir T. Dor Y. Zisman P. Meyuhas O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Methylation is considered to be one of the most common forms of post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins (3Polevoda B. Sherman F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was shown in 1979 that 11 ribosomal proteins are likely to be methylated in HeLa cells (4Scolnik P.A. Eliceiri G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Lhoest et al. (5Lhoest J. Lobet Y. Costers E. Colson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) estimated from in vivo labeling experiments that the yeast 60 S subunit contains about 10 methylation groups, whereas the 40 S subunit has 2–4 methylation groups. The pattern of ribosomal protein methylation appears to be similar in various eubacteria, but there is a higher occurrence of arginine methylation in higher eukaryotes (3Polevoda B. Sherman F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking PRMT3 showed accumulation of free 60 S ribosomal subunits, resulting in an imbalance in the 40 S:60 S free subunits ratio (8Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bähler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, arginine methylation of other ribosomal proteins, especially in higher eukaryotes, and its biofunctions remain to be elucidated.Protein-arginine methyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to arginine (9Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). PRMTs are classified into two groups. Although type I PRMTs catalyze the formation of monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA), type II enzymes catalyze monomethylarginine and symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA). Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed that arginine methylation has important roles in many cellular processes, including RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, and protein-protein interactions (9Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol.

We have shown in fission yeast that Skb1 plays an important role in regulating cell growth and polarity under hyperosmotic stress (20Bao S. Qyang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Henkel J.

We also found that the homolog of PRMT5 in plants, SKB1, plays a role in methylation of histone H4R3 and is involved in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis (21Wang X. Zhang Y. Ma Q. Zhang Z. Xue Y. Bao S. Chong K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1934-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, overexpression of PRMT5 induces hyperproliferation, whereas knockdown of PRMT5 inhibits cell growth and proliferation (22Pal S. Vishwanath S.N. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

By forming complexes with hSWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling proteins BRG and BRM, PRMT5 can facilitate ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and is required for muscle differentiation and myogenesis (25Dacwag C.S.

More importantly, PRMT5 protein levels are elevated in gastric cancer and various human lymphoid cancer cells and mantle cell lymphoma clinical samples (23Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C. Grever M.R.

PRMT5 is also associated with tumorigenesis by suppressing the transcription of the RB family and ST7 (suppressor of tumorigenicity 7) in leukemia and lymphoma cells (23Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C.

Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6262-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation of p53 by PRMT5 also affects the target gene specificity of p53, and PRMT5 depletion triggers p53-dependent apoptosis (29Jansson M. Durant S.T. Cho E.C. Sheahan S. Edelmann M. Kessler B. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Loss of E-cadherin is a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A recent report demonstrated that PRMT5 knockdown results in elevated E-cadherin expression, further indicating that PRMT5 is an oncoprotein (30Hou Z. Peng H. Ayyanathan K. Yan K.P. Langer E.M. Longmore G.D. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3198-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).In this study, we identified RPS10 as a novel substrate for PRMT5. PRMT5 interacts with RPS10 and methylates it on both Arg158 and Arg160 residues. RPS10 is essential for cell proliferation and methylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence here that PRMT5-mediated RPS10 methylation plays a role in the interaction between RPS10 and B23, the localization of RPS10 in the granular component (GC) region of the nucleolus and in the assembly of RPS10 into ribosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionHEK293 and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Bel7402 was grown in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

GAR deletion of the GST fusion RPS10 (ΔGAR) plasmid was constructed by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGTTGATGCCTAAGAAG-3′, and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAGAATTCGGTTGCTGAC-3′, and inserted into the BamHI/SalI site in pGEX-4T-2. Methylation mutants of GST fusion RPS10 plasmid were constructed by annealing different synthesized oligos and inserting into the EcoRI/SalI site of pGEX-4T-2; R158K, 5′-AATTCCAGTTTAGAGGCGGATTTGGTAAGGGACGTGGTCAGCCACCTCAGTAAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTTACTGAGGTGGCTGACCACGTCCCTTACCAAATCCGCCTCTAAACTGG-3′; R160K, 5′-AATTCCAGTTTAGAGGCGGATTTGGTCGTGGAAAGGGTCAGCCACCTCAGTAAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTTACTGAGGTGGCTGACCCTTTCCACGACCAAATCCGCCTCTAAACTGG-3′; R158K/R160K, 5′-AATTCCAGTTTAGAGGCGGATTTGGTAAGGGAAAGGGTCAGCCACCTCAGTAAC-3′, and 5′-TCGAGTTACTGAGGTGGCTGACCCTTTCCCTTACCAAATCCGCCTCTAAACTGG-3′. For GFP fusion of WT and R158K/R160K mutant constructs, the peGFP-N1 construct was digested by XhoI/BamHI and inserted into RPS10 using primers: 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCACCATGTTGATGCCTAAGAAG-3′, and 5′-CGGGATCCCCCTGAGGTGGCTGACCACG-3′. For FLAG-tagged RPS10, a FLAG tag was added to the C terminus by PCR and subcloned into the SalI site of pcDNA3.1. Primers used were: 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCACCATGTTGATGCCTAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCTGAGGTGGCTGACC-3′. The FLAG-tagged RPS10-R158A/R160A plasmid was constructed by point mutagenesis in pcDNA3.1-RPS10-FLAG with the following primers: 5′-GTTTAGAGGCGGATTGGTGCCGGAGCAGGTCAGCCACCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGGTGGCTGACCTGCTCCGGCACCAAATCCGCCTCTAAAC-3′.PRMT5 cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems. To prepare the FLAG-tagged PRMT5, PRMT5 was subcloned into pCMV-tag 2B (Stratagene) vector by PCR using primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCGGCGATGGCGGTCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGAGGCCAATGGTATATGAGC-3′; for the GFP fusion PRMT5 construct, the same PCR product was cloned into the BglII/SalI site of peGFP-C1. DsRed fusion B23 and Myc-tagged B23 constructs were subcloned by PCR amplification from pET21a-B23 (47Yang C. Maiguel D.A. Carrier F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2251-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-GGAATTCACCATGGAAGATTCGATGGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCAAAGAGACTTCCTCCACTG-3′ were used for PCR and inserted into EcoRI/BamHI sites of pDsRed-N1 and pcDNA3.1 Myc His(−) B. For GST fusion and FLAG-tagged B23, the B23 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAAGATTCGATGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAGAGACTTCCTCCACTG-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI/XhoI site of pGST-4T-1 and pCMV-tag 2B.Purification of GST and GST-RPS10 Fusion ProteinsGST, GST-RPS10 wild type, and different mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (44Yu Y. Maggi Jr., L.B. Brady S.N. Apicelli A.J. Dai M.S. Lu H. Weber J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3798-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0). The result of purification is shown in supplemental Fig. S1.RNA Interference Vector and siRNA-resistant ConstructionRNA interference plasmids were prepared as previously described (48Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For PRMT5 siRNA, 5′-GAGAAGATTCGCAGGAACTC-3′ and 5′-GCTGACCTCCCATCTAATC-3′ were selected and designed as shRNAs in pNeoU6 vector. For RPS10, 5′-GAGCTGGCAGACAAGAAT-3′ and 5′-GAGTCATGGTGGCCAAGAA-3′ were selected and named siRPS10-A and siRPS10-B. The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into RNAi-Ready pSIREN-DNR-DsRed (BD Biosciences). siRNA-resistant RPS10 constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1 RPS10-Myc using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).In Vitro Methylation Assay with GST Fusion ProteinsIn vitro methylation reactions were performed in 40 μl of methylation buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.5) containing 3 μg of substrate and FLAG-PRMT5 immunopurified from transfected HEK293 cell extract. All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.42 μm [3H]S-adenosyl-l-methionine (GE Healthcare). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 1 h, separated on SDS-PAGE, treated with En3hanceTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to film overnight.Immunoprecipitation, Western Immunoblotting, and in Vitro Binding AssayImmunoprecipitation, Western immunoblotting, and in vitro binding assay were performed as previously described (49Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 50Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Nucleus/Cytosol IsolationTo isolation the cytosol and nuclear components, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube. Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) was added to the cell pellet and vortexed. The nuclei were spun out in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 5,000 × g for 2 min; and the supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic extract. The nuclear pellet was washed with buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine and protease inhibitors). The supernatant was carefully removed and stored as the nuclear extract.Cell Proliferation and Rescue Assay24 h after transfection, 105 cells were seeded into each well of 12-well plate. Medium was changed every 2 days throughout the course of the experiments. For each sample, three fields from each well in three duplicated wells were selected randomly, counted under a fluorescence microscope, and analyzed separately every 2 days.Protein Half-life Assay and Ubiquitination AssayTo measure the half-life of proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with RPS10-FLAG or its mutant cDNAs. 24 h later, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) together with or without 10 μm MG132 for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. The cells were harvested, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-tubulin antibodies. For pulse-chase experiments, 48 h after transfection, medium was replaced with methionine-cysteine-free medium for 40 min. The cells were then incubated in fresh methionine-cysteine/fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. Complete medium (containing methionine, cysteine, and fetal bovine serum) was added and incubated for the desired chase times. Total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (49Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Measurement of Protein SynthesisCells were incubated in methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min before labeling. In vivo metabolic labeling was performed by adding Trans35S-label at a final concentration of 50 mCi/ml containing labeled l-methionine. After 90 min, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and vacuum-dried. Total protein content was measured using the Bradford assay, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to film.Image Acquisition and Analyses24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal images were captured on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Immunofluorescent images were scanned with a 1042 × 1024 frame size, 4× zoom, and <1.0 μm optical thickness. Detector gain and amplifier offset were adjusted to ensure all signals were appropriately displayed within the linear range. Exposure time was set so that the brightest intensity reached 80% of the saturation intensity.Polysome Isolation and Polysome ProfilingPolysome Isolation48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of CHX for 15 min, and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (containing 100 μg/ml of CHX). The cell extract was prepared using 500 μl of polysome lysis buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 unit/μl of RNase inhibitor, 100 μg/ml of CHX, 0.2 mg/ml of heparin and protease inhibitors). Following a 10-min incubation on ice, cellular debris was discarded after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Pellets were resuspended in polysome buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The ratio of RPS10 in polysome/total cell lysate was analyzed with the Image J 1.36b software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).Polysome ProfilingCells were treated with CHX and lysed as described above. The supernatant was layered over a 5–45% (w/v) sucrose density gradient in ribosome lysis buffer and ultracentrifuged in a swinging bucket MLA-55 rotor at 38,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Total layers containing the ribosome 80 S, 60 S large subunit and 40 S small were collected. The gradients were next fractionated by upward displacement using a Biologic Duo-flow (Bio-Rad) apparatus connected to a UV detector for continuous absorbance measurements at 254 nm. IntroductionRibosomes are complex macromolecular machines composed of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins and are responsible for the synthesis of polypeptide chains. Ribosome biogenesis is thus a critical process inextricably linked to cell growth and proliferation. The production of mature ribosomes competent to translate mRNAs is a highly coordinated multistep process (1Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins, including phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, affect their characteristics and ribosome biogenesis. Increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, for example, has been shown to result in enhanced translation efficiency of specific mRNAs (2Ruvinsky I. Sharon N. Lerer T. Cohen H. Stolovich-Rain M. Nir T. Dor Y. Zisman P. Meyuhas O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Methylation is considered to be one of the most common forms of post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins (3Polevoda B. Sherman F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was shown in 1979 that 11 ribosomal proteins are likely to be methylated in HeLa cells (4Scolnik P.A. Eliceiri G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Lhoest et al. (5Lhoest J. Lobet Y. Costers E. Colson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) estimated from in vivo labeling experiments that the yeast 60 S subunit contains about 10 methylation groups, whereas the 40 S subunit has 2–4 methylation groups. The pattern of ribosomal protein methylation appears to be similar in various eubacteria, but there is a higher occurrence of arginine methylation in higher eukaryotes (3Polevoda B. Sherman F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S2 was the first arginine methylation substrate found for protein-arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) 2The abbreviations used are: PRMTprotein-arginine methyltransferaseaDMAasymmetric dimethylargininesDMAsymmetric dimethylarginineGCgranular componentGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseWTwild-typeLRRK2leucine-rich repeat kinase 2siRNAsmall interfering RNACHXcycloheximideSLEsystemic lupus erythematosusshRNAshort hairpin RNAEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinDsRedDiscosoma sp. red.

J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking PRMT3 showed accumulation of free 60 S ribosomal subunits, resulting in an imbalance in the 40 S:60 S free subunits ratio (8Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bähler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, arginine methylation of other ribosomal proteins, especially in higher eukaryotes, and its biofunctions remain to be elucidated.Protein-arginine methyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to arginine (9Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). PRMTs are classified into two groups. Although type I PRMTs catalyze the formation of monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA), type II enzymes catalyze monomethylarginine and symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA). Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed that arginine methylation has important roles in many cellular processes, including RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, and protein-protein interactions (9Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In humans, the PRMT family has been shown to contain around 11 methyltransferases, designated as PRMT1–11 based on their primary sequence and substrate specificity (11Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar).PRMT5 or Skb1Hs, a type II arginine methyltransferase was originally cloned as a human homolog of Shk1 kinase binding 1 (Skb1) in fission yeast (12Gilbreth M.

It was later reported to interact with a number of complexes and to be involved in a variety of cellular processes. PRMT5 methylates histones H2A, H3, and H4 to regulate gene expression (13Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol.

We have shown in fission yeast that Skb1 plays an important role in regulating cell growth and polarity under hyperosmotic stress (20Bao S. Qyang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Henkel J. Pimental R. Verde F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14549-14552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also found that the homolog of PRMT5 in plants, SKB1, plays a role in methylation of histone H4R3 and is involved in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis (21Wang X. Zhang Y. Ma Q. Zhang Z. Xue Y. Bao S. Chong K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1934-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, overexpression of PRMT5 induces hyperproliferation, whereas knockdown of PRMT5 inhibits cell growth and proliferation (22Pal S. Vishwanath S.N. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sif S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9630-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 23Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C. Grever M.R. Jacob S.T. Sif S.

By forming complexes with hSWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling proteins BRG and BRM, PRMT5 can facilitate ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and is required for muscle differentiation and myogenesis (25Dacwag C.S. Ohkawa Y. Pal S. Sif S. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Dacwag C.S. Bedford M.T. Sif S. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 9: 1909-1921Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More importantly, PRMT5 protein levels are elevated in gastric cancer and various human lymphoid cancer cells and mantle cell lymphoma clinical samples (23Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C. Grever M.R. Jacob S.T. Sif S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3558-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 27Kim J.M. Sohn H.Y. Yoon S.Y. Oh J.H. Yang J.O. Kim J.H. Song K.S. Rho S.M. Yoo H.S. Kim Y.S. Kim J.G. Kim N.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PRMT5 is also associated with tumorigenesis by suppressing the transcription of the RB family and ST7 (suppressor of tumorigenicity 7) in leukemia and lymphoma cells (23Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C. Grever M.R. Jacob S.T. Sif S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3558-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Pal S. Sif S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6262-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation of p53 by PRMT5 also affects the target gene specificity of p53, and PRMT5 depletion triggers p53-dependent apoptosis (29Jansson M. Durant S.T. Cho E.C. Sheahan S. Edelmann M. Kessler B. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Loss of E-cadherin is a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A recent report demonstrated that PRMT5 knockdown results in elevated E-cadherin expression, further indicating that PRMT5 is an oncoprotein (30Hou Z. Peng H. Ayyanathan K. Yan K.P. Langer E.M. Longmore G.D. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3198-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).In this study, we identified RPS10 as a novel substrate for PRMT5. PRMT5 interacts with RPS10 and methylates it on both Arg158 and Arg160 residues. RPS10 is essential for cell proliferation and methylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence here that PRMT5-mediated RPS10 methylation plays a role in the interaction between RPS10 and B23, the localization of RPS10 in the granular component (GC) region of the nucleolus and in the assembly of RPS10 into ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2026286389,"To better understand Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) circulation and transmission to humans, we conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, a country characterized by both epidemic and non epidemic regions. The survey lasted three years and covered 4,349 individuals from 220 randomly selected villages, representing 10.7% of all villages in Gabon. Using a sensitive and specific ELISA method, we found a ZEBOV-specific IgG seroprevalence of 15.3% overall, the highest ever reported. The seroprevalence rate was significantly higher in forested areas (19.4%) than in other ecosystems, namely grassland (12.4%), savannah (10.5%), and lakeland (2.7%). No other risk factors for seropositivity were found. The specificity of anti-ZEBOV IgG was confirmed by Western blot in 138 individuals, and CD8 T cells from seven IgG+ individuals were shown to produce IFN-gamma after ZEBOV stimulation. Together, these findings show that a large fraction of the human population living in forested areas of Gabon has both humoral and cellular immunity to ZEBOV. In the absence of identified risk factors, the high prevalence of ""immune"" persons suggests a common source of human exposure such as fruits contaminated by bat saliva. These findings provide significant new insights into ZEBOV circulation and human exposure, and raise important questions as to the human pathogenicity of ZEBOV and the existence of natural protective immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2012768611,"Tandem repeats of various trinucleotide motifs are present in the human transcriptome, but the functions of these regular sequences, which likely depend on the structures they form, are still poorly understood. To gain new insight into the structural and functional properties of triplet repeats in RNA, we have performed a biochemical structural analysis of the complete set of triplet repeat transcripts, each composed of a single sequence repeated 17 times. We show that these transcripts fall into four structural classes. The repeated CAA, UUG, AAG, CUU, CCU, CCA, and UAA motifs did not form any higher order structure under any analyzed conditions. The CAU, CUA, UUA, AUG, and UAG repeats are ordered according to their increasing tendency to form semistable hairpins. The repeated CGA, CGU, and all CNG motifs form fairly stable hairpins, whereas AGG and UGG repeats fold into stable G-quadruplexes. The triplet repeats that formed the most stable structures were characterized further by biophysical methods. UV-monitored structure melting revealed that CGG and CCG repeats form, respectively, the most and least stable hairpins of all CNG repeats. Circular dichroism spectra showed that the AGG and UGG repeat quadruplexes are formed by parallel RNA strands. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the different susceptibility of various triplet repeat transcripts to serum nucleases can be explained by the sequence and structural features of the tested RNAs. The results of this study provide a comprehensive structural foundation for the functional analysis of triplet repeats in transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1995098566,"The PLUNC (""Palate, lung, nasal epithelium clone"") protein is an abundant secretory product of epithelia present throughout the conducting airways of humans and other mammals, which is evolutionarily related to the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LT/LBP) family. Two members of this family--the bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) and the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)--are innate immune molecules with recognized roles in sensing and responding to Gram negative bacteria, leading many to propose that PLUNC may play a host defense role in the human airways.Based on its marked hydrophobicity, we hypothesized that PLUNC may be an airway surfactant. We found that purified recombinant human PLUNC greatly enhanced the ability of aqueous solutions to spread on a hydrophobic surface. Furthermore, we discovered that PLUNC significantly reduced surface tension at the air-liquid interface in aqueous solutions, indicating novel and biologically relevant surfactant properties. Of note, surface tensions achieved by adding PLUNC to solutions are very similar to measurements of the surface tension in tracheobronchial secretions from humans and animal models. Because surfactants of microbial origin can disperse matrix-encased bacterial clusters known as biofilms [1], we hypothesized that PLUNC may also have anti-biofilm activity. We found that, at a physiologically relevant concentration, PLUNC inhibited biofilm formation by the airway pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an in vitro model.Our data suggest that the PLUNC protein contributes to the surfactant properties of airway secretions, and that this activity may interfere with biofilm formation by an airway pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2016773151,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) appear to be modulated by the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived from intestinal bacteria with their respective innate immune receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We aimed to establish if intestinal concentrations of proinflammatory bacterial ligands of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5 may be altered in murine IBD models, and to characterize which of the major bacterial groups may contribute to each signal.PAMPs specific for TLR2 (lipopeptide equivalents), TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide equivalents), and TLR5 (flagellin equivalents) in human and murine fecal and intestinal samples were quantified using HEK-293 cells transfected with respective TLRs and calibrated with defined standard PAMPs. The induction of colitis in mice by dextran-sodium-sulphate treatment significantly increased colonic lipopeptide (fourfold) and LPS equivalent (550-fold) concentrations, while flagellin equivalent concentrations remained similar. The induction of ileitis by oral infection with Toxoplasma gondii dramatically increased ileal concentrations of lipopeptide (370-fold), LPS (3,300-fold), and flagellin equivalents (38-fold), all P<0.01. Analysis of representative strains of the major bacterial groups of the human intestine revealed that enterobacterial species are likely to be more significant contributors of soluble TLR2 and TLR4 stimulants to the intestinal milieu than Bacteroides species or Gram-positive Firmicutes.We conclude that the induction of colitis or ileitis in mice is associated with significant disease-specific alterations to the PAMP profile of the gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W1987109479,"Background Migration, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are dependent upon a complex three-dimensional (3D) bone marrow microenvironment. Although osteoblasts control the HSC pool, the subendosteal niche is complex and its cellular composition and the role of each cell population in HSC fate have not been established. In vivo models are complex and involve subtle species-specific differences, while bidimensional cultures do not reflect the 3D tissue organization. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the role of human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) and active osteoblasts in control of migration, lodgment, and proliferation of HSCs. Methodology/Principal Findings A complex mixed multicellular spheroid in vitro model was developed with human BMSC, undifferentiated or induced for one week into osteoblasts. A clear limit between the two stromal cells was established, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, collagens I and IV, laminin, and osteopontin was similar to the observed in vivo. Noninduced BMSC cultured as spheroid expressed higher levels of mRNA for the chemokine CXCL12, and the growth factors Wnt5a and Kit ligand. Cord blood and bone marrow CD34+ cells moved in and out the spheroids, and some lodged at the interface of the two stromal cells. Myeloid colony-forming cells were maintained after seven days of coculture with mixed spheroids, and the frequency of cycling CD34+ cells was decreased. Conclusions/Significance Undifferentiated and one-week osteo-induced BMSC self-assembled in a 3D spheroid and formed a microenvironment that is informative for hematopoietic progenitor cells, allowing their lodgment and controlling their proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2108633532,"Background The urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype H1N1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir, the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses, and indeed the evolving swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic. A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus in ferrets, the optimal model of human influenza infection. Survival rates, clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature, virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract, as well as macro- and microscopic pathology were investigated. Prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality, weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9%, abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented H5N1-induced lung pathology. When administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge, 30 mg/kg CR6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease, as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise, reduced lung viral loads and shedding, and less lung damage. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2085366812,"Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects about five million people worldwide. Diagnosis remains clinical, based on phenotypic patterns. The discovery of laboratory markers that will enhance diagnostic accuracy, allow pre-clinical detection and tracking of disease progression is critically needed. These biomarkers may include transcripts with different isoforms. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed extensive analysis on 3 PD microarray experiments available through GEO and found that the RNA splicing gene SRRM2 (or SRm300), sereine/arginine repetitive matrix 2, was the only gene differentially upregulated among all the three PD experiments. SRRM2 expression was not changed in the blood of other neurological diseased patients versus the healthy controls. Using real-time PCR, we report that the shorter transcript of SRRM2 was 1.7 fold (p = 0.008) upregulated in the substantia nigra of PDs vs controls while the longer transcript was 0.4 downregulated in both the substantia nigra (p = 0.03) and amygdala (p = 0.003). To validate our results and test for the possibility of alternative splicing in PD, we performed independent microarray scans, using Affymetrix Exon_ST1 arrays, from peripheral blood of 28 individuals (17 PDs and 11 Ctrls) and found a significant upregulation of the upstream (5′) exons of SRRM2 and a downregulation of the downstream exons, causing a total of 0.7 fold down regulation (p = 0.04) of the long isoform. In addition, we report novel information about hundreds of genes with significant alternative splicing (differential exonic expression) in PD blood versus controls. Conclusions/Significance The consistent dysregulation of the RNA splicing factor SRRM2 in two different PD neuronal sources and in PD blood but not in blood of other neurologically diseased patients makes SRRM2 a strong candidate gene for PD and draws attention to the role of RNA splicing in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2048318083,"The honeybee has to detect, process and learn numerous complex odours from her natural environment on a daily basis. Most of these odours are floral scents, which are mixtures of dozens of different odorants. To date, it is still unclear how the bee brain unravels the complex information contained in scent mixtures.This study investigates learning of complex odour mixtures in honeybees using a simple olfactory conditioning procedure, the Proboscis-Extension-Reflex (PER) paradigm. Restrained honeybees were trained to three scent mixtures composed of 14 floral odorants each, and then tested with the individual odorants of each mixture. Bees did not respond to all odorants of a mixture equally: They responded well to a selection of key odorants, which were unique for each of the three scent mixtures. Bees showed less or very little response to the other odorants of the mixtures. The bees' response to mixtures composed of only the key odorants was as good as to the original mixtures of 14 odorants. A mixture composed of the other, non-key-odorants elicited a significantly lower response. Neither an odorant's volatility or molecular structure, nor learning efficiencies for individual odorants affected whether an odorant became a key odorant for a particular mixture. Odorant concentration had a positive effect, with odorants at high concentration likely to become key odorants.Our study suggests that the brain processes complex scent mixtures by predominantly learning information from selected key odorants. Our observations on key odorant learning lend significant support to previous work on olfactory learning and mixture processing in honeybees."
https://openalex.org/W2031351113,"It is difficult to genetically manipulate the medically and biotechnologically important genus Clostridium due to the existence of the restriction and modification (RM) systems. We identified and engineered the RM system of a model clostridial species, C. acetobutylicum, with the aim to allow the host to accept the unmethylated DNA efficiently. A gene CAC1502 putatively encoding the type II restriction endonuclease Cac824I was identified from the genome of C. acetobutylicum DSM1731, and disrupted using the ClosTron system based on group II intron insertion. The resulting strain SMB009 lost the type II restriction endonuclease activity, and can be transformed with unmethylated DNA as efficiently as with methylated DNA. The strategy reported here makes it easy to genetically modify the clostridial species using unmethylated DNA, which will help to advance the understanding of the clostridial physiology from the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2091708838,"HIV protease inhibitor (PI)-induced inflammatory response plays an important role in HIV PI-associated dyslipidemia and cardiovascular complications. This study examined the effect of berberine, a traditional herb medicine, on HIV PI-induced inflammatory response and further investigated the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms in macrophages.Cultured mouse J774A.1 macrophages and primary mouse macrophages were used in this study. The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. Activations of ER stress and ERK signaling pathways were determined by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine the intracellular localization of RNA binding protein HuR. RNA-pull down assay was used to determine the association of HuR with endogenous TNF-alpha and IL-6. Berberine significantly inhibited HIV PI-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression by modulating ER stress signaling pathways and subsequent ERK activation, in turn preventing the accumulation of the RNA binding protein HuR in cytosol and inhibiting the binding of HuR to the 3'-UTRs of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in macrophages.Inhibition of ER stress represents a key mechanism by which berberine prevents HIV PI-induced inflammatory response. Our findings provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of berberine and show the potential application of berberine as a complimentary therapeutic agent for HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2022407169,"Reversible ubiquitination is essential for the endocytic sorting and down-regulation of G protein-coupled receptors, such as the chemokine receptor CXCR4. The deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH has been implicated in the endocytic sorting of both G protein-coupled receptors and receptor-tyrosine kinases. Herein, we examine the role of AMSH in the regulation of CXCR4 stability and trafficking and characterize protein-protein interactions critical for this function. Loss of AMSH catalytic activity or depletion by RNAi results in increased steady-state levels of CXCR4 under basal conditions. Analysis of truncation and point mutation of AMSH reveal the importance of an RXXK motif for CXCR4 degradation. The RXXK motif of AMSH interacts with the SH3 domains of the STAM and Grb2 families of adaptor proteins with high affinity. Cells expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of AMSH show basal hyperubiquitination, but not increased degradation, of the ESCRT-0 components STAM1 and Hrs. This is dependent on the RXXK motif of AMSH. Ubiquitination of endocytic machinery modulates their activity, suggesting that AMSH may directly regulate endocytic adaptor protein function. This is reflected in CXCR4 trafficking and provides a mechanism by which AMSH specifies the fate of endocytosed receptors. Taken together, these studies implicate AMSH as a key modulator of receptor fate determination through its action on components of the endocytic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1985098236,"Thymic epithelial cell (TEC) microenvironments are essential for the recruitment of T cell precursors from the bone marrow, as well as the subsequent expansion and selection of thymocytes resulting in a mature self-tolerant T cell repertoire. The molecular mechanisms, which control both the initial development and subsequent maintenance of these critical microenvironments, are poorly defined. Wnt signaling has been shown to be important to the development of several epithelial tissues and organs. Regulation of Wnt signaling has also been shown to impact both early thymocyte and thymic epithelial development. However, early blocks in thymic organogenesis or death of the mice have prevented analysis of a role of canonical Wnt signaling in the maintenance of TECs in the postnatal thymus.Here we demonstrate that tetracycline-regulated expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in TECs localized in both the cortex and medulla of adult mice, results in rapid thymic degeneration characterized by a loss of DeltaNP63(+) Foxn1(+) and Aire(+) TECs, loss of K5K8DP TECs thought to represent or contain an immature TEC progenitor, decreased TEC proliferation and the development of cystic structures, similar to an aged thymus. Removal of DKK1 from DKK1-involuted mice results in full recovery, suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is required for the differentiation or proliferation of TEC populations needed for maintenance of properly organized adult thymic epithelial microenvironments.Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling within TECs is required for the maintenance of epithelial microenvironments in the postnatal thymus, possibly through effects on TEC progenitor/stem cell populations. Downstream targets of Wnt signaling, which are responsible for maintenance of these TEC progenitors may provide useful targets for therapies aimed at counteracting age associated thymic involution or the premature thymic degeneration associated with cancer therapy and bone marrow transplants."
https://openalex.org/W1993150938,"Recently, three ion channel subunits of the degenerin (DEG)/epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) gene family have been cloned from the freshwater polyp Hydra magnipapillata, the Hydra Na(+) channels (HyNaCs) 2-4. Two of them, HyNaC2 and HyNaC3, co-assemble to form an ion channel that is gated by the neuropeptides Hydra-RFamides I and II. The HyNaC2/3 channel is so far the only cloned ionotropic receptor from cnidarians and, together with the related ionotropic receptor FMRFamide-activated Na(+) channel (FaNaC) from snails, the only known peptide-gated ionotropic receptor. The HyNaC2/3 channel has pore properties, like a low Na(+) selectivity and a low amiloride affinity, that are different from other channels of the DEG/ENaC gene family, suggesting that a component of the native Hydra channel might still be lacking. Here, we report the cloning of a new ion channel subunit from Hydra, HyNaC5. The new subunit is closely related to HyNaC2 and -3 and co-localizes with HyNaC2 and -3 to the base of the tentacles. Coexpression in Xenopus oocytes of HyNaC5 with HyNaC2 and -3 largely increases current amplitude after peptide stimulation and affinity of the channel to Hydra-RFamides I and II. Moreover, the HyNaC2/3/5 channel has altered pore properties and amiloride affinity, more similarly to other DEG/ENaC channels. Collectively, our results suggest that the three homologous subunits HyNaC2, -3, and -5 form a peptide-gated ion channel in Hydra that could contribute to fast synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2098973943,"Human cryptococcal infections have been associated with bird droppings as a likely source of infection. Studies toward the local and global epidemiology of Cryptococcus spp. have been hampered by the lack of rapid, discriminatory, and exchangeable molecular typing methods.We selected nine microsatellite markers for high-resolution fingerprinting from the genome of C. neoformans var. grubii. This panel of markers was applied to a collection of clinical (n = 122) and environmental (n = 68; from pigeon guano) C. neoformans var. grubii isolates from Cuba. All markers proved to be polymorphic. The average number of alleles per marker was 9 (range 5-51). A total of 104 genotypes could be distinguished. The discriminatory power of this panel of markers was 0.993. Multiple clusters of related genotypes could be discriminated that differed in only one or two microsatellite markers. These clusters were assigned as microsatellite complexes. The majority of environmental isolates (>70%) fell into 1 microsatellite complex containing only few clinical isolates (49 environmental versus 2 clinical). Clinical isolates were segregated over multiple microsatellite complexes.A large genotypic variation exists in C. neoformans var. grubii. The genotypic segregation between clinical and environmental isolates from pigeon guano suggests additional source(s) of human cryptococcal infections. The selected panel of microsatellite markers is an excellent tool to study the epidemiology of C. neoformans var. grubii."
https://openalex.org/W1991769704,"Initiation factor eIF4G is a key regulator of eukaryotic protein synthesis, recognizing proteins bound at both ends of an mRNA to help recruit messages to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit. Notably, the genomes of a wide variety of eukaryotes encode multiple distinct variants of eIF4G. We found that deletion of eIF4G1, but not eIF4G2, impairs growth and global translation initiation rates in budding yeast under standard laboratory conditions. Not all mRNAs are equally sensitive to loss of eIF4G1; genes that encode messages with longer poly(A) tails are preferentially affected. However, eIF4G1-deletion strains contain significantly lower levels of total eIF4G, relative to eIF4G2-delete or wild type strains. Homogenic strains, which encode two copies of either eIF4G1 or eIF4G2 under native promoter control, express a single isoform at levels similar to the total amount of eIF4G in a wild type cell and have a similar capacity to support normal translation initiation rates. Polysome microarray analysis of these strains and the wild type parent showed that translationally active mRNAs are similar. These results suggest that total eIF4G levels, but not isoform-specific functions, determine mRNA-specific translational efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2066723829,"Background Variation in individual behavior within social groups can affect the fitness of the group as well as the individual, and can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, the molecular factors associated with individual variation in social behavior remain relatively unexplored. We used honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a model to examine differences in socially-regulated behavior among individual workers, and used transcriptional profiling to determine if specific gene expression patterns are associated with these individual differences. In honey bees, the reproductive queen produces a pheromonal signal that regulates many aspects of worker behavior and physiology and maintains colony organization. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that there is substantial natural variation in individual worker attraction to queen pheromone (QMP). Furthermore, worker attraction is negatively correlated with ovariole number—a trait associated with reproductive potential in workers. We identified transcriptional differences in the adult brain associated with individual worker attraction to QMP, and identified hundreds of transcripts that are organized into statistically-correlated gene networks and associated with this response. Conclusions/Significance Our studies demonstrate that there is substantial variation in worker attraction to QMP among individuals, and that this variation is linked with specific differences in physiology and brain gene expression patterns. This variation in individual response thresholds may reveal underlying variation in queen-worker reproductive conflict, and may mediate colony function and productivity by creating variation in individual task performance."
https://openalex.org/W1970687439,"Characterizing relationships between individual body size and trophic niche position is essential for understanding how population and food-web dynamics are mediated by size-dependent trophic interactions. However, whether (and how) intraspecific size-trophic relationships (i.e., trophic ontogeny pattern at the population level) vary with time remains poorly understood. Using archival specimens of a freshwater predatory fish Gymnogobius isaza (Tanaka 1916) from Lake Biwa, Japan, we assembled a long-term (>40 years) time-series of the size-dependence of trophic niche position by examining nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N) of the fish specimens. The size-dependence of trophic niche position was defined as the slope of the relationship between delta(15)N and log body size. Our analyses showed that the slope was significantly positive in about 60% of years and null in other years, changing through time. This is the first quantitative (i.e., stable isotope) evidence of long-term variability in the size-trophic relationship in a predatory fish. This finding had implications for the fish trophic dynamics, despite that about 60% of the yearly values were not statistically different from the long-term average. We proposed hypotheses for the underlying mechanism of the time-varying size-trophic relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2054192588,"Nucleotide insertions that modify the C terminus of ferritin light chain (FTL) cause neurodegenerative movement disorders named neuroferritinopathies, which are inherited with dominant transmission. The disorders are characterized by abnormal brain iron accumulation. Here we describe the biochemical and crystallographic characterization of pathogenic FTL mutant p.Phe167SerfsX26 showing that it is a functional ferritin with an altered conformation of the C terminus. Moreover we analyze functional and stability properties of ferritin heteropolymers made of 20-23 H-chains and 1-4 L-chains with representative pathogenic mutations or the last 10-28 residues truncated. All the heteropolymers containing the pathogenic or truncated mutants had a strongly reduced capacity to incorporate iron, both when expressed in Escherichia coli, and in vitro when iron was supplied as Fe(III) in the presence of ascorbate. The mutations also reduced the physical stability of the heteropolymers. The data indicate that even a few mutated L-chains are sufficient to alter the permeability of 1-2 of the 6 hydrophobic channels and modify ferritin capacity to incorporate iron. The dominant-negative action of the mutations explains the dominant transmission of the disorder. The data support the hypothesis that hereditary ferritinopathies are due to alterations of ferritin functionality and provide new input on the mechanism of the function of isoferritins."

Expression of non-cleavable PrPC mutants in transgenic mice correlates with neurotoxicity, suggesting that α-cleavage is important for PrPC physiology. To gain insights into the mechanisms of α-cleavage, we generated a library of PrPC mutants with mutations in the region neighbouring the α-cleavage site. The prevalence of C1, the carboxy adduct of α-cleavage, was determined for each mutant. In cell lines of disparate origin, C1 prevalence was unaffected by variations in charge and hydrophobicity of the region neighbouring the α-cleavage site, and by substitutions of the residues in the palindrome that flanks this site. Instead, α-cleavage was size-dependently impaired by deletions within the domain 106–119. Almost no cleavage was observed upon full deletion of this domain. These results suggest that α-cleavage is executed by an α-PrPase whose activity, despite surprisingly limited sequence specificity, is dependent on the size of the central region of PrPC."
https://openalex.org/W1975645342,"Mate-choice copying occurs when animals rely on the mating choices of others to inform their own mating decisions. The proximate mechanisms underlying mate-choice copying remain unknown. To address this question, we tracked the gaze of men and women as they viewed a series of photographs in which a potential mate was pictured beside an opposite-sex partner; the participants then indicated their willingness to engage in a long-term relationship with each potential mate. We found that both men and women expressed more interest in engaging in a relationship with a potential mate if that mate was paired with an attractive partner. Men and women's attention to partners varied with partner attractiveness and this gaze attraction influenced their subsequent mate choices. These results highlight the prevalence of non-independent mate choice in humans and implicate social attention and reward circuitry in these decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2092812792,"Maternal effects—where an individual's phenotype is influenced by the phenotype or environment of its mother—are taxonomically and ecologically widespread. Yet, their role in the origin of novel, complex traits remains unclear. Here we investigate the role of maternal effects in influencing the induction of a novel resource-use phenotype. Spadefoot toad tadpoles, Spea multiplicata, often deviate from their normal development and produce a morphologically distinctive carnivore-morph phenotype, which specializes on anostracan fairy shrimp. We evaluated whether maternal investment influences expression of this novel phenotype. We found that larger females invested in larger eggs, which, in turn, produced larger tadpoles. Such larger tadpoles are better able to capture the shrimp that induce carnivores. By influencing the expression of novel resource-use phenotypes, maternal effects may play a largely underappreciated role in the origins of novelty."
https://openalex.org/W2031671504,"Colicin M inhibits Escherichia coli peptidoglycan synthesis through cleavage of its lipid-linked precursors. It has a compact structure, whereas other related toxins are organized in three independent domains, each devoted to a particular function: translocation through the outer membrane, receptor binding, and toxicity, from the N to the C termini, respectively. To establish whether colicin M displays such an organization despite its structural characteristics, protein dissection experiments were performed, which allowed us to delineate an independent toxicity domain encompassing exactly the C-terminal region conserved among colicin M-like proteins and covering about half of colicin M (residues 124–271). Surprisingly, the in vitro activity of the isolated domain was 45-fold higher than that of the full-length protein, suggesting a mechanism by which the toxicity of this domain is revealed following primary protein maturation. In vivo, the isolated toxicity domain appeared as toxic as the full-length protein under conditions where the reception and translocation steps were by-passed. Contrary to the full-length colicin M, the isolated domain did not require the presence of the periplasmic FkpA protein to be toxic under these conditions, demonstrating that FkpA is involved in the maturation process. Mutational analysis further identified five residues that are essential for cytotoxicity as well as in vitro lipid II-degrading activity: Asp-229, His-235, Asp-226, Tyr-228, and Arg-236. Most of these residues are surface-exposed and located relatively close to each other, hence suggesting they belong to the colicin M active site.

https://openalex.org/W1986491579,"Background Identification of receptor mediated signaling pathways in embryonic stem (ES) cells is needed to facilitate strategies for cell replacement using ES cells. One large receptor family, largely uninvestigated in ES cells, is G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). An important role for these receptors in embryonic development has been described, but little is known about GPCR expression in ES cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We have examined the expression profile of 343 different GPCRs in mouse ES cells demonstrating for the first time that a large number of GPCRs are expressed in undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells, and in many cases at high levels. To begin to define a role for GPCR signaling in ES cells, the impact of activating Gs-alpha, one of the major alpha subunits that couples to GPCRs, was investigated. Gs-alpha activation resulted in larger embryoid bodies (EBs), due, in part, to increased cell proliferation and prevented the time-related decline in expression of transcription factors important for maintaining ES cell pluripotency. Significance/Conclusions These studies suggest that Gs-alpha signaling contributes to ES cell proliferation and pluripotency and provide a framework for further investigation of GPCRs in ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028087228,"Background Alcoholism is associated with susceptibility to infectious disease, particularly bacterial pneumonia. In the present study we described characteristics in alcoholic patients with bacterial meningitis and delineate the differences with findings in non-alcoholic adults with bacterial meningitis. Methods/Principal Findings This was a prospective nationwide observational cohort study including patients aged >16 years who had bacterial meningitis confirmed by culture of cerebrospinal fluid (696 episodes of bacterial meningitis occurring in 671 patients). Alcoholism was present in 27 of 686 recorded episodes of bacterial meningitis (4%) and alcoholics were more often male than non-alcoholics (82% vs 48%, P = 0.001). A higher proportion of alcoholics had underlying pneumonia (41% vs 11% P<0.001). Alcoholics were more likely to have meningitis due to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (70% vs 50%, P = 0.01) and Listeria monocytogenes (19% vs 4%, P = 0.005), whereas Neisseria meningitidis was more common in non-alcoholic patients (39% vs 4%, P = 0.01). A large proportion of alcoholics developed complications during clinical course (82% vs 62%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P = 0.04), often cardiorespiratory failure (52% vs 28%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P = 0.01). Alcoholic patients were at risk for unfavourable outcome (67% vs 33%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P<0.001). Conclusions/Significance Alcoholic patients are at high risk for complications resulting in high morbidity and mortality. They are especially at risk for cardiorespiratory failure due to underlying pneumonia, and therefore, aggressive supportive care may be crucial in the treatment of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2005755798,"Background Grasping at birth is well-known as a reflex in response to a stimulation of the palm of the hand. Recent studies revealed that this grasping was not only a pure reflex because human newborns are able to detect and to remember differences in shape features. The manual perception of shapes has not been investigated in preterm human infants. The aim of the present study was to investigate manual perception by preterm infants. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a habituation/reaction to novelty procedure in twenty-four human preterm infants from 33 to 34+6 post-conceptional age. After habituation to an object (prism or cylinder) in one hand (left or right) in a habituation phase, babies were given either the same object or the other (novel) object in the same hand in a test phase. We observed that after successive presentations of the same object, a decrease of the holding time is observed for each preterm infant. Moreover, a significant increase of the holding time is obtained with the presentation of the novel object. Finally, the comparison between the current performance of preterm infants and those of full-term newborns showed that preterm babies only had a faster tactile habituation to a shape. Conclusion/Significance For the first time, the results reveal that preterm infants from 33 to 34+6 GW can detect the specific features that differentiate prism and cylinder shapes by touch, and remember them. The results suggest that there is no qualitative, but only quantitative, difference between the perceptual abilities of preterm babies and those of full-term babies in perceiving shape manually."
https://openalex.org/W2108848219,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF57 is a viral early protein essential for KSHV multiplication. We found that B cells derived from cavity-based B cell lymphoma with lytic KSHV infection display activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of ORF57 in the cytoplasm by caspase-7 at the aspartate residue at position 33 from the N terminus. Caspase-7 cleavage of ORF57 is prevented by pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD, caspase-3 and caspase-7 inhibitor z-DEVD, and caspase-7 small interfering RNAs. The caspase-7 cleavage site (30)DETD(33) in ORF57 is not cleavable by caspase-3, although both enzymes use DEXD as a common cleavage site. B cells with lytic KSHV infection and caspase-7 activation exhibited a greatly reduced level of ORF57. A majority of the cells expressing active caspase-7 appeared to have no detectable ORF57 and vice versa. Upon cleavage with caspase-7, ORF57 was deficient in promoting the expression of viral lytic genes. Inhibiting caspase-7 cleavage of ORF57 in KSHV(+) BCBL-1 cells by z-VAD, z-DEVD, or caspase-7 small interfering RNA led to increased expression of viral lytic genes and production of cell-free virus particles. Collectively, our data provide the first compelling evidence that caspase cleavage of ORF57 may represent a cellular function against lytic KSHV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2016175895,"Background Non-coding RNAs have critical functions in diverse biological processes, particularly in gene regulation. Viruses, like their host cells, employ such functional RNAs and the human cancer associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is no exception. Nearly all EBV associated tumours express the EBV small, non-coding RNAs (EBERs) 1 and 2, however their role in viral pathogenesis remains largely obscure. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the action of EBER1 in vivo, we produced ten transgenic mouse lines expressing EBER1 in the lymphoid compartment using the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer Eμ. Mice of several of these EμEBER1 lines developed lymphoid hyperplasia which in some cases proceeded to B cell malignancy. The hallmark of the transgenic phenotype is enlargement of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and in some cases enlargement of the thymus, liver and peripheral lymph nodes. The tumours were found to be of B cell origin and showed clonal IgH rearrangements. In order to explore if EBER1 would cooperate with c-Myc (deregulated in Burkitt's lymphoma) to accelerate lymphomagenesis, a cross-breeding study was undertaken with EμEBER1 and EμMyc mice. While no significant reduction in latency to lymphoma onset was observed in bi-transgenic mice, c-Myc induction was detected in some EμEBER1 single transgenic tumours, indicative of a functional cooperation. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to describe the in vivo expression of a polymerase III, non-coding viral gene and demonstrate its oncogenic potential. The data suggest that EBER1 plays an oncogenic role in EBV associated malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2045263516,"Background Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury contributes to organ dysfunction in a variety of clinical disorders, including myocardial infarction, stroke, organ transplantation, and hemorrhagic shock. Recent investigations have demonstrated that apoptosis as an important mechanism of cell death leading to organ dysfunction following I/R. Intracellular danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released during cell death can activate cytoprotective responses by engaging receptors of the innate immune system. Methodology/Principal Findings Ischemia was induced in the mouse hind limb by tourniquet or in the heart by coronary artery ligation. Reperfusion injury of skeletal or cardiac muscle was markedly reduced by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of recombinant human (rh)BCL2 protein or rhBCL2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1) (50 ng/g) given prior to ischemia or at the time of reperfusion. The cytoprotective activity of extracellular rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 protein was mapped to the BH4 domain, as treatment with a mutant BCL2 protein lacking the BH4 domain was not protective, whereas peptides derived from the BH4 domain of BCL2 or the BH4-like domain of BCL2A1 were. Protection by extracellular rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 was associated with a reduction in apoptosis in skeletal and cardiac muscle following I/R, concomitant with increased expression of endogenous mouse BCL2 (mBCL2) protein. Notably, treatment with rhBCL2A1 protein did not protect mice deficient in toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) or the adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88). Conclusions/Significance Treatment with cytokine-like doses of rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 protein or BH4-domain peptides reduces apoptosis and tissue injury following I/R by a TLR2-MyD88-dependent mechanism. These findings establish a novel extracellular cytoprotective activity of BCL2 BH4-domain proteins as potent cytoprotective DAMPs."
https://openalex.org/W1969074759,"Background Humans detect faces with direct gazes among those with averted gazes more efficiently than they detect faces with averted gazes among those with direct gazes. We examined whether this “stare-in-the-crowd” effect occurs in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), whose eye morphology differs from that of humans (i.e., low-contrast eyes, dark sclera). Methodology/Principal Findings An adult female chimpanzee was trained to search for an odd-item target (front view of a human face) among distractors that differed from the target only with respect to the direction of the eye gaze. During visual-search testing, she performed more efficiently when the target was a direct-gaze face than when it was an averted-gaze face. This direct-gaze superiority was maintained when the faces were inverted and when parts of the face were scrambled. Subsequent tests revealed that gaze perception in the chimpanzee was controlled by the contrast between iris and sclera, as in humans, but that the chimpanzee attended only to the position of the iris in the eye, irrespective of head direction. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that the chimpanzee can discriminate among human gaze directions and are more sensitive to direct gazes. However, limitations in the perception of human gaze by the chimpanzee are suggested by her inability to completely transfer her performance to faces showing a three-quarter view."
https://openalex.org/W1989340741,"The plasma membrane serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT, SLC6A4) clears 5-HT after release at nerve termini and is targeted by both antidepressant medications and psychostimulants (e.g. MDMA, cocaine). Homology modeling of human SERT (hSERT), based on high resolution structures of the microbial SLC6 family member LeuTAa, along with biochemical studies of wild type and mutant transporters, predicts transmembrane (TM) domains 1, 3, 6, and 8 comprise the 5-HT-binding pocket. We utilized the substituted cysteine accessibility method along with surface and site-specific biotinylation to probe TM6 for aqueous accessibility and differential interactions with 5-HT and psychostimulants. Our results are consistent with TM6 being composed of an aqueous-accessible, α-helical extracellular domain (TM6a) that is separated by a central, unwound section from a cytoplasmically localized domain (TM6b) with limited aqueous accessibility. The substitution G338C appears to lock hSERT in an outward-facing conformation that, although accessible to aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate-biotin, 5-HT, and citalopram, is incapable of inward 5-HT transport. Transport of 5-HT by G338C can be partially restored by the TM1 mutation Y95F. With regard to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) inactivation of uptake, TM6a Cys mutants demonstrate Na+-dependent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-MTS sensitivity. Studies with the centrally located substitution S336C reveal features of a common binding pocket for 5-HT and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

SLC6A4) is an integral membrane protein responsible for clearing serotonin (5-HT) after vesicular release, thereby constraining the indolamine actions on pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT receptors (1Cooper J. Bloom F. Roth R. The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology. 7th Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2003: 271-304Google Scholar). SERT is closely related to biogenic amine transporters of the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family that transport the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (SLC6A2) and dopamine (DAT, SLC6A3) and, more distantly, transporters for the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT-1, SLC6A1) and glycine (2Lill H.

SERT is predicted to be a 12-transmembrane (TM) domain protein that is functional as a monomer but likely exists in multimeric complexes, including transporter homomultimers (4Kilic F. Rudnick G.

SERT-supported 5-HT transport is coupled to extracellular sodium and chloride, which is thought to drive inward movement of 5-HT, and intracellular potassium, which is thought to outwardly rectify SERT (11Gu H.H.

Because of the clinical efficacy of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, significant effort has been focused on investigating the potentially compromised function of human SERT (hSERT) as a contributor to affective disorders, such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (1Cooper J. Bloom F. Roth R. The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology. 7th Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2003: 271-304Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic studies associate hSERT regulatory and coding polymorphisms with obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and autism (13Sutcliffe J.S. Delahanty R.J. Prasad H.C. McCauley J.L.

As many of the functional coding variants identified in hSERT lie within TM domains, we and others have sought a better understanding of the role that these domains play in hSERT function. In addition to its ability to bind and transport 5-HT, SERT is also a major binding target for drugs of abuse, most notably cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”). Because MDMA shares structural similarity to 5-HT, this amphetamine-like compound likely binds to determinants that overlap those used by 5-HT. In contrast, much larger competitive antagonists such as cocaine and the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are believed to gather additional TM binding determinants outside the 5-HT-binding pocket (16Beuming T.

SERT, like other SLC6 family members, is presumed to translocate substrate across the membrane using an alternating access mechanism in which 5-HT binds to an extracellularly facing conformation of the transporter, thereby triggering a conformational change that exposes the intracellular face of the permeation pathway to release 5-HT into the cellular milieu (19Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar).

The LeuTAa protein, the closest crystallized homologue of SERT, was initially crystallized with its substrate bound and with passageways to extracellular and intracellular compartments closed (i.e. an “occluded” state). LeuTAa, as well as portions of vSGLT and Mhp1, displays an inverted repeat structure, with (in LeuTAa) TMs 1–5 and 6–10 assembling in pseudo-2-fold symmetry (31Krishnamurthy H. Piscitelli C.L. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 459: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TMs 1 and 6 exist as closely associated, anti-parallel helices localized within the core of the transporter that display significant unwound portions in the middle of the membrane. In LeuTAa, TMs 1, 3, 6, and 8 form the leucine binding pocket. Biochemical analyses and homology modeling of SERT proteins predict a similar binding pocket for 5-HT (32Kaufmann K.W. Dawson E.S.

Consistent with these models, pre-structure studies identified residues in hSERT TMs 1 and 3 that confer high affinity interactions and ligand selectivity to substrates and antagonists. Whereas mutational studies of selected TM6 residues in SERT, DAT, and GAT-1 suggest involvement of this TM in substrate and ion interactions (37Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

In the current study we present a biochemical characterization of the entirety of hSERT TM6. We probe hSERT TM6 using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) to assess the secondary structure and relative residue accessibility, to determine the functional sensitivity of residues to chemical modification, and to elucidate sites of potential ligand interaction through protection experiments (40Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Our delineation of the impact of TM6 Cys substitutions on 5-HT transport as well as their relative sensitivity to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents lends support to LeuTAa-based hSERT homology models. Additionally, they provide insight into structural and functional relationships between TM1 and TM6 and offer evidence of TM6 residues bearing unique contributions to transport conformations, including substrate recognition. We discuss opportunities to capitalize on our findings for high resolution structure studies of biogenic amine transporters as well as enhanced computational modeling approaches. Site-directed mutagenesis of hSERT C109A was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit and protocol (Stratagene). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides, purchased from Invitrogen, were designed to generate single Cys mutations at each residue along TM6 from position 323 to 348. Oligonucleotide sequences used for mutagenesis are available upon request. hSERT C109A, cloned into pcDNA3, was used for mutagenesis to permit studies of Cys accessibility in a background deficient in labeling of endogenous Cys residues (41Chen J.G.

Sequencing of all mutants was performed at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the Division of Genetic Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Successful mutants were transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli cells for amplification and purified using the Qiafilter Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). Results reflect the analysis of multiple, independent plasmid preparations. hSERT C109A and hSERT C109A bearing TM6 Cys substitutions were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293-T (HEK-293T) cells. HEK-293T cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For 5-HT uptake assays, MTS sensitivity and protection assays, and transporter biotinylation assays, HEK-293T cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine and grown in complete medium. Transfection of cells was performed ∼24 h after plating; the TM6 Cys mutants were transfected into cells using 6 μl of Trans-IT (Mirus Bio Corp.) per μg of DNA in Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 100 ng/well. Cells were incubated in transfection medium for ∼48 h before assay. For competition binding assays, HEK-293T cells were plated at a density of 107 cells/dish in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 12–24 h before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 hSERT C109A or pcDNA3 hSERT C109A/G338C using 6 μl of Trans-IT per μg DNA as for transport assays at a concentration of 6 μg/dish. Cells were incubated in transfection medium for ∼48 h until binding assays were performed. Single point and saturation kinetic 5-HT uptake assessments were performed in triplicate within an experiment and repeated in at least three separate experiments. Single point uptake assays were performed as follows. Cells were washed with a modified Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (mKRH) buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1.8 g/liter glucose and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 20 nm [3H]5-HT, 100 μm pargyline, and 100 μm ascorbic acid. Uptake was terminated by two cell washes using 500 μl of mKRH assay buffer, and cells were solubilized in 400 μl of Microscint 20 scintillation fluid and counted on a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. Specific 5-HT uptake was determined by subtracting uptake obtained with mock-transfected cells from uptake of hSERT mutant-transfected cells. Cys mutants exhibiting ≥5% of hSERT C109A uptake activity were further evaluated through saturation kinetic analyses as well as MTS reactivity; mutants displaying <5% uptake activity were considered nonfunctional and were not further examined. For saturation kinetic analyses, serial dilutions of a [3H]5-HT/unlabeled 5-HT mix (1:50) at a constant specific activity were applied to transfected cells in the presence of 100 μm pargyline and 100 μm ascorbic acid and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Uptake was terminated by two cell washes with ice-cold mKRH assay buffer. Cells were solubilized and counted as noted above with nonspecific 5-HT uptake assessed in parallel at each 5-HT concentration using mock-transfected cells. 5-HT transport Km and Vmax values were derived from nonlinear, least squares curve fits using a single site model in Prism 4.0 (Graphpad). Mutant Km and Vmax values were compared with those of hSERT C109A by Student's two-way t test in Prism 4.0 with p < .05 taken as evidence of significant differences. hSERT C109A and hSERT C109A mutant-transfected cells were washed once with 4 °C PBS buffer followed by the addition of 4 °C homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). Cells were scraped into 14-ml glass centrifuge tubes, homogenized on ice using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments), and centrifuged for 10 min at 30,000 × g in a Sorvall RC-5B Plus centrifuge. Supernatants were decanted, fresh 4 °C homogenization buffer was added, and homogenization and centrifugation were repeated. Supernatants were decanted, and membranes were resuspended in 4 °C binding assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). Protein concentrations were determined via a Coomassie Plus Bradford assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Competition binding assays were performed on 100 μg of protein/tube in 12 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tubes. [3H]Citalopram (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 77.0 Ci/mmol; 5 nm final) and cold 5-HT (concentration range from 10−2 to 10−8 m final in 100 μm pargyline and 100 μm ascorbic acid) were added to the membranes, and tubes were gently mixed and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 45 min. Nonspecific binding was determined by co-incubation of samples with 10 μm paroxetine and subtracted from total binding for each sample to determine specific citalopram binding. Samples were processed on a 24-well Brandel cell harvester using Whatman GF/B filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for 60 min. The filters were washed 3 times with ∼1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), dried, and transferred to EcoScint H scintillant (National Diagnostics). Radioactivity was counted using a Packard Tricarb 2900 Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. 5-HT KI values were estimated using a one-site competition binding fit in Prism 4.0. Transiently transfected HEK-293T cells in 24-well tissue culture plates were washed twice with 500 μl of room temperature PBS/CM buffer (PBS, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated in PBS/CM buffer with/without MTS reagents for 10 min at room temperature. Concentrations for the specific MTS reagents are as follows: 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), 0.25 mm aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), and 10 mm (2-sulfonatoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (Toronto Research Chemicals). The concentrations for MTSET and MTSES are based on previous studies by Karlin and Akabas (40Karlin A. Akabas M.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) (2.5 mm) was reduced 10-fold. After incubation with MTS reagents, cells were washed with 500 μl of PBS/CM followed by incubation with 500 μl of 37 °C mKRH assay buffer. 5-HT transport activity was then assessed by single point uptake assay, as described above. For ligand protection experiments, cells were preincubated with 50 μm 5-HT, MDMA, or cocaine for 5 min before the addition of MTSET and assayed as described above. For the Na+ substitution assay, cells were washed 3 times with 500 μl of PBS/CM or a PBS/CM buffer in which Na+ was isotonically replaced with NMDG (PBS/CM-NMDG); the MTSET incubation was then performed in the respective sodium or NMDG buffer, and the cells were washed and assayed for 5-HT uptake activity as described above. 5-HT uptake activity of MTS-treated Cys mutants was normalized to its respective untreated cysteine mutant to evaluate the impact of the MTS reagent. MTS-treated and untreated mutants were analyzed using Graphpad Prism software and compared using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test. Cell surface biotinylation studies were performed to establish the functional impact of Cys substitution on the ability of each mutant to reach the plasma membrane. hSERT C109A or hSERT C109A Cys mutants were transfected in HEK-293T cells as described above. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were washed 4 times with ice-cold PBS/CM buffer and incubated with 1.0 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin in PBS/CM for 30 min at 4 °C. Biotinylation reactions were quenched by washing cells twice with PBS/CM buffer containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were then incubated for 10 min in the PBS/CM/glycine buffer, washed once with PBS/CM buffer, and solubilized with RIPA buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 250 μm PMSF, pH 7.4). Cells were shaken at 100 rpm in RIPA buffer for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation of lysates at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. A fraction of the resulting supernatant was retained for immunoblots to quantify total hSERT protein. Immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were washed four times with RIPA buffer and resuspended in RIPA buffer to achieve a 50% slurry. The remaining cell supernatant was applied to the streptavidin bead/RIPA slurry at room temperature for 1 h, and beads were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the streptavidin beads with Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Biotinylated and total protein samples were resolved via 10% SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred overnight at 21 V (constant), 4 °C, to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS/0.5% Tween (PBS/Tween) for 4 h at 4 °C and probed with hSERT monoclonal antibody ST51–2 (mAB Technologies) for 1 h at 4 °C. After multiple washes with PBS/Tween, blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) diluted 1:10,000 overnight at 4 °C. After additional washes with PBS/Tween, blots were developed using the Western Lightning chemiluminescence kit and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat Blue XB film. MTSEA biotinylation of cells was performed in the same manner as MTS inactivation studies described above with the following exceptions. Transfected cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS/CM and incubated with 1 mm MTSEA-biotin in PBS/CM for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS/CM and solubilized in 400 μl of RIPA solubilization buffer. Extraction of biotinylated proteins and hSERT immunoblotting was performed as described above. For all blotting studies, multiple exposures were captured in all experiments to ensure collection of data in the film linear range. Before characterizing the accessibility of hSERT TM6 Cys substitutions to MTS reagents, the effect of Cys substitution was examined for impact on 5-HT transport activity and transporter surface expression. As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” all TM6 Cys mutants were engineered in the hSERT C109A background, as the C109A substitution in either rat SERT (43Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or hSERT (42Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) essentially eliminates MTS reagent sensitivity while maintaining normal surface expression and transport activity. In single point (20 nm) uptake assays (Fig. 1), 10 Cys mutants displayed uptake equivalent to hSERT C109A when expressed under identical transfection conditions. In contrast, six Cys mutants (W326C, A329C, Q332C, G338C, F341C, and G342C) exhibited less than 5% of hSERT C109A activity and, thus, were considered functionally inactive and inadequate for SCAM analysis. Of the remaining TM6 Cys substitutions, four (V325C, D328C, I333C, and S336C) resulted in significantly reduced uptake relative to hSERT C109A. Interestingly, two Cys mutants, A331C and F347C, exhibited increased 5-HT uptake. Although only the transport enhancement of F347C reached statistical significance, we also observed several mutants in the cytosolic half of the TM to display small, but consistent, elevations in 5-HT uptake in these assays. Full saturation kinetic analyses were performed to assess the impact of Cys substitution on 5-HT transport Km and Vmax (Table 1). A significant increase in Km was observed in the I333C mutant, whereas a significant Km decrease was detected in the P339C, G340C, L344C, F347C, and A348C mutants. Many of the TM6 Cys substitutions exhibited significant changes in 5-HT transport Vmax. Increased Vmax values were observed in the T323C, A330C, A331C, I333C, and F334C substitutions, whereas G324C, V325C, D328C, S336C, P339C, G340C, L344C, L345C, F347C, and A348C displayed decreased Vmax values.TABLE 1Impact of Cys substitution on [3H]5-HT uptake kinetics in functional TM6 Cys mutantshSERT mutantKmVmaxμmfmol/cell/minC109A1.93 ± 0.338.89 ± 0.67T323C2.35 ± 0.8214.3 ± 2.36ap < 0.05 above C109A.G324C2.10 ± 0.446.29 ± 0.60bp < 0.05 below C109A.V325C2.96 ± 0.735.90 ± 0.75bp < 0.05 below C10"
https://openalex.org/W2053379430,"Germination of Bacillus anthracis spores occurs when nutrients such as amino acids or purine nucleosides stimulate specific germinant receptors located in the spore inner membrane. The gerP(ABCDEF) operon has been suggested to play a role in facilitating the interaction between germinants and their receptors in spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. B. anthracis mutants containing deletions in each of the six genes belonging to the orthologue of the gerP(ABCDEF) operon, or deletion of the entire operon, were tested for their ability to germinate. Deletion of the entire gerP operon resulted in a significant delay in germination in response to nutrient germinants. These spores eventually germinated to levels equivalent to wild-type, suggesting that an additional entry point for nutrient germinants may exist. Deletions of each individual gene resulted in a similar phenotype, with the exception of DeltagerPF, which showed no obvious defect. The removal of two additional gerPF-like orthologues was necessary to achieve the germination defect observed for the other mutants. Upon physical removal of the spore coat, the mutant lacking the full gerP operon no longer exhibited a germination defect, suggesting that the GerP proteins play a role in spore coat permeability. Additionally, each of the gerP mutants exhibited a severe defect in calcium-dipicolinic acid (Ca-DPA)-dependent germination, suggesting a role for the GerP proteins in this process. Collectively, these data implicate all GerP proteins in the early stages of spore germination."
https://openalex.org/W2063335978,"Proinflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. One of the cytokine-regulated pathways mediating inflammation in this autoimmune disease is the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, comprising both the induction of cyclooxygenases and the production of different prostaglandins. Cytokine toxicity is mediated in many cell types, including pancreatic β cells through this pathway. Interestingly, some cell types have been shown to be insensitive to such toxicity, and this correlated with a high expression of prostacyclin synthase (PGIS). Using insulin-producing RINm5F cells as a model for pancreatic β cells, PGIS was overexpressed and exhibited a large protective effect against cytokine toxicity. This protective effect of PGIS against cytokine toxicity correlated with a decreased activation of the transcription factor NFκB and the inducible NO synthase promoter as well as a reduced inducible NO synthase protein expression and nitrite production. A reduction in the cytokine-stimulated endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress was also found in the PGIS-overexpressing cells. Moreover, cytokine-induced caspase-3 activation and reduction of glucose oxidation and cell proliferation were suppressed. Thus, PGIS overexpression apparently protects insulin-producing cells against cytokine toxicity via suppression of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress-mediated cell death pathways.

On the other hand, research efforts focus on potential protective strategies that can counteract proinflammatory cytokine-induced β cell dysfunction and death. Among the complex mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory response are the activation of cyclooxygenases (COX) 2The abbreviations used are: COXcyclooxygenaseIFNγinterferon γIKKIκB kinaseIL-1βinterleukin 1βiNOSinducible NO synthaseNFκBnuclear factor κBPGI2prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin)PGprostaglandinPGISprostacyclin synthasePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorTNFtumor necrosis factorERendoplasmic reticulumILinterleukin. and the synthesis and activity of arachidonic acid metabolites. COX enzymes (constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2) convert arachidonic acid into an unstable endoperoxide intermediate, which is subsequently converted into several related products, including the prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α, prostacyclin, and thromboxane A2. Cyclooxygenases are well expressed in insulin-producing cells, and the inducible form (COX-2) is activated in islet cells by cytokines (10Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J.

Kwon G. Hill J.R. Marshall C.A. Corbett J.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some products of arachidonic acid metabolism produced by COX-2, like prostaglandin E2, have been shown to mediate inhibition of insulin secretion by IL-1β in insulin-producing cells (18Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PGJ2 has also been considered to cause β cell apoptosis (19Chambers K.T. Weber S.M. Corbett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E1052-E1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). cyclooxygenase interferon γ IκB kinase interleukin 1β inducible NO synthase nuclear factor κB prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) prostaglandin prostacyclin synthase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor tumor necrosis factor endoplasmic reticulum interleukin. Interestingly, it has been reported that a lack of toxicity caused by COX-2 induction in some cell types is accompanied by a high expression of prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), the heme-thiolate enzyme converting prostaglandin H2 into prostacyclin (PGI2) (20Siegle I. Klein T. Zou M.H. Fritz P. Kömhoff M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this promotes cell survival (20Siegle I. Klein T. Zou M.H. Fritz P. Kömhoff M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The action of PGI2 is mediated by specific cell surface receptors called IP receptors (20Siegle I. Klein T. Zou M.H. Fritz P. Kömhoff M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or, as recently shown, by the nuclear receptors PPARs (21Hatae T. Wada M. Yokoyama C. Shimonishi M. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46260-46267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PGIS deficiency plays a major role in various diseases including arterial intima hyperplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and tissue infarction. Enhanced PGIS expression with or without a concurrent COX-1 overexpression has been shown to control these disease processes (22Wu K.K. Liou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PGI2 produced from PGIS is generally considered to be released into the extracellular matrix. On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that endogenously produced PGI2 at the nuclear membrane enters the nucleus and binds and activates PPARδ to exert its cytoprotective action via induction of 14-3-3 protein expression, which in turn prevents apoptosis (23Liou J.Y. Lee S. Ghelani D. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inhibition of IL-1β-induced COX-2 gene expression by sodium salicylate enhances the insulin-producing islet cell function (24Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has also been reported in several studies that administration of prostacyclin analogues such as isocarbacyclin, iloprost, or beraprost to isolated pancreatic β cells and islets exerts protective effects (25Arita S.

So far very little is known about the functional role of PGIS in insulin-producing cells. The present study demonstrates an extremely low endogenous level of PGIS in insulin-producing cells and reports that overexpression of PGIS can efficiently prevent cytokine-induced cell death by prevention of NO formation as well as ER and mitochondrial stress in insulin-producing cells. The cytokines were obtained from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). Biotherm™ Taq polymerase from GeneCraft (Münster, Germany). Hybond N nylon membranes, the ECL detection system, and autoradiography films were from Amersham Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany). U51605 was from Biozol (Eching, Germany). Lentiviral particles with rat GADD 153 small hairpin RNA and lentiviral particles with rat caspase-12 small hairpin RNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). All other reagents were from Sigma. Insulin-producing RINm5F cells were cultured as described (30Lortz S. Tiedge M. Nachtwey T. Karlsen A.E. Nerup J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Elsner M. Tiedge M. Guldbakke B. Munday R. Lenzen S.

Human prostacyclin synthase cDNA (pcDNA3.1-hPGIS vector, a kind gift from Dr. Rolf Müller, Marburg, Germany) was stably overexpressed in insulin-producing RINm5F cells using the Lipofectamine transfection method. Positive clones were selected against G418, and the PGIS expression levels were confirmed by real time PCR measurements and Western blotting. Viability of the cells was determined after a 72-h incubation with cytokines using a microplate-based 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Viability was expressed as a percentage of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide absorbance at 550 nm in the absence of the test compounds. The proliferation rate of RINm5F cells was quantified by a colorimetric method using cell proliferation bromodeoxyuridine-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). The cells were seeded at a concentration of 5, 000 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Thereafter cells were incubated with cytokines for 72 h. The proliferation assay was performed as described earlier (33Gurgul E. Lortz S. Tiedge M. Jörns A. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2271-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 450 nm (reference wavelength, 650 nm) was measured. The data are expressed as percentages of untreated cells. For the NFκB enhancer element, activator protein 1, and iNOS promoter activity studies, 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h before transient transfection was performed (jetPEI™ transfection reagent) and 48 h before addition of test compounds for 6 h. The pSEAP constructs were used as described before (34Azevedo-Martins A.K. Lortz S. Lenzen S. Curi R. Eizirik D.L. Tiedge M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Secreted alkaline phosphatase expression was measured using the Phospha-Light™ system kit (Applera, Darmstadt, Germany). Activation of caspase 3 was analyzed after 24 h of incubation with cytokines. The fluorimetric method of cleavage of the DEVD was employed as described earlier (35Souza K.L. Gurgul-Convey E. Elsner M. Lenzen S. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 197: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results are presented as percentages of untreated cells. Activation of caspase-9 and -12 was quantified in control and RIN-PGIS cells after 24 h of exposure to cytokines using a Green Caspase-9 or -12 staining kit (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the instruction manual. After staining and washing, the cell suspensions were promptly read in the CyFlow ML cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany). A total of 20,000 events were acquired. Nonlabeled cells were used as a negative control and for the determination of the gates. The data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The data are expressed as percentages of the caspase-9- or -12-positive cells without exposure to cytokines. Total RNA from insulin-producing cell clones was obtained using NucleoSpin RNA columns (Marcherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The quality of the total RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260/280 nm. Thereafter, 2 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using a random hexamer primer and a reverse transcriptase. The QuantiTect SYBR Green™ technology (Qiagen), which uses a fluorescent dye that binds only double-stranded DNA, was employed. The reactions were performed using the DNA Engine Opticon™ sequence detection system (Biozym Diagnostik, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany). A total volume of 25 μl was used for the PCRs. The samples were first denatured at 94 °C for 2 min followed by up to 30 PCR cycles. Each PCR cycle comprised a melting at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing at 62 °C (PGIS) or 58 °C (CHOP) for 30 s, and an extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Each PCR amplification was performed in triplicate. The optimal parameters for the PCRs were empirically defined. The purity of the amplified PCR products was verified by melting curves. The primer sequences were as follows: for rCHOP: forward, CCAGCAGAGGTCACAAGCAC, and reverse, CGCACTGACCACTCTGTTTC; for hPGIS: forward, CCTGGTTGGGGTATGCCTTG, and reverse, TGTGGGTCCAGGAGAACGGT; for rPGIS: forward, CTGGGCCATGCCTTGGAGTT, and reverse, AGCCGTGTACGCAGATCCCA; and for rat β-actin: forward, GAACACGGCATTGTAACCAACTGG, and reverse, GGCCACACGCAGCTCATTGTA. The values for rPGIS, hPGIS, and rCHOP were normalized to β-actin. The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106/90-mm plastic dish and grown to confluence within 2 days. Thereafter the cells were exposed to the desired concentration of proinflammatory cytokines for 24 h (iNOS) or for 30 min (P-IKK). Concentrations of the cytokines were: IL-1β (600 units/ml) or a cytokine mixture containing IL-1β (60 units/ml) + TNFα (185 units/ml) + IFNγ (14 units/ml). RINm5F cells were homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline using short bursts (Braun-Sonic 125 Homogenisator, Quigley-Rochester Inc., Rochester, NY) (iNOS and PGIS). The cytosolic extracts for analysis of P-IKK were obtained as described earlier (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). For the assays, 40 μg of total protein was resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted onto membranes. Immunodetection was performed using specific primary antibodies against iNOS (NOS2 rabbit polyclonal IgG), against β-actin, or against P-IKKα/β Ser176/177 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or hPGIS (mouse polyclonal IgG, Biozol, Eching, Germany) followed by exposition to secondary peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The hybrids were visualized through chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system after a short exposure (2–3 min) to autoradiograms. Nitrite accumulation after 72 h of cytokine exposure was determined spectrophotometrically at 562 nm by the Griess reaction as described earlier (37Tiedge M. Lortz S. Munday R. Lenzen S. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Glucose oxidation in the different cell clones after a 72-h incubation with IL-1β (600 units/ml) or a cytokine mixture containing IL-1β (60 units/ml) + TNFα (185 units/ml) + IFNγ (14 units/ml) was determined at 10 mmol/liter [U-14C]glucose (1 Ci/mol) as described earlier (33Gurgul E.

The concentration of a stable product of prostacyclin metabolism was measured by a 6-keto-PGF1α EIA kit from Biozol (Eching, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism analysis program (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). The endogenous level of prostacyclin synthase expression in insulin-producing RINm5F cells was virtually undetectable, so this insulin-producing cell line is particularly suited as a model for studies on the effects of PGIS overexpression. Therefore cDNA for human PGIS was introduced, and several positive clones were obtained. To exclude a possible influence of clonal variation on the results, for further analyses two clones with medium expression levels (K1 and K2) and two clones with high expression levels (K3 and K4) of PGIS were selected (Fig. 1). The PGIS expression was estimated on the RNA and protein level as well as by measurements of a stable product of prostacyclin metabolism 6-keto-PGF1α (Fig. 1, and concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1α in cell clones: RINm5F, not detected; RIN-PGIS K1, 46 ± 12; RIN-PGIS K2, 210 ± 65; RIN-PGIS K3, 637 ± 27, RIN-PGIS K4, 670 ± 82 pg/ml/mg cellular protein). Insulin-producing RINm5F cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector were used as control cells. A decrease of 35% in 6-keto-PGF1α formation after exposure to cytokines was observed in the cells overexpressing PGIS (supplemental Table S1). But the concentration of a stable PGI2 product in the cells overexpressing PGIS and exposed to cytokines remained significantly higher than in the control cells, in which virtually no 6-keto-PGF1α could be detected (supplemental Table S1). A 72-h incubation of insulin-producing RINm5F control cells with cytokines caused ∼30 or 60% of cell viability loss after exposure to IL-1β (600 units/ml) or to a cytokine mixture (60 units/ml IL-1β, 185 units/ml TNFα, and 14 units/ml IFNγ), respectively (Table 1). A significant protection through overexpression of PGIS was observed in all of the analyzed clones, with the greatest effect in the clones with the highest PGIS expression levels (Table 1). In the case of IL-1β, a 50% reduction of the toxic effect was seen in the RIN-PGIS clones K1 and K2 when compared with control cells and virtually full protection in the case of the RIN-PGIS clones K3 and K4 (Table 1). Similar protective effects, although somewhat less pronounced, were observed after incubation with the cytokine mixture (Table 1). The use of a specific PGIS inhibitor (U51605) at a concentration of 3 μm abrogated the protective effect of PGIS overexpression (Table 1). The PGIS inhibitor caused an ∼33% reduction in the formation of 6-keto-PGF1α. Higher concentrations of this inhibitor were toxic to the cells (data not shown). The reduced PGIS activity in the RIN-PGIS cells treated with cytokines and the PGIS inhibitor resulted in a reduction of the protective effect of PGIS overexpression against cytokines (∼20% reduction of the beneficial effect; Table 1).TABLE 1Effects of PGIS overexpression in RINm5F insulin-producing cells on cell viability after exposure to IL-1β alone or a cytokine mixture in the absence or presence of a PGIS inhibitor (U51605)RINm5FRIN-PGIS K1RIN-PGIS K2RIN-PGIS K3RIN-PGIS K4Control100 ± 3 (8)100 ± 5 (4)100 ± 4 (4)fp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus cytokine mixture + U51605.100 ± 4 (4)100 ± 1 (8)IL-1β67 ± 3 (8)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.84 ± 7 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,cp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.83 ± 1 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,cp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.92 ± 1 (4)cp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.91 ± 1 (8)cp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.Mix40 ± 3 (8)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.67 ± 5 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,dp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.77 ± 1 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,dp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.83 ± 1 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,dp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.85 ± 1 (8)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,dp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.U5160598 ± 2 (4)97 ± 2 (4)97 ± 3 (4)99 ± 3 (4)98 ± 3 (4)IL-1β + U5160560 ± 3 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.76 ± 1 (4)ep < 0.05 versus U51605.77 ± 2 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.79 ± 1 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.,gp < 0.05 IL-1β versus IL-1β + U51605.85 ± 1 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.,gp < 0.05 IL-1β versus IL-1β + U51605.Mix + U5160544 ± 2 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.57 ± 2 (4)ep < 0.05 versus U51605.,fp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus cytokine mixture + U51605.68 ± 2 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.70 ± 2 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.,fp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus cytokine mixture + U51605.80 ± 2 (4)bp < 0.05 versus U51605.a p < 0.05 versus untreated.b p < 0.05 versus U51605.c p < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.d p < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.e p < 0.05 versus U51605.f p < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus cytokine mixture + U51605.g p < 0.05 IL-1β versus IL-1β + U51605. Open table in a new tab The proliferation rate in untreated RIN-PGIS cell clones was slightly higher compared with control RINm5F cells (after 72 h under control condition: RINm5F, 100 ± 3%; RIN-PGIS K1, 125 ± 6%; RIN-PGIS K2, 118 ± 6%; RIN-PGIS K3, 119 ± 3%; RIN-PGIS K4, 114 ± 4%; n = 4, expressed as percentages of proliferation of RINm5F control cells). A 72-h exposure of insulin-producing RINm5F control as well as PGIS-overexpressing cell clones to IL-1β alone did not cause a significant decrease in the cell proliferation rate (Table 2). The incubation of insulin-producing RINm5F control cells with the cytokine mixture led to a 45% reduction in the proliferation rate (Table 2). Interestingly, a significant protective effect of PGIS overexpression against the cytokine mixture-induced decrease in the proliferation rate was observed in all clones overexpressing PGIS (Table 2). The protection correlated well with the degree of the PGIS expression and was most pronounced in the RIN-PGIS K4 clone with the highest PGIS expression (Table 2). Indeed, in this clone, no significant reduction in the proliferation rate could be detected after incubation with the cytokine mixture (Table 2). Because the largest protective effects on the cell viability as well as the proliferation rate were seen in the case of the RIN-PGIS K4 clone, all of the subsequent experiments were performed with this clone.TABLE 2Effects of PGIS overexpression in RINm5F insulin-producing cells on cell proliferation after exposure to IL-1β alone or a cytokine mixtureRINm5F cell cloneCell proliferationUntreatedIL-1βMixRINm5F100 ± 3 (4)88 ± 3 (4)55 ± 3 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.RIN-PGIS K1100 ± 5 (4)91 ± 6 (4)73 ± 6 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.RIN-PGIS K2100 ± 4 (4)93 ± 3 (4)75 ± 4 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.RIN-PGIS K3100 ± 4 (4)97 ± 4 (4)80 ± 4 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.,bp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.RIN-PGIS K4100 ± 1 (4)102 ± 4 (4)84 ± 5 (4)bp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.a p < 0.05 versus untreated.b p < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone. Open table in a new tab Exposure of insulin-producing RINm5F control cells to IL-1β for 24 h induced caspase-12 and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2). The increase in the activity of both caspases could also be detected after incubation of the control cells with the cytokine mixture; however, this induction was lower than in the case of IL-1β (4-fold increase after cytokine mixture versus 10-fold increase after IL-1β; Fig. 2) in the case of caspase-3. The activation of caspase-3 was almost completely abolished by overexpression of PGIS in the RIN-PGIS K4 clone (Fig. 2). Camptothecin (0.5 μm) induced caspase-3 activation in both control and PGIS K4 clones, indicating that the protective effect was specific for cytokine-mediated toxicity. PGIS overexpression completely blocked cytokine-induced caspase-12 activation but not the camptothecin-induced caspase-12 activation (Fig. 2). In the case of caspase-9 activation, PGIS overexpression diminished cytokine-induced activation but did not prevent the activation induced by camptothecin (Fig. 2). Because a complete prevention of caspase-12 activation in PGIS-overexpressing cells was observed, which is thought to be induced by ER stress, CHOP gene expression was analyzed in untreated and cytokine-treated control and PGIS-overexpressing cells. In RINm5F control cells a 2-fold induction after IL-1β and a 3-fold induction after a cytokine mix was observed. This cytokine-stimulated CHOP gene expression was almost completely prevented by the overexpression of PGIS (Fig. 3). In contrast to PGIS overexpression, the reduction of ER stress (by a use of small hairpin RNA-CHOP ∼65% or small hairpin RNA-caspase-12 ∼60% reduction) in control experiments resulted only in a weak protection against cytokine toxicity (supplemental Table S2). As expected, incubation of insulin-producing RINm5F control cells with cytokines stimulated NFκB activation (2-fold increase; Table 3). In contrast, there was no induction of NFκB activation in the RIN-PGIS K4 clone (Table 3). The prevention of NFκB activation in RIN-PGIS K4 clone went along with a reduction of IKK phosphorylation by cytokines. This effect was particularly prominent in the case of the cytokine mixture (supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, cytokine-induced activator protein 1 activation in both control and PGIS K4 clones did not differ significantly (Table 3).TABLE 3Effects of PGIS overexpression on cytokine-induced NFκB, activator protein 1, and iNOS promoter activation and nitrite production in RINm5F insulin-producing cell clonesRINm5F cell cloneRINm5FRIN-PGIS K4NFκB (% of untreated)Untreated100 ± 2 (4)100 ± 1 (4)IL-1β217 ± 23 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.111 ± 5 (4)bp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.Mix190 ± 19 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.119 ± 15 (4)cp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.AP-1 (% of untreated)Untreated100 ± 1 (6)100 ± 1 (6)IL-1β125 ± 6 (6)110 ± 20 (6)Mix129 ± 10 (6)94 ± 18 (6)iNOS promoter (% of untreated)Untreated100 ± 1 (4)100 ± 3 (4)IL-1β422 ± 49 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.144 ± 9 (4)bp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.Mix531 ± 91 (4)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.182 ± 19 (4)cp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.Nitrite (pmol/μg protein)Untreated0 ± 0 (6)0 ± 0 (6)IL-1β3.9 ± 0.5 (6)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.0 ± 0 (6)bp < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.Mix5.5 ± 0.7 (6)ap < 0.05 versus untreated.0 ± 0 (6)cp < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone.a p < 0.05 versus untreated.b p < 0.05 IL-1β versus control clone.c p < 0.05 cytokine mixture versus control clone."
https://openalex.org/W1994077412,"Ufd2 is the founding member of E4 enzymes that are specifically involved in ubiquitin chain elongation but whose roles in proteolysis remain scarce. Here, using a genome-wide screen, we identified one cellular target of yeast Ufd2 as the membrane protein Pex29. The ubiquitin chains assembled on Pex29 in vivo by Ufd2 mainly contain Lys-48 linkages. We found that the ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase for overexpressed Pex29 is Doa10, which is known to be involved in protein quality control. Interestingly, not all Doa10 substrates are regulated by Ufd2, suggesting that E4 involvement is not specific to a particular E3, but may depend on the spatial arrangement of the E3-substrate interaction. Cells lacking UFD2 elicit an unfolded protein response, expanding the physiological function of Ufd2. Our results lead to novel insights into the biological role of Ufd2 and further underscore the significance of Ufd2 in proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2009438187,"The Escherichia coli version of the mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) system is required for biogenesis of membrane proteins and contains two essential proteins: the SRP subunit Ffh and the SRP-receptor FtsY. Scattered in vivo studies have raised the possibility that expression of membrane proteins is inhibited in cells depleted of FtsY, whereas Ffh-depletion only affects their assembly. These differential results are surprising in light of the proposed model that FtsY and Ffh play a role in the same pathway of ribosome targeting to the membrane. Therefore, we decided to evaluate these unexpected results systematically.We characterized the following aspects of membrane protein biogenesis under conditions of either FtsY- or Ffh-depletion: (i) Protein expression, stability and localization; (ii) mRNA levels; (iii) folding and activity. With FtsY, we show that it is specifically required for expression of membrane proteins. Since no changes in mRNA levels or membrane protein stability were detected in cells depleted of FtsY, we propose that its depletion may lead to specific inhibition of translation of membrane proteins. Surprisingly, although FtsY and Ffh function in the same pathway, depletion of Ffh did not affect membrane protein expression or localization.Our results suggest that indeed, while FtsY-depletion affects earlier steps in the pathway (possibly translation), Ffh-depletion disrupts membrane protein biogenesis later during the targeting pathway by preventing their functional assembly in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2127547346,"Previous studies indicated that EAF (ELL-associated factor) family members, EAF1 and EAF2/U19, play a role in cancer and embryogenesis. For example, EAF2/U19 may serve as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. At the same time, EAF2/U19 is a downstream factor in the non-canonical Wnt 4 signaling pathway required for eye development in Xenopus laevis, and along with EAF1, contributes to convergence and extension movements in zebrafish embryos through Wnt maintenance. Here, we used zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells to show that both EAF1 and EAF2/U19 were up-regulated by Wnt4 (Wnt4a). Furthermore, we found that EAF1 and EAF2/U19 suppressed Wnt4 expression by directly binding to the Wnt4 promoter as seen in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These findings indicate that an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop occurs between Wnt4 and the EAF family, which is conserved between zebrafish and mammalian. The rescue experiments in zebrafish embryos showed that early embryonic development required the maintenance of the appropriate levels of Wnt4a through the feedback loop. Others have demonstrated that the tumor suppressors p63, p73 and WT1 positively regulate Wnt4 expression while p21 has the opposite effect, suggesting that maintenance of appropriate Wnt4 expression may also be critical for adult tissue homeostasis and prevention against tumor initiation. Thus, the auto-regulatory negative feedback loop that controls expression of Wnt4 and EAF proteins may play an important role in both embryonic development and tumor suppression. Our findings provide the first convincing line of evidence that EAF and Wnt4 form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2145029160,"Background Of all organs and tissues in adult mammals, the brain shows the most limited regeneration and recovery after injury. This is one reason why treating neurological damage such as ischemic injury after stroke presents such a challenge. Here we report a novel mode of regeneration which the slug's cognitive center, the procerebrum, shows after surgical lesioning in the adult. It is well known that the land slug Limax possesses the capacity to demonstrate conditioned food aversion. This learning ability critically depends on the procerebrum, which is the higher olfactory center in the brain of the terrestrial mollusk. Principal Findings In the present study, after a 1-month recovery period post-surgical lesioning of the procerebrum we investigated whether the brain of the slug shows recovery from damage. We found that learning ability, local field potential oscillation, and the number of cells in the procerebrum (PC) all recovered spontaneously within 1 month of bilateral lesioning of the PC. Moreover, neurogenesis was enhanced in the lesioned PC. However, memory acquired before the surgery could not be retrieved 1 month after surgery although the procerebrum had recovered from injury by this time, consistent with the notion that the procerebrum is the storage site of odor-aversion memory, or deeply involved in the memory recall process. Significance Our findings are the first to demonstrate that a brain region responsible for the associative memory of an adult organism can spontaneously reconstitute itself, and can recover its function following injury."
https://openalex.org/W2078105812,"Background and Methods In this study, we utilized a combination of low oxygen tension and a novel anti-oxidant, 4-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-derivative (DHP-d) to directly induce adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSC) to de-differentiate into more primitive stem cells. De-differentiated ATSCs was overexpress stemness genes, Rex-1, Oct-4, Sox-2, and Nanog. Additionally, demethylation of the regulatory regions of Rex-1, stemnesses, and HIF1α and scavenging of reactive oxygen species were finally resulted in an improved stem cell behavior of de-differentiate ATSC (de-ATSC). Proliferation activity of ATSCs after dedifferentiation was induced by REX1, Oct4, and JAK/STAT3 directly or indirectly. De-ATSCs showed increased migration activity that mediated by P38/JUNK and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, regenerative efficacy of de-ATSC engrafted spinal cord-injured rats and chemical-induced diabetes animals were significantly restored their functions. Conclusions/Significance Our stem cell remodeling system may provide a good model which would provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ATSC proliferation and transdifferentiation. Also, these multipotent stem cells can be harvested may provide us with a valuable reservoir of primitive and autologous stem cells for use in a broad spectrum of regenerative cell-based disease therapy."

Whereas AF9 is found in the nucleus where it interacts with the histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase, Dot1, AF9 is also present in the cytoplasm.

AF9/MLLT3 is a proline-, serine-rich protein of 568 amino acids and contains a KKRKK (amino acids 296–300) nuclear localization sequence, features that are typical of many transcription factors. Nevertheless, the function of AF9 is incompletely characterized. AF9 was first identified as one of the 60+ fusion partners of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) 2The abbreviations used are: MLLmixed lineage leukemiaATPγSadenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphateELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineqPCRquantitative polymerase chain reactionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assay. gene that result from translocations at the 11q23 locus.

AF9 shares sequence similarity to TFG3/TAF30/ANC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a 29-kDa component of SWI/SNF, TFIID, and TFIIF complexes in yeast, which suggests that it may function to promote transcription (4Cairns B.R.

In addition to the aforementioned proteins, mass spectroscopy analysis of protein complexes containing the AF9 homolog ENL reveal an even wider array of gene regulatory proteins including BCoR, CBX8/Pc3, and RING1. Rather than forming a large complex comprised of all of the proteins known to associate with ENL, gel filtration experiments indicate that individual ENL-containing complexes range from 230–600 kDa and thus must contain only discrete subsets of these proteins (12Mueller D.

Mice with homozygous deletion of the Af9 gene survive gestation but have homeotic skeletal anomalies and die shortly after birth. The skeletal defects are similar to mice with null mutations of Cdx1, a regulator of Hox gene expression. Thus, it has been suggested that Af9 is also a “master regulator” of Hox gene expression in mice (13Collins E.C. Appert A. Ariza-McNaughton L. Pannell R. Yamada Y. Rabbitts T.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7313-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AF9 is highly expressed in human hematopoietic stem cells and experimental manipulation of AF9 in hematopoietic precursors alters erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. Reporter gene assays indicate that AF9 stimulates expression of the GATA1 transcription factor through the HS1 enhancer element (14Pina C. May G. Soneji S. Hong D. Enver T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 6: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although these findings provide strong support for a role of AF9 in normal hematopoiesis, the hematologic status of Af9-null mice has not been reported. Whereas AF9 likely serves an important function in regulating the expression of multiple genes, perhaps the best characterized target is the epithelial sodium channel gene α (ENaCα). In this case, AF9 interacts with Dot1 to enhance the H3K79me3 mark at the ENaCα promoter and represses gene expression. Interestingly, this is in contrast to the canonical H3K79 methylation mark, which is typically present within the body of the gene and is associated with transcriptional elongation and active gene expression. Aldosterone treatment of renal collecting duct cells triggers phosphorylation of AF9 impairing the binding of Dot1 and leads to hypomethylation of the ENaCα promoter. Aldosterone thus stimulates ENaCα expression in the renal-collecting duct through an AF9-Dot1-controlled pathway (8Zhang W. Xia X. Reisenauer M.R. Rieg T. Lang F. Kuhl D. Vallon V. Kone B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 3: 773-783Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Data indicate that AF9 alternatively binds to several different proteins and contributes to the activity of distinct gene regulatory complexes. Factors that facilitate the assembly of differing AF9-containing complexes have not been described but here we show that AF9 is a client protein of the molecular chaperone Hsp90. In addition to an important role in nuclear import of steroid receptors, Hsp90 is increasingly recognized as an effector of transcriptional activation through diverse mechanisms (11Issacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Hsp90 is required for the rapid nucleosome remodeling that occurs with GAL gene induction (15Floer M. Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition to directly affecting transcriptional machinery, Hsp90 is required for the proper function of signaling molecules that, in turn, regulate gene expression (17Truman A.W. Millson S.H. Nuttall J.M. King V. Mollapour M. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Piper P.W. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We propose that Hsp90 contributes to the normal activity of AF9. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to mislocalization of AF9 protein and impaired regulation of the AF9 target gene ENaCα. cDNA-encoding residues 475–568 of AF9 was cloned into pFLAG-MAC (Sigma) to generate pFLAG-AF9-ct. This plasmid construct was transformed into BL21 bacterial cells (Invitrogen) for protein expression. Following induction of protein expression with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cell pellets were collected and resuspended in bacterial lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were lysed using a French Press and debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and diluted 1:5 with the lysis buffer containing no NaCl (final concentration of NaCl, 200 mm). The FLAG-tagged protein was affinity purified using M2 FLAG agarose resin (Sigma). The bound, purified protein was eluted using 50 mm FLAG peptide and then concentrated using 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff (MWCO) Centricon centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). THP-1, HeLa (both ATCC), or IMCD3 cells (gift of Samir El-Dahr, Tulane University) were harvested by centrifugation. In some cases, cells were first transfected with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) to express FLAG-tagged full-length AF9 as previously described (18Hemeway C.S. de Erkenez A.C. Gould G.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3798-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were gently resuspended in 250 μl of mammalian lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X) per 106 cells. Cells were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble debris. FLAG-tagged recombinant AF9 proteins were covalently linked to agarose beads using Amino-Link resin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysate from THP-1 leukemia cells was passed over the column and bound proteins were eluted using 1 m NaCl or 100 mm glycine buffer. Eluent was concentrated using a 3-kDa MWCO spin column (Millipore). Proteins were boiled in Laemmli buffer and then separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS gels (Invitrogen). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and visible bands were excised and sent for mass spectroscopy analysis at the proteomics core facility at Louisiana State University in New Orleans. 96-well M2 Plates (Sigma) were blocked with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Triton-X. 100 μl of a 50 mm solution of recombinant FLAG-AF9 was added to individual wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times in between each step with DPBS containing 0.1% Triton-X. 100 μl of 100 mm purified recombinant Hsp90 (Stressgen) was added to wells with or without 5 mm ATPγS (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Competition was carried out by adding a 0–8 μmol gradient of FLAG-AF9 or FLAG peptide to the wells and incubating overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then washed with blocking buffer before addition of the primary antibody. A 1:2500 dilution of a rabbit-derived anti-Hsp90 antibody (Stressgen) in 1% BSA with 0.1% Triton X was added to the wells and allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. A 1:5000 dilution of a secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added. Wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Triton X-100. SureBlue (KPL) was added to obtain a colorimetric signal, and the reaction was stopped with 1 n HCl. Absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 650 nm wavelength and normalized to the signal obtained without competitor. Each sample was run in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. Antibodies against Hsp90 α/β, Hsp90 β, Hsp90 α, Hsp70, p60/HOP (all Stressgen), AF9 (Novus), FLAG (Sigma), β-actin (Sigma), and IgG control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were employed. A dilution of 1:1000–1:2500 was used for immunoprecipitation. The resulting antibody-protein complex was then recovered using either protein A- or protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). Agarose beads were washed twice in PBS before Laemmli buffer was added. The mixture was boiled and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using iBlot (Invitrogen) and were probed using appropriate primary antibodies as indicated in the text. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE). IMCD3 cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides at 5000 cells per well. Cells were treated overnight with either mouse Hsp90 α/β siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-35610) or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol, or with 2 μm 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) (AG Scientific), or with 500 μm novobiocin (Sigma). Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and then permeabilized with 50 mm ammonium chloride, 0.1% Triton X. Wells were blocked with DPBS, 5% BSA + 0.1% Triton X before primary antibody was added at a dilution of 1:2500 in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X. Cells were washed three times with DPBS, 0.1% Triton X in between each step. AlexaFluor 488- or 563-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:5000 in DPBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X. PROLONG Gold antifade with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) was applied to the slides before being examined using a 3 color Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. IMCD3 cells were treated overnight with either Hsp90 siRNA, 17AAG or novobiocin. Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was converted into cDNA using SS III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). 200 ng of total cDNA was used in the qPCR reaction along with primers against GAPDH (F: GCA CCG TCA AGG CTG AGA AC, R: GCC TTC TCC ATG GTG GTG AA) and ENaCα (F: CTA ATG ATG CTG GAC CAC ACC, R: AAA GCG TCT GCT CCG TGA TGC). Reactions were performed with SYBR Green Supermix with ROX according to kit instructions (Bio-Rad). IMCD3 cells were treated overnight with either Hsp90 siRNA, control siRNA, 17AAG, or novobiocin. Cells were fixed by adding 670 μl of 32% formaldehyde to 10 ml of medium for a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. Cells were fixed for 10 min and excess formaldehyde was quenched with 1 ml of 10× glycine (4.7 g of glycine in 50 ml of deionized water). Cells were collected, spun, and frozen overnight at −80 °C. Cells were lysed to collect the nuclear fraction which was subjected to sonication of 4 pulses of 15 s each. The resulting lysate was collected and immunoprecipitated using Hsp90 α/β and AF9 antibodies. Primers for PCR amplification of the ENaCα promoter (gift of Wenzheng Zhang, UT-Houston) are described in Ref. 6Zhang W. Xia X. Reisenauer M.R. Hemenway C.S. Kone B.C. J. Biol.

Following PCR amplification, samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using Image J software from NIH. MLL-AF9 chimeric oncoproteins are comprised of the C terminus of AF9 fused to the N-terminal portion of MLL. In experimental systems, the C-terminal ∼90 amino acids of AF9 and the highly homologous protein ENL have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for MLL-mediated leukemic transformation (19Corral J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37181-37186Google Scholar). No structural or enzymatic functions have been attributed to the C terminus of either AF9 or ENL although several proteins have been identified that bind this region (7Bitoun E. Oliver P.L. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3395-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used affinity purification to isolate additional factors that associate with immobilized recombinant AF9 C terminus protein (AF9-ct) comprised of amino acids 475–568 of AF9. Total cell lysates were prepared from the leukemia cell line THP-1 that expresses an MLL-AF9 oncogene. Lysates were pre-absorbed on an immobilized FLAG peptide resin and then passed over a FLAG-AF9-ct column. Bound proteins were eluted with either 1 m NaCl or 100 mm glycine buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 shows the resulting Coomassie Blue-stained gel with six distinct bands ranging from ∼40 to 100 kDa. These bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, four of the bands contained cytoskeleton-associated proteins whose relationship to AF9 is currently being studied. A fifth band, migrating at ∼85 kDa, was identified as the β isoform of Hsp90. Importantly, in an independent yeast two-hybrid screen of AF9-ct-interacting proteins, we previously isolated the closely related α isoform of Hsp90 (data not shown). To test if the interaction between AF9 and Hsp90 is direct and not mediated through members of a multiprotein complex, purified AF9-ct and Hsp90 were used in a direct binding assay. Bacterially expressed FLAG-AF9-ct was added to purified recombinant human Hsp90β in the presence and absence of ATPγS. Protein complexes were recovered by anti-Hsp90 immunoprecipitation. FLAG-AF9-ct was found only in immunoprecipitates of reactions containing Hsp90 and ATPγS (Fig. 2A). These data provide evidence of a direct interaction between Hsp90 and AF9 that does not require additional protein factors. Consistent with other Hsp90 client proteins, binding does require ATP. Using the purified recombinant proteins described above, we measured the dissociation constant of Hsp90 and AF9. FLAG-AF9-ct was immobilized in 96-well plates and an ELISA was performed with anti-Hsp90 antibodies to detect Hsp90 binding. Hsp90 was displaced from the immobilized FLAG-AF9-ct by free FLAG-AF9-ct allowing a determination of the Kd. With this competitive ELISA system, the Kd was calculated to be ∼3.5 μm a value comparable to other Hsp90-client protein complexes (Fig. 2B) (25Blatch G.L. Networking of Chaperones by Co-chaperones.

The Kd calculation takes into account Hsp90 homodimerization as Hsp90 has been shown to bind to client proteins as homodimer (29Wayne N. Bolon D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35386-35395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between Hsp90 and a full-length AF9 molecule in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cells expressing either FLAG-tagged AF9 or the FLAG tag alone. When endogenous Hsp90 is precipitated with anti-Hsp90 antibodies recognizing both α and β isoforms, FLAG-tagged AF9 is recovered in the immune complexes (Fig. 3A). This indicates that full-length AF9 interacts with Hsp90 in living cells. However, as the FLAG-AF9 in this experiment was produced from a CMV promoter-driven expression vector, the observed association with Hsp90 was further confirmed with physiologic levels of AF9 protein. Endogenous AF9 and Hsp90 were co-precipitated with a polyclonal Hsp90 antibody. In both HeLa and IMCD3 cell extracts, endogenous AF9 was detected in immune complexes with endogenous Hsp90 (Fig. 3B). These findings reveal that Hsp90 and AF9 interact under physiological conditions. From our initial experiments, we found both isoforms of Hsp90 are able to interact with AF9; the α isoform was found in a yeast two hybrid screen of AF9-interacting proteins and the β isoform was recovered using AF9 column purification. Immunoprecipitation using isoform-specific antibodies was performed to confirm these preliminary results and to verify that AF9 binds both isoforms in living cells. These experiments showed that both isoforms stably associate with AF9 under the conditions used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C). Several transcription factors including the glucocorticoid receptor, STAT3, and p53 (35Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Stackhouse B.L. He C. Appl. Theor.

Cell Biol. 2009; 88: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are found within heteromeric complexes containing Hsp90 as well as Hsp70 and p60/Hop. These multiprotein complexes collaborate in the cellular trafficking and nuclear import of the client transcription factors. In S. cerevisiae, Hsp90, Hsp70, and the yeast homolog of p60/Hop, Sti1, promote removal of nucleosomes to activate GAL1 gene expression (15Floer M. Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the Hsp90-Hsp70-p60 complex facilitates a variety of dynamic nuclear processes. Below, we show that the subcellular distribution of AF9 is affected by manipulating Hsp90 thus raising the possibility that AF9 exists within Hsp90-Hsp70-p60 heteromeric complexes that help direct the protein to specific subcellular compartments. To test whether AF9 is a component of Hsp70-p60-containing complexes, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with Hsp70 and p60/Hop antibodies using IMCD3 cell lysates (Fig. 4). When the resulting Hsp70 and p60/Hop immune precipitates were analyzed by Western blot, we detected AF9. Although this finding does not exclude the possibility that AF9 individually and mutually exclusively binds Hsp90, Hsp70, and p60/Hop, we believe that the most likely explanation is that AF9 is part of an Hsp90-Hsp70-p60 chaperone complex. To test the significance of the Hsp90-AF9 interaction, we used Hsp90 siRNA directed against both isoforms of mouse Hsp90 to deplete the protein, or the Hsp90 inhibitors 17AAG and Novobiocin to perturb Hsp90 function (15Floer M. Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Kamphausen T. Fanghänel J. Neumann D. Schulz B. Rahfeld J.U. Plant J. 2002; 32: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 2002; 296: 2232-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). 17AAG is a derivative of geldanamycin, a well-studied N-terminal ATPase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit Hsp90's chaperonin function (32Zeng Y. Feng H. Graner M.W. Katsanis E. Blood. 2003; 101: 4485-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Novobiocin inhibits the C-terminal ATPase of Hsp90 and prevents co-chaperones from binding the molecule (33Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We tested whether depletion of Hsp90 with siRNA or chemical inhibition of Hsp90 function leads to AF9 destabilization and/or degradation. IMCD3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 17AAG or novobiocin and whole cell lysates were then analyzed for Hsp90 and AF9 protein by Western blot. Similarly, cells were treated with siRNA directed against both Hsp90 isoforms. siRNA treatment did diminish total Hsp90 while the chemical inhibitors had no effect on Hsp90 protein abundance. Remarkably, under all experimental conditions tested, levels of AF9 protein were not changed (Fig. 5A). In contrast to some Hsp90 client proteins, AF9 is not readily degraded despite interfering with normal Hsp90 activity with siRNA, 17AAG, or novobiocin. Hsp90 is also required for nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of specific protein complexes (34Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that AF9 localizes to the nucleus, therefore we tested whether Hsp90 is required for efficient transport of AF9 into the nucleus. In cells exposed to either novobiocin or Hsp90 siRNA, confocal imaging showed differences in AF9 distribution within the cell (Fig. 5). As has been previously reported (22Srinivasan R.S. de Erkenez A.C. Hemenway C.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3395-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in control-treated cells AF9 is localized primarily to the nucleus within discrete subnuclear speckles. Upon treatment of IMCD3 cells with novobiocin or exposure of these cells to Hsp90 siRNA, AF9 proteins are redistributed. Nuclear AF9 is shifted into DAPI-staining pockets or, more dramatically, is delocalized from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In contrast, treatment with 17AAG causes no observable change. These observations are consistent with a novobiocin-sensitive role for Hsp90 in directing and/or maintaining AF9 in precise sites within the nucleus. Furthermore, the observations suggest that disruption of Hsp90-AF9 interactions may affect AF9-modulated gene expression by depleting AF9 from the nucleus. To determine if expression of AF9-responsive genes would be affected by altering Hsp90 activity, we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure ENaCα mRNA. We predicted that by diminishing AF9 abundance within the nucleus, Hsp90 inhibition would lead to increased ENaCα gene expression. Indeed, following treatment with novobiocin or Hsp90 siRNA, ENaCα mRNA levels increased. Moreover, in the case of novobiocin, the response was dose-dependent (Fig. 6). Conversely, treatment with 17AAG had no effect on gene expression consistent with the finding that 17AAG treatment shows no delocalization of AF9 from the nucleus. Enhanced ENaCα gene expression is consistent with diminished AF9 activity. Thus, pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of Hsp90 affects ENaCα transcript abundance possibly by preventing the proper subnuclear localization and gene targeting of AF9. Previous studies of the ENaCα promoter region have shown that AF9 is required to recruit the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1. Dot1-mediated H3K79 methylation, in turn, helps repress ENaCα expression (6Zhang W. Xia X. Reisenauer M.R. Hemenway C.S. Kone B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18059-18068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Zhang W. Xia X. Reisenauer M.R. Rieg T. Lang F. Kuhl D. Vallon V. Kone B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 3: 773-783Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Zhang D. Yu Z.Y. Cruz P. Kong Q. Li S. Kone B.C. Kidney Int. 2009; 75: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Changes in AF9 localization as well as the qPCR data of ENaCα expression presented in the previous sections suggest that impaired Hsp90 function interferes with AF9 binding in the promoter region. To assess this possibility, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with Hsp90 and AF9 antibodies and regions of the ENaCα promoter were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. The gel images were quantified using Image J software from NIH and normalized to input for relative intensity quantification. The most dramatic change detected was diminished association of both Hsp90 and AF9 with the R2 region of the ENaCα promoter after cells were treated with either novobiocin or Hsp90 siRNA (Fig. 7). As expected from localization and gene expression experiments, Hsp90 and AF9 binding to the R2 region is unchanged with 17AAG treatment. In sum, alterations in ENaCα gene expression with experimental manipulation of Hsp90 are associated with changes in Hsp90 and AF9 binding at the R2 region of the ENaCα promoter. These studies reveal that the interaction between Hsp90 and AF9 is specific and is required for normal AF9 function. Our data indicate that Hsp90 regulates AF9's distribution in the cell thus affecting the function of AF9 on a downstream target gene, ENaCα. We examined this interaction using purified protein components and verified that Hsp90 and AF9 are able to interact directly and that protein binding requires ATP. Under a variety of assay conditions using different Hsp90 and AF9 antisera, Hsp90 and AF9 are found together within immune complexes isolated from living cells. Consequently, we propose that AF9 is a bona fide client protein of Hsp90. Strengthening this proposal, we have also shown that AF9 associates with both Hsp90 and the cooperating chaperones Hsp70 and p60/Hop. Of note, affinity purification of the AF9 homolog, ENL, and its associated proteins (“EAPs”) using immobilized ENL antibodies recovered Hsp70, but neither Hsp90 nor Hop were described in this report by Slany and co-workers (12Mueller D. Bach C. Zeisig D. Garcia-Cuellar M.P. Monroe S. Sreekumar A. Zhou R. Nesvizhskii A. Chinnaiyan A. Hess J.L. Slany R.K. Blood. 2007; 110: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, we are surprised by the lack of effect of the chemical inhibitor 17AAG. Treatment with novobiocin and Hsp90 knockdown gave similar results indicating a mechanism that is specific for Hsp90. Novobiocin acts through inhibition of the C terminus of Hsp90 while 17AAG inhibits the N-terminal ATPase. Nevertheless, the explanation for differences in the disposition of AF9 in cells treated with novobiocin versus 17AAG is still not clear. In silico sequence analysis of the AF9 C terminus, the region that associates with Hsp90, suggests that it is highly unstructured. In our experiments, perturbations of Hsp90 by various methods did not result in changes in the steady-state level of AF9 as is observed for proteins that require Hsp90 for proper folding. Under these circumstances, disrupting the Hsp90-client protein interaction would normally cause ubiquitination of the client protein, signaling its eventual proteosomal degradation (38Echeverría P.C. Mazaira G. Erlejman A. Gomez-Sanchez C. Piwien Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 4788-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that Hsp90 is not facilitating the proper folding or stabilization of AF9. Rather, Hsp90 transports AF9 to specific domains within the nucleus where it gains access to target genes and the macromolecular assemblies that regulate these genes. This is similar to several other nuclear proteins and is consistent with a model proposed by DeZwaan and Freeman (39Dezwaan D.C. Freeman B.C. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this model, Hsp70 and Hsp90 serve to promote the active and dynamic assembly of higher order structures including those involved in telomere maintenance, DNA repair, and gene transcription. In addition to the well studied role of Hsp90 in cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of glucocorticoid receptors (reviewed in Ref. 40Grad I. Picard D. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2007; 275: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), Hsp90 appears to be required for the trafficking of a heterogeneous collection of proteins. Hsp90 travels to the nucleus in complex with influenza virus RNA polymerase and stimulates viral RNA synthesis (41Naito T. Momose F. Kawaguchi A. Nagata K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As another example, incorporation of the Argonaute RNA-binding proteins into cytoplasmic P-bodies is mediated by Hsp90 and inhibition of Hsp90 interferes with post-transcriptional gene silencing (23Pare J.M. Tahbaz N. Lopez-Orozco J. LaPointe P. Lasko P. Hobman T.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 20: 3273-3284Crossref Google Scholar). We propose that AF9 is yet another protein whose proper subcellular localization, hence function, requires Hsp90. These results further emphasize the importance of Hsp90 in a wide range of cellular processes including the modulation of factors participating in regulated gene expression. Similarly, given the many binding partners that have been identified, it is likely that AF9 variably associates with differing proteins in distinct complexes. We can speculate that Hsp90 may help direct AF9 to one or more of these multiprotein complexes to facilitate its assembly. We thank Drs. Richard Schultz, Nancy Zeleznik-Le, and Charles Miller III for input and advice."
https://openalex.org/W2170117086,"DING proteins encompass an intriguing protein family first characterized by their conserved N-terminal sequences. Some of these proteins seem to have key roles in various human diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, HIV suppression. Although this protein family seems to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes, their genes are consistently lacking from genomic databases. Such a lack has considerably hampered functional studies and has fostered therefore the hypothesis that DING proteins isolated from eukaryotes were in fact prokaryotic contaminants.In the framework of our study, we have performed a comprehensive immunological detection of DING proteins in mice. We demonstrate that DING proteins are present in all tissues tested as isoforms of various molecular weights (MWs). Their intracellular localization is tissue-dependant, being exclusively nuclear in neurons, but cytoplasmic and nuclear in other tissues. We also provide evidence that germ-free mouse plasma contains as much DING protein as wild-type.Hence, data herein provide a valuable basis for future investigations aimed at eukaryotic DING proteins, revealing that these proteins seem ubiquitous in mouse tissue. Our results strongly suggest that mouse DING proteins are endogenous. Moreover, the determination in this study of the precise cellular localization of DING proteins constitute a precious evidence to understand their molecular involvements in their related human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2044002579,"Background Although non-specific pain in the upper limb muscles of workers engaged in mild repetitive tasks is a common occupational health problem, much is unknown about the associated structural and biochemical changes. In this study, we compared the muscle energy metabolism of the extrinsic finger extensor musculature in instrumentalists suffering from work-related pain with that of healthy control instrumentalists using non-invasive phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS). We hypothesize that the affected muscles will show alterations related with an impaired energy metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 19 volunteer instrumentalists (11 subjects with work-related pain affecting the extrinsic finger extensor musculature and 8 healthy controls). We used 31P-MRS to find deviations from the expected metabolic response to exercise in phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), Pi/PCr ratio and intracellular pH kinetics. We observed a reduced finger extensor exercise tolerance in instrumentalists with myalgia, an intracellular pH compartmentation in the form of neutral and acid compartments, as detected by Pi peak splitting in 31P-MRS spectra, predominantly in myalgic muscles, and a strong association of this pattern with the condition. Conclusions/Significance Work-related pain in the finger extrinsic extensor muscles is associated with intracellular pH compartmentation during exercise, non-invasively detectable by 31P-MRS and consistent with the simultaneous energy production by oxidative metabolism and glycolysis. We speculate that a deficit in energy production by oxidative pathways may exist in the affected muscles. Two possible explanations for this would be the partial and/or local reduction of blood supply and the reduction of the muscle oxidative capacity itself."

Here, we develop a new and easy method, BAC HAPPY MAPPING (BAP mapping), that utilizes BAC library pools as a HAPPY mapping panel together with an Mbp-sized DNA panel to integrate the linkage and physical mapping efforts into one pipeline. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as an exemplar, a set of 40 Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers spanning approximately 10% of chromosome 4 were simultaneously assembled onto a BAP map compiled using both a series of BAC pools each comprising 0.7x genome coverage and dilute (0.7x genome) samples of sheared genomic DNA. The resultant BAP map overcomes the need for polymorphic loci to separate genetic loci by recombination and allows physical mapping in segments of suppressed recombination that are difficult to analyze using traditional mapping techniques. Even virtual ""BAC-HAPPY-mapping"" to convert BAC landing data into BAC linkage contigs is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2013394703,"Improved genetic resolution and availability of sequenced genomes have made positional cloning of moderate-effect QTL realistic in several systems, emphasizing the need for precise and accurate derivation of positional confidence intervals (CIs) for QTL. Support interval (SI) methods based on the shape of the QTL likelihood curve have proven adequate for standard interval mapping, but have not been shown to be appropriate for use with composite interval mapping (CIM), which is one of the most commonly used QTL mapping methods.Based on a non-parametric confidence interval (NPCI) method designed for use with the Haley-Knott regression method for mapping QTL, a CIM-specific method (CIM-NPCI) was developed to appropriately account for the selection of background markers during analysis of bootstrap-resampled data sets. Coverage probabilities and interval widths resulting from use of the NPCI, SI, and CIM-NPCI methods were compared in a series of simulations analyzed via CIM, wherein four genetic effects were simulated in chromosomal regions with distinct marker densities while heritability was fixed at 0.6 for a population of 200 isolines. CIM-NPCIs consistently capture the simulated QTL across these conditions while slightly narrower SIs and NPCIs fail at unacceptably high rates, especially in genomic regions where marker density is high, which is increasingly common for real studies. The effects of a known CIM bias toward locating QTL peaks at markers were also investigated for each marker density case. Evaluation of sub-simulations that varied according to the positions of simulated effects relative to the nearest markers showed that the CIM-NPCI method overcomes this bias, offering an explanation for the improved coverage probabilities when marker densities are high.Extensive simulation studies herein demonstrate that the QTL confidence interval methods typically used to positionally evaluate CIM results can be dramatically improved by accounting for the procedural complexity of CIM via an empirical approach, CIM-NPCI. Confidence intervals are a critical measure of QTL utility, but have received inadequate treatment due to a perception that QTL mapping is not sufficiently precise for procedural improvements to matter. Technological advances will continue to challenge this assumption, creating even more need for the current improvement to be refined."
https://openalex.org/W2075357649,"The neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT) is a major determinant of extracellular dopamine (DA) levels and is the primary target for a variety of addictive and therapeutic psychoactive drugs. DAT is acutely regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activation and amphetamine exposure, both of which modulate DAT surface expression by endocytic trafficking. In order to use live imaging approaches to study DAT endocytosis, methods are needed to exclusively label the DAT surface pool. The use of membrane impermeant, sulfonated biarsenic dyes holds potential as one such approach, and requires introduction of an extracellular tetracysteine motif (tetraCys; CCPGCC) to facilitate dye binding. In the current study, we took advantage of intrinsic proline-glycine (Pro-Gly) dipeptides encoded in predicted DAT extracellular domains to introduce tetraCys motifs into DAT extracellular loops 2, 3, and 4. [(3)H]DA uptake studies, surface biotinylation and fluorescence microscopy in PC12 cells indicate that tetraCys insertion into the DAT second extracellular loop results in a functional transporter that maintains PKC-mediated downregulation. Introduction of tetraCys into extracellular loops 3 and 4 yielded DATs with severely compromised function that failed to mature and traffic to the cell surface. This is the first demonstration of successful introduction of a tetracysteine motif into a DAT extracellular domain, and may hold promise for use of biarsenic dyes in live DAT imaging studies."
