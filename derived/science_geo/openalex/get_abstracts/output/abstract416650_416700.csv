https://openalex.org/W2011340259,"Protein function is often modulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and therefore defining the partners of a protein helps to understand its activity. PPIs can be detected through different experimental approaches and are collected in several expert curated databases. These databases are used by researchers interested in examining detailed information on particular proteins. In many analyses the reliability of the characterization of the interactions becomes important and it might be necessary to select sets of PPIs of different confidence levels. To this goal, we generated HIPPIE (Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference), a human PPI dataset with a normalized scoring scheme that integrates multiple experimental PPI datasets. HIPPIE's scoring scheme has been optimized by human experts and a computer algorithm to reflect the amount and quality of evidence for a given PPI and we show that these scores correlate to the quality of the experimental characterization. The HIPPIE web tool (available at http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/hippie) allows researchers to do network analyses focused on likely true PPI sets by generating subnetworks around proteins of interest at a specified confidence level."

São Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) provides a forewarning of the burden of mental disorders in urban settings in developing world. The aim of this study is to estimate prevalence, severity, and treatment of recently active DSM-IV mental disorders. We examined socio-demographic correlates, aspects of urban living such as internal migration, exposure to violence, and neighborhood-level social deprivation with 12-month mental disorders.A representative cross-sectional household sample of 5,037 adults was interviewed face-to-face using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), to generate diagnoses of DSM-IV mental disorders within 12 months of interview, disorder severity, and treatment. Administrative data on neighborhood social deprivation were gathered. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate individual and contextual correlates of disorders, severity, and treatment. Around thirty percent of respondents reported a 12-month disorder, with an even distribution across severity levels. Anxiety disorders were the most common disorders (affecting 19.9%), followed by mood (11%), impulse-control (4.3%), and substance use (3.6%) disorders. Exposure to crime was associated with all four types of disorder. Migrants had low prevalence of all four types compared to stable residents. High urbanicity was associated with impulse-control disorders and high social deprivation with substance use disorders. Vulnerable subgroups were observed: women and migrant men living in most deprived areas. Only one-third of serious cases had received treatment in the previous year.Adults living in São Paulo megacity had prevalence of mental disorders at greater levels than similar surveys conducted in other areas of the world. Integration of mental health promotion and care into the rapidly expanding Brazilian primary health system should be strengthened. This strategy might become a model for poorly resourced and highly populated developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1990601892,"Trop-2 is a calcium signal transducer that is associated with transformed cell growth in experimental systems. However, its role in human cancer remains essentially unknown. In this study, we profiled Trop-2 expression in normal human tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. We then systematically compared Trop-2 mRNA and protein levels in tumours with their tissues of origin. We find that Trop-2 expression is invariably upregulated in tumours, regardless of baseline expression in normal tissues, which suggests a corresponding selective advantage. Thus, we investigated the outcome of Trop-2 upregulation on tumour growth. Overexpression of wild-type Trop-2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient to drive cancer growth in a widely invariant manner across cell type and species. Upregulation of Trop-2 was shown to quantitatively stimulate tumour growth, as proportional to expression levels in vivo, and tumour cell growth was abrogated by somatic knockdown of Trop-2 expression. On the other hand, we found no evidence of tumour-associated TROP2 mutations, nor of TROP2 induction of oncogenic transformation per se. Our data support a model where above-baseline expression of wild-type Trop-2 is a key driver of human cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W2010734188,"The adhesin pertactin (Prn) is one of the major virulence factors of Bordetella pertussis, the etiological agent of whooping cough. However, a significant prevalence of Prn-deficient (Prn−) B. pertussis was observed in Japan. The Prn− isolate was first discovered in 1997, and 33 (27%) Prn− isolates were identified among 121 B. pertussis isolates collected from 1990 to 2009. Sequence analysis revealed that all the Prn− isolates harbor exclusively the vaccine-type prn1 allele and that loss of Prn expression is caused by 2 different mutations: an 84-bp deletion of the prn signal sequence (prn1ΔSS, n = 24) and an IS481 insertion in prn1 (prn1::IS481, n = 9). The frequency of Prn− isolates, notably those harboring prn1ΔSS, significantly increased since the early 2000s, and Prn− isolates were subsequently found nationwide. Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) revealed that 24 (73%) of 33 Prn− isolates belong to MLVA-186, and 6 and 3 Prn− isolates belong to MLVA-194 and MLVA-226, respectively. The 3 MLVA types are phylogenetically closely related, suggesting that the 2 Prn− clinical strains (harboring prn1ΔSS and prn1::IS481) have clonally expanded in Japan. Growth competition assays in vitro also demonstrated that Prn− isolates have a higher growth potential than the Prn+ back-mutants from which they were derived. Our observations suggested that human host factors (genetic factors and immune status) that select for Prn− strains have arisen and that Prn expression is not essential for fitness under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2167270950,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an essential role in multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and migration, through extracellular ligand binding and subsequent activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated EGFR mutants, L858R and G719S, are constitutively active and oncogenic. They display sensitivity to TK inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib. In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, T790M, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic EGFR mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the T790M mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the G719S mutant. The G719S/T790M double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. The T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the G719S mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the G719S/T790M double mutant, as well as the wild type and the G719S and L858R mutants, revealed that the T790M mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active EGFR-TK conformation. The Met790 side chain of the G719S/T790M double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the L858R mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of Phe723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the F723A mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type EGFR in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct NSCLC-associated EGFR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2092976745,"The interaction between muscle tissues and bone metabolism is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that there might be some humoral factors that are produced in muscle tissues and exhibit bone anabolic activity. We, therefore, performed comparative DNA microarray analysis between mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells transfected with either stable empty vector or ALK2 (R206H), the mutation that constitutively activates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, to search for muscle-derived bone anabolic factors. Twenty-five genes whose expression was decreased to <1/4, were identified; these included osteoglycin (OGN). Stable overexpression of OGN significantly decreased the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA compared with those in cells transfected with vector alone in MC3T3-E1 cells. On the other hand, it significantly enhanced the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen (Col1), and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA as well as β-catenin and mineralization. A reduction in endogenous OGN level showed the opposite effects to those of OGN overexpression in MC3T3-E1 and mouse calvarial osteoblastic cells. Transient OGN overexpression significantly suppressed the levels of Runx2, Osterix, ALP, Col1, and OCN mRNA induced by BMP-2 in C2C12 cells. The conditioned medium from OGN-overexpressed and OGN-suppressed myoblastic cells enhanced and decreased, respectively, the levels of ALP, Col1, and β-catenin in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, OGN increased Smad3/4-responsive transcriptional activity as well as Col1 mRNA levels independently of endogenous TGF-β in these cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that OGN may be a crucial humoral bone anabolic factor that is produced by muscle tissues.

In conclusion, this study suggests that OGN may be a crucial humoral bone anabolic factor that is produced by muscle tissues. Progress has recently been made in investigations of the relationships between bone metabolism and organ systems other than bone. For example, the linkages between bone and cardiovascular systems, nervous systems, adipose tissues, and pancreas have been noted. Previous studies indicate that muscle mass is closely related to high bone mass and a decrease in fracture risk in postmenopausal women (1Capozza R.F. Cure-Cure C. Cointry G.R. Meta M. Cure P.

From these findings, we hypothesized that there might be some interactions between muscle tissues and bone metabolism. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinALK2activin-like kinase 2OCNosteocalcinOGNosteoglycinALPalkaline phosphataseCol1type I collagenα-MEMα-minimal essential medium. are known to be important in fracture healing but have been disappointing in human trials (4Bragdon B.

However, a recent study showed that fractures that are covered with relatively intact muscle improve more rapidly than fractures associated with more severe damage (5Utvåg S.E. Grundnes O.

Am. 1991; 73: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In that study muscle flaps applied to autogenous bone grafts improved healing, but coverage with skin did not. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), at the site of fracture induced the differentiation of stromal cells present in muscle into osteoprogenitor cells and promoted bone fracture healing (7Glass G.E. Chan J.K. Freidin A. Feldmann M. Horwood N.J. Nanchahal J. TNF-α promotes fracture repair by augmenting the recruitment and differentiation of muscle-derived stromal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In that study muscle-derived mesenchymal cells were more effective as the source of cells that differentiate into osteoblastic cells than bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells. These findings suggest that muscle tissues play some important physiological and pathological roles through certain interactions between muscle tissues and bone metabolism. Muscle tissues can produce local growth factors, which have anabolic effects in bone tissues. For example, IGF-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) is secreted from muscle tissues (8Chan X.C. McDermott J.C. Siu K.W. Identification of secreted proteins during skeletal muscle development.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that there might be some humoral factors that are produced in muscle tissues and affect bone in an anabolic fashion, although there have been no reports about the relationships between the factors secreted from muscle tissues and bone metabolism. bone morphogenetic protein activin-like kinase 2 osteocalcin osteoglycin alkaline phosphatase type I collagen α-minimal essential medium.

This disease might provide some clue to link muscle tissues to bone. In this study we performed comparative DNA microarray analysis between stable empty vector- and ALK2(R206H)-transfected mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells to find novel factors that are produced in muscle tissues and exhibit bone anabolic activity. Osteoglycin (OGN) was identified as one of 25 genes whose expressions were decreased to <1/4 by ALK2 (R206H) overexpression in these cells. Our data suggest that OGN may be an important factor produced by muscle-derived cells and secreted into blood that exhibits bone anabolic effects. MC3T3-E1 cells were provided by Dr. H.

Forty-eight hours later the transiently transfected cells were used for experiments. To generate stably transfected MC3T3-E1 or C2C12 cells, after incubation in α-MEM or DMEM containing 10% FBS for 48 h, the cells were passaged, and clones were selected in α-MEM or DMEM supplemented with G418 (0.3 mg/ml or 0.7 mg/ml, respectively; Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. Twenty-four clones were selected after 3 weeks of culture in G418. Several clones were selected after Western blotting with anti-OGN antibody. At least three independent clones for each stable transfection were characterized to rule out the possibility of clonal variation. Empty vector-transfected cell clones were used as control. Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Proteins were transferred in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% dried milk powder. The membranes were immunoblotted with each primary antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The results depicted in each figure are representative of at least three independent cell preparations. Each experiment was repeated three times. Total RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzol reagent. cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript TM First-Standard Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen).

Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells stably transfected with empty vector or ALK2 (R206H) using TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was purified using RNeasy MiniElute Clean Up kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) to yield an A260/280>1.90. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using a T7-oligo(dT) primer with the 3′IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization samples were prepared and processed according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. The Affymetrix Murine Genome 430 2.0 set was used to compare gene expression. Data were analyzed using the GeneChip Operating Software Version 1.4 (Affymetrix 690036) according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Fundamentals, no.701190 Rev.4. Using DNA MicroArray Viewer (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan), the -fold changes in expression between two groups were calculated, log 2-transformed, and further classified as not changed, increased (signal log ratio change p value <0.005), decreased (signal log ratio change p value <0.005), or marginally increased or decreased.

Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was taken to indicate a significance difference. C2C12 cell clones stably expressing either empty vector or the V5-tagged-ALK2 (R206H) construct were prepared and screened by Western blot with an anti-V5 antibody. A clone with the highest level of expression was used for DNA microarray analysis in comparison with empty vector-transfected C2C12 cells. From ∼45,000 genes on the Affymetrix gene chip, we identified 25 genes whose expression was decreased to <1/4 in the experimental versus the control group (Table 1). The levels of OGN mRNA were significantly suppressed in the stable ALK2 R206H-transfected C2C12 cells compared with those in the empty vector-transfected cells and was further reduced by BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 1A). The levels of OGN protein were suppressed in the stable ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells compared with those in the empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Gene transcripts down-regulated in stable ALK-2(R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells versus vector-alone transfected cellsGene nameGenBankTM accession no.RatioB830045N13RikBM942851−6.3Trim44NM_020267−4.83110039M20RikAW494150−4.6Fndc1AK003938−4.5Ifi27AY090098−4.5Susd5AV226398−4.52810468N07RikAK013390−4.5Srpx2BC028307−4.4DecorinAV321547−4.3Auts2BB429147−4.0C1rBB558917−3.6Follistatin-like 1BI452727−3.3Del1AF031524−3.0Pros1Z25469−2.8NovX96585−2.5OsteoglycinBB542051−2.5Csrp2NM_007792−2.5Mospd2BB45345−2.42610301H18RikAK011956−2.4IL-33NM_133775−2.2LOC672215///Ntn1NM_008744−2.1Rnf157BB246182−2.1Samd9lBB145092−2.1TslpNM_021367−2.1HhipBB088162−2.0 Open table in a new tab MC3T3-E1 cells in culture undergo osteoblastic differentiation with mineralization starting after 2–3 weeks. The levels of OGN mRNA increased for up to 3 weeks in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2A). Myoblastic C2C12 cells differentiated into osteoblastic cells when stimulated with BMP-2, and the levels of OGN mRNA increased with time (Fig. 2B). OGN levels did not change in the absence of BMP-2 (data not shown). C2C12 cells differentiated into myotube cells when stimulated with horse serum, and the levels of OGN mRNA increased with the myotube differentiation (Fig. 2C). We examined whether OGN would affect osteoblast phenotype in MC3T3-E1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, stable overexpression of OGN significantly suppressed the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA compared with those of cells transfected only with vector in MC3T3-E1 cells. On the other hand, it significantly enhanced the levels of ALP, Col1, and OCN mRNA. Moreover, stable OGN overexpression enhanced the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3B). The optimal concentration of recombinant OGN protein in MC3T3-E1 cells was 10 μg/ml in our preliminary study (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3C, recombinant OGN protein enhanced the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA levels, although it significantly suppressed the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, OGN enhanced the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in these cells (Fig. 3D). These results were consistent with the effects of OGN overexpression on osteoblast markers. Next, we examined the effects of OGN overexpression on mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. Stable OGN overexpression induced mineralization compared with empty vector-transfected cells in the presence of ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate. These findings were confirmed in quantitation analysis of Alizarin Red (Fig. 3E). Although a reduction in endogenous OGN levels by siRNA enhanced the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA, it suppressed the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3F). A reduction in endogenous OGN level by siRNA suppressed the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3G). Moreover, we examined the effects of a reduction in endogenous OGN level by siRNA on the osteoblast phenotypes in mouse primary calvarial osteoblast cultures. As shown in Fig. 3H, a reduction in endogenous OGN levels by siRNA enhanced the level of Runx2 mRNA, and it suppressed the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in mouse primary osteoblasts. It suppressed the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in mouse primary osteoblasts (Fig. 3I). We examined the effects of OGN on BMP-2-induced differentiation of myoblasts into osteoblasts. Transient OGN overexpression significantly suppressed the levels of Runx2, Osterix, Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA induced by BMP-2 in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Figs. 4, B and C, transient OGN overexpression significantly antagonized BMP-2 and Smad5-induced transcriptional activity in C2C12 cells, although it did not affect the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Moreover, OGN was not coimmunoprecipitated with Smad1 and Smad5 in these cells (data not shown), suggesting that OGN does not interact with Smad1 and Smad5 physically. We obtained the conditioned medium from OGN-overexpressed or -suppressed mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells. The levels of OGN in conditioned medium were shown in Fig. 5A. The levels of OGN were elevated and decreased in the conditioned medium from C2C12 cells, in which OGN was overexpressed by OGN transient transfection and decreased by siRNA transfection, respectively. Conditioned medium from transient OGN-overexpressing C2C12 cells decreased the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA, and it enhanced the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells compared with conditioned medium from empty vector-transfected C2C12 cells (Fig. 5B). Conditioned medium from stable OGN-overexpressing C2C12 cells enhanced the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5C). Moreover, although conditioned medium from endogenous C2C12 cells with OGN suppression by siRNA increased the levels of Runx2 and Osterix mRNA, it decreased the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells compared with conditioned medium from control siRNA-transfected C2C12 cells (Fig. 5D). Moreover, it decreased the levels of Col1 and β-catenin protein in these cells (Fig. 5E). In addition, we examined the effects of conditioned medium from OGN-overexpressed or -suppressed C2C12 cells on the osteoblast phenotypes in mouse primary calvarial osteoblast cultures. Conditioned medium from transiently OGN-overexpressing mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells decreased the levels of Runx2 mRNA, and it enhanced the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in mouse primary osteoblasts (Fig. 5F). Moreover, conditioned medium from endogenous C2C12 cells with OGN suppression by siRNA increased the levels of Runx2 mRNA and decreased the levels of Col1, ALP, and OCN mRNA in mouse primary osteoblasts (Fig. 5G). Similar data were obtained from the experiments using the conditioned medium from stably OGN-overexpressing, horse serum-treated C2C12 cells (the putative myotube cells) (data not shown). Moreover, in our preliminary study the OGN protein was detected in human serum by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Because a previous study indicated that OGN induces bone formation in conjunction with TGF-β (15Tasheva E.S. Klocke B. Conrad G.W.

J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we examined the relationships between OGN and TGF-β in the enhancement of Col1 expression by OGN in osteoblasts. We employed 3TP-Lux, a Smad3/4-responsive luciferase reporter, to examine the effects of OGN on TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity in osteoblasts. As shown in Fig. 6A, OGN significantly increased Smad3/4-responsive transcriptional activity in MC3T3-E1 cells, and it additionally enhanced TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity. SB431542, an inhibitor of endogenous TGF-β signaling (ALK5 inhibitor), did not affect OGN-induced transcriptional activity, although it antagonized TGF-β effects (Fig. 6A). OGN significantly enhanced TGF-β-induced Col1 mRNA levels in MC3T3-E1 cells, and SB431542 did not affect OGN-induced Col1 mRNA levels, although it antagonized TGF-β effects (Fig. 6B). Next we examined whether OGN would affect the expression of TGF-β in osteoblasts. As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, transient OGN overexpression or endogenous OGN suppression by siRNA did not affect the levels of TGF-β mRNA and protein compared with those in each control group in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, OGN did not affect TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein (Fig. 6E). Previous studies suggest that MAP kinases are related to Smad-independent signaling of TGF-β (13Sowa H.

We, therefore, performed the additional experiments to examine the involvement of MAP kinases in OGN-induced Col1 mRNA levels using several MAP kinase inhibitors in MC3T3-E1 cells. PD98059, SB203580, and curcumin are inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38 MAP kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6F, inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase or JNK did not affect Col1 mRNA levels induced by OGN. However, OGN enhanced the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, and an inhibitor of ERK1/2 significantly antagonized the levels of Col1 mRNA enhanced by OGN in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 6, F and G), suggesting that OGN seemed to enhance the levels of Col1 mRNA partly through ERK1/2 in osteoblasts. Several lines of evidence suggest certain interactions between muscle tissues and bone metabolism. In this study we aimed to find some humoral factors that are produced in muscle tissues and exhibit bone anabolic activity. We hypothesized that the signal suppressed by the conversion of muscle tissues into bone might give us a clue to find out muscle-derived bone anabolic factors because those factors could be predominantly expressed in muscle tissues, compared with their expressions in bone, and their systemic effects through blood could be more important than their local effects in mus"
https://openalex.org/W2037262701,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) has pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular matrix, and thereby enhances the invasive, proliferative and metastatic potential in cancer. Knockdown of MMP-2 using MMP-2 small interfering RNA (pM) in human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310 decreased cell proliferation compared with mock and pSV (scrambled vector) treatments, as determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, Ki-67 staining and clonogenic survival assay. Cytokine array and western blotting using tumor-conditioned media displayed modulated secretory levels of various cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor and PDGF-BB in MMP-2 knockdown cells. Further, cDNA PCR array indicated potential negative regulation of Janus kinase/Stat3 pathway in pM-treated cells. Mechanistically, MMP-2 is involved in complex formation with α5 and β1 integrins and MMP-2 downregulation inhibited α5β1 integrin-mediated Stat3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed inhibited Stat3 DNA-binding activity and recruitment at CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters in pM-treated cells. In individual experiments, IL-6 or siRNA-insensitive MMP-2 overexpression by pM-FL-A141G counteracted and restored the pM-inhibited Stat3 DNA-binding activity, suggesting IL-6/Stat3 signaling suppression in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. MMP-2/α5β1 binding is enhanced in human recombinant MMP-2 treatments, resulting in elevated Stat3 DNA-binding activity and recruitment on CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters. Activation of α5β1 signaling by Fibronectin adhesion elevated pM-inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation whereas blocking α5β1 abrogated constitutive Stat3 activation. In vivo experiments with orthotropic tumor model revealed the decreased tumor size in pM treatment compared with mock or pSV treatments. Immunofluorescence studies in tumor sections corroborated our in vitro findings evidencing high expression and co-localization of MMP-2/α5β1, which is decreased upon pM treatment along with significantly reduced IL-6, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1, c-Myc, Ki-67 and PCNA expression levels. Our data indicate the possible role of MMP-2/α5β1 interaction in the regulation of α5β1-mediated IL-6/Stat3 signaling activation and signifies the therapeutic potential of blocking MMP-2/α5β1 interaction in glioma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2083003255,"Increasing evidence suggests that prostate cancer is overdiagnosed and overtreated, and prognostic biomarkers would aid in treatment selection. To define prognostic biomarkers for aggressive prostate cancer, we carried out gene-expression profiling of 98 prostate tumors and 52 benign adjacent prostate tissue samples with detailed clinical annotation. We identified 28 transcripts significantly associated with recurrence after radical prostatectomy including NuSAP, a protein that binds DNA to the mitotic spindle. Elevated NuSAP transcript levels were associated with poor outcome in two independent prostate cancer gene-expression datasets. To characterize the role and regulation of NuSAP in prostate cancer, we studied the expression of NuSAP in the LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines. Posttranscriptional silencing of the NuSAP gene severely hampered the ability of PC3 to invade and proliferate in vitro. The promoter region of the NuSAP gene contains two CCAAT boxes and binding sites for E2F. Transient transfection of an E2F1 cDNA and 431 bp of the NuSAP promoter demonstrated E2F1 as an important regulator of expression. Deletion of the E2F-binding site at nucleotide −246 negated the effects of E2F1 on NuSAP expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that nuclear extracts of cells overexpressing E2F1 bound directly to the E2F-binding site in the NuSAP promoter region. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed a strong correlation between E2F1 and NuSAP expression in human prostate cancer samples. NuSAP is a novel biomarker for prostate cancer recurrence after surgery and its overexpression appears to be driven in part by E2F1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1975662382,"Lipids are essential components of all organisms. Within cells, lipids are mainly stored in a specific type of organelle, called the lipid droplet. The molecular mechanisms governing the dynamics of lipid droplets have been little explored. The protein composition of lipid droplets has been analyzed in numerous proteomic studies, and a large number of lipid droplet-associated proteins have been identified, including Rab small GTPases. Rab proteins are known to participate in many intracellular membranous events; however, their exact role in lipid droplets is largely unexplored. Here we systematically investigate the roles of Drosophila Rab family proteins in lipid storage in the larval adipose tissue, fat body. Rab32 and several other Rabs were found to affect the size of lipid droplets as well as lipid levels. Further studies showed that Rab32 and Rab32 GEF/Claret may be involved in autophagy, consequently affecting lipid storage. Loss-of-function mutants of several components in the autophagy pathway result in similar effects on lipid storage. These results highlight the potential functions of Rabs in regulating lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2062094117,"Although monocyte- and macrophage-derived molecules are known to promote extracellular matrix (ECM) disruption and destabilization, it is less appreciated that they also synthesize molecules contributing to ECM formation, stabilization, and function. We have identified and characterized the synthesis of proteoglycans and related proteins, some not previously known to be associated with macrophages. Proteoglycan extracts of [(35)S]sulfate- and (35)S-trans amino acid-radiolabeled culture media from THP-1 monocytes induced to differentiate by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate revealed three major proteins of ~25, 90, and 100 kDa following chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. The 25-kDa protein was predominant for monocytes, whereas the 90- and 100-kDa proteins were predominant for macrophages. Tandem mass spectrometry identified (i) the 25-kDa core protein as serglycin, (ii) the 90-kDa core protein as inter-α-inhibitor heavy chain 2 (IαIHC2), and (iii) the 100-kDa core as amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2). Differentiation was also associated with (i) a >500-fold increase in mRNA for TNF-stimulated gene-6, an essential cofactor for heavy chain-mediated matrix stabilization; (ii) a >800-fold increase in mRNA for HAS2, which is responsible for hyaluronan synthesis; and (iii) a 3-fold increase in mRNA for versican, which interacts with hyaluronan. Biochemical evidence is also presented for an IαIHC2-APLP2 complex, and immunohistochemical staining of human atherosclerotic lesions demonstrates similar staining patterns for APLP2 and IαIHC2 with macrophages, whereas serglycin localizes to the underlying glycosaminoglycan-rich region. These findings indicate that macrophages synthesize many of the molecules participating in ECM formation and function, suggesting a novel role for these molecules in the differentiation of macrophages in the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970989453,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is upregulated in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites play critical role in the development of breast cancer, but the mechanisms through which AA promotes mammary tumorigenesis and progression are poorly understood. We found that the levels of AA and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) strongly correlated with the signaling activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as well as the expression levels of vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) in human breast tumor tissues. In cultured breast cancer cells, AA effectively activated both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Interestingly, AA-stimulated mTORC1 activation was independent of amino acids, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), which suggests a novel mechanism for mTORC1 activation. Further studies revealed that AA stimulated mTORC1 activity through destabilization of mTOR-raptor association in ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, we showed that AA-stimulated cell proliferation and angiogenesis required mTOR activity and that the effect of AA was mediated by lipoxygenase (LOX) but not cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In animal models, AA-enhanced incidences of rat mammary tumorigenesis, tumor weights and angiogenesis were inhibited by rapamycin. Our findings suggest that AA is an effective intracellular stimulus of mTOR and that AA-activated mTOR plays critical roles in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2004223193,"Background Mathematical models exist that quantify the effect of temperature on poikilotherm growth rate. One family of such models assumes a single rate-limiting ‘master reaction’ using terms describing the temperature-dependent denaturation of the reaction's enzyme. We consider whether such a model can describe growth in each domain of life. Methodology/Principal Findings A new model based on this assumption and using a hierarchical Bayesian approach fits simultaneously 95 data sets for temperature-related growth rates of diverse microorganisms from all three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. Remarkably, the model produces credible estimates of fundamental thermodynamic parameters describing protein thermal stability predicted over 20 years ago. Conclusions/Significance The analysis lends support to the concept of universal thermodynamic limits to microbial growth rate dictated by protein thermal stability that in turn govern biological rates. This suggests that the thermal stability of proteins is a unifying property in the evolution and adaptation of life on earth. The fundamental nature of this conclusion has importance for many fields of study including microbiology, protein chemistry, thermal biology, and ecological theory including, for example, the influence of the vast microbial biomass and activity in the biosphere that is poorly described in current climate models."
https://openalex.org/W2074059417,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process for embryogenesis but is abnormally activated during cancer metastasis and recurrence. This process enables epithelial cancer cells to acquire mobility and traits associated with stemness. It is unknown whether epithelial stem cells or epithelial cancer stem cells are able to undergo EMT, and what molecular mechanism regulates this process in these specific cell types. We found that epithelial–ovarian cancer stem cells (EOC stem cells) are the source of metastatic progenitor cells through a differentiation process involving EMT and mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET). We demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro the differentiation of EOC stem cells into mesenchymal spheroid-forming cells (MSFCs) and their capacity to initiate an active carcinomatosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human EOC stem cells injected intraperitoneally in mice are able to form ovarian tumors, suggesting that the EOC stem cells have the ability to ‘home’ to the ovaries and establish tumors. Most interestingly, we found that TWIST-1 is constitutively degraded in EOC stem cells, and that the acquisition of TWIST-1 requires additional signals that will trigger the differentiation process. These findings are relevant for understanding the differentiation and metastasis process in EOC stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062680909,"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes an important ATP-generating step in glycolysis. PGK1 deficiency is an uncommon X-linked inherited disorder, generally characterized by various combinations of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, neurological dysfunctions, and myopathies. Patients rarely exhibit all three clinical features. To provide a molecular framework to the different pathological manifestations, all known mutations were reviewed and 16 mutant enzymes, obtained as recombinant forms, were functionally and structurally characterized. Most mutations heavily affect thermal stability and to a different extent catalytic efficiency, in line with the remarkably low PGK activity clinically observed in the patients. Mutations grossly impairing protein stability, but moderately affecting kinetic properties (p.I47N, p.L89P, p.C316R, p.S320N, and p.A354P) present the most homogeneous correlation with the clinical phenotype. Patients carrying these mutations display hemolytic anemia and neurological disorders, and,except for p.A354P variant, no myopaty. Variants highly perturbed in both catalytic efficiency (p.G158V, p.D164V, p.K191del, D285V, p.D315N, and p.T378P) and heat stability (all, but p.T378P) result to be mainly associated with myopathy alone. Finally, mutations faintly affecting molecular properties (p.R206P, p.E252A, p.I253T, p.V266M, and p.D268N) correlate with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. These are the first studies that correlate the clinical symptoms with the molecular properties of the mutant enzymes. All findings indicate that the different clinical manifestations associated with PGK1 deficiency chiefly depend on the distinctive type of perturbations caused by mutations in the PGK1 gene, highlighting the need for determination of the molecular properties of PGK variants to assist in prognosis and genetic counseling. However, the clinical symptoms can not be understood only on the bases of molecular properties of the mutant enzyme. Different (environmental, metabolic, genetic and/or epigenetic) intervening factors can contribute toward the expression of PGK deficient clinical phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2021800980,"In this study, we show that interfering with the splicing machinery results in activation of the tumour-suppressor p53. The spliceosome was targeted by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of proteins associated with different small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes and by using the small-molecule splicing modulator TG003. These interventions cause: the accumulation of p53, an increase in p53 transcriptional activity and can result in p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. Mdm2 and MdmX are two key repressors of p53. We show that a decrease in MdmX protein level contributes to p53 activation in response to targeting the spliceosome. Interfering with the spliceosome also causes an increase in the rate of degradation of Mdm2. Alterations in splicing are linked with tumour development. There are frequently global changes in splicing in cancer. Our study suggests that p53 activation could participate in protection against potential tumour-promoting defects in the spliceosome. A number of known p53-activating agents affect the splicing machinery and this could contribute to their ability to upregulate p53. Preclinical studies indicate that tumours can be more sensitive than normal cells to small-molecule spliceosome inhibitors. Activation of p53 could influence the selective anti-tumour activity of this therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1973154892,"Recently, we reported HC-HA, a covalent complex formed between heavy chains (HCs) of inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) and hyaluronan (HA) by the catalytic action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), is responsible for human amniotic membrane (AM) anti-inflammatory, anti-scarring, and anti-angiogenic actions. At the present time, the only well characterized source of IαI is serum being produced by the liver. This study showed that AM epithelial and stromal cells and stromal matrix all stained positively for HA, HC 1, 2, and 3, bikunin, and TSG-6. TSG-6 mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed by cultured AM epithelial and stromal cells without being up-regulated by TNF. In serum-free conditions, these cells expressed IαI, leading to the formation of HC-HA complex that contained both HC1 and HC2. In contrast, only HC1 was found in the HC-HA complex purified from AM. Local production of IαI, the HC-TSG-6 intermediate complex, and HC-HA were abolished when cells were treated with siRNA to HC1, HC2, bikunin (all of which impair the biosynthesis of IαI), or TSG-6 but not to HC3. Collectively, these results indicate that AM is another tissue in addition to the liver to constitutively produce IαI and that the HC-HA complex made by this tissue is different from that found at inflammatory sites (e.g. in asthma and arthritis) and in the matrix of the cumulus oocyte complex."
https://openalex.org/W2040882330,"Observations that genome-wide DNA hypomethylation induces genome instability and tumors in animals caution against the indiscriminate use of demethylating agents, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC). Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring a lacZ mutational reporter construct that allows the quantification and characterization of a wide range of mutational events, we found that, in addition to demethylation, treatment with 5-Aza-dC induces γ-H2AX expression, a marker for DNA breaks, and both point mutations and genome rearrangements. To gain insight into the source of these mutations, we first tested the hypothesis that the mutagenic effect of 5-Aza-dC may be directly mediated through the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) covalently trapped in 5-Aza-dC-substituted DNA. Knockdown of DNMT1 resulted in increased resistance to the cytostatic effects of 5-Aza-dC, delayed onset of γ-H2AX expression and a significant reduction in the frequency of genome rearrangements. There was no effect on the 5-Aza-dC-induced point mutations. An alternative mechanism for 5-Aza-dC-induced demethylation and genome rearrangements via activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) followed by base excision repair (BER) was found not to be involved. That is, 5-Aza-dC treatment did not significantly induce AID expression and inhibition of BER did not reduce the frequency of genome rearrangements. Thus, our results indicate that the formation of DNMT1 adducts is the prevalent mechanism of 5-Aza-dC-induced genome rearrangements, although hypomethylation per se may still contribute. As the therapeutic effects of 5-Aza-dC greatly depend on the presence of DNMT1, the expression level of DNA methyltransferases in tumors may serve as a prognostic factor for the efficacy of 5-Aza-dC treatment."

We used site-directed mutagenesis to alter a recombinant LG45 protein by substituting the most critical basic residues with glutamine. All proteins were expressed in mammalian cells, purified, and characterized biochemically. We used in vitro binding assays, including surface plasmon resonance, to examine interactions between mutated LG45 and heparan sulfates, syndecan-1 and -4. We identify a major heparin binding domain on the outer edge of a β-strand of LG45 surrounded by a track of converging low affinity residues. This domain harbors distinctive syndecan-1 and -4 binding-specific sequences. This is the first study to demonstrate a binding specificity of two proteoglycans produced by a single cell type. In addition, we found that although syndecan-1 interacts exclusively through its glycosaminoglycan chains, syndecan-4 binding relies on both its core protein and its heparan sulfate chains.

Recent evidence suggests that REV3L has an important role in the maintenance of genome stability despite its mutagenic characteristics. Such a function makes it a cancer susceptibility candidate gene. To investigate association between REV3L polymorphisms and lung cancer risk in a Chinese population, we first genotyped 15 common polymorphisms of the REV3L gene and found that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs465646, rs459809 and rs1002481) were significantly associated with lung cancer risk. One of the strongest associations observed was for the 3′-terminal untranslated region (3′UTR) 460 T>C polymorphism (rs465646) (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.69 for TC/CC; P=0.007, compared with TT). Similar results were obtained in a subsequent replication study (adjusted OR=0.72; P=0.016). Combined data from the two studies of 1072 lung cancer patients and 1064 cancer-free controls generated an even stronger association (adjusted OR=0.71; P=3.04 × 10−4). This 3′UTR 460 T>C variant was predicted to modulate the binding of several micro RNAs. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and luciferase assays showed that the T allele demonstrated a stronger binding affinity for miR-25 and miR-32, resulting in significantly weaker reporter expression levels. Additional experiments revealed that miR-25/32 could downregulate endogenous REV3L. Furthermore, the tumor-suppressing role of REV3L was confirmed by the foci formation assay. These results support our hypothesis that the REV3L rs465646 variant modifies lung cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han population by affecting miRNA-mediated gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2093733104,"Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk to develop colorectal cancer (CRC) particularly after long duration of the disease. Chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa is characterized by a marked enrichment of immune cells such as macrophages as well as by high expression of cytokines and growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). The adhesion molecule L1CAM mediates chemoresistance and migration of tumor cells and is elevated in CRC tissues being associated with metastatic spread and poor prognosis for the patients. In this study, we examine the role of TGF-β1-induced L1CAM expression and macrophages in malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulation leads to a Slug-dependent upregulation of L1CAM expression already in the colonic intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460 thereby enhancing cell motility and apoptosis resistance. Accordingly, NCM460 cells acquired a migratory and apoptosis-resistant phenotype if transfected with L1CAM. Immunohistochemistry of colonic biopsies revealed considerable L1CAM expression in intestinal epithelial cells in tissues from IBD patients but not in normal colonic tissues. Moreover, L1CAM expression increased with duration of disease being associated with the presence of CD33+ macrophages. Coculture with macrophages generated from monocyte colony-stimulating factor (MCSF)-treated monocytes led to the upregulation of Slug and L1CAM in NCM460 cells thereby elevating cell motility and apoptosis resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling abolished expression of Slug and L1CAM in cocultured NCM460 cells resulting in decreased cell migration and apoptosis resistance. In conclusion, these data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which IBD promotes malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells and underscore the role of L1CAM and macrophages in this scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2058605600,"Human monoglyceride lipase (MGL) is a recently identified lipase and very little is known about its regulation and function in cellular regulatory processes, particularly in context to human malignancy. In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of MGL in human cancer(s) and report that MGL expression was either absent or reduced in the majority of primary colorectal cancers. Immunohistochemical studies showed that reduction of MGL expression in the colorectal tumor tissues predominantly occurred in the cancerous epithelial cells. MGL was found to reside in the core surface of a cellular organelle named ‘lipid body’. Furthermore, it was found to interact selectively with a number of phospholipids, including phosphatidic acid and phosphoinositol(3,4,5)P3, phosphoinositol(3,5)P2, phosphoinositol(3,4)P2 and several other phosphoinositides, and among all phosphoinositides analyzed, its interaction with PI(3,4,5)P3 was found to be the strongest. In addition, overexpression of MGL suppressed colony formation in tumor cell lines and knockdown of MGL resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that MGL plays a negative regulatory role in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling and tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1976484753,"Within an evolutionary framework of Gastrotricha Marinellina flagellata and Redudasys fornerise bear special interest, as they are the only Macrodasyida that inhabit freshwater ecosystems. Notwithstanding, these rare animals are poorly known; found only once (Austria and Brazil), they are currently systematised as incertae sedis. Here we report on the rediscovery of Redudasys fornerise, provide an account on morphological novelties and present a hypothesis on its phylogenetic relationship based on molecular data.Specimens were surveyed using DIC microscopy and SEM, and used to obtain the 18 S rRNA gene sequence; molecular data was analyzed cladistically in conjunction with data from 42 additional species belonging to the near complete Macrodasyida taxonomic spectrum. Morphological analysis, while providing new information on taxonomically relevant traits (adhesive tubes, protonephridia and sensorial bristles), failed to detect elements of the male system, thus stressing the parthenogenetic nature of the Brazilian species. Phylogenetic analysis, carried out with ML, MP and Bayesian approaches, yielded topologies with strong nodal support and highly congruent with each other. Among the supported groups is the previously undocumented clade showing the alliance between Redudasys fornerise and Dactylopodola agadasys; other strongly sustained clades include the densely sampled families Thaumastodermatidae and Turbanellidae and most genera.A reconsideration of the morphological traits of Dactylopodola agadasys in light of the new information on Redudasys fornerise makes the alliance between these two taxa very likely. As a result, we create Anandrodasys gen. nov. to contain members of the previously described D. agadasys and erect Redudasyidae fam. nov. to reflect this novel relationship between Anandrodasys and Redudasys. From an ecological perspective, the derived position of Redudasys, which is deeply nested within the Macrodasyida clade, unequivocally demonstrates that invasion of freshwater by gastrotrichs has taken place at least twice, in contrast with the single event hypothesis recently put forward."
https://openalex.org/W2142535306,"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has shown its appeal as a sensitive technique for in vivo whole body optical imaging. However, the development of injectable tumor-specific near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probes makes fluorescence imaging (FLI) a promising alternative to BLI in situations where BLI cannot be used or is unwanted (e.g., spontaneous transgenic tumor models, or syngeneic mice to study immune effects). In this study, we addressed the questions whether it is possible to detect tumor progression using FLI with appropriate sensitivity and how FLI correlates with BLI measurements. In addition, we explored the possibility to simultaneously detect multiple tumor characteristics by dual-wavelength FLI (∼700 and ∼800 nm) in combination with spectral unmixing. Using a luciferase-expressing 4T1-luc2 mouse breast cancer model and combinations of activatable and targeting NIRF probes, we showed that the activatable NIRF probes (ProSense680 and MMPSense680) and the targeting NIRF probes (IRDye 800CW 2-DG and IRDye 800CW EGF) were either activated by or bound to 4T1-luc2 cells. In vivo, we implanted 4T1-luc2 cells orthotopically in nude mice and were able to follow tumor progression longitudinally both by BLI and dual-wavelength FLI. We were able to reveal different probe signals within the tumor, which co-localized with immuno-staining. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the internal BLI signals and the FLI signals obtained from the NIRF probes. Finally, we could detect pulmonary metastases both by BLI and FLI and confirmed their presence histologically. Taken together, these data suggest that dual-wavelength FLI is a feasible approach to simultaneously detect different features of one tumor and to follow tumor progression with appropriate specificity and sensitivity. This study may open up new perspectives for the detection of tumors and metastases in various experimental models and could also have clinical applications, such as image-guided surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2010680324,"Mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers (CRC) display widespread instability at DNA microsatellite sequences (MSI). Although MSI has been reported to commonly occur at coding repeats, leading to alterations in the function of a number of genes encoding cancer-related proteins, nothing is known about the putative impact of this process on non-coding microRNAs. In miRbase V15, we identified very few human microRNA genes with mono- or di-nucleotide repeats (n = 27). A mutational analysis of these sequences in a large series of MSI CRC cell lines and primary tumors underscored instability in 15 of the 24 microRNA genes successfully studied at variable frequencies ranging from 2.5% to 100%. Following a maximum likelihood statistical method, microRNA genes were separated into two groups that differed significantly in their mutation frequencies and in their tendency to represent mutations that may or may not be under selective pressures during MSI tumoral progression. The first group included 21 genes that displayed no or few mutations in CRC. The second group contained three genes, i.e., hsa-mir-1273c, hsa-mir-1303 and hsa-mir-567, with frequent (≥ 80%) and sometimes bi-allelic mutations in MSI tumors. For the only one expressed in colonic tissues, hsa-mir-1303, no direct link was found between the presence or not of mono- or bi-allelic alterations and the levels of mature miR expression in MSI cell lines, as determined by sequencing and quantitative PCR respectively. Overall, our results provide evidence that DNA repeats contained in human miRNA genes are relatively rare and preserved from mutations due to MSI in MMR-deficient cancer cells. Functional studies are now required to conclude whether mutated miRNAs, and especially the miR-1303, might have a role in MSI tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012126342,"Human epidermis is continuously exposed to environmental mutagenic hazard and is the most frequent target of human cancer. How the epidermis coordinates proliferation with differentiation to maintain homeostasis, even in hyperproliferative conditions, is unclear. For instance, overactivation of the proto-oncogene MYC in keratinocytes stimulates differentiation. Here we explore the cell cycle regulation as proliferating human keratinocytes commit to terminal differentiation upon loss of anchorage or overactivation of MYC. The S-phase of the cell cycle is deregulated as mitotic regulators are inhibited in the onset of differentiation. Experimental inhibition of mitotic kinase cdk1 or kinases of the mitosis spindle checkpoint Aurora B or Polo-like Kinase, triggered keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Furthermore, hyperactivation of the cell cycle by overexpressing the DNA replication regulator Cyclin E induced mitosis failure and differentiation. Inhibition of Cyclin E by shRNAs attenuated the induction of differentiation by MYC. In addition, we present evidence that Cyclin E induces DNA damage and the p53 pathway. The results provide novel clues for the mechanisms committing proliferative keratinocytes to differentiate, with implications for tissue homeostasis maintenance, HPV amplification and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061612227,"NOTCH1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and can stimulate T-ALL cell survival and proliferation. Here we explore the hypothesis that Notch1 also alters T-ALL cell migration. Rho GTPases are well known to regulate cell adhesion and migration. We have analysed the expression levels of Rho GTPases in primary T-ALL samples compared with normal T cells by quantitative PCR. We found that 5 of the 20 human Rho genes are highly and consistently upregulated in T-ALL, and 3 further Rho genes are expressed in T-ALL but not detectable in normal T cells. Of these, RHOU expression is highly correlated with the expression of the Notch1 target DELTEX-1. Inhibition of Notch1 signalling with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) or Notch1 RNA interference reduced RhoU expression in T-ALL cells, whereas constitutively active Notch1 increased RhoU expression. In addition, Notch1 or RhoU depletion, or GSI treatment, inhibits T-ALL cell adhesion, migration and chemotaxis. These results indicate that NOTCH1 mutation stimulates T-ALL cell migration through RhoU upregulation that could contribute to the leukaemia cell dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2082381899,"The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) has been widely used for studies of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). This disorder, characterized by abnormal vascularization of the retina, tends to occur in low birth weight neonates after exposure to high supplemental oxygen. Currently, the incidence of ROP is increasing because of increased survival of these infants due to medical progress. However, little is known about changes in the chronic phase after ROP. Therefore, in this study, we examined morphological and functional changes in the retina using a chronic OIR model. Both the a- and b-waves in the OIR model recovered in a time-dependent manner at 4 weeks (w), 6 w, and 8 w, but the oscillatory potential (OP) amplitudes remained depressed following a return to normoxic conditions. Furthermore, decrease in the thicknesses of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) at postnatal day (P) 17, 4 w, and 8 w and hyperpermeability of blood vessels were observed in conjunction with the decrease in the expression of claudin-5 and occludin at 8 w. The chronic OIR model revealed the following: (1) a decrease in OP amplitudes, (2) morphological abnormalities in the retinal cells (limited to the IPL and INL) and blood vessels, and (3) an increase in retinal vascular permeability via the impairment of the tight junction proteins. These findings suggest that the experimental animal model used in this study is suitable for elucidating the pathogenesis of ROP and may lead to the development of potential therapeutic agents for ROP treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2029085074,"Cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) is an essential regulator of cell signaling and development. HS traps signaling molecules, like Wnt in the glycosaminoglycan side chains of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs), and regulates their functions. Endosulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 are secreted at the cell surface to selectively remove 6-O-sulfate groups from HSPGs, thereby modifying the affinity of cell surface HSPGs for its ligands. This study provides molecular evidence for the functional roles of HSPG sulfation and desulfation in dentinogenesis. We show that odontogenic cells are highly sulfated on the cell surface and become desulfated during their differentiation to odontoblasts, which produce tooth dentin. Sulf1/Sulf2 double null mutant mice exhibit a thin dentin matrix and short roots combined with reduced expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) mRNA, encoding a dentin-specific extracellular matrix precursor protein, whereas single Sulf mutants do not show such defective phenotypes. In odontoblast cell lines, Dspp mRNA expression is potentiated by the activation of the Wnt canonical signaling pathway. In addition, pharmacological interference with HS sulfation promotes Dspp mRNA expression through activation of Wnt signaling. On the contrary, the silencing of Sulf suppresses the Wnt signaling pathway and subsequently Dspp mRNA expression. We also show that Wnt10a protein binds to cell surface HSPGs in odontoblasts, and interference with HS sulfation decreases the binding affinity of Wnt10a for HSPGs, which facilitates the binding of Wnt10a to its receptor and potentiates the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby up-regulating Dspp mRNA expression.

Heparan sulfate (HS) 2The abbreviations used are: HSheparan sulfateGAGglycosaminoglycanHSPGHS proteoglycan; β-d-xylosidemiRNAmicroRNACTcomputed tomographyEnembryonic day nPnpostnatal day n. is a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family of polysaccharides, which attaches to core proteins to form proteoglycans and is ubiquitously present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (1Bernfield M.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). It is also an essential regulator of cell signaling and development. HS traps many different proteins on the cell surface and basement membrane and regulates their functions (2Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M.

There is considerable interest in the structural variability generated by a series of modifications within HS, which are responsible for the binding and regulation of specific HS-interacting proteins (4Turnbull J.

Such HS modifications, in particular in the form of its sulfation patterns, result in structural and functional heterogeneity, which are controlled in a tissue-specific and developmental manner (6Tumova S.

Dentin is the mineralized portion of tooth tissue, and it is produced by odontoblasts differentiating from dental papilla mesenchymal cells. Dentinogenesis is regulated by sequential and reciprocal interactions with the dental epithelium mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which direct both morphogenesis and differentiation (8Thesleff I.

Odontoblasts are characteristically columnar polarized cells, and this cytological polarization specifically occurs in a single layer adjacent to the inner dental epithelium (11Linde A. Goldberg M. Dentinogenesis.Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 679-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) is a phosphorylated parent protein that is cleaved post-translationally into two dentin non-collagenous proteins: dentin sialoprotein (Dsp) and dentin phosphoprotein (Dpp) (12Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and other experimental analyses have shown that Dspp is predominantly expressed in odontoblasts, transiently expressed in preameloblasts, and expressed at low levels in bone (13D'Souza R.N.

This suggests that the functional role of Dspp mainly involves tooth formation and mineralization. In humans, several mutations in DSPP have been identified in patients with dentinogenesis imperfecta, which is an autosomal dominant disorder of the tooth that specifically affects dentin biomineralization (15Shields E.D.

A similar phenotype is found in Dspp null mutant mice, which disrupts dentin mineralization without affecting bone (19Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T.

Hence, it is established that Dspp plays a specific and crucial role in the formation of mineralized dentin. Wnt genes encode a large family of secreted signaling proteins that specify various cell lineage pathways during development. Wnt proteins are now recognized as one of the major families of developmentally important signaling molecules (20Nusse R. Wnts and Hedgehogs. Lipid-modified proteins and similarities in signaling mechanisms at the cell surface.Development. 2003; 130: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Among the functions performed by Wnt proteins are embryonic induction, the generation of cell polarity, and the specification of cell fate. The canonical Wnt pathway involves inhibition of the β-catenin degradation complex, allowing its interaction with the nuclear transcription factors LEF and TCF and the regulation of target gene expression (21Cardigan R.A. Mackie I.J. Machin S.J. Hemostatic-endothelial interactions. A potential anticoagulant role of the endothelium in the pulmonary circulation during cardiac surgery.J. Cardiothorac. Vasc. Anesth. 1997; 11: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In early tooth development, various Wnt genes are expressed from the bud stage to the early bell stage (22Sarkar L. Sharpe P.T. Expression of Wnt signaling pathway genes during tooth development.Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that TOPGAL and Axin2 reporter activity are high in the odontoblast layer (23Suomalainen M. Thesleff I. Patterns of Wnt pathway activity in the mouse incisor indicate absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the epithelial stem cells.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 364-372PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lohi M. Tucker A.S. Sharpe P.T. Expression of Axin2 indicates a role for canonical Wnt signaling in development of the crown and root during pre- and postnatal tooth development.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that dentinogenesis is associated with the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. These findings are in line with the human tooth phenotypes observed after the heterozygotic loss of Axin2 function, which causes tooth agenesis and/or hypodontia (25Lammi L. Arte S. Somer M. Jarvinen H. Lahermo P. Thesleff I. Pirinen S. Nieminen P. Mutations in AXIN2 cause familial tooth agenesis and predispose to colorectal cancer.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Among the numerous Wnt genes that are expressed in developing tooth germs, Wnt10a is specifically expressed in odontoblasts. Interestingly, the forced expression of Wnt10a induced Dspp expression when the transfected cells were cultured on Matrigel (26Yamashiro T. Zheng L. Shitaku Y. Saito M. Tsubakimoto T. Takada K. Takano-Yamamoto T. Thesleff I. Wnt10a regulates dentin sialophosphoprotein mRNA expression and possibly links odontoblast differentiation and tooth morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2007; 75: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), indicating that Wnt10a is an upstream gene involved in Dspp expression. In addition, human WNT10A mutations were reported to be associated with hypodontia (27Adaimy L. Chouery E. Megarbane H. Mroueh S. Delague V. Nicolas E. Belguith H. de Mazancourt P. Megarbane A. Mutation in WNT10A is associated with an autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia. The odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia.Am. J. Hum.

WNT10A missense mutation associated with a complete odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia syndrome.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 17: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that the Wnt10a-induced canonical Wnt pathway is involved in dentinogenesis, at least in part, by directly activating Dspp expression, although there is no direct in vivo or in vitro evidence to support this. The Sulf proteins Sulf1 and Sulf2 were identified as a family of extracellular glucosamine-6-sulfatases that remove the sulfate groups from the 6-O-position of N-acetylglucosamine (29Dhoot G.K.

J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In skeletal structures, malformations, including reduced bone length, premature vertebrae ossification, and fusion of sternebrae and tail vertebrae, are observed (35Ratzka A. Kalus I. Moser M. Dierks T. Mundlos S. Vortkamp A. Redundant function of the heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 during skeletal development.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Due to their activity, the Sulfs control HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) functioning as coreceptors for the signaling activities of multiple developmental ligands (32Lamanna W.C. Kalus I. Padva M.

In particular, Sulf1 activity has been shown to decrease the affinity of HS toward the Wnt ligand and promote the binding of Wnt to its cognate receptor Frizzled, thereby acting as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling (38Ai X. Do A.T. Lozynska O. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Emerson Jr., C.P. QSulf1 remodels the 6-O-sulfation states of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to promote Wnt signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). From these findings, together with those of our previous study (26Yamashiro T. Zheng L. Shitaku Y. Saito M. Tsubakimoto T. Takada K. Takano-Yamamoto T. Thesleff I. Wnt10a regulates dentin sialophosphoprotein mRNA expression and possibly links odontoblast differentiation and tooth morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2007; 75: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Wnt ligands, especially Wnt10a, can be captured by cell surface or basement membrane extracellular matrix molecules to control the differentiation of pulp cells into odontoblasts and that such regulation of Wnt signaling is modulated by the Sulf enzymes. This study presents the first molecular evidence for the functional roles of HSPG sulfation and desulfation in dentin formation. Here, we demonstrate that the desulfation of odontogenic cells progresses with differentiation and that the loss of the endosulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 results in defective dentin phenotypes. In particular, we show that the cell surface sulfation of HSPGs affects the Wnt canonical signaling pathway and consequently regulates Dspp expression in odontogenic cells. We also show that the binding affinity of HS for Wnt10a is directly dependent on its 6-O-sulfation status. Sulf1 and Sulf2 mutant embryos and postnatal mice were used in this study. Sulf1 and Sulf2 knock-out mice were generated by the insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into exon 2 of the murine Sulf1 gene and exon 1 of the murine Sulf2 gene, as described previously (37Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T. Merry C.L. Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases. Discrete in vivo activities and functional cooperativity.Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Control mouse fetuses were also obtained from the ICR strain. The control group consisted of control or single-transgenic animals from the same litter. Animal experiments were performed under the research protocol approved by the Animal Research Committee at Bielefeld University and Okayama University. The mDP odontoblast-like cell line, which was derived from the embryonic mouse mesenchyme (39Wu N. Iwamoto T. Sugawara Y. Futaki M. Yoshizaki K. Yamamoto S. Yamada A. Nakamura T. Nonaka K. Fukumoto S. PDGFs regulate tooth germ proliferation and ameloblast differentiation.Arch. Oral Biol. 2010; 55: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was used in this study. The mDP cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were subcultured every 3–4 days, and 0.05% (w/v) EDTA was used to detach the cells from the culture dish. These cells were used for the real-time PCR experiments. Sodium chlorate is a reversible inhibitor of glycosaminoglycan sulfation. mDP cells were treated to pharmacologically remove sulfated residues from their cell surface HSPGs (40Yip G.W. Ferretti P. Copp A.J. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and spinal neurulation in the mouse embryo.Development. 2002; 129: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chlorate-treated cultures were incubated with 50 mm sodium chlorate for 72 h before being processed for immunocytochemistry and real-time RT-PCR analysis. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and mimics Wnt signaling by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity (41Klein P.S. Melton D.A. A molecular mechanism for the effect of lithium on development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). mDP cell lines were treated with 50 mm LiCl for 5 days before being processed for immunocytochemistry and real-time RT-PCR analysis. The cells were also incubated with 1 mm 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (β-d-xyloside) (Sigma) for 72 h. β-d-Xyloside is a primer of GAG chain synthesis and inhibitor of proteoglycan assembly (42Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. Unusual β-d-xylosides that prime glycosaminoglycans in animal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19159-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Fritz T.A. Esko J.D. Xyloside priming of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and inhibition of proteoglycan assembly.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, at 1 mm β-d-xyloside, HSs without core proteins are supposed to be released from the cells and may form a complex with Wnts in the conditioned medium. In the present study, we also confirmed that 1 mm β-d-xyloside does not affect the proliferation of cells or type I collagen synthesis in odontoblast cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, we can rule out a toxic effect of β-d-xyloside. Further, mDP cells were incubated for 120 h with 5 units/ml heparin (Fuso Pharma, Osaka, Japan), which directly binds free Wnt proteins released into the culture medium. Three-dimensional images of tooth structure were analyzed using an inspeXio SMX-90CT Microfocus x-ray CT system, (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Briefly, image acquisition was performed at 90 kV and 110 mA. The resultant images were processed by the three-dimensional reconstruction software VG Studio MAX 2.0 (Volume Graphics, Heidelberg, Germany). The image reconstruction was carried out using appropriate cross-sections at a spatial resolution of 17 μm and was used to perform comparative measurements of tooth morphology. The following parameters were defined: root length, distance between the apex and the cemento-enamel junction along the root canal for the mesial root of the first lower molar; crown length, anteroposterior distance between the mesial marginal ridge and the distal marginal ridge along the occlusal plane; dentin thickness, mean of the mesial and distal dentin thickness at the level of the cement-enamel junction; enamel thickness, mean of the mesial and distal enamel thickness at the midlevel of crown height. Embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) and postnatal day 0 (P0), P1, P7, and P28 heads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or tissue fixative (Genostaff, Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C overnight. P7 and P28 heads were decalcified in 12.5% EDTA for 3 weeks. Then they were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned at 7 or 6 μm for hematoxylin and eosin staining and in situ hybridization. Frozen cross-sections (10 μm) were also prepared for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Those embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C overnight, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan), and serially sectioned at 10 μm. Predentin thickness was measured in frontal sections of P0 control and Sulf1/Sulf2 double null mutant lower molars. The maximum thickness of the predentin beneath the mesial cusps was measured in serial sections from each group. In situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes was performed as described previously (44Yamashiro T. Fukunaga T. Kobashi N. Kamioka H. Nakanishi T. Takigawa M. Takano-Yamamoto T. Mechanical stimulation induces CTGF expression in rat osteocytes.J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mouse Sulf1 and Sulf2 probes were generated from a 461-bp Sulf1 fragment spanning the region between 124 and 584 in accession number AY101178 and a 459-bp Sulf2 fragment spanning the region between 3056 and 3514 in accession number AY101178. The preparation of Wnt10a, Dspp, and Axin2 RNA probes has been described previously (23Suomalainen M. Thesleff I. Patterns of Wnt pathway activity in the mouse incisor indicate absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the epithelial stem cells.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 364-372PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamashiro T.

Cell proliferation was assessed by 5′-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of dividing cells in the tooth germs of Sulf1 and Sulf2 mutants. E18.5 pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 ml/100 g body weight of BrdU solution (Sigma) and killed after 2 h. BrdU staining was carried out in paraffin sections using a BrdU staining kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Cell proliferation indices were determined by counting the BrdU-positive and -negative cells in defined areas of the cervical loop epithelium and mesenchyme. Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections of developing tooth germs and mDP cells. The sulfated HS distribution was visualized using 10E4 antibody (1:100; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). HS distribution was visualized using the 3G10 antibody (1:100; Seikagaku). 3G10 identifies a neoepitope generated by heparinase III digestion of HS. Sections were pretreated with heparinase III (400 milliunits/ml for 2 h) immediately before immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry for Wnt10a (ab62051, Abcam (Cambridge, UK)) was also performed using mDP cells. Secondary antibodies conjugated with the appropriate fluorochrome, CyTM3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM antibody (1:500; Seikagaku) were used. Immunoreactivity to 10E4, 3G10, and Wnt10a was visualized with a FLUOVIEW FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscopy system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped for differential interference contrast microscopy. The confocal laser-scanning microscopy system was coupled to an upright microscope (IX-71, Olympus) with a ×60 (numerical aperture = 1.4) oil immersion objective lens. Total RNA was extracted from the mDP cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mandibular fragments containing tooth germs were also isolated from P0 transgenic and wild-type mouse pups and fixed overnight in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. First molar tooth germs of the mandible were dissected in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under a stereomicroscope. Total RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed tooth germ using a RecoverAll total nucleic acid isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT)20 primer (Takara, Shiga, Japan). For real-time RT-PCR analysis, the cDNA were amplified with Blend-Taq Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and a regular thermal cycler. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in duplicate for four independent sets of samples. The relative quantity of transcripts was determined using a standard curve and norma"
https://openalex.org/W1985085507,"Background Low nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability plays a role in the pathogenesis of human as well as of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). ECM is partially prevented by administration of the NO-donor dipropylenetriamine NONOate (DPTA-NO) at high concentration (1 mg/mouse), which also induces major side effects such as a sharp drop in blood pressure. We asked whether alternative strategies to improve NO bioavailability with minor side effects would also be effective in preventing ECM. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were infected with PbA and prophylactically treated twice a day with bolus injections of L-arginine, Nω-hydroxy-nor-Arginine (nor-NOHA), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), separately or combined, sodium nitrite, sildenafil or sildenafil plus DPTA-NO starting on day 0 of infection. L-arginine and BH4 supplementation, with or without arginase inhibition by nor-NOHA, increased plasma nitrite levels but failed to protect against ECM development. Accordingly, prophylactic treatment with continuous delivery of L-arginine using osmotic pumps also did not improve survival. Similar outcomes were observed with sodium nitrite sildenafil (aimed at inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5) or with DPTA-NO. However, sildenafil (0.1 mg/mouse) in combination with a lower dose (0.1 mg/mouse) of DPTA-NO decreased ECM incidence (82±7.4% mortality in the saline group and 38±10.6% in the treated group; p<0.05). The combined prophylactic therapy did not aggravate anemia, had delayed effects in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and induced lower effects in pulse pressure when compared to DPTA-NO 1 mg/mouse. Conclusions/Significance These data show that sildenafil lowers the amount of NO-donor needed to prevent ECM, resulting also in lesser side effects. Prophylactic L-arginine when given in bolus or continuous delivery and bolus BH4 supplementation, with or without arginase inhibition, were able to increase NO bioavailability in PbA-infected mice but failed to decrease ECM incidence in the doses and protocol used."
https://openalex.org/W2074059713,"Mitochondria play a critical role in cell survival and death after cerebral ischemia. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are inner mitochondrial membrane proteins that disperse the mitochondrial proton gradient by translocating H+ across the inner membrane in order to stabilize the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have demonstrated that mice transgenically overexpressing UCP2 (UCP2 Tg) in the brain are protected from cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and epileptic challenges. This study seeks to clarify the mechanisms responsible for neuroprotection after transient focal ischemia. Our hypothesis is that UCP2 is neuroprotective by suppressing innate inflammation and regulating cell cycle mediators. PCR gene arrays and protein arrays were used to determine mechanisms of damage and protection after transient focal ischemia. Our results showed that ischemia increased the expression of inflammatory genes and suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic and cell cycle genes. Overexpression of UCP2 blunted the ischemia-induced increase in IL-6 and decrease in Bcl2. Further, UCP2 increased the expression of cell cycle genes and protein levels of phospho-AKT, PKC and MEK after ischemia. It is concluded that the neuroprotective effects of UCP2 against ischemic brain injury are associated with inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of cell survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W2022969614,"The number of neurons in the adult rodent brain is strongly influenced by events in early postnatal life that eliminate approximately half of the neurons. Recently, we reported that neurotrophins induced survival of neonatal rat hippocampal neurons by promoting neural activity and activation of the Ser/Thr kinase, Akt. The survival of neurons also depended on integrin signaling, but a role for the extracellular matrix (ECM) in this mechanism was yet to be explored. Here, we show that levels of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) decrease, and the level of the ECM protein laminin increases in rat hippocampus during the period of neuronal death. Hippocampi from MMP9 null mice showed higher levels of laminin expression than wild type at P1 and no further increase at P10. In vitro, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor FN-439 promoted survival of neurons in a laminin-integrin β1-dependent manner. Blocking laminin signaling attenuated activation of Akt by depolarization. In vivo, injecting FN-439 into the neonatal hippocampus increased the level of laminin and promoted neuronal survival through an integrin-dependent mechanism. These results show signals from the ECM are not simply permissive but rather actively regulated, and they interact with neuronal activity to control the number of hippocampal neurons. This work is the first to report a role for MMP9 in regulating neuronal survival through the developmental process that establishes the functional brain."
https://openalex.org/W2037343710,"Spontaneous mutations of the Sharpin (SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein, other aliases: Rbckl1, Sipl1) gene in mice result in systemic inflammation that is characterized by chronic proliferative dermatitis and dysregulated secretion of T helper1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this inflammatory phenotype remain elusive. Dendritic cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of the phenotype of SHARPIN-deficient mice because of their pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. Here we show by flow cytometry that SHARPIN- deficiency did not alter the distribution of different DC subtypes in the spleen. In response to TOLL-like receptor (TLR) agonists LPS and poly I:C, cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from WT and mutant mice exhibited similar increases in expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide. Mutant BMDC had defective activation of NF-κB signaling, whereas the MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK11/12/13/14 (p38 MAP kinase isoforms) and TBK1 signaling pathways were intact. A mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that mutant BMDC only induced a weak Th1 immune response but stimulated increased Th2 cytokine production from allogeneic naïve CD4(+) T cells. In conclusion, loss of Sharpin in mice significantly affects the immune function of DC and this may partially account for the systemic inflammation and Th2-biased immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2076584115,"A growing body of evidence indicates that protein factors controlling translation play an important role in tumorigenesis. The protein known as eIF6 is a ribosome anti-association factor that has been implicated in translational initiation and in ribosome synthesis. Over-expression of eIF6 is observed in many natural tumours, and causes developmental and differentiation defects in certain animal models. Here we show that the transcription of the gene encoding eIF6 is modulated by the receptor Notch-1, a protein involved in embryonic development and cell differentiation, as well as in many neoplasms. Inhibition of Notch-1 signalling by γ-secretase inhibitors slowed down cell-cycle progression and reduced the amount of eIF6 in lymphoblastoid and ovarian cancer cell lines. Cultured ovarian cancer cell lines engineered to stably over-expressing eIF6 did not show significant changes in proliferation rate, but displayed an enhanced motility and invasive capacity. Inhibition of Notch-1 signalling in the cells over-expressing eIF6 was effective in slowing down the cell cycle, but did not reduce cell migration and invasion. On the whole, the results suggest that eIF6 is one of the downstream effectors of Notch-1 in the pathway that controls cell motility and invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2058806672,"The biological actions of estrogen are mediated via estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. Yet, other cellular signaling events that also impact ER functions have an important role in breast carcinogenesis. Here, we show that activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 tyrosine kinase receptors with growth factor heregulin-β prompts ERβ degradation by the 26S proteasome, a mechanism that requires the coactivator cAMP response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP). We found that CBP promotes ERβ ubiquitination and degradation through enhancement of the PI3-K/Akt pathway by heregulin-β, an effect potentiated by a negatively charged hinge region of ERβ. Activated Akt triggered the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 to ERβ, which was further stabilized by CBP, resulting in ERβ poly-ubiquitination. Mutation of CBP Thr-1872 or Mdm2 Ser-186/188 Akt sites resulted in a dissociation of the ERβ-CBP-Mdm2 complex and reduced ERβ turnover. We found that the decrease in ERβ induced by heregulin-β was associated with reduced target gene promoter occupancy and enhanced proliferation of breast cancer cells. However, knockdown of Mdm2 restored endogenous ERβ levels resulting in reduction of breast cancer cell growth. These studies identify a tripartite Akt-regulated phosphorylation mechanism that functions to hamper normal ERβ activity and turnover through the concerted actions of CBP and Mdm2 in response to growth factor signaling pathways in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109773521,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer exhibiting skeletal-muscle differentiation. New therapeutic targets are required to improve the dismal prognosis for invasive or metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Protein kinase C iota (PKCι) has been shown to have an important role in tumorigenesis of many cancers, but little is known about its role in rhabdomyosarcoma. Our gene-expression studies in human tumor samples revealed overexpression of PRKCI. We confirmed overexpression of PKCι at the mRNA and protein levels using our conditional mouse model that authentically recapitulates the progression of rhabdomyosarcoma in humans. Inhibition of Prkci by RNA interference resulted in a dramatic decrease in anchorage-independent colony formation. Interestingly, treatment of primary cell cultures using aurothiomalate (ATM), which is a gold-containing classical anti-rheumatic agent and a PKCι-specific inhibitor, resulted in decreased interaction between PKCι and Par6, decreased Rac1 activity and reduced cell viability at clinically relevant concentrations. Moreover, co-treatment with ATM and vincristine (VCR), a microtubule inhibitor currently used in rhabdomyosarcoma treatment regimens, resulted in a combination index of 0.470–0.793 through cooperative accumulation of non-proliferative multinuclear cells in the G2/M phase, indicating that these two drugs synergize. For in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies, ATM demonstrated a trend toward enhanced VCR sensitivity. Overall, these results suggest that PKCι is functionally important in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma anchorage-independent growth and tumor-cell proliferation and that combination therapy with ATM and microtubule inhibitors holds promise for the treatment of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2152413142,"Protective autoimmunity (PA) is a physiological response to central nervous system trauma that has demonstrated to promote neuroprotection after spinal cord injury (SCI). To reach its beneficial effect, PA should be boosted by immunizing with neural constituents or neural-derived peptides such as A91. Immunizing with A91 has shown to promote neuroprotection after SCI and its use has proven to be feasible in a clinical setting. The broad applications of neural-derived peptides make it important to determine the main features of this anti-A91 response. For this purpose, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a spinal cord contusion (SCC; moderate or severe) or a spinal cord transection (SCT; complete or incomplete). Immediately after injury, animals were immunized with PBS or A91. Motor recovery, T cell-specific response against A91 and the levels of IL-4, IFN-γ and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released by A91-specific T (TA91) cells were evaluated. Rats with moderate SCC, presented a better motor recovery after A91 immunization. Animals with moderate SCC or incomplete SCT showed significant T cell proliferation against A91 that was characterized chiefly by the predominant production of IL-4 and the release of BDNF. In contrast, immunization with A91 did not promote a better motor recovery in animals with severe SCC or complete SCT. In fact, T cell proliferation against A91 was diminished in these animals. The present results suggest that the effective development of PA and, consequently, the beneficial effects of immunizing with A91 significantly depend on the severity of SCI. This could mainly be attributed to the lack of TA91 cells which predominantly showed to have a Th2 phenotype capable of producing BDNF, further promoting neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W1964987521,"The Rab11-FIPs (Rab11-family interacting proteins; henceforth, FIPs) are a family of Rab11a/Rab11b/Rab25 GTPase effector proteins implicated in an assortment of intracellular trafficking processes. Through proteomic screening, we have identified TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101), a component of the ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complex, as a novel FIP4-binding protein, which we find can also bind FIP3. We show that α-helical coiled-coil regions of both TSG101 and FIP4 mediate the interaction with the cognate protein, and that point mutations in the coiled-coil regions of both TSG101 and FIP4 abrogate the interaction. We find that expression of TSG101 and FIP4 mutants cause cytokinesis defects, but that the TSG101-FIP4 interaction is not required for localisation of TSG101 to the midbody/Flemming body during abscission. Together, these data suggest functional overlap between Rab11-controlled processes and components of the ESCRT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2097400131,"Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure at high concentrations results in overt neurotoxicity. Exposure to low CO concentrations occurs commonly yet is usually sub-clinical. Infants are uniquely vulnerable to a variety of toxins, however, the effects of postnatal sub-clinical CO exposure on the developing brain are unknown. Apoptosis occurs normally within the brain during development and is critical for synaptogenesis. Here we demonstrate that brief, postnatal sub-clinical CO exposure inhibits developmental neuroapoptosis resulting in impaired learning, memory, and social behavior. Three hour exposure to 5 ppm or 100 ppm CO impaired cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in neocortex and hippocampus of 10 day old CD-1 mice. CO increased NeuN protein, neuronal numbers, and resulted in megalencephaly. CO-exposed mice demonstrated impaired memory and learning and reduced socialization following exposure. Thus, CO-mediated inhibition of neuroapoptosis might represent an important etiology of acquired neurocognitive impairment and behavioral disorders in children."
https://openalex.org/W2069872558,"Noggin is a glycosylated-secreted protein known so far for its inhibitory effects on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by sequestering the BMP ligand. We report here for the first time a novel mechanism by which noggin directly induces adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells independently of major human adipogenic signals through C/EBPδ, C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Evaluation of a possible mechanism for noggin-induced adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells identified the role of Pax-1 in mediating such differentiation. The relevance of elevated noggin levels in obesity was confirmed in a preclinical, immunocompetent mouse model of spontaneous obesity and in human patients with higher body mass index. These data clearly provide a novel role for noggin in inducing adipogenesis and possibly obesity and further indicates the potential of noggin as a therapeutic target to control obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1963909289,"The human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) process is crucial to maintain the integrity of the genome and requires many different proteins which interact perfectly and coordinated. Germline mutations in MMR genes are responsible for the development of the hereditary form of colorectal cancer called Lynch syndrome. Various mutations mainly in two MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, have been identified so far, whereas 55% are detected within MLH1, the essential component of the heterodimer MutLα (MLH1 and PMS2). Most of those MLH1 variants are pathogenic but the relevance of missense mutations often remains unclear. Many different recombinant systems are applied to filter out disease-associated proteins whereby fluorescent tagged proteins are frequently used. However, dye labeling might have deleterious effects on MutLα's functionality. Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of N- and C-terminal fluorescent labeling on expression level, cellular localization and MMR activity of MutLα. Besides significant influence of GFP- or Red-fusion on protein expression we detected incorrect shuttling of single expressed C-terminal GFP-tagged PMS2 into the nucleus and found that C-terminal dye labeling impaired MMR function of MutLα. In contrast, N-terminal tagged MutLαs retained correct functionality and can be recommended both for the analysis of cellular localization and MMR efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2046168396,"How fibronectin (FN) converts from a compact plasma protein to a fibrillar component of extracellular matrix is not understood. “Functional upstream domain” (FUD), a polypeptide based on F1 adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes, binds by anti-parallel β-strand addition to discontinuous sets of N-terminal FN type I modules, 2–5FNI of the fibrin-binding domain and 8–9FNI of the gelatin-binding domain. Such binding blocks assembly of FN. To learn whether ligation of 2–5FNI, 8–9FNI, or the two sets in combination is important for inhibition, we tested “high affinity downstream domain” (HADD), which binds by β-strand addition to the continuous set of FNI modules, 1–5FNI, comprising the fibrin-binding domain. HADD and FUD were similarly active in blocking fibronectin assembly. Binding of HADD or FUD to soluble plasma FN exposed the epitope to monoclonal antibody mAbIII-10 in the tenth FN type III module (10FNIII) and caused expansion of FN as assessed by dynamic light scattering. Soluble N-terminal constructs truncated after 9FNI or 3FNIII competed better than soluble FN for binding of FUD or HADD to adsorbed FN, indicating that interactions involving type III modules more C-terminal than 3FNIII limit β-strand addition to 1–5FNI within intact soluble FN. Preincubation of FN with mAbIII-10 or heparin modestly increased binding to HADD or FUD. Thus, ligation of FNIII modules involved in binding of integrins and glycosaminoglycans, 10FNIII and 12–14FNIII, increases accessibility of 1–5FNI. Allosteric loss of constraining interactions among 1–5FNI, 10FNIII, and 12–14FNIII likely enables assembly of FN into extracellular fibrils. How fibronectin (FN) converts from a compact plasma protein to a fibrillar component of extracellular matrix is not understood. “Functional upstream domain” (FUD), a polypeptide based on F1 adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes, binds by anti-parallel β-strand addition to discontinuous sets of N-terminal FN type I modules, 2–5FNI of the fibrin-binding domain and 8–9FNI of the gelatin-binding domain. Such binding blocks assembly of FN. To learn whether ligation of 2–5FNI, 8–9FNI, or the two sets in combination is important for inhibition, we tested “high affinity downstream domain” (HADD), which binds by β-strand addition to the continuous set of FNI modules, 1–5FNI, comprising the fibrin-binding domain. HADD and FUD were similarly active in blocking fibronectin assembly. Binding of HADD or FUD to soluble plasma FN exposed the epitope to monoclonal antibody mAbIII-10 in the tenth FN type III module (10FNIII) and caused expansion of FN as assessed by dynamic light scattering. Soluble N-terminal constructs truncated after 9FNI or 3FNIII competed better than soluble FN for binding of FUD or HADD to adsorbed FN, indicating that interactions involving type III modules more C-terminal than 3FNIII limit β-strand addition to 1–5FNI within intact soluble FN. Preincubation of FN with mAbIII-10 or heparin modestly increased binding to HADD or FUD. Thus, ligation of FNIII modules involved in binding of integrins and glycosaminoglycans, 10FNIII and 12–14FNIII, increases accessibility of 1–5FNI. Allosteric loss of constraining interactions among 1–5FNI, 10FNIII, and 12–14FNIII likely enables assembly of FN into extracellular fibrils. Fibronectin (FN) 2The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinFNIFN type IFNIIFN type IIFNIIIFN type IIIEDAextra domain AFUDfunctional upstream domainHADDhigh affinity downstream domainDLSdynamic light scatteringITCisothermal titration calorimetryFNBRFN-binding repeat. is a dimeric glycoprotein of blood and extracellular matrix. Each subunit of FN, depicted in Fig. 1A, includes 12 type 1 (FNI), 2 type 2 (FNII), and 15–17 type 3 (FNIII) modules, depending on the differential inclusion of FNIII extra domains A (EDA) and B (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Fibronectin at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Subunits are linked by disulfide bonds at the extreme C termini. The N-terminal 70-kDa region (N-9FNI), which is of particular importance in this paper, includes the N-5FNI fibrin- and 6FNI-9FNI gelatin-binding domains and is composed of nine FNI and two FNII modules (Fig. 1A). FNI modules are found only in chordates, and tandem FNI modules are found only in FN (2Tucker R.P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R.

Rotary shadowing, sedimentation velocity, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments indicate that plasma FN is in a compact conformation that elongates at increased ionic strength or pH (4Odermatt E.

Models of fibronectin.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2343-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FN conformation can be monitored by monoclonal antibody (mAb) mAbIII-10, which recognizes an epitope in 10FNIII that is cryptic in soluble plasma FN at low ionic strength and exposed when FN is adsorbed to a surface, placed in high ionic strength, or incubated with heparin, gelatin, or gangliosides (6Ugarova T.P.

Conformational transitions in the cell binding domain of fibronectin.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The compact conformation is likely maintained by interactions among distant modules. Several such interactions have been surmised based on studies of FN fragments, including an intra-subunit interaction between 4FNI and 3FNIII (7Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Ellis I.R. Sarkies P.

The compact structure has been hypothesized to obscure ligand-binding regions of plasma FN and thereby prevent aberrant interactions in the bloodstream (11Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C.

Diverse cells, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and adherent platelets, support the assembly of compact, soluble FN into insoluble fibrils that support cell adhesion, growth, and migration (13Singh P. Carraher C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Assembly of fibronectin extracellular matrix.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). FN assembly is a complex process in which FN binds to the cell surface, engages receptors, most notably the α5β1 integrin binding to the RGD motif in 10FNIII, and elongates into fibrils (13Singh P. Carraher C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Assembly of fibronectin extracellular matrix.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 14Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R.

Pieces of FN comprising the fibrin- and gelatin-binding domains or just the fibrin-binding domain, however, bind to cell surface sites of FN assembly and block assembly (15McKeown-Longo P.J.

A central question regarding FN assembly is whether FN initially interacts via α5β1 with 10FNIII followed by exposure of N-terminal FNI modules (13Singh P. Carraher C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Assembly of fibronectin extracellular matrix.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) or engages cell surface molecules via N-terminal FNI modules followed by exposure of 10FNIII (17Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Annis D.S.

The N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin binds to cell surface fibronectin assembly sites in the absence of intact fibronectin.Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite its recent appearance in the animal kingdom, FN functions as a modulator of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix formation from early development onward (18George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Defects in mesoderm, neural tube and vascular development in mouse embryos lacking fibronectin.Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is involved in diverse pathophysiologic processes, including vascular disease (3Maurer L.M.

Midwood K.S. Plasma and cellular fibronectin: distinct and indendent functions during tissue repair.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2011; 4: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Remarkably, multiple bacteria target FN and its FNI modules as a vehicle to adhere to tissues and evade host defense (20Henderson B. Nair S. Pallas J. Williams M.A. Fibronectin. A multidomain host adhesin targeted by bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 35: 147-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The pathophysiologic importance of bacteria-FN interactions is highlighted by the recent finding that Staphylococcus aureus recovered from patients with infected intravascular devices are enriched in polymorphisms of FN-binding protein A that increase the affinity of the protein for FN (21Lower S.K. Lamlertthon S. Casillas-Ituarte N.N. Lins R.D. Yongsunthon R. Taylor E.S. DiBartola A.C. Edmonson C. McIntyre L.M. Reller L.B. Que Y.A. Ros R. Lower B.H. Fowler Jr., V.G.

It is not known whether the effects of FUD are due to its interaction with 2–5FNI, 8–9FNI, or both 2–5FNI and 8–9FNI. To learn the importance of the fibrin and gelatin binding, we compared FUD to “high affinity downstream domain” (HADD), a 49-residue polypeptide similar to SfbI-5 with its adjacent nonrepetitive sequence, i.e. HADD was designed to bind tightly to N-5FNI by anti-parallel β-strand addition (Fig. 1C).

In experiments looking at the binding of FN to collagen or gelatin, 4 nm FN and 100 nm polypeptide diluted in TBS containing 0.05% Tween and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) were incubated for 30 min prior to addition and a 2-h incubation with high binding plates precoated at 37 °C overnight with 10 μg/ml collagen or gelatin. Bound FN was detected with 9D2 followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Bound conjugate was quantified by addition of SureBlue TMB microwell peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and the reaction was stopped with the addition of TMB stop solution (KPL). The A450 nm was determined as above. High binding plates were coated overnight with 8 nm FN, washed with 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4, and blocked with 1% BSA in washing buffer for 1 h. In some experiments, HADD or FUD was added to FN in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, plus 0.2% BSA for 30 min. To 150 μl of the FN-containing solution, 25 μl of mAbIII-10 ascites (previously diluted to yield a final dilution of 1:50,000) was added in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, plus 0.2% BSA and 0.35% Tween 20 (final concentration 0.05%), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h prior to transfer to FN-coated wells and incubation for 2 h. Plates were washed two times with 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4, and two times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5000 was added to wash buffer and incubated for 1 h. Plates were washed four additional times before the addition of 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 9.0. A405 nm was determined using a Tecan Genios Pro. In experiments comparing purified FN to FN in plasma, exposure of the mAbIII-10 epitope was monitored by a competitive ELISA similar to that described above. Purified FN was diluted in TBS to the concentration of FN determined to be in the plasma sample by competitive ELISA using mAb 9D2, which is not sensitive to conformation as described previously (30Ensenberger M.G.

These samples were then diluted further in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to 233 nm FN without or with FUD or HADD in 2.5-fold molar excess. After 30 min, the mixtures were diluted further, and mAbIII-10 ascites (final concentration after addition of 1:50,000) was added in a volume that brought the concentration of the FN to 200, 100, 50, 25, or 12.5 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1982325841,"Background The question of sampling and spatial aggregation of malaria vectors is central to vector control efforts and estimates of transmission. Spatial patterns of anopheline populations are complex because mosquitoes' habitats and behaviors are strongly heterogeneous. Analyses of spatially referenced counts provide a powerful approach to delineate complex distribution patterns, and contributions of these methods in the study and control of malaria vectors must be carefully evaluated. Methodology/Principal Findings We used correlograms, directional variograms, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and the Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) to examine spatial patterns of Indoor Resting Densities (IRD) in two dominant malaria vectors sampled with a 5×5 km grid over a 2500 km2 area in the forest domain of Cameroon. SADIE analyses revealed that the distribution of Anopheles gambiae was different from regular or random, whereas there was no evidence of spatial pattern in Anopheles funestus (Ia = 1.644, Pa<0.05 and Ia = 1.464, Pa>0.05, respectively). Correlograms and variograms showed significant spatial autocorrelations at small distance lags, and indicated the presence of large clusters of similar values of abundance in An. gambiae while An. funestus was characterized by smaller clusters. The examination of spatial patterns at a finer spatial scale with SADIE and LISA identified several patches of higher than average IRD (hot spots) and clusters of lower than average IRD (cold spots) for the two species. Significant changes occurred in the overall spatial pattern, spatial trends and clusters when IRDs were aggregated at the house level rather than the locality level. All spatial analyses unveiled scale-dependent patterns that could not be identified by traditional aggregation indices. Conclusions/Significance Our study illustrates the importance of spatial analyses in unraveling the complex spatial patterns of malaria vectors, and highlights the potential contributions of these methods in malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W2128870239,"Background Overexpression of EGFR is one of the most frequently diagnosed genetic aberrations of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). EGFR signaling is involved in diverse cellular functions and is dependent on the type of preferred receptor complexes. EGFR translocation to mitochondria has been reported recently in different cancer types. However, mechanistic aspects of EGFR translocation to mitochondria in GBM have not been evaluated to date. Methodology/Principle Findings In the present study, we analyzed the expression of EGFR in GBM-patient derived specimens using immunohistochemistry, reverse-transcription based PCR and Western blotting techniques. In clinical samples, EGFR co-localizes with FAK in mitochondria. We evaluated this previous observation in standard glioma cell lines and in vivo mice xenografts. We further analyzed the effect of human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSC) on the inhibition of EGFR expression and EGFR signaling in glioma cells and xenografts. Treatment with hUCBSC inhibited the expression of EGFR and its co-localization with FAK in glioma cells. Also, hUCBSC inhibited the co-localization of activated forms of EGFR, FAK and c-Src in mitochondria of glioma cells and xenografts. In addition, hUCBSC also inhibited EGFR signaling proteins in glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that hUCBSC treatments inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR, FAK and c-Src forms. Our findings associate EGFR expression and its localization to mitochondria with specific biological functions in GBM cells and provide relevant preclinical information that can be used for the development of effective hUCBSC-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1977455218,"We have recently developed a so-called genomic engineering approach that allows for directed, efficient and versatile modifications of Drosophila genome by combining the homologous recombination (HR)-based gene targeting with site-specific DNA integration. In genomic engineering and several similar approaches, a “founder” knock-out line must be generated first through HR-based gene targeting, which can still be a potentially time and resource intensive process. To significantly improve the efficiency and success rate of HR-based gene targeting in Drosophila, we have generated a new dual-selection marker termed W::Neo, which is a direct fusion between proteins of eye color marker White (W) and neomycin resistance (Neo). In HR-based gene targeting experiments, mutants carrying W::Neo as the selection marker can be enriched as much as fifty times by taking advantage of the antibiotic selection in Drosophila larvae. We have successfully carried out three independent gene targeting experiments using the W::Neo to generate genomic engineering founder knock-out lines in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2046409085,"One of the key drivers for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) proliferation is activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a known proto-oncogene. However, the mechanism of EGFR-dependent SCC proliferation remains unclear. Our previous studies indicate that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced SCC cell proliferation requires the SH3 domain of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), but not its catalytic activity. The SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 is known to activate the short form of nuclear phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) that enhances the activity of nuclear class Ia phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) required for proliferation. However, PIKE has been described for more than a decade to be present exclusively in neuronal cells. In the present study, we found that PIKE was highly expressed in malignant human keratinocytes (SCC4 and SCC12B2) but had low expression in normal human keratinocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong nuclear staining of PIKE in human epidermal and tongue SCC specimens but little staining in the adjacent non-cancerous epithelium. Treatment of SCC4 cells with EGF-induced translocation of PLC-γ1 to the nucleus and binding of PLC-γ1 to the nuclear PIKE. Knockdown of PLC-γ1 or PIKE blocked EGF-induced activation of class Ia PI3K and protein kinase C-ζ and phosphorylation of nucleolin in the nucleus as well as EGF-induced SCC cell proliferation. However, inhibition of the catalytic activity of PLC-γ1 had little effect. These data suggest that PIKE has a critical role in EGF-induced SCC cell proliferation and may function as a proto-oncogene in SCC."
https://openalex.org/W1993551024,"Water (H2O) is the most abundant and important molecule of life. Natural water contains small amount of heavy isotopes. Previously, few animal model studies have shown that the isotopic composition of body water could play important roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Here we study the stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) in human blood plasma. The stable isotopic ratio is defined and determined by δsample = [(Rsample/RSTD)−1] * 1000, where R is the molar ratio of rare to abundant, for example, 18O/16O. We observe that the δ2H and the δ18O in human blood plasma are associated with the human renal functions. The water isotope ratios of the δ2H and δ18O in human blood plasma of the control subjects are comparable to those of the diabetes subjects (with healthy kidney), but are statistically higher than those of the end stage renal disease subjects (p<0.001 for both ANOVA and Student's t-test). In addition, our data indicate the existence of the biological homeostasis of water isotopes in all subjects, except the end stage renal disease subjects under the haemodialysis treatment. Furthermore, the unexpected water contents (δ2H and δ18O) in blood plasma of body water may shed light on a novel assessment of renal functions."
https://openalex.org/W2162473159,"The prevalence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), a common solid tissue malignancy in young men, has been annually increasing at an alarming rate of 3%. Since the majority of testicular cancers are derived from germ cells at the stage of transformation of primordial germ cell (PGC) into gonocytes, the increase has been attributed to maternal/fetal exposures to environmental factors. We examined the effects of an estrogen (diethylstilbestrol, DES), an antiandrogen (flutamide), or radiation on the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors in genetically predisposed 129.MOLF-L1 (L1) congenic mice by exposing them to these agents on days 10.5 and 11.5 of pregnancy. Neither flutamide nor DES produced noticeable increases in testis cancer incidence at 4 weeks of age. In contrast, two doses of 0.8-Gy radiation increased the incidence of TGCT from 45% to 100% in the offspring. The percentage of mice with bilateral tumors, weights of testes with TGCT, and the percentage of tumors that were clearly teratomas were higher in the irradiated mice than in controls, indicating that irradiation induced more aggressive tumors and/or more foci of initiation sites in each testis. This radiation dose did not disrupt spermatogenesis, which was qualitatively normal in tumor-free testes although they were reduced in size. This is the first proof of induction of testicular cancer by an environmental agent and suggests that the male fetus of women exposed to radiation at about 5-6 weeks of pregnancy might have an increased risk of developing testicular cancer. Furthermore, it provides a novel tool for studying the molecular and cellular events of testicular cancer pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042448528,"Cnidarians are characterized by the presence of stinging cells containing nematocysts, a sophisticated injection system targeted mainly at prey-capture and defense. In the anthozoan subclass Octocorallia nematocytes have been considered to exist only in low numbers, to be small, and all of the ancestral atrichous-isorhiza type. This study, in contrast, revealed numerous nematocytes in the octocoral Heteroxenia fuscescens. The study demonstrates the applicability of cresyl-violet dye for differential staining and stimulating discharge of the nematocysts. In addition to the atrichous isorhiza-type of nematocysts, a novel type of macrobasic-mastigophore nematocysts was found, featuring a shaft, uniquely comprised of three loops and densely packed arrow-like spines. In contrast to the view that octocorals possess a single type of nematocyst, Heteroxenia fuscescens features two distinct types, indicating for the first time the diversification and complexity of nematocysts for Octocorallia."
https://openalex.org/W1973089503,"This study optically determines whether the amount of light scatter due to laser-induced damage to the intraocular lens (IOL) is significant in relation to normal straylight values in the human eye. Two IOLs with laser-induced damage were extracted from two donor eyes. Each IOL had 15 pits and/or cracks. The surface area of each pit was measured using a microscope. For 6 pits per intraocular lens the point spread function (PSF) in terms of straylight was measured and the total straylight for all 15 pits was estimated. The damage in the IOLs was scored as mild/moderate. The total damaged surface areas, for a 3.5 mm pupil, in the two IOLs were 0.13% (0.0127 mm2) and 0.66% (0.064 mm2), respectively. The angular dependence of the straylight caused by the damage was similar to that of the normal PSF. The total average contribution to straylight was log(s) = −0.82 and −0.42, much less than the straylight value of the normal eye. The straylight due to normal levels of laser induced damage of the IOL is much lower than normal straylight values found clinically for the normal eye and may therefore be considered not significant."
https://openalex.org/W2030043916,"Background Typically, a two-phase (double) sampling strategy is employed when classifications are subject to error and there is a gold standard (perfect) classifier available. Two-phase sampling involves classifying the entire sample with an imperfect classifier, and a subset of the sample with the gold-standard. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we consider an alternative strategy termed reclassification sampling, which involves classifying individuals using the imperfect classifier more than one time. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity and prevalence are provided for reclassification sampling, when either one or two binary classifications of each individual using the imperfect classifier are available. Robustness of estimates and design decisions to model assumptions are considered. Software is provided to compute estimates and provide advice on the optimal sampling strategy. Conclusions/Significance Reclassification sampling is shown to be cost-effective (lower standard error of estimates for the same cost) for estimating prevalence as compared to two-phase sampling in many practical situations."
