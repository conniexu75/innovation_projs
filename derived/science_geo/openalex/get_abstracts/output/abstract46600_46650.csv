https://openalex.org/W2051165421,"The phenomenon of homologous recombination, which allows specific gene conversion and gene insertion, can be a powerful system for the study of eukaryotic cell biology. Data are presented demonstrating that integration of a transfected plasmid by homologous recombination occurs in the motile eukaryotic cell Dictyostelium discoideum. A plasmid carrying a G418 resistance gene and the amino terminal half of the myosin heavy chain gene was used to transfect Dictyostelium. A large fraction of the resultant G418-resistant cells had the plasmid integrated into the single genomic copy of the heavy chain gene. These cells, which fail to express the native myosin but express the myosin fragment, are defective in cytokinesis and become large and multinucleate. In spite of the absence of native myosin, these cells, termed hmm cells, exhibit many forms of cell movement, including membrane ruffling, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. The hmm cells can aggregate but are blocked at a later stage in the Dictyostelium developmental cycle. The hmm cells revert to the wild-type phenotype. Reversion of the hmm phenotype is due to excision and loss of the transforming plasmid. The revertant cells express native myosin, are G418 sensitive, and have a normal developmental cycle. These results constitute genetic proof that the intact myosin molecule is required for cytokinesis and not for karyokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009623058,"The role of myosin in the contraction of striated muscle cells is well known, but its importance in nonmuscle cells is not yet clear. The function of myosin in Dictyostelium discoideum has been investigated by isolating cells which specifically lack myosin heavy chain (MHC A) protein. Cells were transformed with a vector encoding RNA complementary to mhcA messenger RNA (antisense RNA). Stable transformants have a dramatic reduction in the amount of MHC A protein, grow slowly, and generate giant multinucleated progeny, indicating an impairment in cytokinesis. Surprisingly, the cells adhere to surfaces, extend pseudopods and are capable of ameboid locomotion. The developmental sequence that is initiated by starving cells is severely impaired by the lack of myosin. The cells are unable to form multicellular aggregates normally and do not undergo subsequent morphogenesis. By changing the food source from liquid medium to bacteria, expression of the endogenous mhcA messenger RNA can be increased relative to expression of antisense RNA. When grown in this way, the transformed cells accumulate MHC A protein, remain mononucleate, and proceed through development normally."
https://openalex.org/W2061424654,"Abstract While determining the 5′ ends of C. elegans actin mRNAs, we have discovered a 22 nucleotide spliced leader sequence. The leader sequence is found on mRNA from three of the four nematode actin genes. The leader also appears to be present on some, but not all, nonactin mRNAs. The actin mRNA leader sequence is identical to the first 22 nucleotides of a novel 100 nucleotide RNA transcribed adjacent, and in the opposite orientation, to the 5S ribosomal gene. The evidence suggests that the actin mRNA leader sequence is acquired from this novel nucleotide transcript by an intermolecular trans -splicing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2015761067,"The development of the cerebral hemispheres was assessed by using measures of electroencephalographic coherence and phase in 577 children ranging in age from 2 months to early adulthood. Two categories of age-dependent change in electroencephalographic coherence and phase were noted: continuous growth processes that were described best by an exponential growth function, and discrete growth spurts that appeared in specific anatomical locations at specific postnatal periods. The left and right hemispheres developed at different rates and with different postnatal onset times with the timing of growth spurts overlapping the timing of the major developmental stages described by Piaget."
https://openalex.org/W2084485529,"North American strains of Aedes albopictus, an Asian mosquito recently introduced into the Western Hemisphere, exhibit photoperiodic sensitivity and cold-hardiness characteristics similar to strains originating from temperate zone Asia. Trade statistics for used tire imports, the most likely mode of introduction, also indicate a north Asian origin. Aedes albopictus, an important vector of dengue and a potential vector of many other arboviral diseases, may therefore have the capability of infesting much of temperate North America."
https://openalex.org/W1522572101,"Serum mannan-binding protein (MBP), a lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, was revealed to activate the complement system as measured by passive hemolysis using sheep erythrocytes coated with yeast mannan. In contrast, rat liver MBP, which shares many properties in common with serum MBP, could not activate complement at all. The activation by serum MBP was inhibited effectively by the presence of haptenic sugars and dependent absolutely upon the presence of C4, indicating that the activation is initiated by the sugar binding activity of MBP and proceeds through the classical pathway. The 25 NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of rat serum MBP determined in this study was completely matched with that of MBP-A deduced from cDNA sequence by Drickamer et al. (Drickamer, K., Dordal, M. S., and Reynolds, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6878-6887), revealing that MBP-A is in fact identical with serum MBP. On the basis of the knowledge of primary structures and physicochemical properties of rat serum and liver MBPs, a possible mechanism of the complement activation by serum MBP is discussed with reference to close similarity in the gross structures of serum MBP and C1q."
https://openalex.org/W2118078864,"Nerve regeneration and developmental outgrowth of axons are both correlated with increased synthesis of an axonal membrane protein designated GAP-43. Phosphorylation of an apparently identical protein, present at lower abundance in adult brains, has been correlated with long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity. We have now isolated a cDNA clone encoding GAP-43 from neonatal rat brain. The amino acid sequence is extremely hydrophilic, with no potential membrane-spanning domains and no sites for N-linked glycosylation, but with a short hydrophobic segment at the protein's amino terminus, consistent with a model in which GAP-43 extends from the cytoplasmic surface of growth cone and synaptic plasma membranes. Among several tissues and cells examined, GAP-43 mRNA is expressed only in neurons. Developmental and regeneration-associated changes in GAP-43 synthesis appear to be mediated largely at the level of transcription of a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W2035985010,"Two complementary DNA's, encoding the complete sequences of 671 and 673 amino acids for subspecies of rat brain protein kinase C, were expressed in COS 7 cells. The complementary DNA sequence analysis predicted that the two enzymes are derived from different ways of splicing and differ from each other only in the short ranges of their carboxyl-terminal regions. Both enzymes showed typical characteristics of protein kinase C that responded to Ca2+, phospholipid, and diacylglycerol. The enzymes showed practically identical physical and kinetic properties and were indistinguishable from one of the several subspecies of protein kinase C that occurs in rat brain but not in untransfected COS 7 cells. Partial analysis of the genomic structure confirmed that these two subspecies of protein kinase C resulted indeed from alternative splicing of a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W2003206811,"Ivermectin (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1) is a recently discovered, persistent, broad-spectrum, antiparasitic drug of unpredecented potency1,2 which is now routinely administered to cattle, horses, sheep and pigs in many countries. In cattle, it is an efficient control for parasitic gastrointestinal and respiratory tract nematodes, warble fly, mites, lice and ticks3–6. However, most of the ivermectin dose is ultimately eliminated in the faeces of the treated animals7 where it has been shown to have an insecticidal effect8–11 on the larvae of economically important, dung-breeding, haematophagous Diptera. Nevertheless, the effects of excreted ivermectin on the cowpat fauna as a whole and the wider consequences of such effects have not previously been considered. In field trials reported here, the faeces of calves fitted with rumenal boluses delivering ivermectin at 40 μg per kg per day, failed to degrade in the normal way and this failure was associated with the absence of dung-degrading insects. Faeces from placebo-treated controls contained a characteristic dung-degrading invertebrate community and were largely degraded within 100 days. These results indicate that the increasing widespread use of ivermectin may have important environmental consequences for pastureland."
https://openalex.org/W2020931673,"Preneoplastic and neoplastic liver nodules and hepatocytes isolated from regenerating rat liver have been shown to be resistant to a broad range of carcinogenic agents. This phenomenon was studied by measuring the expression of the multidrug-resistant (mdr) gene in normal liver cells and in preneoplastic and neoplastic nodules and regenerating liver. Levels of messenger RNA for the mdr gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, were elevated in both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. Expression of the mdr gene also reached high levels in regenerating rat liver 24 to 72 hours after partial hepatectomy. These results show that the expression of the mdr gene can be regulated in liver and is likely to be responsible for part of the multidrug-resistance phenotype of carcinogen-initiated hepatocytes and regenerating liver cells."

https://openalex.org/W2081543802,"Heterogeneity in the expression of tumor-associated antigens, as defined by the binding of monoclonal antibodies, is a characteristic common to most, if not all, human carcinoma cell populations. Antigen-negative cells within the population can escape detection and therapy by their failure to bind the appropriate antibody. Therefore, the extent of antigenic heterogeneity is an important consideration when designing protocols for the management of cancer by administration of monoclonal antibodies. One approach to counteracting the effect of antigenic heterogeneity is the use of clone A of recombinant human leukocyte interferon (Hu-IFN-αA). Administration of Hu-IFN-αA in vivo effectively increased the amount of tumor antigen expressed by a human colon xenograft in situ and augmented the localization of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to the tumor site. Concomitant administration of Hu-IFN-αA and monoclonal antibody may thus be effective in overcoming the antigenic heterogeneity of carcinoma cell populations and in enhancing the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the detection and treatment of carcinoma lesions."

https://openalex.org/W1597069818,"We have determined the sequence of the sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C in the turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain. In contrast to previous work (Nishikawa, M., Hidaka, H., and Adelstein, R. S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14069-14072), two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of both heavy meromyosin and the isolated myosin light chain showed two major phosphopeptides, one containing phosphoserine and the other phosphothreonine. We have purified the succinylated tryptic phosphopeptides using reverse phase and DEAE high pressure liquid chromatography. The serine-containing peptide, residues 1-4 (Ac-SSKR), is the NH2-terminal peptide. The phosphorylated serine residue may be either serine 1 or serine 2. The threonine-containing peptide, residues 5-16, yielded the sequence AKAKTTKKRPQR. Analysis of the yields and radioactivity of the products from automated Edman degradation showed that threonine 9 is the phosphorylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1479916544,"In order to obtain information with regard to behavior of the Ca2+ receptor, troponin C (TnC), in intact myofilament lattice of cardiac muscle, we investigated Ca2+-binding properties of canine ventricular muscle fibers skinned with Triton X-100. Analysis of equilibrium Ca2+-binding data of the skinned fibers in ATP-free solutions suggested that there were two distinct classes of binding sites which were saturated over the physiological range of negative logarithm of free calcium concentration (pCa): class I (KCa = 7.4 X 10(7) M-1, KMg = 0.9 X 10(3) M-1) and class II (KCa = 1.2 X 10(6) M-1, KMg = 1.1 X 10(2) M-1). The class I and II were considered equivalent, respectively, to the Ca2+-Mg2+ and Ca2+-specific sites of TnC. The assignments were supported by TnC content of the skinned fibers determined by electrophoresis and 45Ca autoradiograph of electroblotted fiber proteins. Dissociation of rigor complexes by ATP caused a downward shift of the binding curve between pCa 7 and 5, an effect which could be largely accounted for by lowering of KCa of the class II sites. When Ca2+ binding and isometric force were measured simultaneously, it was found that the threshold pCa for activation corresponds to the range of pCa where class II sites started to bind Ca2+ significantly. We concluded that the low affinity site of cardiac TnC plays a key role in Ca2+ regulation of contraction under physiological conditions, just as it does in the regulation of actomyosin ATPase. Study of kinetics of 45Ca washout from skinned fibers and myofibrils revealed that cardiac TnC in myofibrils contains Ca2+-binding sites whose off-rate constant for Ca2+ is significantly lower than the Ca2+ off-rate constant hitherto documented for the divalent ion-binding sites of either cardiac/slow muscle TnC or fast skeletal TnC."
https://openalex.org/W2000335778,"The epithelial cell layer of human amnion membrane can be removed while the basement membrane and stromal surfaces remain morphologically intact. Such a preparation has been used as a substratum for the in vitro culture of dissociated neurons. Embryonic motor neurons from chick ciliary ganglion attached to both surfaces but grew extensive neurites only on the basement membrane. On cross sections of rolled amnion membranes, regenerating axons of cultured neurons were guided along pathways of basement membrane that were immunoreactive with an antibody to laminin. In addition, when rolled amnion membranes were implanted into a lesion cavity between the rat septum and hippocampus, cholinergic neurons extended axons through the longitudinally oriented implant into the hippocampus. Thus, this amnion preparation can serve as a bridge to promote axonal regeneration in vivo in damaged adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2085785668,"Alternative RNA splicing is a ubiquitous process permitting single genes to encode multiple protein isoforms. Here we report experiments in which a gene construct, containing combinatorial Troponin T (TnT) exons that manifest an exceptional diversity of alternative splicing in vivo, has been transfected into muscle and nonmuscle cells. Analyses of the spliced RNAs show that the alternative TnT exons retain their capacity for differential splicing in the modified minigene context when introduced into a variety of nonmuscle and muscle cells. The patterns of alternative splicing differ depending on cell type. Only in differentiated myotubes are the alternative exons normally incorporated during splicing, reproducing their behavior in the native gene; they are excluded in nonmuscle cells and myoblasts that do not express the endogenous TnT. These results provide proof that trans factors required for correct alternative splicing are induced during myogenesis. Surprisingly, such factors are also required for the correct splicing of constitutive TnT exons."
https://openalex.org/W1482755017,"Glucocorticoids have been shown to be useful in the treatment of certain types of chronic liver disease both by inhibiting fibrosis and by improving liver function. We have previously demonstrated in an in vivo model of hepatic fibrogenesis that dexamethasone inhibits the synthesis of types I and IV collagen. In the present study we have evaluated the level of regulation responsible for the dexamethasone-induced changes in collagen gene expression in a defined in vitro system. Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes treated with and without dexamethasone under classical cell culture conditions or using defined media were evaluated for synthesis and abundance of procollagen and beta-actin mRNAs. Cells treated with dexamethasone had decreased types I and IV procollagen mRNA steady state levels due in part to diminished transcription rates of the genes. On the other hand, beta-actin mRNA levels were unaffected by dexamethasone. Transient expression experiments were performed to more precisely define the mechanism whereby dexamethasone affects type I procollagen gene transcription. The recombinant plasmid, pAZ1009, containing the mouse alpha 2(I) procollagen gene promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, was transfected into mouse fibroblast cell lines. Cells transfected with the pAZ1009 plasmid in the presence of dexamethasone had a significant decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity when compared to cells not exposed to dexamethasone. These data suggest that dexamethasone inhibits collagen synthesis through a direct effect on the collagen gene promoter and appears also to have a post-transcriptional effect on procollagen mRNA content."
https://openalex.org/W1532307989,"The glycation (nonenzymatic glycosylation) of several proteins was studied in various buffers in order to assess the effects of buffering ions on the kinetics and specificity of glycation of protein. Incubation of RNase with glucose in phosphate buffer resulted in inactivation of the enzyme because of preferential modification of lysine residues in or near the active site. In contrast, in the cationic buffers, 3-(N-morpholino)propane-sulfonic acid and 3-(N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-amino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, the kinetics of glycation of RNase were decreased 2- to 3-fold, there was a decrease in glycation of active site versus peripheral lysines, and the enzyme was resistant to inactivation by glucose. The extent of Schiff base formation on RNAse was comparable in the three buffers, suggesting that phosphate, bound in the active site of RNase, catalyzed the Amadori rearrangement at active site lysines, leading to the enhanced rate of inactivation of the enzyme. Phosphate catalysis of glycation was concentration-dependent and could be mimicked by arsenate. Phosphate also stimulated the rate of glycation of other proteins, such as lysozyme, cytochrome c, albumin, and hemoglobin. As with RNase, phosphate affected the specificity of glycation of hemoglobin, resulting in increased glycation of amino-terminal valine versus intrachain lysine residues. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate exerted similar effects on the glycation of hemoglobin, suggesting that inorganic and organic phosphates may play an important role in determining the kinetics and specificity of glycation of hemoglobin in the red cell. Overall, these studies establish that buffering ions or ligands can exert significant effects on the kinetics and specificity of glycation of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W96140081,"The structure of the calf uterus nontransformed molybdate-stabilized estradiol receptor (ER) has been investigated using affinity labeling with tamoxifen aziridine and several monoclonal antibodies directed either against the steroid binding protein (Mr approximately 65,000) or against the heat shock protein of Mr approximately 90,000 (hsp 90). The purification was performed using affinity chromatography and a DEAE-Sephacel column. The [3H] estradiol-ER complex was obtained as a well-defined radioactive peak, the specific activity varying between 1,600 and 3,400 pmol/mg of protein. The purified ER sediments in glycerol gradients at 9.4 +/- 0.2 (n = 5) and at 8.1 +/- 0.2 (n = 15) in a 0.15 M KCl containing gradient (8-9 S ER). From a measured Stokes radius of 7.4 +/- 0.2 nm (n = 12), an Mr of approximately 300,000 has been calculated. Studies of the purified 8-9 ER by glycerol gradient centrifugation and by twin assay with the JS34/32 anti-ER monoclonal antibody suggest the presence of two binding subunits in the nontransformed molecular complex. Results of immunological analysis with polyclonal and several monoclonal antibodies against hsp 90 suggest the association of two molecules of this protein to the two steroid binding subunits. In high salt medium (0.4 M KCl), the purified ER sediments at 5.2 +/- 0.3 (n = 8), has a Stokes radius of 5.7 nm +/- 0.1 (n = 2) and the Mr is approximately 129,000, values expected for a homodimer consisting of two hormone-binding subunits (Mr approximately 65,000), a result confirmed by glycerol gradient centrifugation experiments, using the monoclonal antibody JS34/32. The relationship between the nontransformed 8-9 ER and the transformed 5 S-ER forms are discussed, the simplest possibility being the release of the already formed homodimeric ER from 8-9 ER during transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1528419830,"Abstract Caldesmon is a major F-actin binding protein of smooth muscle that has been implicated as a component of a thin filament regulatory system. Chicken gizzard caldesmon consists of polypeptides of Mr-135,000 and 140,000 which are closely related as determined by analysis of cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments. It is a highly extended flexible protein having a contour length of about 146 nm and a secondary structure composed primarily of random coil. Physical and chemical cross-linking data suggest that caldesmon exists as a monomer in solution. The cysteine content of caldesmon was determined to be 2 residues/polypeptide. Remarkably, in solution it readily undergoes sulfhydryl oxidation to form either an internal disulfide bridge in the protein or cross-links between individual polypeptides to form dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc. The internally cross-linked species have a smaller Stokes radius than the reduced molecules, indicating that the cross-link trapped the molecule in a compact conformation. Oxidized protein containing caldesmon oligomers is a potent F-actin bundling protein. Complete reduction of caldesmon abolishes the F-actin bundling activity. Since a vast excess of reducing agent is required to convert caldesmon from an oxidized to reduced state, it may exist in either state in vivo. Thus, the ability of caldesmon to undergo reversible sulfhydryl cross-linking, and thereby reversible F-actin cross-linking, may be of physiological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1496312908,"11-cis-Retinaldehyde bound to cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) is unaffected in bovine eyecup preparations by illumination that bleaches approximately 70% of the rhodopsin. Illumination of retinal homogenates to which CRALBP X [3H]11-cis-retinaldehyde had been added did not result in a reduction of the specific activity of recovered 11-cis-retinaldehyde, ruling out a bleaching regeneration cycle. The quantum efficiency of photoisomerization for CRALBP X 11-cis-retinaldehyde was determined by comparing the rate of photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinaldehyde bound to purified CRALBP and opsin. The low value obtained (0.07), coupled with a low molar extinction coefficient (15,400 M-1 cm-1), results in a photosensitivity only about 4% that of rhodopsin. CRALBP binds 9-cis- and 11-cis-retinaldehyde, producing complexes with absorption maxima at 405 and 425 nm, respectively. No complexes were detected with 13-cis- and all-trans-retinaldehyde. Following incubation of CRALBP X 11-cis-retinol with an equimolar mixture of 9-, 11-, 13-cis-, and all-trans-retinaldehydes, only 11-cis-retinaldehyde and residual 11-cis-retinol are present on the protein following separation from excess retinoids. A similar result is obtained following incubation of CRALBP X 11-cis-retinol with mixtures of 9- and 11-cis-retinaldehyde ranging in composition from 9:1 to 1:9 (9-cis-:11-cis-,mol/mol). The results indicate that CRALBP X 11-cis-retinol is sufficiently stereoselective in its binding properties to warrant consideration as a component of the mechanism for the generation of 11-cis-retinaldehyde in the dark."
https://openalex.org/W1522919933,"We have developed a cell-free assay to detect and characterize nerve growth factor (NGF)-activated protein kinase activity. Cultured PC12 cells were briefly exposed to NGF, and extracts of these were assayed for phosphorylating activity using exogenously added tyrosine hydroxylase as substrate. Tyrosine hydroxylase was employed since it is an endogenous substrate of NGF-regulated kinase activity and is activated by phosphorylation. In the cell-free assay, extracts prepared from NGF-treated cells yielded a 2-3-fold greater incorporation of phosphate into tyrosine hydroxylase as compared with extracts of control, NGF-untreated cells. Activation did not occur, however, if NGF was added directly to cell extracts. The NGF-stimulated phosphorylating activity appeared to be due to regulation of a protein kinase rather than of a phosphoprotein phosphatase. Characterization of the kinase (designated as kinase N) showed that it is soluble, is detectably activated within 1-3 min after cells are exposed to NGF and maximally activated by 10 min, is half-maximally activated with 0.5 nM NGF and maximally activated with 1 nM NGF, is detectable in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ but does not require Ca2+, does not require nonmacromolecular cofactors, can use histone H1 as a substrate, and exhibits a 2-fold increase in apparent Vmax in response to NGF but does not undergo a significant change in apparent Km for either ATP or GTP. A number of characteristics of kinase N were assessed including susceptibility to inhibitors, substrate specificity, cofactor requirements, ATP dependence, and lack of down-regulation by prolonged expose to a phorbol ester. These studies indicated that it lacks tyrosine kinase activity and is distinct from a variety of well-characterized protein kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, and casein kinase II. Preliminary purification data show that the kinase has a basic pI and that it has an apparent Mr of 22,000-25,000. The only amino acid in tyrosine hydroxylase found to be phosphorylated by the semipurified kinase is serine."
https://openalex.org/W1588985663,"Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (cholesterol, NADPH: oxygen oxidoreductase, 7 alpha-hydroxylating, EC 1.14.13.17) was purified from liver microsomes of cholestryramine-fed male rats by using high-performance ion-exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 52,000), and its dithionite-reduced CO complex exhibited an absorption maximum at 450 nm. The specific content of the enzyme was 9 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein. Upon reconstitution with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, the enzyme showed a high activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation with the turnover number of 50 min-1 at 37 degrees C. The reaction was inhibited neither by aminoglutethimide nor by metyrapone, but inhibited markedly by iodoacetamide and disulfiram. The reaction was also inhibited significantly by CO. The enzyme catalyzed hydroxylation of cholesterol with strict regio- and stereoselectivity and was inert toward other sterols which are intermediates in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, i.e. 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (12 alpha-hydroxylation), 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol (25-hydroxylation), and taurodeoxycholate (7 alpha-hydroxylation). Unlike other cytochromes P-450 isolated from rat liver microsomes, the enzyme showed no activity toward testosterone and xenobiotics such as 7-ethoxycoumarin and benzo[a] pyrene. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was Met-Phe-Glu-Val(Ile)-Ser-Leu-, which was distinct from those of any other cytochromes P-450 of rat liver microsomes hitherto reported. These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel species of cytochrome P-450 so far not isolated from liver microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1597702906,"Treatment of rat liver cytosol containing temperature-transformed, [3H]dexamethasone-bound receptors at 0
degree C with the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) inhibits the DNA-binding activity of the receptor, and DNA-binding activity is restored after addition of dithiothreitol (DTT). When cytosol containing untransformed receptors is heated at 25 degrees C in the presence of MMTS, the 90-kDa heat shock protein dissociates from the receptor in the same manner as in the absence of MMTS, and the receptor will bind to DNA-cellulose if DTT is added subsequently at 0 degree C. These observations are consistent with the conclusion of Bodwell et al. (Bodwell, J. E., Holbrook. N. J. and Munck, A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1392-1398) that sulfhydryl moieties on the receptor are absolutely required for the receptor to bind to DNA, and they show that the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent does not inhibit the temperature-mediated dissociation of the heteromeric receptor complex that accompanies transformation to the DNA-binding state. When steroid-receptor complexes that are prebound to DNA-cellulose are exposed to MMTS, the steroid rapidly dissociates, but the receptor remains bound to DNA. Thus, the presence of steroid is not required for the receptor to remain bound to DNA in a high affinity manner. Treatment of cytosol containing transformed glucocorticoid-receptor complexes at 0 degrees C with 20 mM hydrogen peroxide also inactivates the DNA-binding activity of the receptor. The peroxide-induced inactivation is reversed by DTT. Incubation of rat liver cytosol containing untransformed glucocorticoid-receptor complexes at 25 degrees C with hydrogen peroxide prevents their transformation to the DNA-binding form as shown by their inability to bind to DNA-cellulose after addition of DTT. The presence of peroxide during heating of the cytosol also prevents dissociation of the receptor complex as assayed both by reduction in sedimentation value of the receptor and by dissociation of the 90-kDa heat shock protein from the steroid-binding protein. These results strongly suggest that critical sulfur moieties in the receptor complex must be in a reduced form for the temperature-mediated dissociation of the receptor to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1592395715,"Chromatin of the organism Physarum polycephalum contains a class of conformationally altered nucleosomes previously localized to the transcribing regions of ribosomal genes in nucleoli. When nuclei are treated with 2-iodo[2-tritium]acetate, the histone H3 sulfhydryl group of the altered nucleosomes is derivatized while that of folded nucleosomes is not, and the labeled histones can then be identified by autoradiography of gels that separate H3 isoforms. The H3 derivatized is predominantly of tri- and tetraacetylated forms. In contrast, total free histone reacted with iodoacetate shows no preferential labeling of isoforms. Selective reaction of acetylated H3 is prevalent in both nucleolar and non-nucleolar chromatin. The results link specific patterns of H3 acetylation to changes in nucleosome conformation that occur during transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1515003936,"Abstract The spectroscopic properties and specificity of binding of a fluorescent quaternary amine, ethidium, with acetylcholine receptor-enriched membranes from Torpedo californica have been examined. Competition binding with [3H]phencyclidine in the presence of carbamylcholine showed that ethidium binds with high affinity to a noncompetitive inhibitor site (KD = 3.6 X 10(-7) M). However, in the presence of alpha-toxin, ethidium's affinity is substantially lower (KD approximately 1 X 10(-3) M). Ethidium was also found to enhance [3H]acetylcholine binding with a KD characteristic of ethidium binding to a high-affinity noncompetitive inhibitor site. These findings indicate that ethidium binds to an allosteric site which is regulated by agonist binding and can convert the agonist sites from low to high affinity. Fluorescence titrations of ethidium in the presence of carbamylcholine yielded a similar KD (2.5 X 10(-7) M) and showed an ethidium stoichiometry of one site/acetylcholine receptor monomer. Ethidium was completely displaced by noncompetitive inhibitors such as phencyclidine, histrionicotoxin, and dibucaine. The enhanced fluorescence lifetime of the bound species showed that the increased fluorescence intensity reflects a 13-fold increase in quantum yield for the complex compared to ethidium in buffer. Fractional dissociation of ethidium with phencyclidine produced a double-exponential fluorescence decay rate with lifetime components characteristic of ethidium free in solution and bound to the receptor. These data argue that the alterations in ethidium fluorescence elicited by other ligands is due to a change in the fraction of specifically bound ethidium rather than a change in quantum yield of a pre-existing ethidium-acetylcholine receptor complex. The extent of polarization indicates that bound ethidium is strongly immobilized. The magnitude of the quantum yield enhancement and the shifts of excitation and emission maxima of bound ethidium suggest that its binding site is within a hydrophobic domain with limited accessibility to the aqueous phase."
https://openalex.org/W1597312744,"Abstract Heparin binding to rabbit histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) was studied in a purified system, allowing for determination of a heparin dissociation constant of approximately 5.5 X 10(-8) M for the interaction with HRG at pH 7.0. The strong interaction between heparin and HRG was demonstrated to be competitive with the binding of both antithrombin and thrombin to the heparin chain. HRG was further tested as a modulator of the anticoagulant activity of heparin by comparing rates of the heparin-catalyzed reaction between antithrombin and thrombin in the presence and absence of added HRG. The heparin-antithrombin-thrombin reaction was modeled using the formalism of a two-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction with heparin as the enzyme and HRG analyzed as an enzyme inhibitor. HRG was shown to compete with both antithrombin and thrombin for binding to heparin by this kinetic analysis. Thus, both the kinetic and heparin-binding data indicate that the mechanism by which HRG modulates heparin anticoagulant activity involves competition for heparin with both the inhibitor and the protease. Inhibition by HRG of the heparin-catalyzed reaction was found to be highly dependent on pH, with a sharp increase in inhibition from about 15% to greater than 90% observed as pH was lowered from 7.4 to 7.0. Since little change in the rate of the heparin-catalyzed inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin occurs in this pH region, the dramatic change in HRG inhibition seen upon pH titration may reflect increasing ionic interaction between heparin and HRG due to the protonation of histidine residues which occurs in this pH region."
https://openalex.org/W1520523074,"The amino acid sequence of staphylococcal enterotoxin A is presented. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is a single-chain polypeptide which consists of 233 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 27,078 and has the amino acid composition Cys2, Asp17, Asn19, Thr16, Ser13, Glu15, Gln12, Pro4, Gly15, Ala7, Val13, Met2, Ile10, Leu23, Tyr18, Phe8, His6, Lys24, Arg7, Trp2, with serine as both amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids. Automated sequence analysis of intact enterotoxin A, as well as characterization of the peptides obtained from cyanogen bromide treatment and trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion, led to the elucidation of the complete primary structure of this protein. Less structural homology is observed among staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B (Huang, I-Y., and Bergdoll, M. S. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 3518-3525), and C1 (Schmidt, J. J., and Spero, L. (1983) J.

https://openalex.org/W1670056524,"Abstract Lutropin (LH) receptor was solubilized from pseudopregnant rat ovaries and purified by two cycles of affinity chromatography on human choriogonadotropin (hCG)-Affi-Gel 10. The purified receptor preparation contained a single class of high-affinity 125I-hCG binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.1 X 10(-10) M (at 20 degrees C) and had a specific hormone binding capacity of 7920 pmol/mg of protein. The purified receptor migrated as a single 90-kDa band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Affinity cross-linking of the purified receptor to 125I-hCG produced a 130-kDa complex. Hormone-binding ability of the purified 90-kDa polypeptide was demonstrated also by ligand blotting. The purified receptor was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions followed by incubation with 125I-hCG. Autoradiography revealed labeling of a 90-kDa band. This labeling was displaced by unlabeled hCG and human LH but not by human follitropin or rat prolactin. In addition, LH receptors of bovine corpora lutea and mouse Leydig tumor cells were shown by ligand blotting to contain a 90-kDa hormone binding unit, suggesting that LH receptor structure is well conserved among mammalian species. The purified rat ovarian LH receptor bound to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, implying that the receptor is a glycoprotein. These results demonstrate that the hormone-binding unit of rat ovarian LH receptor is a 90-kDa membrane glycopolypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1536580561,"The effects of compounds previously described to inhibit anion transport were tested for their ability to inhibit anion antiport in Vero cells as measured by uptake of 36Cl- by chloride self-exchange and as bicarbonate-linked uptake of 22Na+. While 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid inhibited both processes, ethacrynic acid and probenecid selectively inhibited the uptake of 36Cl-. Low concentrations of pyridoxal phosphate and picrylsulfonic acid selectively inhibited the bicarbonate linked uptake of 22Na+, while higher concentrations of these compounds also inhibited the uptake of 36Cl-. Measurements of the internal pH indicated that ethacrynic acid inhibits Na+-independent HCO-3/Cl- exchange, while it has no measurable effect on Na+-linked bicarbonate-dependent regulation of the internal pH. Conversely, picrylsulfonic acid selectively inhibits the latter process. The results indicate that anion antiport in Vero cells occurs by two independent processes."
https://openalex.org/W1631424226,"The capacity of lipoprotein fractions to provide cholesterol necessary for human lymphocyte proliferation was examined. When endogenous synthesis of cholesterol was blocked, proliferation of mitogen-stimulated normal human lymphocytes was markedly inhibited unless an exogenous source of sterol was supplied. All lipoprotein fractions with the exception of high density lipoprotein subclass 3 were able to provide cholesterol for lymphocyte proliferation. Each of the lipoprotein subfractions capable of providing cholesterol was also able to regulate endogenous sterol synthesis in cultured human lymphocytes. Provision of cholesterol by lipoproteins required the interaction of apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein E with specific receptors on normal lymphocytes. Apolipoprotein modification by acetylation or methylation, which markedly reduced the ability to regulate sterol biosynthesis, also diminished the capacity of lipoproteins to provide cholesterol. In addition, depletion of apolipoprotein B- and apolipoprotein E-containing particles from high density lipoprotein decreased its ability to suppress cholesterol synthesis and prevented it from providing cholesterol to proliferating lymphocytes. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor-recognition sites on apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein E were used to define the specific apolipoproteins required for the provision of cholesterol to lymphocytes by the various lipoprotein fractions. The antibody to apolipoprotein B inhibited cholesterol provision by both low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoprotein fractions. The antibody to apolipoprotein E did not decrease provision of cholesterol by LDL but did inhibit the capacity of other fractions to provide cholesterol. In addition, a monoclonal antibody against the ligand binding site on the LDL receptor inhibited provision of cholesterol to normal lymphocytes by all lipoproteins. Finally, lymphocytes lacking LDL receptors were unable to obtain cholesterol from any lipoprotein fraction. These studies demonstrate that LDL receptor-mediated interaction with apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein E is essential for the provision of cholesterol to normal human lymphocytes from all lipoprotein sources."
https://openalex.org/W1584335408,"A system for the assay of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase in digitonin-permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cells is described. Under these conditions, HMG-CoA reductase remained intact and associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and values for Km (HMG-CoA), Ki (mevinolin), and active/total activity were similar to those seen in sonicated cell preparations. However, the mechanism by which this rapidly turned over (half-life approximately 2 h) enzyme is degraded was disrupted. Addition of ATP at physiological concentrations to digitonin-permeabilized cells resulted in the rapid, irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Immunoblot analysis showed that this loss of activity was followed by cleavage of the intact 97-kilodalton enzyme to a 68-kilodalton fragment which was distinct from the catalytically active fragments generated by nonspecific proteolysis in sonicated cell homogenates. Assay of a lysosomal marker enzyme confirmed that ATP-mediated inactivation and cleavage of reductase was not due to release of lysosomal proteases. The possible role of ATP in phosphorylation, inactivation, and degradation of reductase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536913940,"The role of antithrombin conformation in heparin-catalyzed inhibition of thrombin was investigated using antithrombins modified with the tryptophan reagent dimethyl (2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl) sulfonium bromide (HNB). Affinity fractionation of HNB-labeled antithrombin (0.6-0.7 mol of HNB/mol of protein) on heparin-Sepharose using a linear salt gradient allowed separation of three singly labeled protein species and a fourth HNB-antithrombin species which co-eluted with unlabeled protein. Conformational alterations induced by heparin binding to each of the labeled antithrombins were assessed by spectroscopic techniques, including protein fluorescence, difference spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible range, and circular dichroism. Comparison of spectra of the labeled proteins in the presence and absence of added heparin indicated changes to occur in protein conformation at the sites of the bound HNB moieties and at aromatic amino acid residues within the protein matrix. These spectroscopic alterations mimicked changes induced by heparin in the native protein, but were reduced in magnitude. Rates of thrombin inactivation by the labeled antithrombins were measured over a wide range in both heparin concentration and inhibitor concentration to determine maximal rates of protease inactivation. The kinetic analysis indicated that each of these HNB-antithrombin derivatives, which undergo the heparin-induced changes to varying extents, can react with thrombin at the same maximal rate. Thus, this series of chemically modified antithrombin species demonstrated that the conformational change which is induced in antithrombin by heparin does not render the protein intrinsically more reactive toward thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1554835567,"Dunaliella salina cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min with [14C]palmitic acid, [14C]oleic acid, or [14C]lauric acid in order to trace the pathway of galactolipid biosynthesis and desaturation. Through the use of high performance liquid chromatography it was possible to follow the movement of radioactivity through many individual molecular species of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) for periods of 24 h and, in some cases, as much as 120 h. Analysis of the fatty acid fluxes permitted us to refine current views regarding biosynthesis of the predominantly prokaryotic galactolipids. The initial D. salina MGDG molecular species, containing paired oleate and palmitate (18:1/16:0), can follow two metabolic routes. If the palmitoyl chain is desaturated to 16:1, the resulting 18:1/16:1 MGDG is subject to rapid further desaturation to varying degrees, and a part of these products is subsequently galactosylated to DGDG. Contrary to widely held opinions, these DGDG molecular species can themselves be further desaturated toward a 18:3/16:4 final product. In a separate series of reactions, a smaller portion of the nascent 18:1/16:0 MGDG is directly galactosylated to 18:1/16:0 DGDG. This molecular species can then be sequentially desaturated to 18:2/16:0 DGDG and 18:3/16:0 DGDG. However, there is only very limited desaturation of the palmitoyl group attached to these molecular species."
https://openalex.org/W1493845773,"The yeast transcription factor TFIIIB has been examined with regard to its hydrodynamic properties. This protein, which is required for both tRNA and 5 S rRNA gene transcription in vitro, exhibits unusual physical properties. When analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TFIIIB is a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 60,000. When this transcription factor is subjected to rate zonal centrifugation on glycerol gradients, it sediments between ovalbumin (Mr = 45,000) and bovine serum albumin (Mr = 66,300). This sedimentation behavior is consistent with TFIIIB being a monomer in its native state. However, when TFIIIB was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography it was determined to have a Stokes radius of 53 A, eluting from this chromatography matrix near the position of catalase (Mr = 248,000). This anomalous behavior suggests that TFIIIB is a very asymmetric molecule. Purified TFIIIB was subjected to amino acid analyses and the resulting composition data used to calculate a partial specific volume for the intact molecule. All of these data were then used to estimate possible molecular dimensions of the native TFIIIB molecule. Results of these calculations are consistent with the idea that this transcription factor is a very elongated entity."
https://openalex.org/W2416535934,"We report that the gene for thymidylate synthase (TS) is amplified in the mouse cell line L1210:C15 that was selectively grown in increasing concentrations of the competitive inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, CB3717. The gene is amplified 50-fold compared to the parental cell line. Amplification has not been accompanied by any major rearrangements, and the increase in gene copy number is reflected in elevation of thymidylate synthase mRNA levels. The amplification is relatively stable as there was only a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the number of amplified TS genes when cells were grown in the absence of selection for 375 generations. We also observe a 30- to 40-fold increase in number of copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene with 7-fold elevation of the RNA product, and we suggest that this may be due to cross-inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by CB3717. Thymidylate synthase mRNA levels in L1210 and L1210:C15 show no variation within the different phases of the cell cycle but are significantly reduced during quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W1489493882,"The structure of the membrane-bound and Triton X-100-solubilized female rat liver prolactin receptor has been studied by affinity cross-linking/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and sucrose/H2O and sucrose/D2O density gradient centrifugation. Hydrodynamic characterization revealed that the 125I-human growth hormone receptor-detergent complex represents a molecular species with a Stokes radius of 61 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 5.0 s, and a calculated molecular weight of 158,000. The molecular weight of the receptor was calculated to be 92,000. Three lactogenic hormone-binding species with Mr values of 87,000, 40,000, and 35,000, respectively, were repeatedly found when detergent-solubilized preparations were analyzed using an affinity cross-linking technique. Estrogen treatment of female rats increased the intensity of these bands. Occasionally, an Mr 165,000 hormone-binding species was also found. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies (first dimension, nonreducing; second dimension, reducing) demonstrated that disulfide- and nondisulfide-linked hormone-binding species with Mr values of 40,000 and 35,000 are contained within the Mr 87,000 species. It is concluded that the Triton X-100-solubilized female rat liver prolactin receptor has a molecular weight of about 90,000. This molecular species contains Mr 40,000 and Mr 35,000 hormone-binding subunits. It cannot be determined whether these subunits are combined with each other or with as yet undetected subunit(s) to make up the Mr 90,000 species, or whether each one of these subunits is a proteolytic fragment of the Mr 90,000 species."
https://openalex.org/W1566053729,"The low-temperature recombination of CO with myoglobin was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The bound state of carbon monoxide myoglobin has two distinct conformers observed at 1926 and 1945 cm-1 with an intensity ratio of 1 to 8. The recombination of these bands after complete photolysis at 10 K followed by a temperature jump shows distinct kinetics for the two bands. Although both bands apparently follow the nonexponential kinetics originally described by Frauenfelder and co-workers (Austin, R., Beeson, K., Eisenstein, L., Frauenfelder, H., and Gunsalus, I. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 5355-5373), the 1926 cm-1 band does not appear appreciably below 70 K. In fact, after 20 min of recombination at 70 K the 1945 cm-1 band is fully recovered, while no detectable amount of the 1926 cm-1 band is present. This is the first association of a spectroscopic marker of protein substructure with reaction kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1518318144,"13C and 2H NMR spectroscopy has been employed to probe the biosynthesis of vitamin B6 in Escherichia coli. The 13C NMR spectrum of a sample of pyridoxol derived biosynthetically from D-[1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]glucose shows that the bonds, C(2)-C(3) and C(4)-C(5), of the pyridine nucleus are the only two carbon-carbon bonds of pyridoxol which are generated de novo in the course of its biosynthesis from glucose. It follows that the pyridoxol skeleton is generated from two intact triose units and a triose-derived two-carbon unit, all of which are supplied by glucose. From the 2H NMR spectra of samples of pyridoxol derived from (R)-[1,1-2H2]glycerol and (S)-[1,1-2H2]glycerol, respectively, it can be deduced that the rehydroxymethyl group of glycerol enters C-2', C-4', and C-5' of the pyridoxol skeleton. It follows that each of the three fragments is derived from glycerol in stereo-specific fashion. These results answer questions concerning the regiochemistry and the stereochemistry of pyridoxol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1571080517,"Heparin has been shown to exhibit lower affinity for the antithrombin-thrombin complex than for antithrombin alone (Carlstrom, A.-S., Lieden, K., and Bjork, I. (1977) Thromb. Res. 11, 785-797), suggesting that structural alterations in antithrombin may accompany its reaction with thrombin. The hydroxy-nitrobenzyl (HNB) group attached to a unique tryptophan has been used in the present study as an extrinsic probe for localization of conformational changes to the heparin-binding region within antithrombin III using immunochemical and spectral techniques. Site-specific modification of tryptophan-49 in antithrombin with the hydroxynitrobenzyl reagent blocks heparin binding to the protein and provides a chemical label in the heparin-binding region of the protein (Blackburn, M. N., Smith, R. L., Carson, J., and Sibley, C. C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 939-941). Antibodies specific for the hydroxynitrobenzyl hapten, which bind to HNB-tryptophan-49 in antithrombin, were used to detect a change in conformation in the region of tryptophan-49 which occurs upon thrombin binding to antithrombin. This thrombin-induced structural change was also apparent from spectral perturbations which were detected with the environmentally sensitive HNB moiety. Thus, the HNB group was used as an immunochemical probe as well as a spectral reporter group to provide insight into an allosteric mechanism of control in the catalytic role of heparin. The thrombin-promoted alteration of the structure in the heparin-binding region is presumably responsible for recycling of heparin, allowing it to catalyze further reactions between antithrombin and thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1556030957,"The Km of dopamine beta-hydroxylase for its cofactor, ascorbic acid, was determined in situ in primary cultures of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells and in isolated chromaffin vesicles. A range of intravesicular ascorbate concentrations in chromaffin cell cultures (1.1-31.2 mM) was achieved by varying the number and concentration of ascorbate additions to the culture media. The rate of octopamine synthesis from tyramine displayed a Michaelis-Menten relationship with respect to ascorbate concentration and an apparent Km of dopamine beta-hydroxylase for ascorbate of 15.0 +/- 2.0 mM was determined. In isolated chromaffin vesicles, with an initial intravesicular ascorbate concentration of approximately 10 mM, ascorbate consumption during beta-hydroxylation occurred as a first order process. This indicated that dopamine beta-hydroxylase was not saturated at this initial ascorbate concentration. When isolated chromaffin vesicles were prepared with different intravesicular ascorbate concentrations, the rate of octopamine synthesis displayed a Michaelis-Menten relationship with respect to ascorbate with an apparent Km of 17.0 +/- 5.0 mM. Ascorbate consumption also occurred as a first order process in ascorbate-loaded chromaffin-vesicle ghosts which had initial ascorbate concentrations of approximately 30 mM but which were depleted of other small molecules such as catecholamines. These results indicate that the in situ Km of dopamine beta-hydroxylase for ascorbate (approximately 15 mM) is 25-fold higher than it is for the purified or partially purified enzyme assayed under optimal conditions in vitro (0.6 mM). The factor(s) which decreases the enzyme affinity for ascorbate, relative to in vitro, resides in the chromaffin vesicle interior and is also retained in chromaffin-vesicle ghosts. The mechanism of this effect remains to be determined. The Km value determined in these experiments is close to the estimated intravesicular ascorbate concentration of bovine chromaffin granules in vivo (4), suggesting that the availability of ascorbate could become a factor in regulating the rate of dopamine beta-hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1596448137,"Studies were performed to determine to what extent phosphatidylcholines (PCs) of different composition influence the turnover of lipoprotein cholesterol. Lipoprotein recombinants with the composition and structure of spherical high density lipoproteins (HDL-R) were prepared with apoproteins, 14C-labeled unesterified cholesterol (UC), a [3H]cholesteryl ester (CE), and one of four single molecular species of PC. PCs were selected to include relatively hydrophilic species (16:1-16:1 and 16:0-18:2 PCs) and relatively hydrophobic species (18:0-18:2 and 20:1-20:1 PCs). PCs were also selected to include molecules with novel acyl group pairs (16:1-16:1 and 20:1-20:1 PCs) that would permit the whole molecule to be traced during its clearance from the serum. Rats were injected with HDL-R as an intravenous bolus, and serum, liver, and bile samples were obtained for up to 2 h. The clearance from the serum of each PC was monoexponential with the two most hydrophilic species much more rapidly cleared than either of the two less hydrophilic species. Clearance of specific PCs was not accompanied by PC remodeling (i.e. transacylations), and in the main could not be attributed to the action of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). In incubations designed to simulate in vivo conditions, no more than 15% of the disappearance of 16:1-16:1 PC, one of the most rapidly cleared PCs, was due to the action of LCAT. With 20:1-20:1 PC, one of the least rapidly cleared PCs, no LCAT activity could be detected. The clearance of radiolabeled UC was multiexponential and closely corresponded to the rate of disappearance of each PC. The clearance of radiolabeled CE was linear and, in contrast to UC, was the same with the administration of different PCs. Uptake of radiolabeled UC by the liver and excretion of radiolabeled UC into bile took place in parallel and corresponded to the rapidity of turnover of UC (and PCs) in the serum. With administration of 16:1-16:1 PC, complete equilibration of serum, liver, and bile UC was achieved by about 90 min, whereas with 20:1-20:1 PC, serum UC had not equilibrated by the end of the study. These findings demonstrate that, in the live animal, the kinetic pattern of transport of different lipids from an HDL recombinant is highly disparate, the rate of PC clearance is more rapid with molecular species of greater hydrophilic strength, and the rates of PC and UC clearance are closely coordinated and largely independent of the clearance of CE."
https://openalex.org/W1583618165,"A lectin has been identified in the cell line, SB-1, originally derived from the roots of Glycine max. This lectin, which we shall refer to as SB-1 lectin, was isolated on the basis of its carbohydrate-binding activity (affinity chromatography on Sepharose column derivatized with N-caproyl-galactosamine) and its immunological cross-reactivity (immunoblotting with rabbit antibodies directed against seed soybean agglutinin (SBA]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting analysis of SB-1 lectin revealed a major polypeptide (Mr approximately equal to 30,000) which co-migrated with seed SBA. This form of the lectin was observed in fractions purified from culture medium of SB-1 cells or supernatant fraction of SB-1 cell suspension after enzymatic removal of cell wall. Extracts of SB-1 cells under some other conditions yielded a major band (Mr approximately equal to 60,000) as revealed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-seed SBA; prolonged incubation of these samples in the presence of SDS resulted in the appearance of the 30-kDa polypeptide. It appears that the 60-kDa band represented a highly stable, even under SDS-PAGE conditions, dimeric form of the 30-kDa subunit. The SB-1 lectin derived from the culture medium was compared with seed SBA by gel filtration and by peptide mapping after limited proteolysis; no difference between the lectins from the two sources was found. Extracts of soybean roots fractionated on N-caproyl-galactosamine-Sepharose affinity columns yielded, upon elution with galactose, polypeptides of Mr 30,000 and 60,000. These results suggest that soybean roots contain a lectin whose polypeptide composition corresponds to that of seed SBA and SB-1 lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1853230342,"A 1.8-A resolution x-ray crystallographic restrained least squares refinement has been carried out on the phenylethane boronic acid (PEBA) complex of alpha-chymotrypsin dimer (alpha-CHT), and it has been compared to the 1.67-A resolution structure of the native enzyme. PEBA has a high binding affinity for alpha-CHT, and the boronate forms a tetrahedral complex with Ser-195 OG of one molecule of the dimer; the boronate in the other molecule is severely disordered and does not form a tetrahedral complex. The former could be a model of the transition state of catalysis. The complex of PEBA X alpha-CHT displays significant nonequivalence in conformation of side chains between the independent molecules comparable to the native enzyme, but, like the latter, shows a high degree of fidelity in the folding of the main chain. The orientation of the phenyl ring, CA and CB of PEBA, in the specificity sites of the two molecules is similar, suggesting that recognition is fairly insensitive to small departures from local symmetry; the same does not apply to the boronate functionalities suggesting that greater precision is required for catalysis. The folding of the molecule remains the same upon PEBA binding, but some of the side chains respond nonequivalently. The latter is a consequence of the inherent nonequivalence of the native dimer and the asymmetrical nature of the PEBA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2150470384,"Abstract cAMP induces the activation and subsequent desensitization of adenylate cyclase in Dictyostelium discoideum. cAMP also induces down-regulation of surface cAMP receptors. Desensitization of adenylate cyclase is composed of a rapidly reversible component (adaptation) and a slowly reversible component related to down-regulation of surface cAMP receptors (Van Haastert, P.J.M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7700-7704). The agonistic and antagonistic activities of the cAMP derivative adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate ((Rp)-cAMPS) for these responses were investigated. (Rp)-cAMPS competes with cAMP for binding to different receptor forms with an apparent Ki = 5 microM. (Rp)-cAMPS does not activate adenylate cyclase and antagonizes the cAMP-induced activation with an apparent Ki = 5 microM. (Rp)-cAMPS induces down-regulation of surface cAMP receptors with EC50 = 5 microM. (Rp)-cAMPS induces desensitization of adenylate cyclase, which is not rapidly reversible. These results indicate that desensitization of adenylate cyclase by (Rp)-cAMPS is due to down-regulation of surface cAMP receptors and not to adaptation. We conclude that down-regulation of surface cAMP receptors does not require their activation or modification involved in adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1560052438,"The concentration of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate in erythrocytes was increased by more than 100-fold when red cells were incubated with extracellular phosphoenolpyruvate at 37 degrees C. Since these elevated levels were maintained for 60 min, the metabolism of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate and related compounds could be investigated in phosphoenolpyruvate-treated erythrocytes. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate synthesis was not affected by intracellular pH when the 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate level was constant but did vary with 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate concentration. On the other hand, the relationship between the rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis and 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate concentration was not straightforward. At relatively low concentrations of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate, the observed rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis agreed with a rate calculated from a formula incorporating kinetic parameters of purified 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase (Rose, Z.B. (1973) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 158, 903-910). However, at high concentrations of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate, the observed rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis was lower than the calculated value. The concentration of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate did not increase even when 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate was elevated to 200 microM. Elevated levels of intracellular 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate did not inhibit glycolytic activity in these erythrocytes. These results suggest that incubation of erythrocytes with phosphoenolpyruvate is a useful technique to investigate the effect of metabolic perturbations at the intermediate stages of glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1487652567,"Abstract In this report, we describe a method for high-resolution mapping of a nuclease hypersensitive site (HS) at the promoter region of the chicken beta 2-tubulin gene transfected into monkey Cos-7 cells. Using the indirect end-labeling method of Wu, a tissue-specific nuclease HS was located initially approximately 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. For high-resolution mapping of the HS in the transfected DNA, a DNA fragment of about 400 base pairs containing the promoter region of the beta 2 gene was subcloned into M13 phage. A single-stranded DNA probe with a defined restriction enzyme cleavage site at one end was prepared from the M13 phage DNA template. The single-stranded probe and the restriction enzyme-digested DNA, prepared from nuclease-digested nuclei from transfected cells, were sequentially annealed back to the template. After ligation between the probe and the transfected DNA, the HS was determined by DNA sequencing gel electrophoresis. This method permits determination of the 3' boundary of the HS with precision at the single-nucleotide level. We mapped a major HS at -107 nucleotides of the beta 2-tubulin gene, where a CACCC-like sequence is present. The application of this method in determining HS is discussed."
