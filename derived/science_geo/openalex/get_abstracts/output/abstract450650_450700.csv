https://openalex.org/W2067975546,"The acknowledgement of risks for traumatic brain injury in American football players has prompted studies for sideline concussion diagnosis and testing for neurological deficits. While concussions are recognized etiological factors for a spectrum of neurological sequelae, the consequences of sub-concussive events are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) and the accompanying surge of the astrocytic protein S100B in blood may cause an immune response associated with production of auto-antibodies. We also wished to determine whether these events result in disrupted white matter on diffusion tensor imaging (DT) scans. Players from three college football teams were enrolled (total of 67 volunteers). None of the players experienced a concussion. Blood samples were collected before and after games (n = 57); the number of head hits in all players was monitored by movie review and post-game interviews. S100B serum levels and auto-antibodies against S100B were measured and correlated by direct and reverse immunoassays (n = 15 players; 5 games). A subset of players underwent DTI scans pre- and post-season and after a 6-month interval (n = 10). Cognitive and functional assessments were also performed. After a game, transient BBB damage measured by serum S100B was detected only in players experiencing the greatest number of sub-concussive head hits. Elevated levels of auto-antibodies against S100B were elevated only after repeated sub-concussive events characterized by BBBD. Serum levels of S100B auto-antibodies also predicted persistence of MRI-DTI abnormalities which in turn correlated with cognitive changes. Even in the absence of concussion, football players may experience repeated BBBD and serum surges of the potential auto-antigen S100B. The correlation of serum S100B, auto-antibodies and DTI changes support a link between repeated BBBD and future risk for cognitive changes."
https://openalex.org/W2092312897,"Background Short sleep duration and decreased sleep quality are emerging risk factors for obesity and its associated morbidities. Chronotype, an attribute that reflects individual preferences in the timing of sleep and other behaviors, is a continuum from morningness to eveningness. The importance of chronotype in relation to obesity is mostly unknown. Evening types tend to have unhealthy eating habits and suffer from psychological problems more frequently than Morning types, thus we hypothesized that eveningness may affect health parameters in a cohort of obese individuals reporting sleeping less than 6.5 hours per night. Methodology and Principal Findings Baseline data from obese (BMI: 38.5±6.4 kg/m2) and short sleeping (5.8±0.8 h/night by actigraphy) participants (n = 119) of the Sleep Extension Study were analyzed (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT00261898). Assessments included the Horne and Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire, a three-day dietary intake diary, a 14-day sleep diary, 14 days of actigraphy, and measurements of sleep apnea. Twenty-four hour urinary free cortisol, 24 h urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, morning plasma ACTH and serum cortisol, fasting glucose and insulin, and lipid parameters were determined. Eveningness was associated with eating later in the day on both working and non-working days. Progression towards eveningness was associated with an increase in BMI, resting heart rate, food portion size, and a decrease in the number of eating occasions and HDL-cholesterol. Evening types had overtly higher 24 h urinary epinephrine and morning plasma ACTH levels, and higher morning resting heart rate than Morning types. In addition, Evening types more often had sleep apnea, independent of BMI or neck circumference. Conclusions Eveningness was associated with eating later and a tendency towards fewer and larger meals and lower HDL-cholesterol levels. In addition, Evening types had more sleep apnea and higher stress hormones. Thus, eveningness in obese, chronically sleep-deprived individuals compounds the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1987459626,"The aging phenotype in humans has been thoroughly studied but a detailed metabolic profiling capable of shading light on the underpinning biological processes of longevity is still missing. Here using a combined metabonomics approach compromising holistic (1)H-NMR profiling and targeted MS approaches, we report for the first time the metabolic phenotype of longevity in a well characterized human aging cohort compromising mostly female centenarians, elderly, and young individuals. With increasing age, targeted MS profiling of blood serum displayed a marked decrease in tryptophan concentration, while an unique alteration of specific glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are seen in the longevity phenotype. We hypothesized that the overall lipidome changes specific to longevity putatively reflect centenarians' unique capacity to adapt/respond to the accumulating oxidative and chronic inflammatory conditions characteristic of their extreme aging phenotype. Our data in centenarians support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade as we underpinned increased concentration of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting enhanced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE, markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative products of linoleic acid. Lastly, we also revealed that the longevity process deeply affects the structure and composition of the human gut microbiota as shown by the increased extrection of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in urine of centenarians. Together, our novel approach in this representative Italian longevity cohort support the hypothesis that a complex remodeling of lipid, amino acid metabolism, and of gut microbiota functionality are key regulatory processes marking exceptional longevity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2028993035,"Social movements rely in large measure on networked communication technologies to organize and disseminate information relating to the movements’ objectives. In this work we seek to understand how the goals and needs of a protest movement are reflected in the geographic patterns of its communication network, and how these patterns differ from those of stable political communication. To this end, we examine an online communication network reconstructed from over 600,000 tweets from a thirty-six week period covering the birth and maturation of the American anticapitalist movement, Occupy Wall Street. We find that, compared to a network of stable domestic political communication, the Occupy Wall Street network exhibits higher levels of locality and a hub and spoke structure, in which the majority of non-local attention is allocated to high-profile locations such as New York, California, and Washington D.C. Moreover, we observe that information flows across state boundaries are more likely to contain framing language and references to the media, while communication among individuals in the same state is more likely to reference protest action and specific places and times. Tying these results to social movement theory, we propose that these features reflect the movement’s efforts to mobilize resources at the local level and to develop narrative frames that reinforce collective purpose at the national level."
https://openalex.org/W1981240678,"Commercial capture fisheries produce huge quantities of offal, as well as undersized and unwanted catch in the form of discards. Declines in global catches and legislation to ban discarding will significantly reduce discards, but this subsidy supports a large scavenger community. Understanding the potential impact of declining discards for scavengers should feature in an eco-system based approach to fisheries management, but requires greater knowledge of scavenger/fishery interactions. Here we use bird-borne cameras, in tandem with GPS loggers, to provide a unique view of seabird/fishery interactions. 20,643 digital images (one min−1) from ten bird-borne cameras deployed on central place northern gannets Morus bassanus revealed that all birds photographed fishing vessels. These were large (>15 m) boats, with no small-scale vessels. Virtually all vessels were trawlers, and gannets were almost always accompanied by other scavenging birds. All individuals exhibited an Area-Restricted Search (ARS) during foraging, but only 42% of ARS were associated with fishing vessels, indicating much ‘natural’ foraging. The proportion of ARS behaviours associated with fishing boats were higher for males (81%) than females (30%), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Our study illustrates that fisheries form a very important component of the prey-landscape for foraging gannets and that a discard ban, such as that proposed under reforms of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, may have a significant impact on gannet behaviour, particularly males. However, a continued reliance on ‘natural’ foraging suggests the ability to switch away from scavenging, but only if there is sufficient food to meet their needs in the absence of a discard subsidy."
https://openalex.org/W2047269960,"Although the biological role of KRAS is clearly established in carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not completely understood. In this study, we provide evidence of a novel signaling network regulated by the transcription factor GLI1 mediating KRAS-induced carcinogenesis. Using pancreatic cancer (a disease with high prevalence of KRAS mutations) as a model, we show that loss of GLI1 blocks the progression of KRAS-induced pancreatic preneoplastic lesions in mice with pancreas-specific Cre-activated oncogenic mutant kras. Mice lacking GLI1 develop only low-grade lesions at low frequency, and in most cases, the pancreata are histologically normal. Further characterization of the phenotype showed a decrease in the activation of STAT3 in pancreatic preneoplastic lesions; STAT3 is a transcription factor required for the development of premalignant lesions and their progression into pancreatic cancer. Analysis of the mechanisms revealed a key role for GLI1 in maintaining the levels of activated STAT3 through the modulation of IL-6 signaling. GLI1 binds to the IL-6 mouse promoter and regulates the activity and expression of this cytokine. This newly identified GLI1/IL-6 axis is active in fibroblasts, a known source of IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment. Sonic hedgehog induces GLI1 binding to the IL-6 promoter and increases IL-6 expression in fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. Finally, we demonstrate that mutant KRAS initiates this cascade by inducing the expression of Sonic hedgehog in cancer cells. Collectively, these results define a novel role for GLI1 in carcinogenesis acting as a downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2010501769,"Acetylation on the tails of histones plays an important role in controlling transcription initiation. Although the steady-state abundances of histone acetyl groups have been reported, the rate at which histones are acetylated and deacetylated on a residue-specific basis has not been quantitatively established. We added [13C]glucose to human cells and monitored the dynamic incorporation of 13C-labeled acetyl groups onto specific histone lysines with quantitative mass spectrometry. We determined the turnover of acetylation to be generally slower than phosphorylation, but fast relative to methylation, and that the rate varied depending on the histone, the residue modified, and also the neighboring modifications. Cells were also treated with a deacetylase inhibitor to determine the rate due to histone acetyltransferase activity alone and in the absence of deacetylase activity. Introduction of 13C-labeled glucose also resulted in the incorporation of 13C into alanine, which allowed us to partition histones into existing and newly synthesized protein categories. Newly synthesized histones were slower to accumulate histone modifications, especially modifications associated with silent chromatin. Finally, we applied our new approaches to find that quiescent fibroblasts exhibited lower levels of labeled acetyl accumulation compared with proliferating fibroblasts. This suggests that acetylation rates can be modulated in cells in different biological states and that these changes can be detected with the approach presented here. The methods we describe can be broadly applied to defining the turnover of histone acetylation in other cell states such as during cellular reprogramming and to quantify non-histone protein acetylation dynamics.

That balance is shifted to activate or repress the neighboring gene. histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase nanoflow liquid chromatography. The donor for histone acetylation is acetyl-CoA, in both yeast and metazoans. In yeast, the intracellular pool of acetyl-CoA fluctuates widely across the cell cycle, peaking near the start of a new cycle. Cell growth can be initiated by the addition of acetyl-CoA, which stimulates acetylation of key growth gene promoters via an acetyltransferase complex (13Cai L. Sutter B.M. Li B. Tu B.P. Acetyl-CoA induces cell growth and proliferation by promoting the acetylation of histones at growth genes.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 426-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Human cells do not undergo division in response to the addition of carbon sources but instead use cues from growth factors and hormones. Similar to yeast, acetylation is regulated by metabolic intermediates of glucose, and one major enzyme involved is ATP-citrate lyase, which converts citrate produced by the mitochondria into acetyl-CoA (14Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. ATP-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism to histone acetylation.Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Removal of glucose or a reduction of ATP-citrate lyase resulted in a loss of acetylation on several histones and reduced transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism (14Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. ATP-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism to histone acetylation.Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Although the steady-state levels of histone lysine acetylation can be determined by methods such as Western blotting, understanding the dynamics whereby acetyl groups are added and removed requires methods for monitoring the newly deposited acetyl groups independently of the previously deposited acetyl groups. One approach has been to monitor the incorporation of radiolabeled carbon atoms. Radiolabeled acetate has been used to monitor the presence of acetyl moieties and to estimate histone turnover (15Allfrey V.G. Pogo B.G. Littau V.C. Gershey E.L. Mirsky A.E. Histone acetylation in insect chromosomes.Science. 1968; 159: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using radiolabeled acetate to label bulk histones, a half-life of ∼15 min for deacetylation was estimated by averaging all histones and all acetylated residues (no residue specificity) (16Chestier A. Yaniv M. Rapid turnover of acetyl groups in the four core histones of simian virus 40 minichromosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More recent approaches have also been developed to monitor acetylation dynamics in vitro and in vivo. In one study, NMR was used to monitor acetylation and deacetylation of reporter peptides. Recombinant HATs and HDACs were tested for the kinetics of acetyl exchange to determine specificity for particular lysines (17Dose A. Liokatis S. Theillet F.X. Selenko P. Schwarzer D. NMR profiling of histone deacetylase and acetyl-transferase activities in real time.ACS Chem Biol. 2011; 6: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In another study, a FRET probe was designed with an acetyl-binding domain (bromodomain) that specifically recognized H4K12Ac. The probe was used in live cells to monitor the accumulation of H4K12Ac following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Acetylation levels peaked after ∼3 h, suggesting that the half-maximal time for the addition of acetyl on H4K12 is <3 h. Another method used acid-urea gels to separate and quantify acetylated and non-acetylated H3 and also detected methylation marks on the acetylated histones (18Crump N.T. Hazzalin C.A. Bowers E.M. Alani R.M. Cole P.A. Mahadevan L.C. Dynamic acetylation of all lysine-4 trimethylated histone H3 is evolutionarily conserved and mediated by p300/CBP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dynamics of histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was discovered that acetylation accumulates faster on H3K4me3-containing histones than histones with other methylation marks in the presence of trichostatin A. Moreover, the transition from minimally acetylated to hyperacetylated histones with trichostatin A treatment was achieved after 15 min, which suggests that the half-maximal time for the addition of acetyl on H3K4me3-containing histones is <15 min (18Crump N.T. Hazzalin C.A. Bowers E.M. Alani R.M. Cole P.A. Mahadevan L.C. Dynamic acetylation of all lysine-4 trimethylated histone H3 is evolutionarily conserved and mediated by p300/CBP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7814-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a new method for monitoring the dynamics of histone acetylation using metabolic isotopic labeling of proteins with heavy 13C-labeled glucose in human cells paired with quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry. We show that acetylation rates vary depending on the modification state as well as the presence of neighboring modifications. We further characterized the rate of histone acetylation in the presence of an HDAC inhibitor and found that alanine labeling from glucose can partition histones into existing and new pools, revealing that modifications accumulate on new histones at different rates than old histones. Finally, we measured the accumulation of labeled acetyl groups in proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts and found that quiescent cells have lower labeling efficiency, although both cell types have similar overall steady-state acetylation levels. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) + 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). Cells were washed twice with PBS and introduced into labeling medium. DMEM + 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum + 10 mm [U-13C]sodium acetate (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) was used for acetate labeling experiments; DMEM without glutamine + 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum + 4 mm [U-13C]glutamine (Cambridge Isotopes) was used for glutamine labeling experiments; and DMEM without glucose + 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum + 4.5 g/liter [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes) was used for glucose-labeling experiments. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points by washing with PBS followed by scraping into PBS, pelleting, and flash freezing for −80 °C storage until subsequent analysis. Histones were isolated as described previously using acid extraction (20Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Extraction, purification and analysis of histones.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Histones were then derivatized with propionic anhydride to block unmodified lysines. Briefly, 100 μg of bulk histone was concentrated to 40 μl using a vacuum concentrator, and 20 μl of 3:1 anhydrous isopropyl alcohol to propionic anhydride (Sigma) was added. The solution was immediately neutralized by addition of a base. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and concentrated back to 40 μl, constituting one round of “propionylation.” One additional round of propionylation was performed, and the solution was reduced to near dryness. 85 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) was added, and histones were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 1:50 trypsin to histone for 6–8 h at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by acidifying with glacial acetic acid (to < pH 5) and freezing at −80 °C. Newly exposed N termini were modified with two rounds of propionylation. Histone peptides were purified from salts with C18 STAGE-Tips constructed as described previously (21Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Stop and go extraction tips for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, nanoelectrospray, and LC/MS sample pretreatment in proteomics.Anal Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). An Agilent 1200 series HPLC configured to split the flow for a final output of ∼200 nl/min was used to resolve histone peptides using a 75-μm inner diameter fused silica column packed with 10–15 cm of 5-μm C18 (Michrom, Auburn, CA). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0.7–30% buffer B (buffer A, 0.1 m acetic acid; buffer B, 95% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid) for 35 min followed by 30–98% buffer B for 30 min and were ionized via electrospray ionization. Peptides were analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Full scans of m/z 290–1000 with a resolution of 30,000 were measured in the Orbitrap. The mass spectrometry data were then analyzed using software that has been described previously elsewhere (22DiMaggio Jr., P.A. Young N.L. Baliban R.C. Garcia B.A. Floudas C.A.

Briefly, for a given peptide with several possible modifications, an optimization-based model simultaneously considers the MS isotopic distribution, MS/MS fragment ions, and relative peptide hydrophobicity relationships to identify and quantify all PTM isoforms. All charge states for modified peptides were included in the analysis. Interferences in the MS isotopic distributions between co-eluting labeled and unlabeled peptides were deconvoluted. The resulting identifications were subsequently validated by manual inspection of the tandem mass spectra. The raw abundance of each modified histone peptide identified by the algorithm was computed by integrating its contribution to the experimentally observed isotopic distribution across the peak width. This raw abundance is then normalized across all observable labeled states within a specific modified state. For instance, both the 12C- and 13C-labeled forms for each acetylation that we measured were used to determine the label incorporation for that modification (relative distribution). This method of normalization controls for variable ionization efficiencies across various modified states of the same peptide sequence, which could potentially skew the analysis and interpretation of the data. The software is available for licensing on the Princeton University website. The relative distribution of the labeled acetyl lysines across the time course were fitted (MATLAB, version 7.8) to the logarithmic function, y = A × (1 − e−t/B). This function was chosen to extrapolate both the asymptotic labeling efficiency as A and the time required to reach half of the asymptotic labeling efficiency as ln(2) × B for each modified histone peptide. This work will abbreviate the latter parameter as half-maximal time (t½max, minutes). Within a given time point for a given modified peptide, each replicate measurement was treated as a discrete datum, rather than collated with the other respective measurements into a single average, for the model to account directly for the variability across biological replicates and to increase the statistical significance of the optimizations. Primary human fibroblasts were isolated from foreskins. The subcutaneous cells of a foreskin were removed, and the tissue was cut into 1-mm-wide strips. The strips were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 0.5% dispase (Invitrogen). Following removal of the epidermis, the dermis was cut into 1 × 1 mm squares and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C in 1000 units/ml collagenase (Invitrogen). Cells were filtered through a 70-μm mesh filter, washed with growth medium (DMEM + 8% FBS + 1 mm sodium pyruvate + 10 mm HEPES + 2 nm l-glutamine + 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids), and plated in growth medium. Cells were cultured for 3–4 days to ensure purity of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were plated at ∼10,000 cells/cm2 and collected after 24 h for the proliferating state or after 14 days for the contact inhibition-induced quiescence state. Cells were cultured for 9 h in DMEM without glucose + 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum + 4.5 g/liter [U-13C]glucose for labeling experiments. To quantitatively measure rates of acetylation, we used three approaches for labeling intermediates that provide the carbons for acetyl groups (Fig. 1A). In the first approach, we added 13C-labeled glucose because its metabolism can ultimately lead to production of acetyl-CoA, the donor substrate used by HATs to acetylate histones. In the second approach, we utilized 13C-labeled glutamine, which can contribute carbons to the pool of acetyl-CoA used by HATs via the TCA cycle. In the third approach, we bypassed central carbon metabolism and added 13C-labeled acetate directly to the cells as the substrate for acetylation. HEK293 cells were cultured with these three isotopically labeled components individually, and the histones were analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). A control sample, in which no isotopically labeled components were added, served as a control that demonstrated the base-line isotopic distribution for the H3 peptide K18QLATK23(Ac)AAR (Fig. 1B). The species 570.84 m/z corresponds to the peptide in which Lys23 is acetylated and all atoms exist in their principal or most abundant isotopic state (monoisotopic state). The species 571.84 m/z is the acetylated peptide with two heavy isotopes, and this species exists due to naturally occurring isotopes that have been incorporated into the amino acids constituting the peptide. Labeling of the acetyl carbons with glucose, glutamine, or acetate caused a shift in abundance from the monoisotopic species (570.84) to the species with two heavy isotopes (571.84) because acetyl has two carbons that were 13C-labeled. The addition of 13C-labeled acetate or 13C-labeled glutamine for 24 h caused a modest amount of acetyl labeling, as indicated by a ∼20% increase in the relative abundance of 571.84 m/z (Fig. 1, C and D). 24 h of 13C-labeled glucose resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of the 571.84 species to ∼80% (Fig. 1E). The larger increase in the 13C labeling with glucose incubation compared with glutamine or acetate indicates that glucose is the major contributor of carbons to acetyl groups on human histones. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to confirm that the observed mass shift was in fact due to the heavy carbon isotopes incorporated into the acetyl group rather than the naturally occurring heavy isotopes within the peptide backbone. The H3 peptide K18QLATK23(Ac)AAR was fragmented in the mass spectrometer, and the fragments were detected. The masses of the fragments observed versus the theoretical masses revealed a 2-Da shift on the ions corresponding to the fragments that contain the acetylated lysine (Fig. 1F). Therefore, [13C]glucose is the preferred substrate to monitor the turnover of acetylation and is the predominant source of acetyl carbons in HEK293 cells. We extended our analysis using [13C]glucose to understand the dynamics of acetylation on several lysines on H3 and one acetylation on H4. HEK293 cells were cultured with 13C-labeled glucose and harvested at 10, 20, 60, 120, and 1440 min. Histones were acid-extracted and processed for nanoLC-MS/MS. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that after 10 min in the presence of labeled glucose, a shift was observed in the mass (529.3 m/z) corresponding to a labeled acetyl on the H3 peptide K9STGGK14APR in which either Lys9 or Lys14 is acetylated (Fig. 2, A and B). After 2 h of incubation with [13C]glucose, the abundance of the species with a labeled acetyl exceeded the abundance of the acetyl species with no labeled carbons (Fig. 2C). After incubation with 13C-labeled glucose for 24 h, the conversion of the unlabeled acetyl to the labeled form reached a maximum (Fig. 2D). Approximately 20% of the acetyl species was unlabeled even after 24 h and remained unlabeled after 48 h (data not shown). This is likely due to some contribution to acetylation from other unlabeled carbon sources such as glutamine supplied in the medium or recycling of metabolic or protein components. Our method for processing histones produced several small peptides containing one or two lysines. These lysines could be unmodified, methylated, or acetylated in the cell, and the modification status was determined via their predicted mass and predicted elution properties from the HPLC used to separate the peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Using custom software to identify and quantify these modified histone peptides, we determined the relative abundance of each of the modified forms for a given peptide. For the acetylated species, we then found the fraction that was unlabeled (old acetyl) versus labeled (new acetyl), and plotted the percentage of the labeled form over time (Fig. 2E). The data were fit to a logarithmic curve to generate a time constant used in calculating a half-maximum. Half-maximums were determined for six different acetylated forms on histone H3 and one acetylation on H4 (Table 1). Half-maximal times ranged from 53–87 min, which was much faster than the average cell cycle, and varied depending on the lysine modified as well as the presence of neighboring modifications. The half-maximum was fastest when Lys9 or Lys14 was acetylated, with no adjacent modifications on Lys9 or Lys14, or when Lys14 was acetylated and Lys9 was monomethylated. This is consistent with the absence of silencing marks near the monitored acetyls, at least on the observed peptide. The half-maximum of K14Ac was slower when measured on peptides that also contained Lys9 di- or trimethyl, suggesting that histone tails that contain modifications classified as “silencing marks” exhibit slower rates of acetylation on Lys14 than tails in which Lys14 is not near a silencing mark. The turnover of both Lys9 and Lys14 acetyl on the same peptide is 20 min slower than for a single acetylation event on Lys9 or Lys14, indicating that it is more time consuming to replace acetyls on two residues versus only one residue. The half-maximum of K18Ac or K23Ac was similar to that of K9me2K14Ac and K9me3K14Ac. The slowest half-maximum was on H4 in which Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, or Lys16 was acetylated. These data indicate that the rate of acetylation turnover varies as a function of the site of acetylation as well as the presence of nearby modifications on the same histone tail.TABLE 1Half-maximal (t½, minutes) values for acetylated residues on H3 and H4Modification[13C]Glucose (t½ maximum)[13C]Glucose + Butyrate (t½ maximum)Ratio of butyrate treated to glucose aloneminminH3K9Ac or K14Ac49.2–52.7–56.491.3–102.0–114.41.9H3K9me1K14Ac50.5–54.2–58.093.6–102.7–113.01.9H3K9me2K14Ac64.4–66.8–69.588.4—96.2–105.01.4H3K9me3K14Ac58.6–62.5–66.688.2–97.2–107.41.6H3K9AcK14Ac68.9–75.4–82.7177.0–185.3–194.42.5H3K18Ac or K23Ac63.7–66.1–68.684.2–90.6–97.71.4H4-1Ac80.0–86.7–94.186.5–93.5–101.21.1 Open table in a new tab To decouple the HATs and HDACs that contribute to the overall observed acetylation turnover, we cultured HEK293 cells in [13C]glucose medium that contained 10 mm sodium butyrate, a potent HDAC inhibitor. We did not, however, assume that butyrate targeted all HDACs similarly in our experiments, and therefore, some HDACs may still have been active even in the presence of butyrate. Cells were harvested at 10, 20, 60, 120, and 1440 min and processed for nanoLC-MS/MS. A shift in the relative abundance of the unlabeled acetyl to the 13C-labeled acetyl on either Lys9 or Lys14 of the H3 peptide K9STGGK14APR was observed after 10 min of incubation in [13C]glucose and butyrate (Fig. 3, A and B). After 2 h, the turnover approached 50% but was noticeably slower than without butyrate (Figs. 2C and 3C). After 24 h of labeling, the turnover reached a maximum that was lower than that observed with [13]glucose alone (Figs. 2D and 3D). The labeled fraction at each time point was plotted and fit to a logarithmic curve (Fig. 3E). Half-maximums were determined for six different acetylated forms on H3 and one acetyl on H4 (Table 1). Half-maximums were similar for H3K9Ac or K14Ac, K9me1K14Ac, K9me2K14Ac, K9me3K14Ac, K18Ac or K23Ac, and H4-1Ac. However, the ratio of the half-maximum with butyrate to without butyrate was different. A ratio of 2 would suggest that butyrate was targeting the relevant HDACs with high specificity and that turnover of the acetyl group is equally dependent on HATs and HDACs, instead of new histone synthesis or degradation. The ratio with to without butyrate was 1.9 for H3K9Ac or K14Ac and K9me1K14Ac, suggesting that the HAT(s) and HDAC(s) that modify these sites are contributing equally and that butyrate is an efficient inhibitor of the HDAC(s). The ratio for H3K9me2K14Ac, K9me3K14Ac, and K18Ac or K23Ac was ∼1.5, indicating that the HAT(s) and HDAC(s) that target these sites are not contributing equally or butyrate is not an efficient inhibitor of the HDAC(s). The ratio for H4-1Ac was the lowe"

The bacteria exhibited significant tolerance to selenite (SeO3(2-)) up to 100 mM concentration with an EC50 value of 140 mM. The spent medium (culture supernatant) contains the potential of reducing soluble and colorless SeO3(2-) to insoluble red elemental selenium (Se(0)) at 37°C. Characterization of red Se° product by use of UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis revealed the presence of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) of an average size of 21 nm. Most likely, the metabolite phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) released by strain JS-11 in culture supernatant along with the known redox agents like NADH and NADH dependent reductases are responsible for biomimetic reduction of SeO3(2-) to Se° nanospheres. Based on the bioreduction of a colorless solution of SeO3(2-) to elemental red Se(0), a high throughput colorimetric bioassay (Se-Assay) was developed for parallel detection and quantification of nanoparticles (NPs) cytotoxicity in a 96 well format. Thus, it has been concluded that the reducing power of the culture supernatant of strain JS-11 could be effectively exploited for developing a simple and environmental friendly method of Se-NPs synthesis. The results elucidated that the red colored Se° nanospheres may serve as a biosensor for nanotoxicity assessment, contemplating the inhibition of SeO3(2-) bioreduction process in NPs treated bacterial cell culture supernatant, as a toxicity end point."
https://openalex.org/W2056785446,"Circulating cell-free (ccf) fetal DNA comprises 3-20% of all the cell-free DNA present in maternal plasma. Numerous research and clinical studies have described the analysis of ccf DNA using next generation sequencing for the detection of fetal aneuploidies with high sensitivity and specificity. We sought to extend the utility of this approach by assessing semi-automated library preparation, higher sample multiplexing during sequencing, and improved bioinformatic tools to enable a higher throughput, more efficient assay while maintaining or improving clinical performance.Whole blood (10mL) was collected from pregnant female donors and plasma separated using centrifugation. Ccf DNA was extracted using column-based methods. Libraries were prepared using an optimized semi-automated library preparation method and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer in a 12-plex format. Z-scores were calculated for affected chromosomes using a robust method after normalization and genomic segment filtering. Classification was based upon a standard normal transformed cutoff value of z = 3 for chromosome 21 and z = 3.95 for chromosomes 18 and 13.Two parallel assay development studies using a total of more than 1900 ccf DNA samples were performed to evaluate the technical feasibility of automating library preparation and increasing the sample multiplexing level. These processes were subsequently combined and a study of 1587 samples was completed to verify the stability of the process-optimized assay. Finally, an unblinded clinical evaluation of 1269 euploid and aneuploid samples utilizing this high-throughput assay coupled to improved bioinformatic procedures was performed. We were able to correctly detect all aneuploid cases with extremely low false positive rates of 0.09%, <0.01%, and 0.08% for trisomies 21, 18, and 13, respectively.These data suggest that the developed laboratory methods in concert with improved bioinformatic approaches enable higher sample throughput while maintaining high classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2034435585,"Transition metals are central for bacterial virulence and host defense. P(1B)-ATPases are responsible for cytoplasmic metal efflux and play roles either in limiting cytosolic metal concentrations or in the maturation of secreted metalloproteins. The P(1B)-ATPase, CtpC, is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in a mouse model (Sassetti, C. M., and Rubin, E. J. (2003) Genetic requirements for mycobacterial survival during infection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 12989-12994). CtpC prevents Zn(2+) toxicity, suggesting a role in Zn(2+) export from the cytosol (Botella, H., Peyron, P., Levillain, F., Poincloux, R., Poquet, Y., Brandli, I., Wang, C., Tailleux, L., Tilleul, S., Charriere, G. M., Waddell, S. J., Foti, M., Lugo-Villarino, G., Gao, Q., Maridonneau-Parini, I., Butcher, P. D., Castagnoli, P. R., Gicquel, B., de Chastellièr, C., and Neyrolles, O. (2011) Mycobacterial P1-type ATPases mediate resistance to zinc poisoning in human macrophages. Cell Host Microbe 10, 248-259). However, key metal-coordinating residues and the overall structure of CtpC are distinct from Zn(2+)-ATPases. We found that isolated CtpC has metal-dependent ATPase activity with a strong preference for Mn(2+) over Zn(2+). In vivo, CtpC is unable to complement Escherichia coli lacking a functional Zn(2+)-ATPase. Deletion of M. tuberculosis or Mycobacterium smegmatis ctpC leads to cytosolic Mn(2+) accumulation but no alterations in other metals levels. Whereas ctpC-deficient M. tuberculosis is sensitive to extracellular Zn(2+), the M. smegmatis mutant is not. Both ctpC mutants are sensitive to oxidative stress, which might explain the Zn(2+)-sensitive phenotype of the M. tuberculosis ctpC mutant. CtpC is a high affinity/slow turnover ATPase, suggesting a role in protein metallation. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of CtpC leads to a decrease of Mn(2+) bound to secreted proteins and of the activity of secreted Fe/Mn-superoxide dismutase, particularly in M. smegmatis. Alterations in the assembly of metalloenzymes involved in redox stress response might explain the sensitivity of M. tuberculosis ctpC mutants to oxidative stress and growth and persistence defects in mice infection models."

While functional connectivity can reveal the synchronization between distant brain regions, the regional abnormalities in task-independent baseline brain activity are less clear, especially in specific frequency bands. Here, we used a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method combined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate low frequency spontaneous neural activity in the three different frequency bands (slow-5∶0.01–0.027 Hz; slow-4∶0.027–0.08 Hz; and typical band: 0.01–0.08 Hz) in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy controls. Compared with controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased ReHo in the precentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and posterior insula, whereas increased ReHo in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. Significant differences in ReHo between the two bands were found in fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus (slow-4> slow-5), and in basal ganglia, parahippocampus, and dorsal middle prefrontal gyrus (slow-5> slow-4). Importantly, we identified significant interaction between frequency bands and groups in the inferior occipital gyrus and caudate body. This study demonstrates that ReHo changes in schizophrenia are widespread and frequency dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2015705530,"Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and play critical roles in transcriptional activation via deposition of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in chromatin. Several Arabidopsis TrxG members have been characterized, and among them SET DOMAIN GROUP 2 (SDG2) has been shown to be necessary for global genome-wide H3K4me3 deposition. Although pleiotropic phenotypes have been uncovered in the sdg2 mutants, SDG2 function in the regulation of stem cell activity has remained largely unclear. Here, we investigate the sdg2 mutant root phenotype and demonstrate that SDG2 is required for primary root stem cell niche (SCN) maintenance as well as for lateral root SCN establishment. Loss of SDG2 results in drastically reduced H3K4me3 levels in root SCN and differentiated cells and causes the loss of auxin gradient maximum in the root quiescent centre. Elevated DNA damage is detected in the sdg2 mutant, suggesting that impaired genome integrity may also have challenged the stem cell activity. Genetic interaction analysis reveals that SDG2 and CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR-1 act synergistically in root SCN and genome integrity maintenance but not in telomere length maintenance. We conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 plays a distinctive role in the regulation of chromatin structure and genome integrity, which are key features in pluripotency of stem cells and crucial for root growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2089721826,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important pathological factor involved in serious inflammatory diseases and male reproductive impairments. Emerging evidence demonstrates that antimicrobial peptides possess protective activity in response to LPS-induced inflammation. However, the LPS-binding and/or immunosuppressive activity of β-defensins (DEFBs) has been underestimated. In the present work, we characterized a novel human defensin, DEFB114, which was expressed predominantly in the epididymis and gingival cells at the RNA level. Homogenous recombinant DEFB114 peptides were prepared and characterized using mass spectrometry. DEFB114 protein exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity with salt sensitivity against typical pathogenic microbes (i.e. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans). Interestingly, DEFB114 demonstrated novel LPS-binding activity in vitro and inhibited TNF-α release in RAW264.7 cultures through the inhibition of MAPK p42/44 when challenged with LPS. Moreover, DEFB114 could also rescue the LPS-induced reduction of human sperm motility in vitro and protect d-galactosamine-sensitized C57BL/6 mice from LPS-induced lethality in vivo. The protective activity of DEFB114 on RAW264.7, human sperm, and the d-galactosamine-sensitized mice was disulfide bond-dependent because alkylated DEFB114 lost its activity. The low cytotoxicity of the DEFB114 peptide toward human erythrocytes is indicative of its potential therapeutic use in the treatment of LPS-induced inflammation, LPS contamination, and potentially septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2142322178,"Background Large-scale forest conservation projects are underway in the Brazilian Amazon but little is known regarding their public health impact. Current literature emphasizes how land clearing increases malaria incidence, leading to the conclusion that forest conservation decreases malaria burden. Yet, there is also evidence that proximity to forest fringes increases malaria incidence, which implies the opposite relationship between forest conservation and malaria. We compare the effect of these environmental factors on malaria and explore its implications. Methods and Findings Using a large malaria dataset (∼1,300,000 positive malaria tests collected over ∼4.5 million km2), satellite imagery, permutation tests, and hierarchical Bayesian regressions, we show that greater forest cover (as a proxy for proximity to forest fringes) tends to be associated with higher malaria incidence, and that forest cover effect was 25 times greater than the land clearing effect, the often cited culprit of malaria in the region. These findings have important implications for land use/land cover (LULC) policies in the region. We find that cities close to protected areas (PA’s) tend to have higher malaria incidence than cities far from PA’s. Using future LULC scenarios, we show that avoiding 10% of deforestation through better governance might result in an average 2-fold increase in malaria incidence by 2050 in urban health posts. Conclusions Our results suggest that cost analysis of reduced carbon emissions from conservation efforts in the region should account for increased malaria morbidity, and that conservation initiatives should consider adopting malaria mitigation strategies. Coordinated actions from disparate science fields, government ministries, and global initiatives (e.g., Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation; Millenium Development Goals; Roll Back Malaria; and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), will be required to decrease malaria toll in the region while preserving these important ecosystems."

We devise, develop and implement a new cognitive intervention for achieving generalized tolerance based on scientific studies of social categorization. In five laboratory experiments and one field study the intervention led to a reduction of prejudice towards multiple outgroups (elderly, disabled, asylum seekers, HIV patients, gay men), and fostered generalized tolerance and egalitarian beliefs. Importantly, these effects persisted outside the laboratory in a context marked by a history of violent ethnic conflict, increasing trust and reconciliatory tendencies towards multiple ethnic groups in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We discuss the implications of these findings for intervention strategies focused on reducing conflict and promoting peaceful intergroup relations."
https://openalex.org/W2148847769,"Strandings of marine megafauna can provide valuable information on cause of death at sea. However, as stranding probabilities are usually very low and highly variable in space and time, interpreting the results can be challenging. We evaluated the magnitude and distribution of at-sea mortality of marine turtles along the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, México during 2010–11, using a combination of counting stranded animals and drifter experiments. A total of 594 carcasses were found during the study period, with loggerhead (62%) and green turtles (31%) being the most common species. 87% of the strandings occurred in the southern Gulf of Ulloa, a known hotspot of loggerhead distribution in the Eastern Pacific. While only 1.8% of the deaths could be definitively attributed to bycatch (net marks, hooks), seasonal variation in stranding frequencies closely corresponded to the main fishing seasons. Estimated stranding probabilities from drifter experiments varied among sites and trials (0.05–0.8), implying that only a fraction of dead sea turtles can be observed at beaches. Total mortality estimates for 15-day periods around the floater trials were highest for PSL, a beach in the southern Gulf of Ulloa, ranging between 11 sea turtles in October 2011 to 107 in August 2010. Loggerhead turtles were the most numerous, followed by green and olive ridley turtles. Our study showed that drifter trials combined with beach monitoring can provide estimates for death at sea to measure the impact of small-scale fisheries that are notoriously difficult to monitor for by-catch. We also provided recommendations to improve the precision of the mortality estimates for future studies and highlight the importance of estimating impacts of small–scale fisheries on marine megafauna."
https://openalex.org/W2035711030,"The thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) is the primary mediator of salt reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and is a key determinant of the blood pressure set point. Given its complex topology, NCC is inefficiently processed and prone to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), although the mechanisms governing this process remain obscure. Here, we identify factors that impact the ER quality control of NCC. Analyses of NCC immunoprecipitates revealed that the cotransporter formed complexes with the core chaperones Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40. Disruption of Hsp90 function accelerated NCC degradation, suggesting that Hsp90 promotes NCC folding. In addition, two cochaperones, the C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) and the Hsp70/Hsp90 organizer protein, were associated with NCC. Although CHIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoted NCC ubiquitination and ERAD, the Hsp70/Hsp90 organizer protein stabilized NCC turnover, indicating that these two proteins differentially remodel the core chaperone systems to favor cotransporter degradation and biogenesis, respectively. Adjusting the folding environment in mammalian cells via reduced temperature enhanced NCC biosynthetic trafficking, increased Hsp90-NCC interaction, and diminished binding to Hsp70. In contrast, cotransporters harboring disease-causing mutations that impair NCC biogenesis failed to escape ERAD as efficiently as the wild type protein when cells were incubated at a lower temperature. Instead, these mutants interacted more strongly with Hsp70, Hsp40, and CHIP, consistent with a role for the Hsp70/Hsp40 system in selecting misfolded NCC for ERAD. Collectively, these observations indicate that Hsp70 and Hsp90 comprise two functionally distinct ER quality control checkpoints that sequentially monitor NCC biogenesis."

However, the conventional Caco-2 monolayer model has several drawbacks including labor-intensive culture process, unphysiological growth conditions, lack of reproducibility and limited throughput. Here, we report on the use of 3-day Caco-2 monolayers for assessing permeability of polypeptide drugs.The 3-day monolayers were grown in a commercially available transwell set-up, which facilitates rapid development of the Caco-2 monolayers in an intestinal epithelial differentiation mimicking environment. This set-up included use of serum-free medium of defined composition with supplements such as butyric acid, hormones, growth factors, and other metabolites, reported to regulate the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. We measured permeability of 3 different therapeutic polypeptides; insulin, calcitonin, and exenatide across the monolayer.Preliminary validation of the monolayer was carried out by confirming dose-dependent permeation of FITC-insulin and sulforhodamine-B. Transport of insulin, calcitonin, and exenatide measured at different loading concentrations suggests that the permeability values obtained with 3-day cultures resemble more closely the values obtained with ex vivo models compared to permeability values obtained with conventional 21-day cultures.Short-term 3-day Caco-2 monolayers provide new opportunities for developing reproducible and high-throughput models for screening of therapeutic macromolecules for oral absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2047146830,"The recruitment to plasma membrane invaginations of the protein endophilin is a temporally regulated step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endophilin is believed to sense or stabilize membrane curvature, which in turn likely depends on the dimeric structure of the protein. The dynamic nature of the membrane association and dimerization of endophilin is thus functionally important and is illuminated herein. Using subunit exchange Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we determine dimer dissociation kinetics and find a dimerization equilibrium constant orders of magnitude lower than previously published values. We characterize N-BAR domain membrane association kinetics under conditions where the dimeric species predominates, by stopped flow, observing prominent electrostatic sensitivity of membrane interaction kinetics. Relative to membrane binding, we find that protein monomer/dimer species equilibrate with far slower kinetics. Complementary optical microscopy studies reveal strikingly slow membrane dissociation and an increase of dissociation rate constant for a construct lacking the amphipathic segment helix 0 (H0). We attribute the slow dissociation kinetics to higher-order protein oligomerization on the membrane. We incorporate our findings into a kinetic scheme for endophilin N-BAR membrane binding and find a significant separation of time scales for endophilin membrane binding and subsequent oligomerization. This separation may facilitate the regulation of membrane trafficking phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2113922874,"Background Chronic blood shortages in the U.S. would be alleviated by small increases, in percentage terms, of people donating blood. The current research investigated the effects of subtle changes in charity-seeking messages on the likelihood of people responses to a call for help. We predicted that “avoid losses” messages would lead to more helping behavior than “promote gains” messages would. Method Two studies investigated the effects of message framing on helping intentions and behaviors. With the help and collaboration of the Red Cross, Study 1, a field experiment, directly assessed the effectiveness of a call for blood donations that was presented as either death-preventing (losses) or life-saving (gains), and as being of either more or less urgent need. With the help and collaboration of a local charity, Study 2, a lab experiment, assessed the effects of the gain-versus-loss framing of a donation-soliciting flyer on individuals’ expectations of others’ monetary donations as well their own volunteering behavior. Study 2 also assessed the effects of three emotional motivators - feelings of empathy, positive affect, and relational closeness. Result Study 1 indicated that, on a college campus, describing blood donations as a way to “prevent a death” rather than “save a life” boosted the donation rate. Study 2 showed that framing a charity’s appeals as helping people to avoid a loss led to larger expected donations, increased intentions to volunteer, and more helping behavior, independent of other emotional motivators. Conclusion This research identifies and demonstrates a reliable and effective method for increasing important helping behaviors by providing charities with concrete ideas that can effectively increase helping behavior generally and potentially death-preventing behavior in particular."

This paper reports on our new F2 Dock protocol which improves the state of the art in initial stage rigid body exhaustive docking search, scoring and ranking by introducing improvements in the shape-complementarity and electrostatics affinity functions, a new knowledge-based interface propensity term with FFT formulation, a set of novel knowledge-based filters and finally a solvation energy (GBSA) based reranking technique. Our algorithms are based on highly efficient data structures including the dynamic packing grids and octrees which significantly speed up the computations and also provide guaranteed bounds on approximation error. Results The improved affinity functions show superior performance compared to their traditional counterparts in finding correct docking poses at higher ranks. We found that the new filters and the GBSA based reranking individually and in combination significantly improve the accuracy of docking predictions with only minor increase in computation time. We compared F2 Dock 2.0 with ZDock 3.0.2 and found improvements over it, specifically among 176 complexes in ZLab Benchmark 4.0, F2 Dock 2.0 finds a near-native solution as the top prediction for 22 complexes; where ZDock 3.0.2 does so for 13 complexes. F2 Dock 2.0 finds a near-native solution within the top 1000 predictions for 106 complexes as opposed to 104 complexes for ZDock 3.0.2. However, there are 17 and 15 complexes where F2 Dock 2.0 finds a solution but ZDock 3.0.2 does not and vice versa; which indicates that the two docking protocols can also complement each other. Availability The docking protocol has been implemented as a server with a graphical client (TexMol) which allows the user to manage multiple docking jobs, and visualize the docked poses and interfaces.

https://openalex.org/W2112456014,"Objective Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable condition. First-degree relatives of affected individuals have a more than a ten-fold increased risk of developing bipolar disorder (BD), and a three-fold risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) than the general population. It is unclear however whether differences in brain activation reported in BD and MDD are present before the onset of illness. Methods We studied 98 young unaffected individuals at high familial risk of BD and 58 healthy controls using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans and a task involving executive and language processing. Twenty of the high-risk subjects subsequently developed MDD after the baseline fMRI scan. Results At baseline the high-risk subjects who later developed MDD demonstrated relatively increased activation in the insula cortex, compared to controls and high risk subjects who remained well. In the healthy controls and high-risk group who remained well, this region demonstrated reduced engagement with increasing task difficulty. The high risk subjects who subsequently developed MDD did not demonstrate this normal disengagement. Activation in this region correlated positively with measures of cyclothymia and neuroticism at baseline, but not with measures of depression. Conclusions These results suggest that increased activation of the insula can differentiate individuals at high-risk of bipolar disorder who later develop MDD from healthy controls and those at familial risk who remain well. These findings offer the potential of future risk stratification in individuals at risk of mood disorder for familial reasons."

Because relatively little is known about SR-BI posttranslational regulation in steroidogenic cells, we examined the roles of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors (NHERFs) in regulating SR-BI expression, SR-BI-mediated selective CE uptake, and steroidogenesis. NHERF1 and NHERF2 mRNA and protein are expressed at varying levels in model steroidogenic cell lines and the adrenal, with only low expression of PDZK1 (NHERF3) and NHERF4. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP decreased NHERF1 and NHERF2 and increased SR-BI mRNA expression in primary rat granulosa cells and MLTC-1 cells, whereas ACTH had no effect on NHERF1 and NHERF2 mRNA levels but decreased their protein levels in rat adrenals. Co-immunoprecipitation, colocalization, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and mutational analysis indicated that SR-BI associates with NHERF1 and NHERF2. NHERF1 and NHERF2 down-regulated SR-BI protein expression through inhibition of its de novo synthesis. NHERF1 and NHERF2 also inhibited SR-BI-mediated selective CE transport and steroidogenesis, which were markedly attenuated by partial deletions of the PDZ1 or PDZ2 domain of NHERF1, the PDZ2 domain of NHERF2, or the MERM domains of NHERF1/2 or by gene silencing of NHERF1/2. Moreover, an intact COOH-terminal PDZ recognition motif (EAKL) in SR-BI is needed. Transient transfection of hepatic cell lines with NHERF1 or NHERF2 caused a significant reduction in endogenous protein levels of SR-BI. Collectively, these data establish NHERF1 and NHERF2 as SR-BI protein binding partners that play a negative role in the regulation of SR-BI expression, selective CE transport, and steroidogenesis.

Although in recent years extensive studies have been carried out to delineate the critical events connected with SR-BI-mediated selective delivery of HDL-CE, at present, very little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of SR-BI expression and its function. However, evidence is now emerging to suggest that hepatic expression of SR-BI can be regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (32Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K.

https://openalex.org/W2016824907,"We present a novel study on label-free recognition and distinction of drug resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7 DOX) from their parental cells (MCF-7 WT) via impedimetric measurements. Drug resistant cells exhibited significant differences in their dielectric properties compared to wild-type cells, exerting much higher extracellular resistance (Rextra). Immunostaining revealed that MCF-7 DOX cells gained a much denser F-actin network upon acquiring drug resistance indicating that remodeling of actin cytoskeleton is probably the reason behind higher Rextra, providing stronger cell architecture. Moreover, having exposed both cell types to doxorubicin, we were able to distinguish these two phenotypes based on their substantially different drug response. Interestingly, impedimetric measurements identified a concentration-dependent and reversible increase in cell stiffness in the presence of low non-lethal drug doses. Combined with a profound frequency analysis, these findings enabled distinguishing distinct cellular responses during drug exposure within four concentration ranges without using any labeling. Overall, this study highlights the possibility to differentiate drug resistant phenotypes from their parental cells and to assess their drug response by using microelectrodes, offering direct, real-time and noninvasive measurements of cell dependent parameters under drug exposure, hence providing a promising step for personalized medicine applications such as evaluation of the disease progress and optimization of the drug treatment of a patient during chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036051665,"Recently discovered Sushi domain-containing protein 4 (SUSD4) contains several Sushi or complement control protein domains; therefore, we hypothesized that it may act as complement inhibitor. Two isoforms of human SUSD4, fused to the Fc part of human IgG, were recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The secreted soluble isoform of SUSD4 (SUSD4b) inhibited the classical and lectin complement pathways by 50% at a concentration of 0.5 μM. This effect was due to the fact that 1 μM SUSD4b inhibited the formation of the classical C3 convertase by 90%. The membrane-bound isoform (SUSD4a) inhibited the classical and alternative complement pathways when expressed on the surface of CHO cells but not when expressed as a soluble, truncated protein. In all functional studies, we used known complement inhibitors as positive controls, while Coxsackie adenovirus receptor, which has no effect on complement, expressed with Fc tag, was a negative control. We also studied the mRNA expression of both isoforms of SUSD4 in a panel of human tissues using quantitative PCR and primarily found SUSD4a in esophagus and brain, while SUSD4b was highly expressed in esophagus, ovary, and heart. Overall, our results show that SUSD4 is a novel complement inhibitor with restricted expression."
https://openalex.org/W1995952892,"The host response to calcium silicate ceramic coatings is not always favorable because of their high dissolution rates, leading to high pH within the surrounding physiological environment. Recently, a zinc-incorporated calcium silicate-based ceramic Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating, developed on a Ti-6Al-4V substrate using plasma-spray technology, was found to exhibit improved chemical stability and biocompatibility. This study aimed to investigate and compare the in vitro response of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating, CaSiO3 coating, and uncoated Ti-6Al-4V titanium control at cellular and molecular level. Our results showed Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating enhanced MC3T3-E1 cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation compared to CaSiO3 coating and control. In addition, Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating increased mRNA levels of osteoblast-related genes (alkaline phosphatase, procollagen α1(I), osteocalcin), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). The in vivo osteoconductive properties of Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating, compared to CaSiO3 coating and control, was investigated using a rabbit femur defect model. Histological and histomorphometrical analysis demonstrated new bone formation in direct contact with the Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating surface in absence of fibrous tissue and higher bone-implant contact rate (BIC) in the Ca2ZnSi2O7 coating group, indicating better biocompatibility and faster osseointegration than CaSiO3 coated and control implants. These results indicate Ca2ZnSi2O7 coated implants have applications in bone tissue regeneration, since they are biocompatible and able to osseointegrate with host bone."

https://openalex.org/W2045715580,"Aponogeton madagascariensis produces perforations over its leaf surface via programmed cell death (PCD). PCD begins between longitudinal and transverse veins at the center of spaces regarded as areoles, and continues outward, stopping several cells from these veins. The gradient of PCD that exists within a single areole of leaves in an early stage of development was used as a model to investigate cellular dynamics during PCD. Mitochondria have interactions with a family of proteases known as caspases, and the actin cytoskeleton during metazoan PCD; less is known regarding these interactions during plant PCD. This study employed the actin stain Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin, the actin depolymerizer Latrunculin B (Lat B), a synthetic caspase peptide substrate and corresponding specific inhibitors, as well as the mitochondrial pore inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) to analyze the role of these cellular constituents during PCD. Results depicted that YVADase (caspase-1) activity is higher during the very early stages of perforation formation, followed by the bundling and subsequent breakdown of actin. Actin depolymerization using Lat B caused no change in YVADase activity. In vivo inhibition of YVADase activity prevented PCD and actin breakdown, therefore substantiating actin as a likely substrate for caspase-like proteases (CLPs). The mitochondrial pore inhibitor CsA significantly decreased YVADase activity, and prevented both PCD and actin breakdown; therefore suggesting the mitochondria as a possible trigger for CLPs during PCD in the lace plant. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study using either caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CMK) or CsA, following which the actin cytoskeleton was examined. Overall, our findings suggest the mitochondria as a possible upstream activator of YVADase activity and implicate these proteases as potential initiators of actin breakdown during perforation formation via PCD in the lace plant."
https://openalex.org/W1978626648,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Current treatment is rarely curative, thus novel meaningful therapies are urgently needed. Inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling at the cell membrane level in several cancers has shown anti-cancer activity in recent clinical studies. Evidence of Hh-independent Gli activation suggests Gli as a more potent therapeutic target. The current study is aimed to evaluate the potential of Gli as a therapeutic target to treat MPM. The expression profiles of Gli factors and other Hh signaling components were characterized in 46 MPM patient tissue samples by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cultured cell lines were employed to investigate the requirement of Gli activation in tumor cell growth by inhibiting Gli through siRNA or a novel small molecule Gli inhibitor (Gli-I). A xenograft model was used to evaluate Gli-I in vivo. In addition, a side by side comparison between Gli and Smoothened (Smo) inhibition was conducted in vitro using siRNA and small molecule inhibitors. Our study reported aberrant Gli1 and Gli2 activation in a large majority of tissues. Inhibition of Gli by siRNAs or Gli-I suppressed cell growth dramatically both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Gli exhibited better cytotoxicity than that of Smo by siRNA and small molecule inhibitors vismodegib and cyclopamine. Combination of Gli-I and pemetrexed, as well as Gli-I and vismodegib demonstrated synergistic effects in suppression of MPM proliferation in vitro. In summary, Gli activation plays a critical role in MPM. Inhibition of Gli function holds strong potential to become a novel, clinically effective approach to treat MPM."

Here, we report the development of an optimized targeted drug delivery system to inhibit advanced stage pancreatic tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model. Method/Principal Findings Targeting specificity in vitro was confirmed by preincubation of the pancreatic cancer cells with C225 as well as Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR - nucleoside transporter (NT) inhibitor). Upon nanoconjugation functional activity of gemcitabine was retained as tested using a thymidine incorporation assay. Significant stability of the nanoconjugates was maintained, with only 12% release of gemcitabine over a 24-hour period in mouse plasma. Finally, an in vivo study demonstrated the inhibition of tumor growth through targeted delivery of a low dose of gemcitabine in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, mimicking an advanced stage of the disease. Conclusion We demonstrated in this study that the gold nanoparticle-based therapeutic containing gemcitabine inhibited tumor growth in an advanced stage of the disease in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. Future work would focus on understanding the pharmacokinetics and combining active targeting with passive targeting to further improve the therapeutic efficacy and increase survival."
https://openalex.org/W2143879399,"To better define the structure and origin of the Bulgarian paternal gene pool, we have examined the Y-chromosome variation in 808 Bulgarian males. The analysis was performed by high-resolution genotyping of biallelic markers and by analyzing the STR variation within the most informative haplogroups. We found that the Y-chromosome gene pool in modern Bulgarians is primarily represented by Western Eurasian haplogroups with ∼ 40% belonging to haplogroups E-V13 and I-M423, and 20% to R-M17. Haplogroups common in the Middle East (J and G) and in South Western Asia (R-L23*) occur at frequencies of 19% and 5%, respectively. Haplogroups C, N and Q, distinctive for Altaic and Central Asian Turkic-speaking populations, occur at the negligible frequency of only 1.5%. Principal Component analyses group Bulgarians with European populations, apart from Central Asian Turkic-speaking groups and South Western Asia populations. Within the country, the genetic variation is structured in Western, Central and Eastern Bulgaria indicating that the Balkan Mountains have been permeable to human movements. The lineage analysis provided the following interesting results: (i) R-L23* is present in Eastern Bulgaria since the post glacial period; (ii) haplogroup E-V13 has a Mesolithic age in Bulgaria from where it expanded after the arrival of farming; (iii) haplogroup J-M241 probably reflects the Neolithic westward expansion of farmers from the earliest sites along the Black Sea. On the whole, in light of the most recent historical studies, which indicate a substantial proto-Bulgarian input to the contemporary Bulgarian people, our data suggest that a common paternal ancestry between the proto-Bulgarians and the Altaic and Central Asian Turkic-speaking populations either did not exist or was negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2044147270,"The NIMA family protein kinases Nek9/Nercc1, Nek6, and Nek7 constitute a signaling module activated in early mitosis involved in the control of spindle organization. DYNLL/LC8 (dynein light chain 8) was originally described as a component of the dynein complex, but the recent discovery of multiple interaction partners for LC8 has suggested that it has a general role as a dimerization hub that organizes different protein partners. Recent experiments suggested that LC8 binding to Nek9 was regulated by Nek9 autophosphorylation on Ser944, a residue immediately located N-terminal to the LC8 conserved (K/R)xTQT binding motif, and that this was crucial for the control of signal transduction through the Nek/Nek6/7 module. In the present work, we present two crystal structures of LC8 with a peptide corresponding to the Nek9 binding region with and without a phosphorylation on Ser944. Structural analysis of LC8 with both Nek9 peptides, together with different biophysical experiments, explains the observed diminished binding affinity of Nek9 to LC8 upon phosphorylation on Ser944 within the Nek9 sequence, thus shedding light into a novel phosphorylation regulatory mechanism that interferes with LC8 protein·protein complex formation.

Nek9 (also known as Nercc1) belongs to the mammalian NIMA family of protein kinases, named after the Aspergillus nidulans NIMA kinase (1Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Nercc1, a mammalian NIMA-family kinase, binds the Ran GTPase and regulates mitotic progression.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mammals contain 11 members of the NIMA family or Neks, some of which are modular proteins with different protein domains, whereas some others only contain the kinase domain that has a sequence identity of ∼40% for all members of the family (2O'Connell M.J.

Mitotic regulation by NIMA-related kinases.Cell Div. 2007; 2: 25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nek9 (also called Nercc1) is a 120-kDa modular protein composed of an N-terminal kinase domain, with a strong sequence identity to the other members of the Nek family, followed by a domain homologous to RCC1 (the exchange factor for the small G protein Ran) and a C-terminal domain that contains a coiled-coil motif involved in dimerization (1Roig J.

Although DYNLL/LC8 was initially proposed to be a cargo adapter for the molecular motor dynein and myosin V, the existence of multiple protein partners revealed LC8 as a regulatory hub protein that interacts with a linear consensus binding motif normally located in intrinsically disordered protein regions (21Barbar E. Dynein light chain LC8 is a dimerization hub essential in diverse protein networks.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, it has been recently shown that phosphorylation of Ser88 in LC8, which promotes the disruption of the LC8 homodimer, can regulate the binding of protein partners such as dynein intermediate chain (27Makokha M.

Two different protein sequence motifs in target proteins can be recognized by LC8: (K/R)XTQT and G(I/V)QVD (where X is any amino acid) (32Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M.

In addition to these short sequences, the binding region of the peptide can be extended at the N terminus, thus completing a total of nine residues forming the extra β-strand of the interface. Only a few LC8 partners contain non-canonical binding motifs lacking the most conserved Gln residue (25Lightcap C.M. Sun S. Lear J.D. Rodeck U. Polenova T. Williams J.C. Biochemical and structural characterization of the Pak1-LC8 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27314-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of LC8 to monomeric peptides is moderately weak (Kd between 0.1 and 40 μm) (13Rapali P. Szenes Á. Radnai L. Bakos A. Pál G. Nyitray L. DYNLL/LC8: a light chain subunit of the dynein motor complex and beyond.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 2980-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, bivalent peptides linking two consensus motifs have been shown to increase significantly the binding affinity for LC8 (34Radnai L.

Chem. 2010; 285: 38649-38657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of the dimer-dimer interaction in the complex of LC8 with protein partners. Despite the strong conservation in the LC8 binding region, recent biophysical data indicates an inherent plasticity that allows the interaction with these different consensus motifs (24Benison G. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. The interplay of ligand binding and quaternary structure in the diverse interactions of dynein light chain LC8.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). LC8 has been proposed to participate in the regulation of the Nek9/Nek6/Nek7 kinase signaling module as a negative regulator of Nek6/7 binding and activation (12Regué L. Sdelci S. Bertran M.T. Caelles C. Reverter D. Roig J. DYNLL/LC8 protein controls signal transduction through the Nek9/Nek6 signaling module by regulating Nek6 binding to Nek9.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18118-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). LC8 binding to the C-terminal region of Nek9 interferes with the interaction of Nek9 with Nek6 and Nek7, thus impeding Nek9 activation of Nek6/7. In vivo experiments suggest that autophosphorylation of Nek9 can regulate this process by regulating the binding of Nek9 to LC8. Ser944, which is immediately located N-terminal to the LC8 consensus motif, has been proposed to be phosphorylated upon Nek9 activation and directly promote the LC8 dissociation from Nek9 in vivo, although such direct effect of Ser944 phosphorylation on LC8 binding has never been measured. The conservation in this position of a serine residue and the presence of other Ser/Thr residues in LC8 consensus motifs of many protein partners might indicate that phosphorylation could represent a general manner of regulation for the LC8 binding. To gain insights in this regulation, we have crystallized LC8 in complex with a Nek9 peptide corresponding to the LC8 binding region and with a similar phosphopeptide modified on the equivalent of Nek9(Ser944). Comparison of both crystal structures sheds light into the diminished LC8 binding of Nek9 upon phosphorylation on Ser944. Additionally, in vitro LC8 binding experiments using different biophysical methods demonstrate that phosphorylation on Ser944 reduces the affinity to form a complex with LC8, thus directly confirming that phosphorylation of the partner could be a general way to regulate interactions with LC8. The cDNAs encoding full-length LC8 and the Nek9-CC 5The abbreviations used are: CCcoiled coilSASAsolvent-accessible surface area. constructs (Nek9, residues 893 to 974) were cloned into a pET28b vector with the fusion protein Smt3 tagged with six histidines at the N-terminal. Constructions were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for 4 h at 37 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and recombinant proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of SENP2 SUMO protease overnight at 4 °C. After protease cleavage, LC8 and Nek9-CC were purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Resource Q (GE Healthcare) column and by gel filtration using a Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare). coiled coil solvent-accessible surface area. Single point mutants of NEK9-CC, including Q948A and S944E, were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sequences were sequenced after generation. Nek9-CC mutants were produced and purified as the wild-type form. The Nek9 peptide contains the amino acids between the Nek9 positions 940 to 950 resulting in the sequence VGMHSKGTQTA. In case of the Nek9 P-peptide, with a phosphate group on Ser944, the resulting phosphopeptide contains the sequence VGMH(pS)KGTQTA. Both peptides were provided by the company Pepnome Limited. CD spectra were measured in a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter thermostatted at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded from 260 to 200 nm at 0.5-nm intervals, 1-nm bandwidth, and scan speed of 10 nm/min. Ten accumulations were done for each spectrum. LC8 concentration for each scan is 11.2 μm buffered with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In each spectrum, we vary the Nek9 peptide or the Nek9 P-peptide concentration ranged between 0 and 26.6 μm. In the case of LC8 binding to Nek9-CC (Nek9 residues from 893 to 974) wild-type and point mutants, LC8 and Nek9-CC concentrations were 10 μm and 6.66 μm, respectively, buffered as mentioned above. Same concentrations were used for the spectra of the LC8·Nek9-CC complexes. Data were normalized to [θ] (molar ellipticity) using the formula shown in Equation 1, [θ]=θ110•M•Ne•I(Eq. 1) where [θ] means molar ellipticity, θ indicates measured ellipticity, M represents molarity of the sample, Ne indicates the number of peptide bonds, and l indicates the cuvette path length in cm. To determine the interaction constants between LC8 and the peptides, we measured the ellipticity at 220 nm in every spectrum. Because the interaction of LC8 with the peptides is characterized by moderate-to-high affinity and the concentrations are comparable with the expected dissociation constant, no approximation for the free ligand concentration can be made. The total concentration of ligand is expressed as follows: [PL]=[P]TKA[L]1+Ka[L](Eq. 2) where [L]T and [P]T are the total concentration of the peptide and LC8, respectively, Ka is the association constant, and [L] is the concentration of the free ligand. Solving this equation for the unknown [L] will allow calculating the concentration of the LC8·peptide complex, [PL], for each experimental point, [PL]=[P]TKa[L]1+Ka[L](Eq. 3) from which the change in circular dichroism signal can be calculated in Equation 4, Y=A0+A[PL](Eq. 4) where A0 is the circular dichroism signal at zero peptide concentration, and A accounts for the maximal change of the signal at high peptide concentration. Thermal transition curves of LC8 and LC8·Nek9-peptide complexes were obtained in a spectrofluorometer (Cary Eclipse) at a heating rate of 0.2 °C/min following changes of intrinsic fluorescence at 338 nm while excited at 280 nm. The LC8 concentration was 11.2 μm in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To obtain the thermal denaturation curves for the LC8 in the presence of the two peptides, the experiments were performed in the presence of 11.2 μm concentration of the Nek9 peptide and P-peptide. The thermal transition curves were fitted to obtain the unfolding thermodynamic parameters using Equation 5, Y=(bj+mjT)+(bu+muT)e((-ΔHm(1-T/Tm))/RT)1+e((-ΔHm(1-T/Tm))/RT)(Eq. 5) where mj and bj are the slope and the intercept with y axis in the pretransition region, mu and bu are the slope and the intercept with y axis in the post-transition region, ΔHm is the unfolding enthalpy, T is the absolute temperature, Tm is the temperature at the melting point, and R is the universal gas constant. Binding interaction between LC8 and both peptides was assessed by high-sensitivity isothermal titration microcalorimeter AutoITC200 (MicroCal, GE Healthcare). Protein and peptide samples were properly degassed and carefully loaded into the cells to avoid bubble formation during stirring. Experiments were performed in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, or Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Experiments were carried out titrating 20 μm LC8 in the calorimetric cell with 200–300 μm peptide in the injection syringe. The heat evolved after each ligand injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat due to the binding reaction was obtained as the difference between the reaction heat and the corresponding heat of dilution, and the latter was estimated as a constant heat throughout the experiment and included as an adjustable parameter in the analysis. The association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy change (ΔH) were obtained through non-linear regression of experimental data to a model for a protein with a single binding site. Data were analyzed using software developed in our laboratory implemented in Origin (version 7, OriginLab). The dissociation constant (Kd), the free energy change (ΔG), and the entropic change (ΔS) were obtained from basic thermodynamic relationships. Experiments performed in two buffers with different ionization enthalpies (0.86 kcal/mol phosphate, 11.4 kcal/mol Tris) allowed eliminating the contribution of proton exchange processes to the binding interaction and determining buffer-independent thermodynamic interaction parameters (enthalpy and entropy) (35Gómez J.

Experiments performed at two temperatures, at 15 and 25 °C, allowed estimating the change in heat capacity upon binding, which is a binding parameter associated with changes in solvent accessible (polar and non-polar) surface area and, therefore, provides fundamental information on the binding interaction and possible conformational changes coupled to the complex formation. Crystals of DYNLL/LC8 (dynein light chain 1) in complex with Nek9 peptide were obtained at 18 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion methods. The reservoir solution contained 35% PEG 1500, 0.1 m MIB buffer (malonate, imidazole, and boric acid 2:3:3), pH 4.

https://openalex.org/W2052393549,"Tumstatin is an anti-angiogenic collagen IV α3 fragment, levels of which are reduced in the airways of asthmatics. Its reduction may be due to the degradation by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteases. Cathepsins play a role in ECM remodelling, with cathepsin D, H and K (CTSD, CTSH and CTSK) being associated with lung diseases. CTSD modulates the NC1 domains of collagen molecules including tumstatin, while CTSH and CTSK are involved in ECM degradation. The role of these cathepsins in the regulation of tumstatin in the lung has not previously been examined. We demonstrated that CTSB, D, F, H, K, L and S mRNA was expressed in the airways. Quantification of immunohistochemistry showed that there is no difference in the global expression of CTSD, CTSH and CTSK between asthmatics and non-asthmatics. CTSD and CTSK, but not CTSH had the capacity to degrade tumstatin. No difference was observed in the activity of CTSD and H in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic and non-asthmatics, while CTSK was undetectable. This indicates that while CTSD possesses the potential to directly regulate tumstatin, and thus angiogenesis through this mechanism however, it is not likely to be involved in the dysregulation of tumstatin found in asthmatic airways."
https://openalex.org/W1968229932,"Given limited resources for motility, sperm cell activation must be precisely timed to ensure the greatest likelihood of fertilization. Like those of most species, the sperm of C. elegans become active only after encountering an external signaling molecule. Activation coincides with spermiogenesis, the final step in spermatogenesis, when the spherical spermatid undergoes wholesale reorganization to produce a pseudopod. Here, we describe a gene involved in sperm activation, spe-46. This gene was identified in a suppressor screen of spe-27(it132ts), a sperm-expressed gene whose product functions in the transduction of the spermatid activation signal. While spe-27(it132ts) worms are sterile at 25°C, the spe-46(hc197)I; spe-27(it132ts)IV double mutants regain partial fertility. Single nucleotide polymorphism mapping, whole genome sequencing, and transformation rescue were employed to identify the spe-46 coding sequence. It encodes a protein with seven predicted transmembrane domains but with no other predicted functional domains or homology outside of nematodes. Expression is limited to spermatogenic tissue, and a transcriptional GFP fusion shows expression corresponds with the onset of the pachytene stage of meiosis. The spe-46(hc197) mutation bypasses the need for the activation signal; mutant sperm activate prematurely without an activation signal in males, and mutant males are sterile. In an otherwise wild-type genome, the spe-46(hc197) mutation induces a sperm defective phenotype. In addition to premature activation, spe-46(hc197) sperm exhibit numerous defects including aneuploidy, vacuolization, protruding spikes, and precocious fusion of membranous organelles. Hemizygous worms [spe-46(hc197)/mnDf111] are effectively sterile. Thus, spe-46 appears to be involved in the regulation of spermatid activation during spermiogenesis, with the null phenotype being an absence of functional sperm and hypomorphic phenotypes being premature spermatid activation and numerous sperm cell defects."
https://openalex.org/W1988467936,"Sustained activation of NF-κB is one of the causative factors for various liver diseases, including liver inflammation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been known that activating the NF-κB signal by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is implicated in the development of HCC. However, despite numerous studies on HBx-induced NF-κB activation, the detailed mechanisms still remain unsolved. Recently, p22-FLIP, a cleavage product of c-FLIPL, has been reported to induce NF-κB activation through interaction with the IκB kinase (IKK) complex in primary immune cells. Since our previous report on the interaction of HBx with c-FLIPL, we explored whether p22-FLIP is involved in the modulation of HBx function. First, we identified the expression of endogenous p22-FLIP in liver cells. NF-κB reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the expression of p22-FLIP synergistically enhances HBx-induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, we found that HBx physically interacts with p22-FLIP and NEMO and potentially forms a ternary complex. Knock-down of c-FLIP leading to the downregulation of p22-FLIP showed that endogenous p22-FLIP is involved in HBx-induced NF-κB activation, and the formation of a ternary complex is necessary to activate NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, we showed a novel mechanism of HBx-induced NF-κB activation in which ternary complex formation is involved among HBx, p22-FLIP and NEMO. Our findings will extend the understanding of HBx-induced NF-κB activation and provide a new target for intervention in HBV-associated liver diseases and in the development of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2001901415,"Burn injury causes a major systemic catabolic response that is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. We investigated the effects of the mitochondria-targeted peptide antioxidant Szeto-Schiller 31 (SS-31) on skeletal muscle in a mouse burn model using in vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance ((31)P NMR) spectroscopy to noninvasively measure high-energy phosphate levels; mitochondrial aconitase activity measurements that directly correlate with TCA cycle flux, as measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS); and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to assess oxidative stress. At 6 h postburn, the oxidative ATP synthesis rate was increased 5-fold in burned mice given a single dose of SS-31 relative to untreated burned mice (P=0.002). Furthermore, SS-31 administration in burned animals decreased mitochondrial aconitase activity back to control levels. EPR revealed a recovery in redox status of the SS-31-treated burn group compared to the untreated burn group (P<0.05). Our multidisciplinary convergent results suggest that SS-31 promotes recovery of mitochondrial function after burn injury by increasing ATP synthesis rate, improving mitochondrial redox status, and restoring mitochondrial coupling. These findings suggest use of noninvasive in vivo NMR and complementary EPR offers an approach to monitor the effectiveness of mitochondrial protective agents in alleviating burn injury symptoms."

Cell type-specific regulation of the production, concentration, and relative abundance of individual lipid mediators in response to external stimuli serves as an integrated, self-referent, and self-limiting biochemical signaling network in higher organisms. This lipid-signaling network regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation and development and in adult organisms maintains physiological homeostasis in disparate organs such as the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, reproductive, nervous, and immune systems. In recent decades manifold PLA2 proteins with widely divergent selectivity for phospholipid substrate and diverse mechanisms by which their production and enzyme activity are regulated have been discovered in mammals. There are 22 human PLA2 enzymes that are divided into 15 subgroups defined by structural similarity, catalytic mechanism, calcium requirement, and whether they are secreted (4Murakami M. Taketomi Y.

Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 152-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This structural and functional diversity within a single enzyme class suggests that the activation and expression of PLA2 enzymes may be an important control point at which the responsiveness of lipid mediator biosynthesis pathways to external stimuli is regulated and highlights the need for a more detailed understanding of the function and expression of each enzyme. Aberrant control of eicosanoid signaling contributes to a wide range of human pathological states from headaches to certain cancers. In this context, PLA2 enzymes have been targeted in the hope that limiting substrate supply rather than selectively blocking the production of particular mediators may be of therapeutic benefit (4Murakami M.

The molecular basis for Group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) catalysis is well characterized (5Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry and physiology of mammalian secreted phospholipases A2.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and can be potently inhibited with substrate analogues or by covalent modification of active site residues. However, recent studies show that hGIIA is a bifunctional protein contributing to arachidonic acid metabolism in cells derived from pathological states by acting both as an enzyme capable of releasing arachidonic acid from microvesicles shed by activated cells and as a catalytic activity-independent indirect amplifier of intracellular eicosanoid production through up-regulation of the cytosolic PLA2-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway (9Bryant K.J. Bidgood M.J. Lei P.-W. Taberner M. Salom C. Kumar V. Lee L. Church W.B. Courtenay B. Smart B.P. Gelb M.H. Cahill M.A. Graham G.G. McNeil H.P. Scott K.F.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2492-2503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The bifunctional nature of hGIIA in regulating arachidonic acid metabolism raises important questions about the relative contribution of each function to the production of inflammatory mediators and the subsequent promotion of inflammation. Further the findings raise the possibility of selective pharmacological inhibition of each function as a means of investigating the importance of these roles. Neither the mechanism of hGIIA-mediated signaling nor the relative importance of the signaling function in the promotion of inflammation is known. Here we characterize a chemically diverse set of hGIIA inhibitors in each of two functionally selective assays. We show that there is no correlation between the potency of inhibitors in blocking hGIIA catalysis and their potency in blocking prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), which is a catalytic activity-independent function of hGIIA. Furthermore, we identified three classes of hGIIA inhibitors, those that are (i) selective for catalysis, (ii) non-selective, or (iii) selective for catalysis-independent activity, and determined the crystal structures of hGIIA bound to class (i) and (ii) inhibitors. In combination with the functional assays, these structures indicate that inhibitors of hGIIA signaling in rheumatoid FLS cells operate by perturbing a vimentin binding surface on hGIIA. Finally we demonstrate that the catalysis-independent function of exogenous hGIIA is associated with rapid internalization and colocalization with vimentin in FLSs that is dramatically disrupted by both dual-function and signaling-selective inhibitors but not by catalysis-selective inhibition. Thus, these inhibitors of hGIIA signaling belong to a rare class of small molecule inhibitors that act by modulating protein-protein interactions. The structures also suggest that the signaling and catalytic actions of hGIIA may be mutually exclusive, with transition between the two modes of action regulated by a conformational switch that is unique to the hGIIA subtype involving displacement of His-6. These results provide a solid foundation for the design of further functionally selective inhibitors that will be useful in assessing how the pathophysiology of sPLA2 segregates into its catalytic or non-catalytic actions in vivo and in turn the feasibility of developing efficacious sPLA2 inhibitors. hGIIA protein was expressed using the stably transfected hGIIA-expressing CHOK1 cell line 5A2 (10Bidgood M.J.

Cells (passage 3–10) were plated on 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner), grown to 85–95% confluence, and stimulated for 18 h in serum-free media (DMEM/Ham's F-12 with 0.1% BSA, 200 μl) with 10 ng/ml TNF (20 μl). hGIIA (20 μl, 4 μg/ml) with or without inhibitor was added simultaneously with TNF in inhibitor assays and with various inhibitor concentrations (0.3–10 μg/ml) in dose-response experiments as indicated. Inhibitors (dissolved in DMSO and diluted in serum-free media) were added (20 μl) where appropriate. Culture medium PGE2 was quantified by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical). Cells were detached with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, and triplicate wells were combined and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cold lysis solution (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EGTA in PBS with freshly added protease inhibitors 50 μg/ml aprotonin, 200 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. PGE2 was normalized for cell count and quantified by measuring total protein in lysates with a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Independent experiments were performed using cells derived from separate patients. Pure concentrated hGIIA (5–20 mg/ml) was buffer-exchanged into crystallization buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm β-octyl glucoside, and 2 m NaCl precipitate, with 5-kDa Ultrafree-MC Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Where appropriate, purified hGIIA (1 mg/ml) was chemically modified with p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) (Sigma) by coincubation at room temperature overnight with 1 mm BPB in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.7 mm EDTA. The hGIIA-BPB complex was then exchanged into crystallization buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm β-octyl glucoside, and 1 m NaCl, concentrated 10-fold, then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for use in activity assays or crystallization trials. Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using 24-well tissue-culture plates (Linbro, ICN Biomedicals). Drops were equilibrated with crystallization buffer with higher NaCl concentrations between 3 and 5 m. Coverslips were purchased pre-siliconized from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA). 2-μl drops were used in the presence of the inhibitor at approximately 2–5-fold molar excess over protein. Solutions and tissue-culture plates were all stored at crystal growth temperature (293 K) in a Sanyo MIR-2530 incubator (Sanyo Electric) unless otherwise stated. Macroseeding was performed in some instances by immersing nylon loops or human hair into drops containing crushed native crystals then streaking the hair across fresh drops containing enzyme with inhibitor. Crystals were mounted onto a nylon loop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without cryoprotectant and stored in liquid nitrogen for data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected (Δϕ = 0.5°) at a wavelength of 0.9002 Å with the crystals under a nitrogen stream at 100 K at beamline 14-BMC at the Advanced Photon Source in Chicago on a Area Detector Systems Corporation Quantam-315 charged coupled device detector.

Models were refined to convergence before waters were added, and inhibitors were not used in rounds of refinement until all identifiable waters were built. The stereochemistry of the structures was assessed using the Molprobity internet server (18Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. MOLPROBITY.

When indicated, FLSs (RA61 and RA57; passage 8–13) were treated with hGIIA (2.5 μg/ml) diluted in PBS, 0.1% BSA for 2 min on ice. Cells were then fixed for 2.5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked for 30 min in blocking solution (0.1% BSA and 10% donkey serum in PBS), and incubated with 4A1 (20Smith G.M.

After washing, cells were incubated again with 4 μg/ml anti-vimentin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20) in blocking solution for 1 h, washed, and incubated in the dark with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-goat secondary antibody for 30 min. Cells were then mounted in ProLong Gold antifade medium (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was collected using laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP upright). Images shown are single sections taken from z-stacks acquired using the manufacturer's software. ImageJ (NIH) was used to invert colors, generate merge pictures, and add scale bars. The figure were assembled, and levels were adjusted uniformly using PhotoShop CS4 (Adobe). We have previously shown that exogenous addition of hGIIA causes up-regulation of COX-2 expression in FLSs that, on costimulation with the cytokine TNF, causes an increase in PGE2 production (10Bidgood M.J. Jamal O.S. Cunningham A.M. Brooks P.M. Scott K.F.

Here we show that covalent modification of the active site His-48 residue with the irreversible inhibitor BPB (21Volwerk J.J. Pieterson W.A. de Haas G.H. Histidine at the active site of phospholipase A2.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1446-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) has no effect on dose-dependent stimulation of PGE2 production in rheumatoid FLS cells yet completely abrogates enzyme-dependent hydrolysis of diheptanoylthiophosphatidylcholine micelles (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, these data together with our similar observations with the activity impaired hGIIA mutant H48Q (9Bryant K.J. Bidgood M.J. Lei P.-W. Taberner M. Salom C. Kumar V. Lee L. Church W.B. Courtenay B.

Indeed, two cyclic peptide hGIIA inhibitors (22Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R. Lei P.-W. Bryant K.J. Scott K.F.

These peptides, cyclo-FLSYR (cF) and the analog cyclo-(2-Nal)-LS-(2-Nal)-R (c2) were derived from residues 70–74 of the primary sequence of hGIIA (22Church W.B. Inglis A.S. Tseng A. Duell R.

The ability to selectively inhibit the catalytic and non-catalytic actions of hGIIA establishes that these two functions may be pharmacologically separated and that inhibition of the signaling function of hGIIA does not depend on direct perturbation of the well characterized His-48—Asp-99 hGIIA catalytic site (5Lambeau G.

However, their relative potency in inhibition of catalytic activity (Me-Indoxam > LY311727 > KH064, spanning an 8-fold range in IC50) appears to be unrelated to their relative potency against cell signaling (KH064 > LY311727 ∼ Me-Indoxam, spanning a 2-fold range in IC50). The hGIIA used in these experiments was expressed in mammalian cells; however, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination would nicely explain why BPB-inactivated hGIIA and the H48Q mutant (9Bryant K.J.

Importantly, this LPS hypothesis is ruled out by the fact that both cyclic peptides as well as KH064, LY311727, and Me-Indoxam block hGIIA-dependent PGE2 production. As hGIIA signaling is likely mediated by protein-protein interactions rather than by catalysis, inhibitors of signaling probably belong to a relatively rare class of small-molecule inhibitors that operate by disrupting surface protein interactions. To understand how inhibition of hGIIA signaling is mediated and to identify the relevant binding surface and in turn the relevant interacting protein, we determined the crystal structure of the native enzyme in the presence of the active site calcium and in complex with BPB, KH064, and LY311727. Although the structure of the hGIIA without inhibitor bound has been known for well over two decades (26Wery J.P. Schevitz R.W. Clawson D.K. Bobbitt J.L. Dow E.R. Gamboa G. Goodson Jr., T.

Investigations in these animals revealed altered contractile gene content as well as reduced levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC) attributed to defective RhoA/Rho kinase signaling (7Arboleda-Velasquez J.F.

However, vascular dysfunction was not detected in most systemic arterial and resistance vasculature, suggesting a regional and complex influence through which impaired Notch3 signaling affected vascular smooth muscle myogenic responses. Importantly, smooth muscle Notch signaling was not abolished in these animal models due to expression of additional Notch receptors and pathway components. Force of contraction of VSM is determined by the opposing activities of MLCK and myosin phosphatase (MP), and MLCK is required for both physiological and pathological blood pressure (12He W.Q.

Functionally, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK activity phosphorylates MLC (p-MLC) and activates the myosin ATPase, causing contraction, whereas phosphate removal by MP inactivates myosin, causing relaxation (16Kamm K.E.

Given the unique vascular myogenic deficits associated with dysregulation of a single Notch receptor (Notch3), the current study was designed to more broadly examine vascular function and identify critical targets of Notch signaling by disrupting the canonical pathway in VSM. We hypothesized that Notch signals modulate the transcription of key regulatory contractile proteins and tested this by examining expression and function in a mouse model expressing a dominant-negative Mastermind-like (DNMAML1) protein to inhibit (CSL-dependent) Notch signaling targeted specifically to smooth muscle with the SM22α-Cre promoter (18Proweller A. Wright A.C. Horng D. Cheng L. Lu M.M. Lepore J.J. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells is required to pattern the cerebral vasculature.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16275-16280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This model suppresses canonical signaling through all Notch receptors, therefore overcoming potential functional redundancies and providing a more comprehensive assessment of Notch signaling contribution in VSM. Through this approach, we have identified a novel role for Notch signaling in the regulation of arterial contractile function through transcriptional control of smooth muscle MLCK. Animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved and monitored by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The generation and initial characterization of SM22-Cre+/DNMAML1+ (DNMAML1-expressing) mutant and SM22-Cre−/DNMAML1+ (non-DNMAML1-expressing) littermate control mice were reported previously, including the demonstrated suppression of induced Notch signaling activity in DNMAML-expressing aortic smooth muscle cells (18Proweller A. Wright A.C. Horng D. Cheng L. Lu M.M. Lepore J.J. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells is required to pattern the cerebral vasculature.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16275-16280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All mice, including the parental SM22-Cre+ and conditional DNMAML1 lines, were maintained on a C57Bl/6 genetic background. C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) myofibroblasts and A10 rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Transient plasmid transfections were performed using Xtremegene transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with a 3:1 Xtremegene/DNA ratio, and cells were collected after 48 h. Cultured primary aortic SMCs from control and mutant mice were isolated and propagated as described previously (18Proweller A. Wright A.C. Horng D. Cheng L. Lu M.M. Lepore J.J. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells is required to pattern the cerebral vasculature.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16275-16280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cultured aortic SMCs were depolarized with 60 mm KCl for up to 30 min. Adult mice (10–12 weeks old) were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Segments of thoracic aorta (TA), femoral artery (FA), and mesenteric artery (MA) were dissected, cut into 2–3-mm rings, and suspended in an isometric tension myograph (Model 610M, Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) chamber containing PSS buffer (112.0 mm NaCl, 25.7 mm NaHCO3, 4.9 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mm glucose, and 10.0 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) equilibrated with a gas mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (19Zhang H. Fisher S.A. Conditioning effect of blood flow on resistance artery smooth muscle myosin phosphatase.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. The resting tension-internal circumference (IC) relation was determined for each FA and MA segment (20Mulvany M.J. Halpern W. Contractile properties of small arterial resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats.Circ. Res. 1977; 41: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). IC was set to 0.9 Å ∼ IC100 where IC100 is the internal circumference of the vessel under an effective transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg (13.3 kilopascals). For TA rings, base-line tension in PSS buffer was preset at 4 millinewtons prior to force induction. Cumulative dose-response curves to phenylephrine (PE; an α-adrenergic receptor agonist; 1 nm to 10 μm), acetylcholine (ACh; muscarinic receptor agonist; 10 nm to 10 μm), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; direct NO donor; 10 nm to 10 μm) were generated in the absence or presence of 100 μm l-nitroarginine methyl ester (competitive antagonist of l-arginine/NO production). Dose-response curves were performed with single agents and repeated in triplicate at each concentration. For depolarization-induced contractility studies, 60 mm KCl was added to the reaction bath after vessel equilibration in PSS buffer. Treatment regimens are described in each figure legend. Data are presented as active tension (millinewtons) for agonist-induced contraction and percentage of maximum PE-induced tension for ACh- and SNP-mediated relaxation. Arteries were permeabilized, and force-calcium relationships were determined as described previously with minor modifications (21Lu Y. Zhang H. Gokina N. Mandala M. Sato O. Ikebe M. Osol G. Fisher S.A. Uterine artery myosin phosphatase isoform switching and increased sensitivity to SNP in a rat l-NAME model of hypertension of pregnancy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C564-C571Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, isolated TA and MA segments were mounted in the wire myograph and incubated in high relaxing (HR) solution for 10–20 min and permeabilized with 1000 units/ml α-toxin (Calbiochem) in HR solution for 1 h at room temperature. The HR solution (pCa >9) was composed of 53.28 mm KCl, 6.81 mm MgCl2, 0.025 mm CaCl2, 10.0 mm EGTA, 5.4 mm Na2ATP, and 12.0 mm creatine phosphate. After permeabilization, segments were washed with additional HR solution. HR and pCa solutions used during and following permeabilization of the arteries were designed (MAXC computer program) to maintain a desired free Ca2+ concentration using Ca2+-EGTA buffering. The composition of the pCa 4.5 solution was similar to HR solution except for the following differences: 33.74 mm KCl, 6.48 mm MgCl2, and 9.96 mm CaCl2. The pH of the HR and pCa 4.5 solutions was adjusted to 7.1 with KOH, and ionic strength was held constant (0.15). Solutions containing a desired free Ca2+ concentration between pCa 9 and 4.5 were achieved by mixing appropriate volumes of HR and pCa 4.5 solutions based on the Bathe algorithm. All solutions contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2.5 μg/ml), and PMSF (50 μm). The pCa-tension relationship was then determined by bathing the permeabilized vessels in solutions of sequentially increasing Ca2+ concentrations, ranging from pCa 8.5 to 4.5, while recording active tension for ∼5 min in each solution or until stabilized. Adult mice (8–12 weeks old) were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (Avertin; 0.25 mg/g of body weight intraperitoneally) and secured in the supine position. The right internal jugular vein was surgically exposed and cannulated for drug infusions. Following calibration, a 1F pressure catheter (SPR-1000, Millar Instruments) was inserted into the left common carotid artery and advanced toward the heart until a stable aortic pressure waveform was observed (PowerLab data acquisition unit, ADInstruments). Heart rates were simultaneously measured through needle electrodes and bioamplification under a separate channel. Animals received escalating doses of either PE (5, 20, and 100 μg/kg) or angiotensin II (Ang II) (0.05, 0.5, and 5 μg/kg). Each bolus injection delivered a total volume of 30 μl (adjusted to effective concentration) and was performed in triplicate with return to base-line blood pressure prior to each injection. Hemodynamic data analyses were performed using LabChart software (ADInstruments). Data are displayed as absolute change from base line in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; in mm Hg). MAP was calculated as the sum of the area under the aortic pressure curve averaged over a minimum 100 cardiac cycles. Where indicated, mice were administered N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT; 10 mg/kg subcutaneously; Calbiochem) or vehicle (DMSO) daily for 6 days followed by PE dose-response measurements. Mice (8–12 weeks old) were anesthetized with Avertin (0.25 mg/g of body weight intraperitoneally), and transthoracic echocardiography was performed using the Vevo 770 High Resolution Imaging System (Visual Sonics, Canada) equipped with an RMV-707B 30-MHz probe. Standard M-mode sampling was taken through the left ventricular short axis at the midpapillary level before and 1 min after PE treatment via tail vein injection. A 30-μl bolus volume was maintained for each PE dose. Tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight and cryoprotected with 15% sucrose. Transverse sections (10 mm) were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM3050), washed with PBS, and blocked in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Serial sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies against smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) (1:100; Abcam), αSMA (1:100; Sigma), cleaved Notch1 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), or Jagged1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-TX). Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to DyLight 594 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 (1:200; Sigma) diluted in PBS-TX for 1 h at room temperature. Sections incubated as described above but without the primary antibodies served as negative controls. Sections were mounted with DAPI (Dako) and viewed, and images were captured by high resolution fluorescence microscopy. Arterial segments were quickly dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm PMSF) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce). Alternatively, primary aortic SMCs from control and mutant mice were isolated, and total protein lysates were collected as described previously (22Yang K. Proweller A. Vascular smooth muscle Notch signals regulate endothelial cell sensitivity to angiogenic stimulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 13741-13753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. Role of myosin phosphatase isoforms in cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by standard semidry methods (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer and then with antibodies against MLCK (mouse monoclonal; Sigma; 1:10,000), MLC (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology; 1: 1000), p-MLC (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000 (24Satterwhite L.L.

Thereafter, secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for MLCK and αSMA (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:5,000) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for MLC, p-MLC, SM-MHC, cleaved Notch1, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:10,000). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology), and films were digitally scanned for protein quantification using NIH Image software. Relative densitometric units for MLCK, SM-MHC, and αSMA were calculated by normalization to β-actin, whereas p-MLC was normalized to total MLC. Thoracic aortas were quickly harvested from mutant and littermate control mice and segmented into 4-mm-long rings, each equilibrated in PSS buffer containing protease (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C. Thereafter, rings were treated with either 60 mm KCl or 10−5 m Ang II for 15 min and immediately transferred to a fresh PSS buffer wash, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen segments were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer using TissueLyser II (2 × 2 min at 30 Hz; Qiagen). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for Western blot detection of phosphorylated and total MLC as described above. From whole tissue, arterial segments were quickly dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by standard RNA extraction. Total RNA was also isolated from A10 and primary aortic SMCs collected in TRIzol. Two micrograms of total RNA served as template for oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time PCR analyses were performed on a StepOnePlus quantitative PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using mouse MLCK primers reported previously (25Zhi G. Ryder J.W. Huang J. Ding P. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Myosin light chain kinase and myosin phosphorylation effect frequency-dependent potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17519-17524Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MLCK primers for A10-derived transcripts included 5′-GACGTGTTCACCCTGGTTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGTGCAGCATCAGTGACA-3′ (reverse). Primers for HRT1 and HRT2 have been described previously (26Proweller A. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling represses myocardin-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation.J. Biol.

The PCR included 50 ng of cDNA reaction, 150 nm forward and reverse MLCK primers, and 1× SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH amplification served as the reference gene. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and data were analyzed according to the 2−ΔΔc(t) method. Luciferase reporter assays were performed in 10T1/2 cells (ATCC) as described previously (26Proweller A. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling represses myocardin-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8994-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and co-transfected using Xtremegene transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 25 ng of p6476 or p389 MLCK-luciferase reporter constructs (a kind gift from Dr. Paul Herring, Indiana University) and expression plasmids for intracellular Notch1 (ICN1) and DNMAML1 at the indicated ratios (15Yin F.

As described previously (15Yin F. Hoggatt A.M. Zhou J. Herring B.P. 130-kDa smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is transcribed from a CArG-dependent, internal promoter within the mouse mylk gene.Am. J. Physiol.

Both p6476 and p389 contain a CArG element required for serum response factor/myocardin-induced transcription, and therefore inclusion of a myocardin expression plasmid in these experiments served as a positive control for activation of the promoter/reporter (26Proweller A. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. Notch signaling represses myocardin-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8994-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after plasmid transfection for measurement of luciferase activity (Promega) using a Veritas plate reader (Turner BioSystems) and normalized to total protein. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. For promoter mutagenesis studies, p6476 was used as the template for a single nucleotide substitution at a core CSL (CC) sequence located at position −3685 (G to A). Mutagenesis primers included 5′-GGAATGAGGGACCTGAGAATTCATGCTGGTC-3′ (2FCSLf) and 5′-GACCAGCATGAATTCTCAGGTCCCTCATTCC-3′ (2FCSLr), and the procedure was performed using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two independent mutant clones (p2FCSL2 and p2FCSL5) were confirmed by DNA sequencing and subjected to luciferase assay as above. Notch signaling was induced in control SM22-Cre−/DNMAML1+ aortic SMCs cultured in dishes displaying immobilized Jagged1 ligand (Fc-Jag1) as described previously (26Proweller A. Pear W.S.

It has recently been shown that LINGO-1 antagonists significantly improve neuronal survival after neural injury. However, the mechanism by which LINGO-1 signaling influences susceptibility to apoptosis remains unknown. In an effort to better understand how LINGO-1 regulates these signaling pathways, we used an established model of serum deprivation (SD) to induce neuronal apoptosis. We demonstrate that treatment either with a construct containing the intracellular domain of LINGO-1 or with Nogo66, a LINGO-1 receptor complex agonist, resulted in an enhanced rate of apoptosis in primary cultured cortical neurons under SD. Reducing the expression levels of the serine/threonine kinase WNK3 using shRNA or inhibiting its kinase activity had similar effects on the survival of serum-deprived neurons. Consistent with these observations, we found that LINGO-1 and WNK3 co-localized and co-precipitated in cultured cortical neurons and brain tissue. Significantly, this co-association was enhanced by Nogo66 treatment. Binding of WNK3 to the intracellular domain of LINGO-1 led to a reduction in WNK3 kinase activity, as did Nogo66 stimulation. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that endogenous WNK3 suppresses SD-induced neuronal apoptosis in a kinase-dependent manner, as the expression of either a WNK3 RNAi construct or a kinase-dead N-terminal fragment of WNK3 led to increased apoptosis. Taken together, our results show that LINGO-1 potentiates neuronal apoptosis, likely by inhibiting WNK3 kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1978956080,"Protein arginine methylation is emerging as a pivotal posttranslational modification involved in regulating various cellular processes; however, its role in erythropoiesis is still elusive. Erythropoiesis generates circulating red blood cells which are vital for body activity. Deficiency in erythroid differentiation causes anemia which compromises the quality of life. Despite extensive studies, the molecular events regulating erythropoiesis are not fully understood. This study showed that the increase in protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) levels, via transfection or protein transduction, significantly promoted erythroid differentiation in the bipotent human K562 cell line as well as in human primary hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cells. PRMT1 expression enhanced the production of hemoglobin and the erythroid surface marker glycophorin A, and also up-regulated several key transcription factors, GATA1, NF-E2 and EKLF, which are critical for lineage-specific differentiation. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of PRMT1 suppressed erythroid differentiation. The methyltransferase activity-deficient PRMT1G80R mutant failed to stimulate differentiation, indicating the requirement of arginine methylation of target proteins. Our results further showed that a specific isoform of p38 MAPK, p38α, promoted erythroid differentiation, whereas p38β did not play a role. The stimulation of erythroid differentiation by PRMT1 was diminished in p38α- but not p38β-knockdown cells. PRMT1 appeared to act upstream of p38α, since expression of p38α still promoted erythroid differentiation in PRMT1-knockdown cells, and expression of PRMT1 enhanced the activation of p38 MAPK. Importantly, we showed for the first time that PRMT1 was associated with p38α in cells by co-immunoprecipitation and that PRMT1 directly methylated p38α in in vitro methylation assays. Taken together, our findings unveil a link between PRMT1 and p38α in regulating the erythroid differentiation program and provide evidence suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism for p38α through arginine methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1991547601,"Edenopteron keithcrooki gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Famennian Worange Point Formation; the holotype is amongst the largest tristichopterids and sarcopterygians documented by semi-articulated remains from the Devonian Period. The new taxon has dentary fangs and premaxillary tusks, features assumed to be derived for large Northern Hemisphere tristichopterids (Eusthenodon, Hyneria, Langlieria). It resembles Eusthenodon in ornament, but is distinguished by longer proportions of the parietal compared to the post-parietal shield, and numerous differences in shape and proportions of other bones. Several characters (accessory vomers in the palate, submandibulars overlapping ventral jaw margin, scales ornamented with widely-spaced deep grooves) are recorded only in tristichopterids from East Gondwana (Australia-Antarctica). On this evidence Edenopteron gen. nov. is placed in an endemic Gondwanan subfamily Mandageriinae within the Tristichopteridae; it differs from the nominal genotype Mandageria in its larger size, less pointed skull, shape of the orbits and other skull characters. The hypothesis that tristichopterids evolved in Laurussia and later dispersed into Gondwana, and a derived subgroup of large Late Devonian genera dispersed from Gondwana, is inconsistent with the evidence of the new taxon. Using oldest fossil and most primitive clade criteria the most recent phylogeny resolves South China and Gondwana as areas of origin for all tetrapodomorphs. The immediate outgroup to tristichopterids remains unresolved – either Spodichthys from Greenland as recently proposed, or Marsdenichthys from Gondwana, earlier suggested to be the sister group to all tristichopterids. Both taxa combine two characters that do not co-occur in other tetrapodomorphs (extratemporal bone in the skull; non-cosmoid round scales with an internal boss). Recently both ‘primitive’ and ‘derived’ tristichopterids have been discovered in the late Middle Devonian of both hemispheres, implying extensive ghost lineages within the group. Resolving their phylogeny and biogeography will depend on a comprehensive new phylogenetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1963608935,"The identification of significant individual factors causing complex diseases is challenging in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) since each factor has only a modest effect on the disease development mechanism. In this study, we hypothesize that the biological pathways that are targeted by these individual factors show higher conservation within and across populations. To test this hypothesis, we searched for the disease related pathways on two intracranial aneurysm GWAS in European and Japanese case–control cohorts. Even though there were a few significantly conserved SNPs within and between populations, seven of the top ten affected pathways were found significant in both populations. The probability of random occurrence of such an event is 2.44E−36. We therefore claim that even though each individual has a unique combination of factors involved in the mechanism of disease development, most targeted pathways that need to be altered by these factors are, for the most part, the same. These pathways can serve as disease markers. Individuals, for example, can be scanned for factors affecting the genes in marker pathways. Hence, individual factors of disease development can be determined; and this knowledge can be exploited for drug development and personalized therapeutic applications. Here, we discuss the potential avenues of pathway markers in medicine and their translation to preventive and individualized health care."
https://openalex.org/W2015387317,"Adverse drug reactions, including severe patient bleeding, may occur following the administration of anticoagulant drugs. Bivalirudin is a synthetic anticoagulant drug sometimes employed as a substitute for heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant that can cause a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Although bivalrudin has the advantage of not causing HIT, a major concern is lack of an antidote for this drug. In contrast, medical professionals can quickly reverse the effects of heparin using protamine. This report details the selection of an aptamer to bivalirudin that functions as an antidote in buffer. This was accomplished by immobilizing the drug on a monolithic column to partition binding sequences from nonbinding sequences using a low-pressure chromatography system and salt gradient elution. The elution profile of binding sequences was compared to that of a blank column (no drug), and fractions with a chromatographic difference were analyzed via real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and used for further selection. Sequences were identified by 454 sequencing and demonstrated low micromolar dissociation constants through fluorescence anisotropy after only two rounds of selection. One aptamer, JPB5, displayed a dose-dependent reduction of the clotting time in buffer, with a 20 µM aptamer achieving a nearly complete antidote effect. This work is expected to result in a superior safety profile for bivalirudin, resulting in enhanced patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2063475539,"Decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD; EC 4.1.1.9) is an essential facet in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. The structure of human peroxisomal MCD reveals a molecular tetramer that is best described as a dimer of structural heterodimers, in which the two subunits present markedly different conformations. This molecular organization is consistent with half-of-the-sites reactivity. Each subunit has an all-helix N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain with an acetyltransferase fold (GNAT superfamily). Intersubunit disulfide bridges, Cys-206-Cys-206 and Cys-243-Cys-243, can link the four subunits of the tetramer, imparting positive cooperativity to the catalytic process. The combination of a half-of-the-sites mechanism within each structural heterodimer and positive cooperativity in the tetramer produces a complex regulatory picture that is further complicated by the multiple intracellular locations of the enzyme. Transport into the peroxisome has been investigated by docking human MCD onto the peroxisomal import protein peroxin 5, which revealed interactions that extend beyond the C-terminal targeting motif."
https://openalex.org/W2080923642,"Fiddler crabs (Uca spp., Decapoda: Ocypodidae) are commonly found forming large aggregations in intertidal zones, where they perform rhythmic waving displays with their greatly enlarged claws. While performing these displays, fiddler crabs often synchronize their behavior with neighboring males, forming the only known synchronized visual courtship displays involving reflected light and moving body parts. Despite being one of the most conspicuous aspects of fiddler crab behavior, little is known about the mechanisms underlying synchronization of male displays. In this study we develop a spatially explicit model of fiddler crab waving displays using coupled logistic map equations. We explored two alternative models in which males either direct their attention at random angles or preferentially toward neighbors. Our results indicate that synchronization is possible over a fairly large region of parameter space. Moreover, our model was capable of generating local synchronization neighborhoods, as commonly observed in fiddler crabs under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086077515,"Explaining cooperation in groups remains a key problem because reciprocity breaks down between more than two. Punishing individuals who contribute little provides a potential answer but changes the dilemma to why pay the costs of punishing which, like cooperation itself, provides a public good. Nevertheless, people are observed to punish others in behavioural economic games, posing a problem for existing theory which highlights the difficulty in explaining the spread and persistence of punishment. Here, I consider the apparent mismatch between theory and evidence and show by means of instructive analysis and simulation how much of the experimental evidence for punishment comes from scenarios in which punishers may expect to obtain a net benefit from punishing free-riders. In repeated games within groups, punishment works by imposing costs on defectors so that it pays them to switch to cooperating. Both punishers and non-punishers then benefit from the resulting increase in cooperation, hence investing in punishment can constitute a social dilemma. However, I show the conditions in which the benefits of increased cooperation are so great that they more than offset the costs of punishing, thereby removing the temptation to free-ride on others' investments and making punishment explicable in terms of direct self-interest. Crucially, this is because of the leveraging effect imposed in typical studies whereby people can pay a small cost to inflict a heavy loss on a punished individual. In contrast to previous models suggesting punishment is disadvantaged when rare, I show it can invade until it comes into a producer-scrounger equilibrium with non-punishers. I conclude that adding punishment to an iterated public goods game can solve the problem of achieving cooperation by removing the social dilemma."
https://openalex.org/W2143016187,"The Ikaros family of transcription factors is critical for normal T cell development while limiting malignant transformation. Mature CD8 T cells express multiple Ikaros family members, yet little is known about their function in this context. To test the functions of this gene family, we used retroviral transduction to express a naturally occurring, dominant negative (DN) isoform of Ikaros in activated CD8 T cells. Notably, expression of DN Ikaros profoundly enhanced the competitive advantage of activated CD8 T cells cultured in IL-12, such that by 6 days of culture, DN Ikaros-transduced cells were 100-fold more abundant than control cells. Expression of a DN isoform of Helios, a related Ikaros-family transcription factor, conferred a similar advantage to transduced cells in IL-12. While DN Ikaros-transduced cells had higher expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, DN Ikaros-transduced cells achieved their competitive advantage through an IL-2 independent mechanism. Finally, the competitive advantage of DN Ikaros-transduced cells was manifested in vivo, following adoptive transfer of transduced cells. These data identify the Ikaros family of transcription factors as regulators of cytokine responsiveness in activated CD8 T cells, and suggest a role for this family in influencing effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1978339676,"sparks and waves play important roles in calcium release and calcium propagation during the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process in cardiac myocytes. Although the classical Fick’s law is widely used to model sparks and waves in cardiac myocytes, it fails to reasonably explain the full-width at half maximum(FWHM) paradox. However, the anomalous subdiffusion model successfully reproduces sparks of experimental results. In this paper, in the light of anomalous subdiffusion of sparks, we develop a mathematical model of calcium wave in cardiac myocytes by using stochastic release of release units (CRUs). Our model successfully reproduces calcium waves with physiological parameters. The results reveal how concentration waves propagate from an initial firing of one CRU at a corner or in the middle of considered region, answer how large in magnitude of an anomalous spark can induce a wave. With physiological currents (2pA) through CRUs, it is shown that an initial firing of four adjacent CRUs can form a wave. Furthermore, the phenomenon of calcium waves collision is also investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2028270977,"HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) frequently incorporates ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) during proviral DNA synthesis, particularly under the limited dNTP conditions found in macrophages. We investigated the mechanistic impacts of an rNMP embedded in DNA templates on HIV-1 RT-mediated DNA synthesis. We observed that the template-embedded rNMP induced pausing of RT and delayed DNA synthesis kinetics at low macrophage dNTP concentrations but not at high T cell dNTP concentrations. Although the binding affinity of RT to the rNMP-containing template-primer was not altered, the dNTP incorporation kinetics of RT were significantly reduced at one nucleotide upstream and downstream of the rNMP site, leading to pause sites. Finally, HIV-1 RT becomes more error-prone at rNMP sites with an elevated mismatch extension capability but not enhanced misinsertion capability. Together these data suggest that rNMPs embedded in DNA templates may influence reverse transcription kinetics and impact viral mutagenesis in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2035318773,"Coastal protection measures are planned and executed worldwide to combat the effects of global warming and climate change, in particular the acceleration of sea level rise, higher storm surge flooding and extensive coastal inundation. The extent to which these defensive measures may impact coastal and estuarine ecosystems is still poorly understood. Since the building of a storm surge barrier, movement of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in and out of the Eastern Scheldt tidal bay (SW-Netherlands) may be limited. To measure residency, porpoises stranded along the Dutch North Sea coast between 2006 and 2008 were sampled for muscle (n = 102) and bone tissue (n = 118), of which 9 muscle (8.8%) and 12 bone samples (10.2%) were collected from animals stranded within the Eastern Scheldt. Stable carbon (δ13C) was analysed to get insight into the habitat use and residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt. Our data showed significantly higher δ13C values in the muscle of porpoises stranded within the Eastern Scheldt (µ = −17.7‰, SD = 0.4‰) compared to animals stranded along the Dutch coast (µ = −18.3‰, SD = 0.5‰). This suggests that most porpoises stranded in the Eastern Scheldt foraged there for a longer period. The distinct δ13C signature of animals from the Eastern Scheldt was not observed in bone tissue, suggesting a relatively recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises within the Eastern Scheldt. The high number of strandings within the Eastern Scheldt suggests a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch coastal zone. Our study indicates that along with other changes in the physical environment, the storm surge barrier may play an important role in determining the residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt, and that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it."
