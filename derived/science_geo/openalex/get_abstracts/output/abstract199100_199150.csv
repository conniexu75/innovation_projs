Although oxidative decarboxylation has been shown to play a major role in ribose formation in yeast (3) and Escherichia coEi (4), and in ribitol formation in the mold Ashbya gossypii (5), the work of Bernstein (2) indicates that in the chick this pathway seems to be of only minor importance. He found that the labeling pattern of ribonucleic acid ribose isolated after administration of C14-labeled precursors such as acetate, glycine, and bicarbonate was markedly different from that of carbons 2 to 6 of the glucose residues obtained from the liver glycogen of the same animals. The results of similar work with rats have been interpreted by Bernstein as indicating approximately equal contributions from both pathways (6, 4). It has been suggested that the data of Bernstein with chicks are in good agreement with the results expected from the operation of the transaldolase-transketolase pathway (7). This pathway would also appear to’ account for up to one-half of the ribitol synthesis in A. gossypii and for most of the pentosan formation in plants (8). An 8to lo-fold increase in liver DPN during 8 hours can be obtained by injecting mice with nicotinamide (9). This rapid and extensive synthesis of nucleotide ribose provides a convenient system for studying the conversion of hexose to pentose in the whole animal. It was found that considerable quantities of ribose-labeled DPN could readily be obtained by injecting mice with glucose labeled with Cl4 together with nicotinamide (10). This paper describes the distribution of label in the ribose obtained from mouse liver DPN after the injection of C14-labeled glucose and ribose. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, under the conditions used, oxidative decarboxylation accounts for only a minor portion of pentose biosynthesis and that the major pathway can be explained in terms of the transaldolase-transketolase reactions."

As regards the analysis of hydroxyproline, the accuracy can be considerably improved if the colour development is effected using a ninhydrin–isatin–triethylamine reagent2 rather than isatin1."
