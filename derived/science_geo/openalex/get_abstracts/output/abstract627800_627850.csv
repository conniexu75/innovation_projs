https://openalex.org/W2914756534,"Microglia have critical roles not only in neural development and homeostasis, but also in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system1–4. These highly diverse and specialized functions may be executed by subsets of microglia that already exist in situ, or by specific subsets of microglia that develop from a homogeneous pool of cells on demand. However, little is known about the presence of spatially and temporally restricted subclasses of microglia in the central nervous system during development or disease. Here we combine massively parallel single-cell analysis, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, advanced immunohistochemistry and computational modelling to comprehensively characterize subclasses of microglia in multiple regions of the central nervous system during development and disease. Single-cell analysis of tissues of the central nervous system during homeostasis in mice revealed specific time- and region-dependent subtypes of microglia. Demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases evoked context-dependent subtypes of microglia with distinct molecular hallmarks and diverse cellular kinetics. Corresponding clusters of microglia were also identified in healthy human brains, and the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis. Our data provide insights into the endogenous immune system of the central nervous system during development, homeostasis and disease, and may also provide new targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory pathologies. Analyses at single-cell resolution show that diverse subtypes of microglia exist during development and homeostasis of the central nervous system, and identify specific subsets of microglia associated with demyelination and neurodegenerative disease in mice and humans."

https://openalex.org/W2912600324,"Sleep is integral to life1. Although insufficient or disrupted sleep increases the risk of multiple pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease2, we know little about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which sleep maintains cardiovascular health. Here we report that sleep regulates haematopoiesis and protects against atherosclerosis in mice. We show that mice subjected to sleep fragmentation produce more Ly-6Chigh monocytes, develop larger atherosclerotic lesions and produce less hypocretin—a stimulatory and wake-promoting neuropeptide—in the lateral hypothalamus. Hypocretin controls myelopoiesis by restricting the production of CSF1 by hypocretin-receptor-expressing pre-neutrophils in the bone marrow. Whereas hypocretin-null and haematopoietic hypocretin-receptor-null mice develop monocytosis and accelerated atherosclerosis, sleep-fragmented mice with either haematopoietic CSF1 deficiency or hypocretin supplementation have reduced numbers of circulating monocytes and smaller atherosclerotic lesions. Together, these results identify a neuro-immune axis that links sleep to haematopoiesis and atherosclerosis. The fragmentation of sleep in Apoe−/− mice induces monocytosis and accelerated atherosclerosis due to a reduction in hypocretin that otherwise restricts bone marrow CSF1 availability."
https://openalex.org/W2911980279,"The human genome contains approximately 20 thousand protein-coding genes1, but the size of the collection of antigen receptors of the adaptive immune system that is generated by the recombination of gene segments with non-templated junctional additions (on B cells) is unknown-although it is certainly orders of magnitude larger. It has not been established whether individuals possess unique (or private) repertoires or substantial components of shared (or public) repertoires. Here we sequence recombined and expressed B cell receptor genes in several individuals to determine the size of their B cell receptor repertoires, and the extent to which these are shared between individuals. Our experiments revealed that the circulating repertoire of each individual contained between 9 and 17 million B cell clonotypes. The three individuals that we studied shared many clonotypes, including between 1 and 6% of B cell heavy-chain clonotypes shared between two subjects (0.3% of clonotypes shared by all three) and 20 to 34% of λ or κ light chains shared between two subjects (16 or 22% of λ or κ light chains, respectively, were shared by all three). Some of the B cell clonotypes had thousands of clones, or somatic variants, within the clonotype lineage. Although some of these shared lineages might be driven by exposure to common antigens, previous exposure to foreign antigens was not the only force that shaped the shared repertoires, as we also identified shared clonotypes in umbilical cord blood samples and all adult repertoires. The unexpectedly high prevalence of shared clonotypes in B cell repertoires, and identification of the sequences of these shared clonotypes, should enable better understanding of the role of B cell immune repertoires in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2911647752,"Cholesterol is essential for cells to grow and proliferate. Normal mammalian cells meet their need for cholesterol through its uptake or de novo synthesis1, but the extent to which cancer cells rely on each of these pathways remains poorly understood. Here, using a competitive proliferation assay on a pooled collection of DNA-barcoded cell lines, we identify a subset of cancer cells that is auxotrophic for cholesterol and thus highly dependent on its uptake. Through metabolic gene expression analysis, we pinpoint the loss of squalene monooxygenase expression as a cause of cholesterol auxotrophy, particularly in ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines and primary tumours. Squalene monooxygenase catalyses the oxidation of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and its loss results in accumulation of the upstream metabolite squalene, which is normally undetectable. In ALK+ ALCLs, squalene alters the cellular lipid profile and protects cancer cells from ferroptotic cell death, providing a growth advantage under conditions of oxidative stress and in tumour xenografts. Finally, a CRISPR-based genetic screen identified cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor as essential for the growth of ALCL cells in culture and as patient-derived xenografts. This work reveals that the cholesterol auxotrophy of ALCLs is a targetable liability and, more broadly, that systematic approaches can be used to identify nutrient dependencies unique to individual cancer types."

https://openalex.org/W2914432255,"Cell-identity switches, in which terminally differentiated cells are converted into different cell types when stressed, represent a widespread regenerative strategy in animals, yet they are poorly documented in mammals. In mice, some glucagon-producing pancreatic α-cells and somatostatin-producing δ-cells become insulin-expressing cells after the ablation of insulin-secreting β-cells, thus promoting diabetes recovery. Whether human islets also display this plasticity, especially in diabetic conditions, remains unknown. Here we show that islet non-β-cells, namely α-cells and pancreatic polypeptide (PPY)-producing γ-cells, obtained from deceased non-diabetic or diabetic human donors, can be lineage-traced and reprogrammed by the transcription factors PDX1 and MAFA to produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose. When transplanted into diabetic mice, converted human α-cells reverse diabetes and continue to produce insulin even after six months. Notably, insulin-producing α-cells maintain expression of α-cell markers, as seen by deep transcriptomic and proteomic characterization. These observations provide conceptual evidence and a molecular framework for a mechanistic understanding of in situ cell plasticity as a treatment for diabetes and other degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3100698457,"The three central phenomena of cuprate (copper oxide) superconductors are linked by a common doping level p*—at which the enigmatic pseudogap phase ends and the resistivity exhibits an anomalous linear dependence on temperature, and around which the superconducting phase forms a dome-shaped area in the phase diagram1. However, the fundamental nature of p* remains unclear, in particular regarding whether it marks a true quantum phase transition. Here we measure the specific heat C of the cuprates Eu-LSCO and Nd-LSCO at low temperature in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, over a wide doping range2 that includes p*. As a function of doping, we find that Cel/T is strongly peaked at p* (where Cel is the electronic contribution to C) and exhibits a log(1/T) dependence as temperature T tends to zero. These are the classic thermodynamic signatures of a quantum critical point3–5, as observed in heavy-fermion6 and iron-based7 superconductors at the point where their antiferromagnetic phase comes to an end. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates ends at a quantum critical point, the associated fluctuations of which are probably involved in d-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering of charge carriers. Measurements of the specific heat of two cuprate materials at low temperature in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity and over a wide doping range reveal that the pseudogap phase of cuprates ends at a quantum critical point."

https://openalex.org/W2913381985,"Photonic cooling of matter has enabled both access to unexplored states of matter, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, and novel approaches to solid-state refrigeration1–3. Critical to these photonic cooling approaches is the use of low-entropy coherent radiation from lasers, which makes the cooling process thermodynamically feasible4–6. Recent theoretical work7–9 has suggested that photonic solid-state cooling may be accomplished by tuning the chemical potential of photons without using coherent laser radiation, but such cooling has not been experimentally realized. Here we report an experimental demonstration of photonic cooling without laser light using a custom-fabricated nanocalorimetric device and a photodiode. We show that when they are in each other’s near-field—that is, when the size of the vacuum gap between the planar surfaces of the calorimetric device and a reverse-biased photodiode is reduced to tens of nanometres—solid-state cooling of the calorimetric device can be accomplished via a combination of photon tunnelling, which enhances the transport of photons across nanoscale gaps, and suppression of photon emission from the photodiode due to a change in the chemical potential of the photons under an applied reverse bias. This demonstration of active nanophotonic cooling—without the use of coherent laser radiation—lays the experimental foundation for systematic exploration of nanoscale photonics and optoelectronics for solid-state refrigeration and on-chip device cooling. The ‘negative luminescence’ of a reverse-biased photodiode is harnessed to draw thermal energy from a nearby solid object, thereby realizing photonic cooling without the use of coherent laser radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2912800004,"Singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) has well-established roles in photosynthetic plants, bacteria and fungi1–3, but not in mammals. Chemically generated 1O2 oxidizes the amino acid tryptophan to precursors of a key metabolite called N-formylkynurenine4, whereas enzymatic oxidation of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalysed by a family of dioxygenases, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 15. Under inflammatory conditions, this haem-containing enzyme is expressed in arterial endothelial cells, where it contributes to the regulation of blood pressure6. However, whether indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 forms 1O2 and whether this contributes to blood pressure control have remained unknown. Here we show that arterial indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 regulates blood pressure via formation of 1O2. We observed that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the enzyme generates 1O2 and that this is associated with the stereoselective oxidation of l-tryptophan to a tricyclic hydroperoxide via a previously unrecognized oxidative activation of the dioxygenase activity. The tryptophan-derived hydroperoxide acts in vivo as a signalling molecule, inducing arterial relaxation and decreasing blood pressure; this activity is dependent on Cys42 of protein kinase G1α. Our findings demonstrate a pathophysiological role for 1O2 in mammals through formation of an amino acid-derived hydroperoxide that regulates vascular tone and blood pressure under inflammatory conditions. Singlet molecular oxygen, produced by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 activity, gives rise to a signalling molecule that regulates arterial relaxation under inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2886568032,"Time-dependent data collected in studies of Alzheimer’s disease usually has missing and irregularly sampled data points. For this reason time series methods which assume regular sampling cannot be applied directly to the data without a pre-processing step. In this paper we use a random forest to learn the relationship between pairs of data points at different time separations. The input vector is a summary of the time series history and it includes both demographic and non-time varying variables such as genetic data. To test the method we use data from the TADPOLE grand challenge, an initiative which aims to predict the evolution of subjects at risk of Alzheimer’s disease using demographic, physical and cognitive input data. The task is to predict diagnosis, ADAS-13 score and normalised ventricles volume. While the competition proceeds, forecasting methods may be compared using a leaderboard dataset selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and with standard metrics for measuring accuracy. For diagnosis, we find an mAUC of 0.82, and a classification accuracy of 0.73 compared with a benchmark SVM predictor which gives mAUC = 0.62 and BCA = 0.52. The results show that the method is effective and comparable with other methods."
https://openalex.org/W2913207199,"The incessantly growing demand for electricity in today’s world claims an efficient and reliable system of energy supply. Distributed energy resources such as diesel generators, wind energy and solar energy can be combined within a microgrid to provide energy to the consumers in a sustainable manner. In order to ensure more reliable and economical energy supply, battery storage system is integrated within the microgrid. In this article, operating cost of isolated microgrid is reduced by economic scheduling considering the optimal size of the battery. However, deep discharge shortens the lifetime of battery operation. Therefore, the real time battery operation cost is modeled considering the depth of discharge at each time interval. Moreover, the proposed economic scheduling with battery sizing is optimized using firefly algorithm (FA). The efficacy of FA is compared with other metaheuristic techniques in terms of performance measurement indices, which are cost of electricity and loss of power supply probability. The results show that the proposed technique reduces the cost of microgrid and attain optimal size of the battery."

https://openalex.org/W2911294518,"The only way to visually observe cellular viscosity, which can greatly influence biological reactions and has been linked to several human diseases, is through viscosity imaging. Imaging cellular viscosity has allowed the mapping of viscosity in cells, and the next frontier is targeted viscosity imaging of organelles and their microenvironments. Here we present a fluorescent molecular rotor/FLIM framework to image both organellar viscosity and membrane fluidity, using a combination of chemical targeting and organelle extraction. For demonstration, we image matrix viscosity and membrane fluidity of mitochondria, which have been linked to human diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease and Leigh's syndrome. We find that both are highly dynamic and responsive to small environmental and physiological changes, even under non-pathological conditions. This shows that neither viscosity nor fluidity can be assumed to be fixed and underlines the need for single-cell, and now even single-organelle, imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2912291055,"T cell activation is tightly regulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory co-receptors and has been a focus in the development of interventions for managing cancer or autoimmune diseases. Targeting the inhibitory co-receptors programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) has successfully eradicated tumors but induced immune-related adverse events in humans and mice. The beneficial and adverse effects of targeting these co-receptors highlight their importance in cancer immunity and also autoimmunity. Although the therapeutic potencies of other inhibitory co-receptors are under extensive investigation, their inhibitory mechanisms and their functional differences are not well understood. Here we analyzed the inhibitory mechanisms of lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), another inhibitory co-receptor, by using an in vitro T cell activation system and a high-affinity anti-LAG-3 antibody that strongly interferes with the binding of LAG-3 to its ligand. We found that the expression level of LAG-3 strongly correlates with the inhibitory function of LAG-3, suggesting that LAG-3 functions as a rheostat rather than as a breaker of T cell activation. By evaluating the inhibitory capacities of various LAG-3 variants relative to their expression levels, we found that LAG-3 transduces two independent inhibitory signals through an FXXL motif in the membrane-proximal region and the C-terminal EX repeat. These motifs have not been reported previously for inhibitory co-receptors, suggesting that LAG-3 inhibits T cell activation through a nonredundant inhibitory mechanisms along with the other inhibitory co-receptors. Our findings provide a rationale for combinatorial targeting of LAG-3 and the other inhibitory co-receptors to improve cancer immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2914482281,"Germin-like proteins (GLPs) are involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in different plant species. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 40 GLP family member proteins in nine chromosomes. Although some of the rice GLP (OsGLP) promoters have been studied through in silico analysis as well as experimentally, studies regarding the distribution pattern of the biotic and abiotic stress associated transcription factor binding sites (TFbs) in the promoter regions of OsGLP genes have not been attempted thoroughly. Several transcription factors (TFs) namely NAC, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB and AP2/ERF act as major TFs concerned with biotic as well as abiotic stress responses across various plant species. In the present study the in silico analysis was carried out using the 1.5 kilobases (kb) promoter regions from 40 different OsGLP genes for the presence of NAC, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB and AP2/ERF TFbs in it. Among various OsGLP gene promoters, OsGLP8-11 was found to contain highest number of tested TFbs in the promoter region whereas the promoter region of OsGLP5-1 depicted least amount of TFbs. Phylogenetic study of promoter regions of different OsGLP genes revealed four different clades. Our analyses could reveal the evolutionary significance of different OsGLP gene promoters. It can be presumed from the present findings as well as previous reports that OsGLP gene duplications and subsequent variations in the TFbs in OsGLP gene promoter regions might be the consequences of neofunctionalization of OsGLP genes and their promoters for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2912016924,"The reconstruction of large bone defects remains a significant challenge for orthopedists. Three-dimensional-printed (3DP) scaffold is considered a promising repair material. Static magnetic field (SMF) treatment is an effective and noninvasive therapeutic method to improve bone regeneration. However, the osteogenic effect of SMF on human bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in 3DP scaffolds, as well as its potential mechanism, are unclear. In this study, the osteogenic effect of SMF on hBMSCs in a 3DP scaffold was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the potential mechanism for promoting osteogenesis was investigated by proteomic analysis. The results showed that SMF promoted osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro. A total of 185 differential proteins were identified under SMF conditions by proteomic analysis. The osteogenic effect might be associated with bone morphogenetic protein-Smad1/5/8-signaling pathway and increased transport of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 to the nucleus by up-regulating Smad4 under SMF conditions. The in vivo experiment showed that bone regeneration and osseointegration was enhanced by SMF in the rat model of bone defect. In conclusion, moderate SMF was a safe and effective method for enhancing osteogenesis in 3DP scaffolds in vitro and in vivo.-He, Y., Yu, L., Liu, J., Li, Y., Wu, Y., Huang, Z., Wu, D., Wang, H., Wu, Z., Qiu, G.

https://openalex.org/W2914225241,"Endothelial dysfunction is induced by inflammatory mediators including multiple G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. However, the GPCR signaling pathways that promote endothelial dysfunction are incompletely understood. We previously showed that thrombin promotes endothelial barrier disruption through autophosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via a non-canonical transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase-1-binding protein-1 (TAB1) and TAB2-dependent pathway rather than the canonical three-tiered kinase cascade. Here, we sought to determine whether other GPCR agonists stimulate p38 MAPK activation via this non-canonical pathway in human endothelial cells derived from different vascular beds. Using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), HUVEC-derived EA.hy926 cells, and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs), we found that both non-canonical and canonical p38 activation pathways components are expressed in these various endothelial cell types, including TAB3, a structurally-related TAB2 homolog. Moreover, multiple GPCRs agonists, including thrombin, histamine, prostaglandin E2, and ADP, stimulated robust p38 autophosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of the upstream MAPKs MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MKK6, was virtually undetectable, indicating that non-canonical p38 activation may exist for other GPCRs. Indeed, in EA.hy926 cells, thrombin- and histamine-stimulated p38 activation depended on TAB1-TAB2, whereas in primary HUVECs, both TAB1-TAB2 and TAB1-TAB3 were required for p38 activation. In HDMECs, thrombin-induced p38 activation depended on TAB1-TAB3, but histamine-induced p38 activation required TAB1-TAB2. Moreover, thrombin- and histamine-stimulated interleukin-6 production required both TAB1-TAB2 and TAB1-TAB3 in HUVEC. We conclude that multiple GPCR agonists utilize non-canonical TAB1-TAB2 and TAB1-TAB3-dependent p38 activation to promote endothelial inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2911993832,"Professional sporting organisations invest considerable resources collecting and analysing data in order to better understand the factors that influence performance. Recent advances in non-invasive technologies, such as global positioning systems (GPS), mean that large volumes of data are now readily available to coaches and sport scientists. However analysing such data can be challenging, particularly when sample sizes are small and data sets contain multiple highly correlated variables, as is often the case in a sporting context. Multicollinearity in particular, if not treated appropriately, can be problematic and might lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper we present a novel 'leave one variable out' (LOVO) partial least squares correlation analysis (PLSCA) methodology, designed to overcome the problem of multicollinearity, and show how this can be used to identify the training load (TL) variables that influence most 'end fitness' in young rugby league players.The accumulated TL of sixteen male professional youth rugby league players (17.7 ± 0.9 years) was quantified via GPS, a micro-electrical-mechanical-system (MEMS), and players' session-rating-of-perceived-exertion (sRPE) over a 6-week pre-season training period. Immediately prior to and following this training period, participants undertook a 30-15 intermittent fitness test (30-15IFT), which was used to determine a players 'starting fitness' and 'end fitness'. In total twelve TL variables were collected, and these along with 'starting fitness' as a covariate were regressed against 'end fitness'. However, considerable multicollinearity in the data (VIF >1000 for nine variables) meant that the multiple linear regression (MLR) process was unstable and so we developed a novel LOVO PLSCA adaptation to quantify the relative importance of the predictor variables and thus minimise multicollinearity issues. As such, the LOVO PLSCA was used as a tool to inform and refine the MLR process.The LOVO PLSCA identified the distance accumulated at very-high speed (>7 m·s-1) as being the most important TL variable to influence improvement in player fitness, with this variable causing the largest decrease in singular value inertia (5.93). When included in a refined linear regression model, this variable, along with 'starting fitness' as a covariate, explained 73% of the variance in v30-15IFT 'end fitness' (p<0.001) and eliminated completely any multicollinearity issues.The LOVO PLSCA technique appears to be a useful tool for evaluating the relative importance of predictor variables in data sets that exhibit considerable multicollinearity. When used as a filtering tool, LOVO PLSCA produced a MLR model that demonstrated a significant relationship between 'end fitness' and the predictor variable 'accumulated distance at very-high speed' when 'starting fitness' was included as a covariate. As such, LOVO PLSCA may be a useful tool for sport scientists and coaches seeking to analyse data sets obtained using GPS and MEMS technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2912114435,"Atg101 is an autophagy-related gene identified in worms, flies, mice, and mammals, which encodes a protein that functions in autophagosome formation by associating with the ULK1-Atg13-Fip200 complex. In the last few years, the critical role of Atg101 in autophagy has been well-established through biochemical studies and the determination of its protein structure. However, Atg101's physiological role, both during development and in adulthood, remains less understood. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of an Atg101 loss-of-function mutant in Drosophila and report on the roles of Atg101 in maintaining tissue homeostasis in both adult brains and midguts. We observed that homozygous or hemizygous Atg101 mutants were semi-lethal, with only some of them surviving into adulthood. Both developmental and starvation-induced autophagy processes were defective in the Atg101 mutant animals, and Atg101 mutant adult flies had a significantly shorter lifespan and displayed a mobility defect. Moreover, we observed the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in Atg101 mutant brains, indicating a neuronal defect. Interestingly, Atg101 mutant adult midguts were shorter and thicker and exhibited abnormal morphology with enlarged enterocytes. Detailed analysis also revealed that the differentiation from intestinal stem cells to enterocytes was impaired in these midguts. Cell type–specific rescue experiments disclosed that Atg101 had a function in enterocytes and limited their growth. In summary, the results of our study indicate that Drosophila Atg101 is essential for tissue homeostasis in both adult brains and midguts. We propose that Atg101 may have a role in age-related processes."

Projecting mortality trend can provide valuable tools for policy makers and planners. In this article, we have estimated the trend of non-communicable disease mortality during 2001-2015 and have projected it until 2030 at national and subnational levels in Iran.The data employed was gathered from the Iranian death registration system and using the Spatio-temporal model, the trends of 4 major categories of non-communicable diseases (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, asthma and COPD, and diabetes) by 2030 were projected at the national and subnational levels.The results indicated that age standardized mortality rate for cancers, CVDs, and Asthma and COPD will continue to decrease in both sexes (cancers: from 81.8 in 2015 to 45.2 in 2030, CVDs: 307.3 to 173.0, and Asthma and COPD: from 52.1 to 46.6); however, in terms of diabetes, there is a steady trend in both sexes at national level (from 16.6 to 16.5). Age standardized mortality rates for cancers and CVDs, in males and females, were high in all provinces in 2001. The variation between the provinces is clearer in 2015, and it is expected to significantly decrease in all provinces by 2030.Generally, the age standardized mortality rate from NCDs will decrease by 2030. Of course, given the experience of the past two decades in Iran, believing that the mortality rate will decrease may not be an easy notion to understand. However hard to believe, this decrease may be the result of better management of risk factors and early detection of patients due to more comprehensive care in all segments of society, as well as improved literacy and awareness across the country."

In this study, we conducted a demographic analysis of this species at 30, 35 and 40°C, combining deterministic and stochastic approaches. The net reproductive rate, the intrinsic rate of increase, the finite rate of increase and the doubling time did not differ significantly between 30 and 35°C, while at 40°C we detected negative values of the intrinsic rate of increase and the doubling time. The Briere model fit the data well with respect to the intrinsic rate of increase. Females of roughly 63, 42 and 21 days old reached their maximum reproductive potential at 30, 35 and 40°C, respectively. The stochastic models of this study allowed for checking model fit and the characterization of the most suitable distribution for each component of the process. We expect these results to have bearing on the management of T. granarium since they could be combined with models related to international trade and climatic change, alerting specialists towards early detection strategies against this species."
https://openalex.org/W2914551689,"Aortic distensibility can be calculated using semi-automated methods to segment the aortic lumen on cine CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) images. However, these methods require visual quality control and manual localization of the region of interest (ROI) of ascending (AA) and proximal descending (PDA) aorta, which limit the analysis in large-scale population-based studies. Using 5100 scans from UK Biobank, this study sought to develop and validate a fully automated method to 1) detect and locate the ROIs of AA and PDA, and 2) provide a quality control mechanism.The automated AA and PDA detection-localization algorithm followed these steps: 1) foreground segmentation; 2) detection of candidate ROIs by Circular Hough Transform (CHT); 3) spatial, histogram and shape feature extraction for candidate ROIs; 4) AA and PDA detection using Random Forest (RF); 5) quality control based on RF detection probability. To provide the ground truth, overall image quality (IQ = 0-3 from poor to good) and aortic locations were visually assessed by 13 observers. The automated algorithm was trained on 1200 scans and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used to calculate the agreement between ground truth and automatically detected ROIs.The automated algorithm was tested on 3900 scans. Detection accuracy was 99.4% for AA and 99.8% for PDA. Aorta localization showed excellent agreement with the ground truth, with DSC ≥ 0.9 in 94.8% of AA (DSC = 0.97 ± 0.04) and 99.5% of PDA cases (DSC = 0.98 ± 0.03). AA×PDA detection probabilities could discriminate scans with IQ ≥ 1 from those severely corrupted by artefacts (AUC = 90.6%). If scans with detection probability < 0.75 were excluded (350 scans), the algorithm was able to correctly detect and localize AA and PDA in all the remaining 3550 scans (100% accuracy).The proposed method for automated AA and PDA localization was extremely accurate and the automatically derived detection probabilities provided a robust mechanism to detect low quality scans for further human review. Applying the proposed localization and quality control techniques promises at least a ten-fold reduction in human involvement without sacrificing any accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2911652157,"Inhibitors of the activin receptor signaling pathway (IASPs) have become candidate therapeutics for sarcopenia and bone remodeling disorders because of their ability to increase muscle and bone mass. However, IASPs utilizing activin type IIA and IIB receptors are also potent stimulators of erythropoiesis, a feature that may restrict their usage to anemic patients because of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Based on the endogenous TGF-β superfamily antagonist follistatin (FST), a molecule in the IASP class, FSTΔHBS-mFc, was generated and tested in both ovariectomized and naive BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In ovariectomized mice, FSTΔHBS-mFc therapy dose-dependently increased cancellous bone mass up to 42% and improved bone microstructural indices. For the highest dosage of FSTΔHBS-mFc (30 mg/kg, 2 times/wk), the increase in cancellous bone mass was similar to that observed with parathyroid hormone therapy (1-34, 80 µg/kg, 5 times/wk). Musculus quadriceps femoris mass dose-dependently increased up to 21% in ovariectomized mice. In both ovariectomized and naive mice, FSTΔHBS-mFc therapy did not influence red blood cell count or hematocrit or hemoglobin levels. If the results are reproduced, a human FSTΔHBS-mFc version could be applicable in patients with musculoskeletal conditions irrespective of hematocrit status.-Lodberg, A., van der Eerden, B. C.

Transitioning from a few discovery experiments to quantitative analyses on hundreds of samples requires significant resources both to develop sensitive and specific methods as well as analyze them in a high-throughput manner. To aid these efforts, we developed a workflow using data acquired from discovery proteomic experiments, retention time prediction, and standard-flow chromatography to rapidly develop targeted proteomic assays. We demonstrated this workflow by developing MRM assays to quantify proteins of multiple metabolic pathways from multiple microbes under different experimental conditions. With this workflow, one can also target peptides in scheduled/dynamic acquisition methods from a shotgun proteomic dataset downloaded from online repositories, validate with appropriate control samples or standard peptides, and begin analyzing hundreds of samples in only a few minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2913307067,"NADH (NAD+) is an essential metabolite involved in various cellular biochemical processes. The regulation of NAD+ metabolism is incompletely understood. Here, using budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we established an NAD+ intermediate–specific genetic system to identify factors that regulate the de novo branch of NAD+ biosynthesis. We found that a mutant strain (mac1Δ) lacking Mac1, a copper-sensing transcription factor that activates copper transport genes during copper deprivation, exhibits increases in quinolinic acid (QA) production and NAD+ levels. Similar phenotypes were also observed in the hst1Δ strain, deficient in the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Hst1, which inhibits de novo NAD+ synthesis by repressing BNA gene expression when NAD+ is abundant. Interestingly, the mac1Δ and hst1Δ mutants shared a similar NAD+ metabolism–related gene expression profile, and deleting either MAC1 or HST1 de-repressed the BNA genes. ChIP experiments with the BNA2 promoter indicated that Mac1 works with Hst1-containing repressor complexes to silence BNA expression. The connection of Mac1 and BNA expression suggested that copper stress affects de novo NAD+ synthesis, and we show that copper stress induces both BNA expression and QA production. Moreover, nicotinic acid inhibited de novo NAD+ synthesis through Hst1-mediated BNA repression, hindered the reuptake of extracellular QA, and thereby reduced de novo NAD+ synthesis. In summary, we have identified and characterized novel NAD+ homeostasis factors. These findings will expand our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2913873205,"The Gln233Arg (A>G; rs1137101) polymorphism of the leptin receptor gene (LEPR) has been investigated extensively and is reported to be associated with different metabolic states. In this investigation, we aimed to study the frequency of Gln233Arg genotypes and alleles in a group of Saudi women stratified by their body mass index (BMI), to correlate the LEPR genotypes with variations in anthropometric, lipid and hormonal parameters and to investigate conformational and structural variations in the mutant LEPR using molecular dynamic (MD) investigations. The study group included 122 Saudi women (normal weight = 60; obese = 62) attending the clinics for a routine checkup. Anthropometric data: height, weight, waist and hip circumference were recorded and fasting serum sample was used to estimate glucose, lipids, ghrelin, leptin and insulin. BMI, W/H ratio, and HOMA-IR values were calculated. Whole blood sample was used to extract DNA; exon 6 of the LEPR gene was amplified by PCR and sequencing was conducted on an ABI 3100 Avant Genetic Analyser. Molecular Dynamic Simulation studies were carried out using different softwares. The results showed the presence of all three genotypes of Gln233Arg in Saudi women, but the frequencies were significantly different when compared to reports from some populations. No differences were seen in the genotype and allele frequencies between the normal weight and obese women. Stratification by the genotypes showed significantly higher BMI, waist and hip circumference, leptin, insulin, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR and lower ghrelin levels in obese women carrying the GG genotype. Even in the normal weight group, individuals with GG genotype had higher BMI, waist and hip circumference and significantly lower ghrelin levels. The MD studies showed a significant effect of the Gln/Arg substitution on the conformation, flexibility, root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg) values, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) and number of inter- and intra-molecular H-bonds. The results suggest that the structural changes brought about by the mutation, influence the signaling pathways by some unknown mechanism, which may be contributing to the abnormalities seen in the individuals carrying the G allele of rs1137101."

https://openalex.org/W2911492173,"Serum amyloid A (SAA), a potent inflammatory mediator, and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), an intracellular signaling kinase, are increased by diabetes. The aims were to elucidate: 1) a JAK2-mediated pathway for increased SAA in the kidneys of diabetic mice; 2) a JAK2-SAA pathway for inflammation in podocytes.Akita diabetic mice (129S6) with podocyte JAK2 overexpression and angiotensin II infusion (4 weeks) were given a JAK1,2 inhibitor (LY03103801, 3 mg/kg/day orally for the last two weeks). Kidneys were immunostained for SAA isoform 3 (SAA3). SAA3 knockout and control mouse podocytes were exposed to advanced glycation end products (AGE) or exogenous SAA with JAK2 inhibition (Tyrphostin AG 490, 50μM). JAK2 activity (phosphorylation, Western blot, 1 hour) and mRNA for SAA3 and associated inflammatory genes (Cxcl5, Ccl2, and Ccl5) were measured by RT-PCR (20 hours).SAA3 protein was present throughout the diabetic kidney, and podocyte JAK2 overexpression increased tubulointerstitial SAA3 compared to wild type diabetic controls, 43% versus 14% (p = 0.007); JAK1,2 inhibition attenuated the increase in SAA3 to 15% (p = 0.003). Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (r = 0.49, p = 0.03), mesangial index (r = 0.64, p = 0.001), and glomerulosclerosis score (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) were associated with SAA3 immunostaining scores across mouse groups. Exposing podocytes to AGE or exogenous SAA increased JAK2 activity within one hour and mRNA for associated inflammatory genes after 20 hours. JAK2 inhibition reduced SAA3 mRNA expression in podocytes exposed to AGE or SAA. SAA3 knockout podocytes had >85% lower AGE-induced inflammatory genes.JAK1,2 inhibition reduced SAA and histological features of DKD in podocyte JAK2-overexpressing mice. In podocytes exposed to a diabetes-like condition, JAK2 inhibition reduced expression of SAA, while SAA knockout blocked expression of associated pro-inflammatory mediators. SAA may promote JAK2-dependent inflammation in the diabetic kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2912393592,"Background This study evaluated the feasibility of achieving high response rates in stage II or III breast cancer by tailoring neoadjuvant therapy using clinical and histopathological features and the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score. Genomic determinants of response and resistance were also explored. Patients and outcome measures Fifty-one patients were enrolled. The primary cohort comprised 40 patients: 15 human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-amplified; 15 triple-negative (TNBC); and ten hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-non-amplified tumours; with recurrence scores ≥25. Patients were treated with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by nab-paclitaxel, with the addition of trastuzumab if HER2-amplified. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast. Pre- and post-treatment tumour samples underwent variant burden, gene and gene pathway, mutational signature profile and clonal evolution analyses. Results The pCR rates were: overall 55% (n = 22), HER2-amplified 80% (n = 12), triple-negative 46% (n = 7) and HR-positive, HER2-non-amplified 30% (n = 3). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included febrile neutropenia (8%), neutropenia (18%), sensory neuropathy (5%), deranged transaminases (5%), fatigue (2%), diarrhoea (2%), and pneumothorax (2%). Molecular analyses demonstrated strong similarities between residual disease and matched primary tumour. ATM signalling pathway alterations and the presence of a COSMIC Signature 3 implied the majority of tumours contained some form of homologous repair deficiency. ATM pathway alterations were identified in the subset of TNBC patients who did not achieve pCR; Signature 3 was present in both pCR and non-pCR subgroups. Clonal evolution analyses demonstrated both persistence and emergence of chemoresistant clones. Conclusions This treatment regime resulted in a high rate of pCR, demonstrating that tailored neoadjuvant therapy using a genomic recurrence score is feasible and warrants further investigation. Molecular analysis revealed few commonalities between patients. For TNBC future clinical gains will require precision medicine, potentially using DNA sequencing to identify specific targets for individuals with resistant disease.

https://openalex.org/W2913148542,"We previously showed that MMP-9 contributes to CLL pathology by regulating cell survival and migration and that, when present at high levels, MMP-9 induces cell arrest. To further explore the latter function, we studied whether MMP-9 influences the gene-expression profile in CLL. Microarray analyses rendered 131 differentially expressed genes in MEC-1 cells stably transfected with MMP-9 (MMP-9-cells) versus cells transfected with empty vector (Mock-cells). Ten out of twelve selected genes were also differentially expressed in MEC-1 cells expressing the catalytically inactive MMP-9MutE mutant (MMP-9MutE-cells). Incubation of primary CLL cells with MMP-9 or MMP-9MutE also regulated gene and protein expression, including CD99, CD226, CD52, and CD274. Because CD99 is involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration, we selected CD99 for functional and mechanistic studies. The link between MMP-9 and CD99 was reinforced with MMP-9 gene silencing studies, which resulted in CD99 upregulation. CD99 gene silencing significantly reduced CLL cell adhesion, chemotaxis and transendothelial migration, while CD99 overexpression increased cell migration. Mechanistic analyses indicated that MMP-9 downregulated CD99 via binding to α4β1 integrin and subsequent inactivation of the Sp1 transcription factor. This MMP-9-induced mechanism is active in CLL lymphoid tissues, since CD99 expression and Sp1 phosphorylation was lower in bone marrow-derived CLL cells than in their peripheral blood counterparts. Our study establishes a new gene regulatory function for MMP-9 in CLL. It also identifies CD99 as an MMP-9 target and a novel contributor to CLL cell adhesion, migration and arrest. CD99 thus constitutes a new therapeutic target in CLL, complementary to MMP-9."
https://openalex.org/W2911624673,"Azospirillum brasilense is one of the most studied species of diverse agronomic plants worldwide. The benefits conferred to plants inoculated with Azospirillum have been primarily attributed to its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen and synthesize phytohormones, especially indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The principal pathway for IAA synthesis involves the intermediate metabolite indole pyruvic acid. Successful colonization of plants by Azospirillum species is fundamental to the ability of these bacteria to promote the beneficial effects observed in plants. Biofilm formation is an essential step in this process and involves interactions with the host plant. In this study, the tyrR gene was cloned, and the translated product was observed to exhibit homology to TyrR protein, a NtrC/NifA-type activator. Structural studies of TyrR identified three putative domains, including a domain containing binding sites for aromatic amino acids in the N-terminus, a central AAA+ ATPase domain, and a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif domain in the C-terminus, which binds DNA sequences in promoter-operator regions. In addition, a bioinformatic analysis of promoter sequences in A. brasilense Sp7 genome revealed that putative promoters encompass one to three TyrR boxes in genes predicted to be regulated by TyrR. To gain insight into the phenotypes regulated by TyrR, a tyrR-deficient strain derived from A. brasilense Sp7, named A. brasilense 2116 and a complemented 2116 strain harboring a plasmid carrying the tyrR gene were constructed. The observed phenotypes indicated that the putative transcriptional regulator TyrR is involved in biofilm production and is responsible for regulating the utilization of D-alanine as carbon source. In addition, TyrR was observed to be absolutely required for transcriptional regulation of the gene dadA encoding a D-amino acid dehydrogenase. The data suggested that TyrR may play a major role in the regulation of genes encoding a glucosyl transferase, essential signaling proteins, and amino acids transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2912866253,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive tumor with propensity to metastasize and poor treatment options. Improving treatment options would be impactful; thus, finding a tumor-specific cell surface protein with metastasis promoting functions that could be knocked out was the goal of this study. The Otoconin 90 gene (OC90), frequently amplified in tumors on chromosome 8q24.22, was identified as a potential therapeutic candidate. Normally OC90 is expressed in the cochlea with no known function in other normal tissues. In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-tumor RNAseq cohorts revealed that OC90 is expressed in many tumor types at high prevalence and genomic amplification is associated with the elevated mRNA expression. In vitro assays in TNBC cell lines revealed OC90 expression with control over cell viability, apoptosis and invasion. RNA-seq analysis of OC90-siRNA knockdown and OC90-overexpression in BT20, BT549, HCC38 cell lines identified co-expressed transcripts, HMGA2, POLE2 and TRIB3. Altered expression of HMGA2, POLE2 and TRIB3 was predictive of survival among members of the Metabric breast cancer cohort. Thus, OC90 represents a potential therapeutic target whose knockdown could improve the treatment of TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2914650019,"The Earth's geomagnetic field (GMF) is known to influence magnetoreceptive creatures, from bacteria to mammals as a sensory cue or a physiological modulator, despite it is largely thought that humans cannot sense the GMF. Here, we show that humans sense the GMF to orient their direction toward food in a self-rotatory chair experiment. Starved men, but not women, significantly oriented toward the ambient/modulated magnetic north or east, directions which had been previously food-associated, without any other helpful cues, including sight and sound. The orientation was reproduced under blue light but was abolished under a blindfold or a longer wavelength light (> 500 nm), indicating that blue light is necessary for magnetic orientation. Importantly, inversion of the vertical component of the GMF resulted in orientation toward the magnetic south and blood glucose levels resulting from food appeared to act as a motivator for sensing a magnetic field direction. The results demonstrate that male humans sense GMF in a blue light-dependent manner and suggest that the geomagnetic orientations are mediated by an inclination compass."
https://openalex.org/W2911598189,"For studying cancer and genetic diseases, the issue of identifying high correlation genes from high-dimensional data is an important problem. It is a great challenge to select relevant biomarkers from gene expression data that contains some important correlation structures, and some of the genes can be divided into different groups with a common biological function, chromosomal location or regulation. In this paper, we propose a penalized accelerated failure time model CHR-DE using a non-convex regularization (local search) with differential evolution (global search) in a wrapper-embedded memetic framework. The complex harmonic regularization (CHR) can approximate to the combination [Formula: see text] and ℓq (1 ≤ q < 2) for selecting biomarkers in group. And differential evolution (DE) is utilized to globally optimize the CHR's hyperparameters, which make CHR-DE achieve strong capability of selecting groups of genes in high-dimensional biological data. We also developed an efficient path seeking algorithm to optimize this penalized model. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and three gene expression datasets: breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. The experimental results demonstrate that CHR-DE is a more effective tool for feature selection and learning prediction."

This study examined modification of the association between global DNA methylation and breast cancer risk by reproductive characteristics. A population-based case-control study assessed reproductive history in an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Global DNA methylation was measured from white blood cell DNA using luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) and pyrosequencing assay (long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among 1 070 breast cancer cases and 1 110 population-based controls. Effect modification was assessed on additive and multiplicative scales. LUMA methylation was associated with elevated breast cancer risk across all strata (comparing the highest to the lowest quartile), but estimates were higher among women with age at menarche ≤12 years (OR = 2.87, 95%CI = 1.96-4.21) compared to >12 years (OR = 1.66, 95%CI = 1.20-2.29). We observed a 2-fold increase in the LUMA methylation-breast cancer association among women with age at first birth >23 years (OR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.90-3.62) versus ≤23 years (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.84-2.05). No modification was evident for parity or lactation. Age at menarche and age at first birth may be modifiers of the association between global DNA methylation and breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2913726992,"Two complementary measurement systems—built upon an autonomous floating craft and a tethered balloon—for lake research and monitoring are presented. The autonomous vehicle was assembled on a catamaran for stability, and is capable of handling a variety of instrumentation for in situ and near-surface measurements. The catamaran hulls, each equipped with a small electric motor, support rigid decks for arranging equipment. An electric generator provides full autonomy for about 8 h. The modular power supply and instrumentation data management systems are housed in two boxes, which enable rapid setup. Due to legal restrictions in Switzerland (where the craft is routinely used), the platform must be observed from an accompanying boat while in operation. Nevertheless, the control system permits fully autonomous operation, with motion controlled by speed settings and waypoints, as well as obstacle detection. On-board instrumentation is connected to a central hub for data storage, with real-time monitoring of measurements from the accompanying boat. Measurements from the floating platform are complemented by mesoscale imaging from an instrument package attached to a He-filled balloon. The aerial package records thermal and RGB imagery, and transmits it in real-time to a ground station. The balloon can be tethered to the autonomous catamaran or to the accompanying boat. Missions can be modified according to imagery and/or catamaran measurements. Illustrative results showing the surface thermal variations of Lake Geneva demonstrate the versatility of the combined floating platform/balloon imagery system setup for limnological investigations."

We examined their internal consistency, tested the underlying subscale structure by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), verified construct validity by testing associations with quality-related factors (e.g., child-caregiver ratio), and checked concurrent validity of the instruments' total scores. We found high internal consistency of the instruments at the full scale level and moderate to high at the subscale/domain level. CFA showed high factor loadings, but goodness of fit statistics were low. Construct validity results varied from low to very low depending on the quality-related factor, and concurrent validity from low to very high depending on the instruments compared. This validity exercise provides useful information for policy-makers and researchers interested in using these instruments in the Ecuadorian context or elsewhere in the region. The findings will also inform future research and development of affordable and culturally-appropriate tools for monitoring process quality in child care centers in Latin American countries."
https://openalex.org/W2914256941,"Long-range associations between enhancers and their target gene promoters have been shown to play critical roles in executing genome function. Recent variations of chromosome capture technology have revealed a comprehensive view of intra- and interchromosomal contacts between specific genomic sites. The locus control region of the β-globin genes (β-LCR) is a super-enhancer that is capable of activating all of the β-like globin genes within the locus in cis through physical interaction by forming DNA loops. CTCF helps to mediate loop formation between LCR-HS5 and 3’HS1 in the human β-globin locus, in this way thought to contribute to the formation of a “chromatin hub”. The β-globin locus is also in close physical proximity to other erythrocyte-specific genes located long distances away on the same chromosome. In this case, erythrocyte-specific genes gather together at a shared “transcription factory” for co-transcription. Theoretically, enhancers could also activate target gene promoters at the identical loci, yet on different chromosomes in trans, a phenomenon originally described as transvection in Drosophilla. Although close physical proximity has been reported for the β-LCR and the β-like globin genes when integrated at the mouse homologous loci in trans, their structural and functional interactions were found to be rare, possibly because of a lack of suitable regulatory elements that might facilitate such trans interactions. Therefore, we re-evaluated presumptive transvection-like enhancer-promoter communication by introducing CTCF binding sites and erythrocyte-specific transcription units into both LCR-enhancer and β-promoter alleles, each inserted into the mouse ROSA26 locus on separate chromosomes. Following cross-mating of mice to place the two mutant loci at the identical chromosomal position and into active chromation in trans, their transcriptional output was evaluated. The results demonstrate that there was no significant functional association between the LCR and the β-globin gene in trans even in this idealized experimental context."

Our aim was to develop a new monoclonal antibody against D-dimer with a proper specificity, and estimating its suitability using in a latex agglutination diagnostic test. Monoclonal antibodies were generated using hybridoma technology. Their titer was determined by a self-developed ELISA method. The cross-reactions of the antibodies were tested. Characterization of the epitope specificity of a selected antibody was performed through digestion of D-dimer followed by Western blotting. The amino acid sequences of the active antigen fragments were determined. According to the ELISA results, 38 cell groups were constated as antibody-producing hybridomas, among them 7 gave raised titer of antibody and were cloned. Based on the cross-reaction analysis, none of the antibodies gave cross-reaction with fibrin-E and fibrinogen-E fragments but reacted with fibrin D and fibrinogen D fragments. A low cross-reaction was showed with fibrinogen and fibrin X and Y. Contrary to the others, antibody 2B9 gave no cross-reaction with fibrinogen and reacted weakly with fibrin X and Y fragments. According to the epitope analysis the antibody 2B9 binds to amino acids 94-99 and to amino acids 140-147 on the beta chain and it recognizes the amino acids 23-32 and 93-98 on the gamma chain of D-dimer. Considering the characteristics of the above mentioned monoclonal antibody 2B9, we found that it is suitable to be a basis for a D-dimer diagnostic test with proper specificity."

The likelihood function and the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) are obtained by stochastic differential equation and the Girsanov theorem. To capture the heteroscedasticity of volatility, we consider a stochastic volatility model. The efficiency of the proposed estimators is illustrated by a simulation study.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is the most frequent and potentially lethal complication of myocardial infarction, but the impact of mono nuclear cells on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia is still not clear.We aimed to characterize the influence of splenic mononuclear cell populations on ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction.We assessed electrical vulnerability in vivo in mice with left ventricular cryoinfarction 14 days after injury and intramyocardial injection of specific subpopulations of mononuclear cells (MNCs) (CD11b-positive cells, Sca-1-positive cells, early endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs)). As positive control group we used embryonic cardiomyocytes (eCMs). Epicardial mapping was performed for analysing conduction velocities in the border zone. Left ventricular function was quantified by echocardiography and left heart catheterization.In vivo pacing protocols induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 30% of non-infarcted mice. In contrast, monomorphic or polymorphic VT could be evoked in 94% of infarcted and vehicle-injected mice (p<0.01). Only transplantation of eCMs prevented post-infarction VT and improved conduction velocities in the border zone in accordance to increased expression of connexin 43. Cryoinfarction resulted in a broad aggravation of left ventricular function. All transplanted cell types augmented left ventricular function to a similar extent.Transplantation of different MNC populations after myocardial infarction improves left ventricular function similar to effects of eCMs. Prevention of inducible ventricular arrhythmia is only seen after transplantation of eCMs."

Our aim was to develop a risk score to identify stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) patients undergoing PCI who would benefit or suffer from extending DAPT beyond 6 months.Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who completed 6 months of DAPT following PCI. Predictors of ischaemic and bleeding events for the 6-12 month period post-PCI were identified and a risk score was developed to estimate the likelihood of benefiting from extending DAPT beyond 6 months. Incidence of mortality, ischaemic and bleeding events for patients treated with DAPT for 6 vs. 6-12 months, was compared, stratified by strata of the risk score.The study included 2,699 patients. Over 6 months' follow up, there were 78 (2.9%) ischaemic and 43 (1.6%) bleeding events. Four variables (heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%, left main or three vessel CAD, status post (s/p) PCI and s/p stroke) predicted ischemic events, two variables (age>75, haemoglobin <10 g/dL) predicted bleeding. In the lower stratum of the risk score, 6-12 months of treatment with DAPT resulted in increased bleeding (p = 0.045) with no decrease in ischaemic events. In the upper stratum, 6-12 months DAPT was associated with reduced ischaemic events (p = 0.029), with no increase in bleeding.In a population of SCAD patients who completed 6 months of DAPT, a risk score for subsequent ischaemic and bleeding events identified patients likely to benefit from continuing or stopping DAPT."
