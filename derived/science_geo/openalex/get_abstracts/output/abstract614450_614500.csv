https://openalex.org/W3100256087,"Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera-electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray-emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos."

Due to recent findings of microbial involvement in other psychiatric disorders like autism and depression, a role of the gut microbiota in ADHD pathogenesis is assumed but has not yet been investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of 14 male ADHD patients (mean age: 11.9 yrs.) and 17 male controls (mean age: 13.1 yrs.) was examined via next generation sequencing of 16S rDNA and analyzed for diversity and biomarkers. We found that the microbial diversity (alpha diversity) was significantly decreased in ADHD patients compared to controls (pShannon = 0.036) and that the composition (beta diversity) differed significantly between patients and controls (pANOSIM = 0.033, pADONIS = 0.006, pbetadisper = 0.002). In detail, the bacterial family Prevotellacae was associated with controls, while patients with ADHD showed elevated levels of Bacteroidaceae, and both Neisseriaceae and Neisseria spec. were found as possible biomarkers for juvenile ADHD. Our results point to a possible link of certain microbiota with ADHD, with Neisseria spec. being a very promising ADHD-associated candidate. This finding provides the basis for a systematic, longitudinal assessment of the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD, yielding promising potential for both prevention and therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2867752270,"The well-known genotypic and phenotypic diversity of G. vaginalis resulted in its classification into at least four subgroups (clades) with diverse genomic properties. To evaluate the virulence potential of G. vaginalis subgroups, we analyzed the virulence-related phenotypic characteristics of 14 isolates of clade 1, 12 isolates of clade 2, 8 isolates of clade 4 assessing their in vitro ability to grow as a biofilm, produce the toxin vaginolysin, and express sialidase activity. Significant differences in VLY production were found (p = 0.023), but further analysis of clade pairs did not confirm this finding. The amount of biofim did not differ significantly among the clades. Analysis of sialidase activity indicated statistically significant differences among the clades (p < 0.001). Production of active recombinant G. vaginalis sialidase demonstrated the link between the sld gene and enzymatic activity, which may be differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. Statistical classification analysis (random forests algorithm) showed that G. vaginalis clades could be best defined by the profiles of two phenotypic characteristics: sialidase activity and vaginolysin production. The results of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering suggested that all isolates can be subgrouped into three clusters, the structures of which are determined based on phenotypic characteristics of the isolates. Clade 4 was the most homogenous group, as all isolates were found in the same cluster, which is characterized by low production of all studied virulence factors. Clade 2 isolates were mainly distributed between two clusters, whereas clade 1 isolates were found in all three clusters that were characterized by a distinct profile of phenotypic characteristics. Our findings suggest that G. vaginalis subgroups with different virulence potential might play distinct roles in vaginal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2871210587,"Introduction Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Macrophages are fundamental components of post-MI inflammation. Pro-inflammatory macrophages can lead to adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure while anti-inflammatory/reparative macrophages enhance tissue healing. Shifting the balance between pro-inflammatory and reparative macrophages post-MI is a novel therapeutic strategy. Azithromycin (AZM), a commonly used macrolide antibiotic, polarizes macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, as shown in animal and human studies. We hypothesized that AZM modulates post-MI inflammation and improves cardiac recovery. Methods and results Male WT mice (C57BL/6, 6–8 weeks old) were treated with either oral AZM (160 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (control) starting 3 days prior to MI and continued to day 7 post-MI. We observed a significant reduction in mortality with AZM therapy. AZM-treated mice showed a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory (CD45+/Ly6G-/F4-80+/CD86+) and increase in anti-inflammatory (CD45+/Ly6G-/F4-80+/CD206+) macrophages, decreasing the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory macrophage ratio in the heart and peripheral blood as assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Macrophage changes were associated with a significant decline in pro- and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies confirmed the ability of AZM to shift macrophage response towards an anti-inflammatory state under hypoxia/reperfusion stress. Additionally, AZM treatment was associated with a distinct decrease in neutrophil count due to apoptosis, a known signal for shifting macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype. Finally, AZM treatment improved cardiac recovery, scar size, and angiogenesis. Conclusion Azithromycin plays a cardioprotective role in the early phase post-MI through attenuating inflammation and enhancing cardiac recovery. Post-MI treatment and human translational studies are warranted to examine the therapeutic applications of AZM."
https://openalex.org/W2828995761,"As the sole reproductive female in a honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony, the queen’s health is critical to colony productivity and longevity. Beekeeping operations typically rely on the commercial mass production of queens for colony multiplication, which involves manipulating and isolating the queens by confining them in cages during early development. Using common queen-rearing techniques, this study shows that segregating newly eclosed queens from their worker attendants for 72 hours using queen protector cages has a significant impact on the total amount of gut bacteria carried by those queens compared to queens that have unrestricted access to attendants upon eclosion. Isolated virgin queens sampled immediately after isolation at 4 days post eclosure had significantly more bacteria and a less consistent microbiota composition than their non-isolated peers. Furthermore, this effect lasted into the mating life of queens, since mated queens that had been isolated after emergence and then sampled at 14 days post eclosure also had significantly more microbiota compared to non-isolated mated queens of the same age. The causes and potential impacts of this alteration are not clear and deserve further investigation. This study also verifies earlier findings that honey bee queens lack the core microbiome found within honey bee workers."
https://openalex.org/W2813134247,"Objectives Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction are obstetrical syndromes associated with abnormal placental implantation and changes in the activation status of maternal leukocytes. This study is aimed to determine by a simple, rapid fluorescent assay the changes in maternal serum total cell-free DNA (t-cfDNA) concentrations in women with preeclampsia and those with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Study design A cross-sectional study was conducted measuring maternal serum t-cfDNA concentrations. Women were classified into the following groups: 1) patients with preeclampsia (n = 21); 2) FGR-estimated fetal weight below the 10thpercentile (n = 28); and 3) normal pregnancy (n = 39). Serum samples were directly assayed for t-cfDNA using a rapid fluorescent SYBR Gold assay. Elevated maternal serum t-cfDNA concentrations were defined as a cutoff>850ng/ml. Nonparametric statistics were used for analysis. Results Women with preeclampsia had a higher median maternal serum concentration (802 ng/ml, 400–2272 ng/ml) than women with a normal pregnancy (499 ng/ml, 0–1892 ng/ml, p = 0.004) and those with FGR (484 ng/ml, 72–2187 ng/ml, p = 0.012). Moreover, even patients with FGR <5th percentile and abnormal Doppler had a lower median maternal serum t-cfDNA than those with preeclampsia (median 487 ng/ml, 144–1971 ng/ml, p = 0.022). The median concentration of t-cfDNA did not differ between women with a normal pregnancy and those with FGR (p = 0.54), as well as those with fetuses <5th percentile and abnormal Doppler (p = 0.7). Women with preeclampsia had a higher proportion of elevated t-cfDNA than those with a normal pregnancy (p = 0.015) and patients with FGR (p = 0.025). Conclusions Preeclampsia is associated with higher maternal serum t-cfDNA concentration than normal pregnancy or FGR. This observation may reflect an increased systemic activation of the maternal inflammation, rather than placental; this assumption is supported by the fact that we did not observe a significant change in the maternal serum t-cfDNA in patients with placental-mediated FGR."
https://openalex.org/W2843822617,"Studies of cerebellum-like circuits in fish have demonstrated that synaptic plasticity shapes the motor corollary discharge responses of granule cells into highly-specific predictions of self-generated sensory input. However, the functional significance of such predictions, known as negative images, has not been directly tested. Here we provide evidence for improvements in neural coding and behavioral detection of prey-like stimuli due to negative images. In addition, we find that manipulating synaptic plasticity leads to specific changes in circuit output that disrupt neural coding and detection of prey-like stimuli. These results link synaptic plasticity, neural coding, and behavior and also provide a circuit-level account of how combining external sensory input with internally generated predictions enhances sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2880005582,"Here, we seek to summarize the current understanding of the biochemical and molecular events mediated by visual cycle molecules in the eye. The structures and functions of selected visual cycle proteins and their roles in human retinal diseases are also highlighted. Genetic mutations and malfunctions of these proteins provide etiological evidence that many ocular diseases arise from anomalies of retinoid (vitamin A) metabolism and related visual processes. Genetic retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, Leber's congenital amaurosis, and Stargardt's disease are linked to structural changes in visual cycle proteins. Moreover, recent reports suggest that visual cycle proteins may also play a role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Basic science has laid the groundwork for finding a cure for many of these blindness-causing afflictions, but much work remains. Some translational research projects have advanced to the clinical trial stage, while many others are still in progress, and more are at the ideas stage and remain yet to be tested. Some examples of these studies are discussed. Recent and future progress in our understanding of the visual cycle will inform intervention strategies to preserve human vision and prevent blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2825756920,"The development of diagnostic markers has been a long-standing interest of population geneticists as it allows clarification of taxonomic uncertainties. Historically, there has been much debate on the taxonomic status of species belonging to the Mytilus species complex (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus), and whether they are discrete species. We analysed reference pure specimens of M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, using Restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and identified over 6,000 SNP markers separating the three species unambiguously. We developed a panel of diagnostic SNP markers for the genotyping of Mytilus species complex as well as the identification of hybrids and interspecies introgression events in Mytilus species. We validated a panel of twelve diagnostic SNP markers which can be used for species genotyping. Being able to accurately identify species and hybrids within the Mytilus species complex is important for the selective mussel stock management, the exclusion of invasive species, basic physiology and bio-diversity studies."
https://openalex.org/W2813055229,"Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression and turn-over are regulated via its ubiquitination by the membrane associated RING-CH 1 (MARCH1) E3 ligase. Unexpectedly, we show that MHC II ubiquitination also impacts MHC I. Lack of MARCH1 in B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) resulted in a significant reduction in surface MHC I expression. This decrease was not directly caused by changes in MARCH1 ubiquitination of MHC I but indirectly by altered MHC II trafficking in the absence of its ubiquitination. Deletion of MHC II in March1-/- cells restored normal MHC I surface expression and replacement of wild type MHC II by a variant that could not be ubiquitinated caused a reduction in MHC I expression. Furthermore, these cells displayed inefficient presentation of peptide and protein antigen via MHC I to CD8+ T cells. In summary, we describe an unexpected intersection between MHC I and MHC II such that the surface expression of both molecules are indirectly and directly regulated by MARCH1 ubiquitination, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2828471097,"The effect of endogenous progesterone and/or exogenous pre- or postnatal progesterone application on lung function of preterm infants is poorly defined. While prenatal progesterone substitution may prevent preterm birth, in vitro and in vivo data suggest a benefit of postnatal progesterone replacement on the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for progesterone’s effects are undefined. Numerous factors are involved in lung development, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling: the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) signaling pathway and TGF-β-regulated genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transgelin (TAGLN), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These processes contribute to the development of BPD. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether progesterone could affect TGF-β1-activated Smad signaling and CTGF/transgelin/PAI-1 expression in lung epithelial cells. The pharmacological effect of progesterone on Smad signaling was investigated using a TGF-β1-inducible luciferase reporter and western blotting analysis of phosphorylated Smad2/3 in A549 lung epithelial cells. The regulation of CTGF, transgelin, and PAI-1 expression by progesterone was studied using a promoter-based luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting in the same cell line. While progesterone alone had no direct effect on Smad signaling in lung epithelial cells, it dose-dependently inhibited TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, as shown by luciferase assays and western blotting analysis. Progesterone also antagonized the TGF-β1/Smad-induced upregulation of CTGF, transgelin, and PAI-1 at the promoter, mRNA, and/or protein levels. The present study highlights possible new molecular mechanisms involving progesterone, including inhibition of TGF-β1-activated Smad signaling and TGF-β1-regulated genes involved in BPD pathogenesis, which are likely to attenuate the development of BPD by inhibiting TGF-β1-mediated airway remodeling. Understanding these mechanisms might help to explain the effects of pre- or postnatal application of progesterone on lung diseases of preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2843356123,"Prolong walking is a notable risk factor for work-related lower-limb disorders (WRLLD) in industries such as agriculture, construction, service profession, healthcare and retail works. It is one of the common causes of lower limb fatigue or muscular exhaustion leading to poor balance and fall. Exoskeleton technology is seen as a modern strategy to assist worker’s in these professions to minimize or eliminate the risk of WRLLDs. Exoskeleton has potentials to benefit workers in prolong walking (amongst others) by augmenting their strength, increasing their endurance, and minimizing high muscular activation, resulting in overall work efficiency and productivity. Controlling exoskeleton to achieve this purpose for able-bodied personnel without impeding their natural movement is, however, challenging. In this study, we propose a control strategy that integrates a Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (DUKF) for trajectory generation/prediction of the spatio-temporal features of human walking (i.e. joint position, and velocity, and acceleration) and an impedance cum supervisory controller to enable the exoskeleton to follow this trajectory to synchronize with the human walking. Experiment is conducted with four subjects carrying a load and walking at their normal speed- a typical scenario in industries. EMG signals taken at two muscles: Right Vastus Intermedius (on the thigh) and Right Gastrocnemius (on the calf) indicated reduction in muscular activation during the experiment. The results also show the ability of the control system to predict spatio-temporal features of the pilots’ walking and to enable the exoskeleton to move in concert with the pilot."
https://openalex.org/W2874359668,"Prostate carcinoma contain foci of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, resulting in an increase of androgen-independent neuroendocrine-like (NE) tumor cells, whose number significantly correlates with tumor aggressiveness and thus lower survival rate. Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer cells and a potential role of miRNAs within this process are poorly understood. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. The aim of this project was to identify new genes and miRNAs involved in neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were differentiated to NE-like cancer cells and microarray analyses were performed. Microarray results have been validated for the eight most deregulated mRNAs and microRNAs via qRT-PCR and analyzed with different algorithms to predict new targets for deregulated microRNAs. The induced CyclinD1 gene could be validated as new target gene for the repressed miR-17 family containing miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b via reporter gene assays and Western Blot. Functional analysis of miR-17 family shows a high influence on cell proliferation, colony forming ability and apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Our data demonstrate wide changes in mRNA and microRNA expression during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of LNCaP cells and confirm new mRNA-miRNA interactions with potential roles in NE-transdifferentiation of prostate carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2838287174,"The build-up of diversified and tissue-specific assemblies of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins depends on secreted and cell surface–located molecular arrays that coordinate ECM proteins into discrete designs. The family of small leucine-rich proteins (SLRPs) associates with and dictates the structure of fibrillar collagens, which form the backbone of most ECM types. However, whether SLRPs form complexes with proteins other than collagens is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that heat shock protein 47 (Hsp47), a well-established endoplasmic reticulum–resident collagen chaperone, also binds the SLRPs decorin, lumican, and fibromodulin with affinities comparable with that in the Hsp47–type I collagen interaction. Furthermore, we show that a lack of Hsp47 inhibits the cellular secretion of decorin and lumican.

Here, we wanted to explore whether small leucine-rich proteins (SLRPs) are involved in early collagen biosynthesis in the ER via complex formation with other intracellular collagen–associated proteins. SLRPs are already known to modulate the phenotype of collagen fibrils and their cross-linking in the extracellular space (25Olsson P.O. Gustafsson R. In't Zandt R. Friman T. Maccarana M. Tykesson E.

Such a, yet unknown, mechanism would ensure a proper modulatory SLRP function during the early, intracellular stages of collagen fibrillogenesis (i.e. even before the deposition in extracellular space). In this report, we investigated whether the collagen-associated SLRPs decorin (29Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V.

Far-Western blotting was used to find potential intracellular interactants of decorin, fibromodulin, and lumican. Cell lysate from a chondrocyte-like ATDC5 cell line was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was then incubated with biotinylated recombinant decorin, fibromodulin, or lumican. Although decorin, unlike fibromodulin and lumican, bound to several other proteins (possibly through its chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains), all three SLRPs interacted with a protein around 48–50 kDa (Fig. 1A). The corresponding area on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was analyzed by MS, where five peptides from Hsp47 were found (Fig. S1). Because Hsp47 is an ER-resident collagen chaperone, residing in the same subcellular compartment as the secreted SLRPs, Hsp47–SLRP interactions were validated with further experiments (below). Other proteins identified by MS were either nuclear or cytoskeletal proteins; they were not considered in further analyses. To characterize the SLRP–Hsp47 interactions, co-immunoprecipitations were performed using cell lysates. As endogenous intracellular amounts of SLRPs were not abundant, exogenous purified recombinant decorin, fibromodulin, or lumican (the latter two His-tagged) were added to the cell lysate and immunoprecipitated using decorin antiserum or His tag antibodies. In these assays, Hsp47 precipitated together with all three SLRPs and did not precipitate in the absence of SLRPs (Fig. 1B). To validate our findings, further pulldown assays were also performed, where BSA or recombinant Hsp47 were coupled to magnetic beads, and then these beads were incubated with biotinylated recombinant decorin, fibromodulin, or lumican. In all cases, SLRPs were captured by Hsp47-coated beads but not by BSA-coated beads (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Hsp47 could associate with the investigated SLRPs. To investigate whether the SLRP–Hsp47 interactions are present in intracellular compartments, we used proximity ligation assays using human BJ fibroblasts, mouse or rabbit anti-Hsp47, and rabbit anti-decorin or anti-lumican antibodies (Fig. 2). In two independent experiments, clear signals were detected in cells transfected with negative control shRNA, whereas low signals were detected in cells transfected with Hsp47 knockdown shRNA. This strongly suggests an association between Hsp47 and the two SLRPs. As Hsp47 is an ER-resident protein (22Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. Involvement of the stress protein HSP47 in procollagen processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.J.

These results also suggest that Hsp47 binds nonglycosylated SLRPs because substitution of the SLRPs with glycosaminoglycans occurs downstream of rER (36Jönsson M. Eklund E. Fransson L.A. Oldberg A. Initiation of the decorin glycosaminoglycan chain in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment.J. Biol.

To assess whether Hsp47 directly interacts with SLRPs, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed using lumican, fibromodulin, and decorin immobilized to a chip. Fig. S2 shows the proteins used for the SPR experiments. Injected Hsp47 clearly interacted with all three SLRPs and also showed a concentration-dependent binding (Fig. 3). To compare the binding of SLRPs to Hsp47 versus type I collagen, type I collagen was also injected into the SLRP chips, resulting in a concentration-dependent binding (Fig. 3). Next, equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from the binding kinetics (ka and kd). Similar Kd values were obtained for Hsp47 interacting with the three different SLRPs. Similar Kd values were also obtained for type I collagen interacting with the three different SLRPs. The SLRPs did, however, interact stronger with collagen than with Hsp47, but the Hsp47–SLRP interactions were still comparable with the Hsp47–collagen interactions (Fig. S3 and Table 1).Table 1The binding affinities between Hsp47, SLRPs, and collagensImmobilizedInjectedkakdKdp value for Kd104 m−1 s−110−3 s−110−7 mLumicanHsp470.397 ± 0.1556.23 ± 0.8416.9 ± 5.00.0012Type I collagenaType I collagen was treated with pepsin.26.3 ± 6.8722.9 ± 4.920.88 ± 0.07FibromodulinHsp470.796 ± 0.3894.03 ± 1.915.9 ± 3.90.0292Type I collagenaType I collagen was treated with pepsin.11.6 ± 0.9912.4 ± 0.381.07 ± 0.09DecorinHsp470.371 ± 0.0052.15 ± 0.255.8 ± 0.70.000012Type I collagenaType I collagen was treated with pepsin.35.3 ± 1.007.35 ± 0.230.22 ± 0.06Type I collagenaType I collagen was treated with pepsin.Hsp476.12 ± 0.6423.5 ± 0.603.87 ± 0.49a Type I collagen was treated with pepsin. Open table in a new tab To test a potential complex formation between SLRPs, Hsp47, and type I collagen, we performed further SPR analyses with Hsp47, type I collagen, or mixtures of the two that were injected over immobilized lumican, fibromodulin, or decorin. In a previous SPR study on complex formations between Hsp47, type I collagen, and TANGO1 or FKBP65, we found that mixtures of two of the reactants gave higher signals than the sum of signals obtained from injecting each of the proteins alone (16Ishikawa Y.

This implies that the injected reactants associate and form trimeric complexes, thereby yielding a higher signal. The red curves in Fig. 4 show Hsp47 and type I collagen co-injected over the SLRPs. Interestingly, these red curves always showed lower signals than the blue curves, which show the calculated sum of the individual binding signals obtained after injection of Hsp47 or type I collagen alone. This indicates that the three proteins do not form a trimeric complex but that Hsp47 and SLRPs compete to interact with type I collagen (16Ishikawa Y. Ito S. Nagata K. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P.

This difference was most prominent in experiments with decorin, whose strong binding to collagen was reduced in the presence of Hsp47. For lumican and fibromodulin, similar interaction inhibition by Hsp47 was observed, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 4). To further investigate the interactions between collagen, Hsp47, and decorin, an established in vitro collagen fibril formation assay was used. This assay monitors inhibition of collagen fibrillogenesis over time as a function of interaction between collagen and other proteins or molecules (37Ishikawa Y. Holden P. Bächinger H.P.

Collagen fibrillogenesis was delayed slightly by Hsp47 but more efficiently by decorin or by a mixture of Hsp47 and decorin (Fig. 5). Comparison of the decorin curve with the mixture curve shows intriguing, statistically significant differences at the beginning (≤9 min) and at the end (45–60 min) of the measurement (see Table 2 for detailed analysis). Furthermore, the experimental mixture curve was also compared with a theoretically calculated curve, the latter derived by adding the experimental curves of Hsp47 and decorin alone. This comparison revealed less inhibitory effect from the experimental than from the theoretical curve until around 40 min and then no significant differences from that point to the end of the measurement (Fig. 5). The mode of binding between these three molecules is initially competitive when mostly small type I collagen aggregates are present. It then transitions into cooperative binding for larger collagen fibrils.Table 2Absorbance (A313 nm) signal differences measured in the in vitro collagen fibril formation assayTimeDCNDCN + Hsp47 (experimental)p value (DCN versus experimental)DCN + Hsp47 (theoretical)p value (experimental versus theoretical)min30.00275 ± 0.0000850.00388 ± 0.0003270.00440.00105 ± 0.0006370.002460.00704 ± 0.0002610.00844 ± 0.0005360.01540.00331 ± 0.0009450.001290.0143 ± 0.000490.0157 ± 0.000750.04420.0078 ± 0.001310.0008120.0225 ± 0.000710.0240 ± 0.000970.10160.0138 ± 0.001420.0004150.0311 ± 0.001060.0326 ± 0.001210.17820.0211 ± 0.001660.0006200.0435 ± 0.001510.0447 ± 0.001290.32650.0331 ± 0.001980.0010250.0561 ± 0.001760.0562 ± 0.00120.96270.0469 ± 0.001830.0018300.0651 ± 0.001950.0638 ± 0.001050.37480.0573 ± 0.001600.0039350.0725 ± 0.002250.0701 ± 0.000880.15250.0655 ± 0.001860.0154400.0796 ± 0.002410.0760 ± 0.000760.06760.0726 ± 0.001840.0427450.0847 ± 0.002600.0802 ± 0.000680.04440.0777 ± 0.001990.1024500.0892 ± 0.002670.0839 ± 0.000620.02900.0822 ± 0.002060.2417550.0937 ± 0.002720.0876 ± 0.000590.01920.0867 ± 0.002090.4599600.0971 ± 0.002730.0904 ± 0.000550.01390.0899 ± 0.002030.7299 Open table in a new tab During synthesis of type I collagen, Hsp47 anchors newly synthesized collagen molecules to the rER protein TANGO1 (16Ishikawa Y.

In a recent study, Hsp47 was identified as an anchor protein for the sorting of collagen, as Hsp47 was observed to be bind TANGO1 through an interaction with the SH3 domain of TANGO1 (16Ishikawa Y. Ito S. Nagata K. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. Intracellular mechanisms of molecular recognition and sorting for transport of large extracellular matrix molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Hsp47 could also sort SLRPs to be loaded into the same COPII vesicles as collagens. SPR was performed to investigate potential interactions between SLRPs, Hsp47, and the SH3 domain of TANGO1. Fig. 6 shows that the SH3 domain of TANGO1 barely binds to SLRPs even at a 10-fold higher molarity than Hsp47. Furthermore, the binding of Hsp47 to fibromodulin was slightly inhibited, and the binding of Hsp47 to lumican and decorin was not significantly affected by the simultaneous presence of the SH3 domain of TANGO1. By comparing the red experimental curves in Fig. 6 with the curves constructed by adding the signals yielded after injection of each reactant alone (blue curves in Fig. 6), we concluded that SLRPs, Hsp47, and the TANGO1 SH3 domain do not form complexes. To assess the functional effect of Hsp47 binding to SLRPs, fibroblast cultures (NIH/3T3 cell line) were used to knock down Hsp47 expression using shRNA. The knockdown of Hsp47 was confirmed by immunoblotting and resulted in stalled secretion of decorin and lumican as well as of collagen, whereas the intracellular levels of protein-disulfide isomerase, calreticulin, and β-actin were unchanged (Fig. 7A). As a note, fibromodulin was not detectable in the medium from both control and knockdown samples, probably due to low cellular synthesis of this protein. In these experiments, the intracellular fractions were assayed for the presence of accumulated decorin and lumican, but both proteins were detected neither by immunoblots (in Nonidet P-40– or in radioimmune precipitation as"
https://openalex.org/W2860026723,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative nosocomial pathogen that causes soft tissue infections in patients who spend a long time in intensive care units. This recalcitrant bacterium is very well known for developing rapid drug resistance, which is a combined outcome of its natural competence and mobile genetic elements. Successful efforts to treat these infections would be aided by additional information on the physiology of A. baumannii. Toward that end, we recently reported on a small RNA (sRNA), AbsR25, in this bacterium that regulates the genes of several efflux pumps. Because sRNAs often require the RNA chaperone Hfq for assistance in binding to their cognate mRNA targets, we identified and characterized this protein in A. baumannii. The homolog in A. baumannii is a large protein with an extended C terminus unlike Hfqs in other Gram-negative pathogens. The extension has a compositional bias toward glycine and, to a lower extent, phenylalanine and glutamine, suggestive of an intrinsically disordered region. We studied the importance of this glycine-rich tail using truncated versions of Hfq in biophysical assays and complementation of an hfq deletion mutant, finding that the tail was necessary for high-affinity RNA binding. Further tests implicate Hfq in important cellular processes of A. baumannii like metabolism, drug resistance, stress tolerance, and virulence. Our findings underline the importance of the glycine-rich C terminus in RNA binding, ribo-regulation, and auto-regulation of Hfq, demonstrating this hitherto overlooked protein motif to be an indispensable part of the A. baumannii Hfq."
https://openalex.org/W2882967527,"Introduction Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is known to contribute to automaticity via the cytoplasmic Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Mitochondria participate in Ca2+ cycling. We studied the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux in ventricular spontaneous electrical activity. Methods Spontaneously contracting mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) were differentiated from wild type and ryanodine receptor type 2 (RYR2) knockout mouse ESCs and differentiated for 19–21 days. Automaticity was also observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived ventricular CMs differentiated for 30 days, and acute isolated adult mouse ventricular cells in ischemic simulated buffer. Action potentials (APs) were recorded by perforated whole cell current-clamp. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients were determined by fluorescent imaging. Results In mouse ESC-derived ventricular CMs, spontaneous beating was dependent on the L-type Ca2+ channel, cytoplasmic NCX and mitochondrial NCX. Spontaneous beating was modulated by SR Ca2+ release from RYR2 or inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R), the pacemaker current (If) and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). In RYR2 knockout mouse ESC-derived ventricular CMs, mitochondrial Ca2+ flux influenced spontaneous beating independently of the SR Ca2+ release from RYR2, and the mitochondrial effect was dependent on IP3R SR Ca2+ release. Depolarization of mitochondria and preservation of ATP could terminate spontaneous beating. A contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux to automaticity was confirmed in hiPSC-derived ventricular CMs and ischemic adult mouse ventricular CMs, confirming the findings across species and cell maturity levels. Conclusions Mitochondrial and sarcolemma NCX fluxes are required for ventricular automaticity. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a modulatory role. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through MCU is influenced by IP3R-dependent SR Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W2858985345,"Brain haemorrhages often require urgent treatment with a consequent need for quick and accurate diagnosis. Therefore, in this study, we investigate Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for detecting brain haemorrhages using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) measurement frames. A 2-layer model of the head, along with a series of haemorrhages, is designed as both numerical models and physical phantoms. EIT measurement frames, taken from an electrode array placed on the head surface, are used to train and test linear SVM classifiers. Various scenarios are implemented on both platforms to examine the impact of variables such as noise level, lesion location, lesion size, variation in electrode positioning, and variation in anatomy, on the classifier performance. The classifier performed well in numerical models (sensitivity and specificity of 90%+) with signal-to-noise ratios of 60 dB+, was independent of lesion location, and could detect lesions reliably down to the tested minimum volume of 5 ml. Slight variations in electrode layout did not affect performance. Performance was affected by variations in anatomy however, emphasising the need for large training sets covering different anatomies. The phantom models proved more challenging, with maximal sensitivity and specificity of 75% when used with the linear SVM. Finally, the performance of two more complex classifiers is briefly examined and compared to the linear SVM classifier. These results demonstrate that a radial basis function (RBF) SVM classifier and a neural network classifier can improve detection accuracy. Classifiers applied to EIT measurement frames is a novel approach for lesion detection and may offer an effective diagnostic tool clinically. A challenge is to translate the strong results from numerical models into real world phantoms and ultimately human patients, as well as the selection and development of optimal classifiers for this application."

Possible negative consequences of supplementation on local stocks are a concern for the conservation of wild fish populations. However, the direct impacts of supplementation on life history traits of local populations have rarely been investigated.

Here, we combined genetic (genotype-by-sequencing analysis) and life history traits to document the effects of supplementation on maximum length, growth rates, body condition and genetic admixture in stocked populations of two Lake Trout ecotypes from small boreal lakes in Quebec and Ontario, Canada. In both ecotypes, the length of stocked individuals was greater than local individuals and, in planktivorous-stocked populations, most stocked fish exhibited a planktivorous-like growth while 20% of fish exhibited piscivorous-like growth. The body condition index was positively related to the proportion of local genetic background, but this pattern was only observed in stocked planktivorous populations. We conclude that interactions and hybridization between contrasting ecotypes is a risk that could result in deleterious impacts and possible outbreeding depression. We discuss the implications of these findings for supplementation stocking."
https://openalex.org/W2861367202,"It is usually recommended that flucloxacillin is given on an empty stomach. The aim of this study was to compare total and free flucloxacillin concentrations after oral flucloxacillin, given with and without food, based on contemporary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets. Flucloxacillin 1000 mg orally was given to 12 volunteers, after a standardised breakfast and while fasting, on two separate occasions. Flucloxacillin concentrations over 12 hours were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacodynamic endpoints related to target concentration achievement, were compared in the fed and fasting states. For free flucloxacillin, the fed/fasting area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) ratio was 0.80 (p<0.01, 90% CI 0.70–0.92), the peak concentraton (Cmax) ratio 0.51 (p<0.001, 0.42–0.62) and the time to peak concentration (Tmax) ratio 2.2 (p<0.001, 1.87–2.55). The ratios for total flucloxacillin concentrations were similar. The mean (90% CI) fed/fasting ratios of free concentrations exceeded for 30%, 50% and 70% of the first 6 hours post-dose were 0.74 (0.63–0.87, fed inferior p<0.01), 0.95 (0.81–1.11, bioequivalent) and 1.15 (0.97–1.36, fed non-inferior), respectively. Results for 8 hours post-dose and those predicted for steady state were similar. Comparison of probability of target attainments for fed versus fasting across a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were in line with these results. Overall, this study shows that food reduced the AUC0-∞ and Cmax, and prolonged the Tmax of both free and total flucloxacillin concentrations compared with the fasting state, but achievement of free concentration targets associated with efficacy was in most circumstances equivalent. These results suggest that taking flucloxacillin with food is unlikely to compromise efficacy in most circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2864864287,"Some strains of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes secrete protein SIC (streptococcal inhibitor of complement), including strains of the clinically relevant M1 serotype. SIC neutralizes the effect of a number of antimicrobial proteins/peptides and interferes with the function of the host complement system. Previous studies have shown that some S. pyogenes proteins bind and modulate coagulation and fibrinolysis factors, raising the possibility that SIC also may interfere with the activity of these factors. Here we show that SIC interacts with both human thrombin and plasminogen, key components of coagulation and fibrinolysis. We found that during clot formation, SIC binds fibrin through its central region and that SIC inhibits fibrinolysis by interacting with plasminogen. Flow cytometry results indicated that SIC and plasminogen bind simultaneously to S. pyogenes bacteria, and fluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of the two proteins at the bacterial surface. As a consequence, SIC-expressing bacteria entrapped in clots inhibit fibrinolysis, leading to delayed bacterial escape from the clots as compared with mutant bacteria lacking SIC. Moreover, within the clots SIC-expressing bacteria were protected against killing. In an animal model of subcutaneous infection, SIC-expressing bacteria exhibited a delayed systemic spread. These results demonstrate that the bacterial protein SIC interferes with coagulation and fibrinolysis and thereby enhances bacterial survival, a finding that has significant implications for S. pyogenes virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2819258944,"Aim Investigate the immediate effect of low intensity vibration on skin blood flow and its underlying control mechanisms in healthy human participants. Materials and methods One-group pre-post design in a university laboratory setting. Nine adults underwent two bouts of 10-minute vibration (30Hz, peak acceleration 0.4g). Outcome measures include skin blood flow, and skin temperature on the right foot. To examine the control mechanisms underlying the vibration-induced blood flow response, SHORT-TIME Fourier analyses were computed to obtain the spectral densities for three frequency bands: metabolic (0.0095–0.02Hz), neurogenic (0.02–0.06Hz), and myogenic (0.06–0.15Hz). Non-parametric Friedman’s tests were computed to compare changes of the outcome measures and control mechanisms over the course of vibration. Results Vibration increased skin blood flow during both bouts of vibration, however the effect did not last after vibration was terminated. Myogenic spectral density increased during both bouts of vibration, whereas the metabolic and neurogenic spectral densities increased only during the 2nd bout of vibration. Interestingly, only the metabolic spectral density remained elevated after vibration ended. Conclusion Low intensity vibration produced acute increases in skin blood flow mediated in part by vascular control mechanisms of myogenic origin. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether low intensity vibration induces similar increases in skin blood flow in populations prone to developing chronic non-healing wounds, such as spinal cord injury and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2820246467,"Somatostatin-expressing (SOM+), inhibitory interneurons represent a heterogeneous group of cells and given their remarkable diversity, classification of SOM+ interneurons remains a challenging task. Electrophysiological, morphological and neurochemical classes of SOM+ interneurons have been proposed in the past but it remains unclear as to what extent these classes are congruent. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from 127 GFP-labeled SOM+ interneurons ('GIN') of the superficial cingulate cortex with subsequent biocytin-filling and immunocytochemical labeling. Principal component analysis followed by k-means clustering predicted two putative subtypes of SOM+ interneurons, which we designated as group I and group II GIN. A key finding of our study is the fact that these electrophysiologically and morphologically distinct groups of SOM+ interneurons can be correlated with two neurochemical subtypes of SOM+ interneurons described recently in our laboratory. In particular, all SOM+ interneurons expressing calbindin but no calretinin could be classified as group I GIN, whereas all but one neuropeptide Y- and calretinin-positive interneurons were found in group II."
https://openalex.org/W2823197384,"Rbfox1 is a splicing regulator that has been associated with various neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. We show that in adult rodent retinas, Rbfox1 is expressed in all types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in certain subsets of amacrine cells (ACs), within the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers. In the INL, all Rbfox1-positive cells were colocalized with GABAergic ACs, however not all GABAergic ACs were immunostained for Rbfox1. In the GCL, a vast majority of GABAergic dACs were Rbfox1-immunopositive. Furthermore, all cholinergic starburst ACs (SACs) in the INL (type a) and in the GCL (type b) were Rbfox1 positive. The expression of Rbfox1 in the retina significantly overlapped with expression of Rbfox2, another member of Rbfox family of proteins. Rbfox2, in addition to RGCs and ACs, was also expressed in horizontal cells. In developing retinas at E12 and E15, Rbfox1 is localized to the cytoplasm of differentiating RGCs and ACs. Between P0 and P5, Rbfox1 subcellular localization switched from cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear. Downregulation of Rbfox1 in adult Rbfox1loxP/loxP mice had no detectable effect on retinal gross morphology. However, the visual cliff test revealed marked abnormalities of depth perception of these animals. RNA sequencing of retinal transcriptomes of control and Rbfox1 knockout animals identified a number of Rbfox1-regulated genes that are involved in establishing neuronal circuits and synaptic transmission, including Vamp1, Vamp2, Snap25, Trak2, and Slc1A7, suggesting the role of Rbfox1 in facilitating synaptic communications between ACs and RGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2880392472,"Even though they are important determinants for increasing vaccination rates in advanced and developing nations alike, maternal capacity and decisional authority have not been fully elucidated in diverse countries and cultural spheres. This study examined the effects of South Korean, Chinese, and Japanese mothers' health literacy, self-efficacy, mass media use, and decisional authority on their children's vaccination after adjustment for their socioeconomic statuses. Computer-assisted web interviews were conducted with married women in their 20s-40s of South Korean, Chinese, or Japanese nationality (n = 1,571). Dependent variables were generated for the following four vaccinations: BCG, diphtheria+pertussis+tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (polio), and measles. For statistical processing, cases where all four types of vaccines had been recorded were scored as 1 and other cases were processed as 0. According to the results of the pooled model, we found that for East Asian mothers, decisional authority, self-efficacy, and health literacy all increased the likelihood that they would vaccinate their children. Furthermore, women who searched for health information through media such as the radio were more likely to vaccinate their children. However, when elaborate analyses were conducted by country, there were considerable differences in those characteristics by country. Therefore, this study showed that it is necessary to establish locally tailored strategies in order to raise vaccination rates in the Global Vaccine Action Plan. This study also showed that social contexts must be taken into consideration in order to raise vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W2831423901,"Background The grading of oral epithelial dysplasia is not possible in the atrophic epithelium of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). Recently, we found that features such as increased basal cell layer hyperplasia, abnormal superficial mitosis, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, increased nuclear size, and hyperchromasia represent transformation-relevant dysplastic features in the atrophic epithelium of OSMF. The presence of these features can be considered a high-risk feature for patients. However, these findings have not been tested and authenticated using markers relevant to oral carcinogenesis. Method Paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 normal oral mucosa (NOM) and 50 OSMF were retrieved from 2008 to 2016 and subjected to immunohistochemical expression using Ki67, CD105 and α-SMA antibodies. Results Ki67 LI showed significant increases from NOM (12.47±2.34) to LRED (23.47±3.75) to HRED (34.31±7.31) (<0.0001). Similarly, MVD was increased significantly from NOM (3.53±5.17) to LRED (27.57±12.25) to HRED (46.18±12.55) (p<0.0001). The expression of α-SMA was significantly increased from LRED (0.21±0.41) to HRED (1.13±0.56) (<0.0001). The Ki67 LI and α-SMA; MVD and α-SMA; and Ki67Ki67 LI and MVD in NOM, LRED and HRED showed a statistically significant positive correlation (P<0.0001). The increase in Ki67 LI was directly proportional to MVD and α-SMA expression from NOM to LRED to HRED (P<0.0001). The connective tissue stroma of NOM lacks α-SMA expression. Mild myofibroblast expression was noted in 4 cases of LRED (14.28%) and in 18 cases of HRED (81.81%). Moderate expression was noted only in 4 cases of HRED (22.22%). Conclusion Ki67 LI, CD105, and α-SMA expression showed significant differences between normal, LRED and HRED. These findings further support that features such as increased basal cell layer hyperplasia, abnormal superficial mitosis, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and hyperchromasia could be transformation-relevant dysplastic features."
https://openalex.org/W2843737656,"Objective Genetic counseling and testing can be offered to individuals who are at high risk of carrying a breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutation. However, the content of genetic counseling could be difficult to understand due to complex medical information. The aim of this study was to investigate if comprehension can be improved with a new genetic counseling tool (NGCT hereafter; a tool that combines complex medical information with pictures, diagrams and tables) as compared to conventional oral-only genetic counseling (CGC). Methods 207 clients attended genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer at the Medical University of Vienna between February 2015 and February 2016. Seventy clients participated in this study and were allocated into two groups: the first 36 participants received conventional (oral only) genetic counseling (CGC) and the following 34 participants received genetic counseling using a new genetic counseling tool (NGCT), which combines complex information with pictures, diagrams and tables. After genetic counseling, all consenting participants were invited to complete a questionnaire with seven questions evaluating their comprehension of the medical information provided. Results Socio-demographic backgrounds were comparable in both groups. Correct responses were significantly higher in the NGCT group compared to the CGC group (p = 0.012). NGCT also statistically improves correct response of Q1 (p = 0.03) and Q7 (p = 0.004). Conclusion The NGCT leads to an overall better understanding of the content of a genetic counseling session than CGC alone."
https://openalex.org/W2872329651,"Immunochromatographic kits and RT-PCR are widely used as diagnostic tools for influenza detection in clinical and hygiene fields. Immunochromatographic kits are useful for differential typing of influenza A and influenza B but cannot show if the detected virus strains have acquired drug resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors that target sialidase activity of viral neuraminidase. Although RT-PCR enables determination of drug-resistant mutants, its efficacy is limited to viruses carrying a known substitution in their neuraminidase genome sequence. In the present study, an easy, rapid and sensitive method for detection of drug-resistant influenza viruses regardless of major antigenic changes or genomic mutations was developed. By using the method in combination with virus-concentrated membranes in centrifugal filter units and a sialidase imaging probe, 2-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-bromophenyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (BTP3-Neu5Ac), sialidase activity of influenza neuraminidase was visualized on membranes by the green fluorescence of produced hydrophobic BTP3 under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight. Fluorescence images in the presence or absence of neuraminidase inhibitors clearly discriminated drug-resistant influenza viruses from drug-sensitive ones. The assay can be done within 15 min. The detection sensitivity was shown to be equal to or higher than the sensitivities of commercial immunochromatographic kits. The assay will be a powerful tool for screening and monitoring of emerging drug-resistant influenza viruses and would help clinicians decide effective antiviral treatment strategies when such mutants have become prevalent."

The use of NIPPV may also be of great value combined with minimally invasive surfactant delivery. Our aim was to implement an in vivo model of RDS, which can be managed with different non-invasive ventilation (NIV) strategies, including non-synchronized NIPPV, synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV), and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Forty-two surfactant-depleted adult rabbits were allocated in six different groups: three groups of animals were treated with only NIV for three hours (NIPPV, SNIPPV, and NCPAP groups), while three other groups were treated with surfactant (SF) followed by NIV (NIPPV+SF, SNIPPV+SF, and NCPAP+SF groups). Arterial gas exchange, ventilation indices, and dynamic compliance were assessed. Post-mortem the lungs were sampled for histological evaluation. Surfactant depletion was successfully achieved by repeated broncho-alveolar lavages (BALs). After BALs, all animals developed a moderate respiratory distress, which could not be reverted by merely applying NIV. Conversely, surfactant administration followed by NIV induced a rapid improvement of arterial oxygenation in all surfactant-treated groups. Breath synchronization was associated with a significantly better response in terms of gas exchange and dynamic compliance compared to non-synchronized NIPPV, showing also the lowest injury scores after histological assessment. The proposed in vivo model of surfactant deficiency was successfully managed with NCPAP, NIPPV, or SNIPPV; this model resembles a moderate respiratory distress and it is suitable for the preclinical testing of less invasive surfactant administration techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2881537323,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. DENV causes a spectrum of illness ranging from mild to potentially severe complications. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in initiating and regulating highly effective antiviral immune response that include linking innate and adaptive immune responses. This study was conducted to comparatively characterize in detail the relative proportion, phenotypic changes, and maturation profile of subsets of both myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in children with dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and for purposes of control healthy individuals. The mDCs (Lin-CD11c+CD123lo), the pDCs (Lin-CD11c-CD123+) and the double negative (DN) subset (Lin-/HLA-DR+/CD11c-CD123-) were analyzed by polychromatic flow cytometry. The data were first analyzed on blood samples collected from DENV-infected patients at various times post-infection. Results showed that the relative proportion of mDCs were significantly decreased which was associated with an increase in disease severity in samples from DENV-infected patients. While there was no significant difference in the relative proportion of pDCs between healthy and DENV-infected patients, there was a marked increase in the DN subset. Analysis of the kinetics of changes of pDCs showed that there was an increase but only during the early febrile phase. Additionally, samples from patients during acute disease showed marked decreases in the relative proportion of CD141+ and CD16+ mDC subsets that were the major mDC subsets in healthy individuals. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the level of CD33-expressing mDCs in DENV patients. While the pDCs showed an up-regulation of maturation profile during acute DENV infection, the mDCs showed an alteration of maturation status. This study suggests that different relative proportion and phenotypic changes as well as alteration of maturation profile of DC subsets may play a critical role in the dengue pathogenesis and disease outcome."

In our country more than 30 Mha are currently cultivated under no-till schemes, stressing the importance of this management system for crop production. It is widely recognized that soil microbiota is altered under different soil managements. In this regard the structure of Burkholderia populations is affected by soils management practices such as tillage, fertilization, or crop rotation. The stability of these structures, however, has not been evaluated under sustainable schemes where the impact of land practices could be less deleterious to physicochemical soils characteristics. In order to assess the structure of Burkholderia spp. populations in no-till schemes, culturable Burkholderia spp. strains were quantified and their biodiversity evaluated. Results showed that Burkholderia spp. biodiversity, but not their abundance, clearly displayed a dependence on agricultural managements. We also showed that biodiversity was mainly influenced by two soil factors: Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen. Results showed that no-till schemes are not per se sufficient to maintain a richer Burkholderia spp. soil microbiota, and additional traits should be considered when sustainability of productive soils is a goal to fulfil productive agricultural schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2843206214,"Background We performed a qualitative study to investigate the experiences of participants in a multicentre randomized controlled trial on a home-based palliative approach (HPA) for adults with severe multiple sclerosis (MS) and their caregivers. Our aim was to explore the strengths and challenges of the intervention, and circumstances that may have influenced its efficacy. Methods Participants to the qualitative study were the patients, their caregivers, patient referring physicians, and the teams who delivered the HPA intervention. We performed semi-structured one-on-one interviews with 12 patients and 15 informal caregivers chosen using a maximum variation strategy, two focus group meetings with patient referring physicians (4 participants each), and one with the HPA teams (9 participants). Results From data analysis (framework method) 38 sub-categories emerged, which were grouped into 10 categories and 3 themes: 'expectations,' 'met and unmet needs', and 'barriers’. Intervention benefits were improved control of symptoms and reduced sense of isolation of the patient-caregiver dyads. Limitations were: factors related to experimental design (difficulty of dyads in identifying examiner and team roles, additional burden for caregivers); team issues (insufficient team building /supervision, competing priorities); limitations of the intervention itself (insufficient length, lack of rehabilitation input); and external factors (resource limitations, under-responsive services/professionals). The referring physician focus groups provided little experiential data. Conclusions The HPA reduced patient symptoms and sense of isolation in patients and caregivers. The indirect role of the HPA teams, and insufficient length of the intervention were key limitations. The experimental design imposed additional burdens on the dyads. Key barriers were the paucity of available services, the demanding administrative procedures, and lack of networking facilities. These findings suggest that two major requirements are necessary for home palliative care to be effective in this patient population: HPA teams well-connected with MS rehabilitation services, and care delivered over the long-term, with variable intensity.

https://openalex.org/W2849951077,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an intensely studied non-receptor tyrosine kinase with roles in cancer and other common human diseases. Despite the large interest in FAK, the in vivo contribution of FAK auto-phosphorylation site tyrosine (Y) 397 to FAK function is incompletely understood. To study FAK Y397 in vivo we analyzed mice with ‘non-phosphorylatable’ Y-to-phenylalanine (F) and ‘phospho-mimicking’ Y-to-glutamate (E) mutations in the germline. We found that FAK Y397F mice die early during embryogenesis with abnormal angiogenesis like FAK kinase-dead mice. When Y397 is mutated to a glutamate mice survive beyond mid-gestation like mice where Y397 is lost by deletion of FAK exon 15. In culture, defects in proliferation, invasion and gene expression were more severe with the FAK Y397F than with the FAK Y397E mutation despite the inability of FAK Y397E to bind SRC. Conditional expression of FAK Y397F or Y397E in unchallenged avascular epidermis, however, resulted in no appreciable phenotype. We conclude that FAK Y397 is required for the highly dynamic tissue remodeling during development but dispensable for normal homeostasis of avascular epidermis. In contrast to the Y397F mutation, FAK Y397E retains sufficient biological activity to allow for development beyond mid-gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2860971858,"Knowledge on successful interventions against livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) within pig herds is sparse. In situations like this, a mechanistic simulation model can be a valuable tool for assessing the effect of potential intervention strategies, and prioritising which should be tested in the field. We have simulated on-farm interventions in a farrow-to-finish pig herd, with a previously published LA-MRSA spread model, within four different areas: 1) Reduced antimicrobial consumption, 2) Reduced number of pigs within each section, 3) Reduced mixing of pigs, and 4) Improved internal biosecurity. To model a decrease in the selective pressure, the transmission rates were reduced after LA-MRSA had become fully established within a herd, which resulted in a marked decrease in the prevalence within all stable units. However, LA-MRSA rarely disappeared completely from the herd; this was only observed in scenarios where the transmission rates were reduced to ≤ 30% of the original level. While changes in antimicrobial consumption patterns might be a very important step towards reducing the spread of LA-MRSA, the simulation results indicate that it may need to be paired with other preventive or intervention measures. Reducing the number of pigs within each section, reducing mixing of pigs, or improving internal biosecurity after LA-MRSA had become established within the herd only resulted in marginal changes in the median prevalence within the herd. However, these factors might be important in relation to being able to achieve or maintain a low level of antimicrobial consumption, and thus still indirectly influence the LA-MRSA prevalence within the herd. The results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the assumptions regarding the existence of pigs persistently shedding MRSA have a noticeable influence on the model results. The assumptions regarding transmission from sow to offspring at the day of birth also had a considerable influence on the MRSA prevalence within the farrowing unit but did not cause any marked changes in the simulated effect of interventions. Effects might differ between different farm types contaminated in different levels and this simulation study highlights a strong need for more knowledge from on-farm trials."

Despite this, Leishmania donovani (LD) are able to parasitize the macrophages and persist. The impact of this parasitizing and persistence on antigen processing and presentation by macrophages remains poorly defined. To gain insight into this, we analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and compared the HLA-I self-peptidomes, proteasome compositions, HLA expression and activation states of non-infected and LD-infected THP1-derived macrophages. We found that, though both HLA-I peptidomes were dominated by nonapeptides, they were heterogeneous and individualized, with differences in HLA binding affinities and anchor residues. Non-infected and LD-infected THP1-derived macrophages were able to sample peptides from source proteins of almost all subcellular locations and involved in various cellular functions, but in different proportions. In the infected macrophages, there was increased sampling of plasma membrane and extracellular proteins, and those involved in immune responses, cell communication/signal transduction and metabolism/energy pathways, and decreased sampling of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and those involved in protein metabolism, RNA binding and cell growth and/or maintenance.

https://openalex.org/W2815617934,"Serotonin (5-HT) acts as both a morphogenetic factor during early embryonic development and a neuromodulator of circuit plasticity in the mature brain. Dysregulation of serotonin signaling during critical periods is involved in developmental neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. In this study we focused on the consequences of defect reelin signaling for the development of the brainstem serotonergic raphe system. We observed that reelin signaling components are expressed by serotonergic neurons during the critical period of their lateral migration. Further, we found that reelin signaling is important for the normal migration of rostral, but not caudal hindbrain raphe nuclei and that reelin deficiency results in the malformation of the paramedian raphe nucleus and the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe nuclei. Additionally, we showed that serotonergic neurons projections to laminated brain structures were severely altered. With this study, we propose that the perturbation of canonical reelin signaling interferes with the orientation of tangentially, but not radially, migrating brainstem 5-HT neurons. Our results open the window for further studies on the interaction of reelin and serotonin and the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders."

We used galvanic-VEMP to compare spinal cord function in individuals infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) from asymptomatic status to HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). Methodology/Principal findings This cross-sectional study with 122 individuals included 26 HTLV-1-asymptomatic carriers, 26 individuals with possible HAM, 25 individuals with HAM, and 45 HTLV-1-seronegative individuals (controls). The groups were similar regarding gender, age, and height. Galvanic stimuli (duration: 400 ms; intensity: 2 mA) were applied bilaterally to the mastoid processes and VEMP was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle. The electromyographic parameters investigated were the latency and amplitude of the short-latency (SL) and medium-latency (ML) responses. While SL and ML amplitudes were similar between groups, SL and ML latencies were delayed in the HTLV-1 groups compared to the control group (p<0.001). Using neurological examination as the gold standard, ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.83 (p<0.001) for SL and 0.86 (p<0.001) for ML to detect spinal cord injury. Sensibility and specificity were, respectively, 76% and 86% for SL and 79% and 85% for ML. Galvanic-VEMP disclosed alterations that were progressive in HTLV-1-neurological disease, ranging from SL delayed latency in HTLV-1-asymptomatic carriers, SL and ML delayed latency in possible HAM group, to absence of VEMP response in HAM group. Conclusions/Significance The worse the galvanic-VEMP response, the more severe the myelopathy. Galvanic-VEMP alteration followed a pattern of alteration and may be a prognostic marker of progression from HTLV-1-asymptomatic carrier to HAM."
https://openalex.org/W2819225772,"Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), like human metabolic syndrome, comprises a collection of clinical signs related to obesity, insulin dysregulation and susceptibility to secondary inflammatory disease. Although the secondary conditions resulting from EMS can be life-threatening, diagnosis is not straightforward and often complicated by the presence of other concurrent conditions like pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). In order to better characterize EMS, we sought to describe the variation within, and correlations between, typical physical and endocrine parameters for EMS. Utilizing an unsupervised statistical approach, we evaluated a population of Arabian horses using a physical examination including body measurements, as well as blood plasma insulin, leptin, ACTH, glucose, and lipid values. We investigated the relationships among these variables using principle component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and linear regression. Owner-assigned assessments of body condition were one full score (on a nine-point scale) lower than scores assigned by researchers, indicating differing perception of healthy equine body weight. Rotated PCA defined two factor scores explaining a total of 46.3% of variation within the dataset. Hierarchical clustering using these two factors revealed three groups corresponding well to traditional diagnostic categories of ""Healthy"", ""PPID-suspect"", and ""EMS-suspect"" based on the characteristics of each group. Proxies estimating up to 93.4% of the composite ""EMS-suspect"" and ""PPID-suspect"" scores were created using a reduced set of commonly used diagnostic variables, to facilitate application of these quantitative scores to horses of the Arabian breed in the field. Use of breed-specific, comprehensive physical and endocrinological variables combined in a single quantitative score may improve detection of horses at-risk for developing EMS, particularly in those lacking severe clinical signs. Quantification of EMS without the use of predetermined reference ranges provides an advantageous approach for future studies utilizing genomic or metabolomics approaches to improve understanding of the etiology behind this troubling condition."

The aim is a 90% reduction of new infections and 65% reduction of HCV-related deaths by 2030.This study reports on the epidemiology of HCV infections in the Austrian state of Tyrol (total population 750,000) and uses a predictive model to identify how the WHO strategy for elimination of HCV can be achieved.We developed a regional disease burden model based on observed local diagnosis data from 2001 to 2016. Scenarios were developed to evaluate the impact of diagnosis and treatment on HCV-related outcomes (viremic prevalence, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths) from 2015 through 2030.In the last 15 years, 1,721 patients living in Tyrol have been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection. When ageing, mortality and treatment were factored in, there were an estimated 2,043 viremic HCV infections in 2016, of which 1,136 cases had been diagnosed. A baseline model predicts a decrease of 588 HCV cases from 2015 to 2030, which would not translate into the significant reduction of infections needed to achieve WHO global health recommendations. A total of 1,843 infected individuals need to be identified and treated to achieve the WHO goals by 2030 (1,254 averted cases as compared to baseline model). Implementation of this strategy would avoid 523 new HCV infections and decreases HCV-related mortality by 73%.HCV elimination and >65% reduction of associated mortality are possible for Tyrol, but requires a significant increase in new diagnoses and treatment rate. The model presented in this study could serve as an example for other regions to reliably predict regional disease burden and estimate how WHO goals can be met in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2840807461,"Background Unhealthy diet may increase the risk of impaired physical functioning in older age. Although poor diet and limited physical functioning both seem to be particularly common in Eastern Europe, no previous study has assessed the relationship between these two factors in this region. The current analysis examined the association between overall diet quality and physical functioning in Eastern European populations. Methods We used data on 25,504 persons (aged 45–69 years at baseline) who participated in the Health Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study. Dietary assessment at baseline used food frequency questionnaire, and the overall diet quality was evaluated by the Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Physical functioning (PF) was measured by the physical functioning subscale (PF-10) of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline and three subsequent occasions over a 10-year period. The cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between the MDS and PF were examined simultaneously using growth curve models. Results Men and women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had significantly better PF at baseline; after multivariable adjustment, the regression coefficient per 1-unit increase in the MDS was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.52) in men and 0.50 (0.36, 0.64) in women. However, we found no statistically significant link between baseline MDS and the subsequent slope of PF decline in neither gender; the coefficients were -0.02 (-0.04, 0.00) in men and -0.01 (-0.03, 0.02) in women. Discussion Our results do not support the hypothesis that the Mediterranean diet has a substantial impact on the trajectories of physical functioning, although the differences existing at baseline may be related to dietary habits in earlier life."
https://openalex.org/W2826683767,"Spring-mediated distraction enterogenesis has been studied as a novel treatment for short bowel syndrome (SBS). Previous approaches are limited by multiple surgeries to restore intestinal continuity. Purely endoluminal devices require a period of intestinal attachment for enterogenesis. The purpose of this study is to modify the device to prevent premature spring migration in a porcine model. Two models were created in juvenile mini-Yucatan pigs for the placement of three-dimensionally printed springs. (1) Two Roux-en-y jejunojenostomies with two Roux limbs were made. A spring with bidirectional hooked surface features was placed in one Roux limb and a spring with smooth surface was placed in the other Roux limb. (2) The in-continuity model had both hooked and smooth surface springs placed directly in intestinal continuity. Spring location was evaluated by weekly radiographs, and the intestine was retrieved after 2 to 4 weeks. Springs with smooth surfaces migrated between 1 to 3 weeks after placement in both porcine models. Springs with bidirectional hooked surface features were anchored to the intestine for up to 4 weeks without migration. Histologically, the jejunal architecture showed significantly increased crypt depth and muscularis thickness compared to normal jejunum. Bidirectional features printed on springs prevented the premature migration of endoluminal springs. These novel spring anchors allowed for their endoluminal placement without any sutures. This approach may lead to the endoscopic placement of the device for patients with SBS."
https://openalex.org/W2822675354,"Recently, breast cancer prevalence has increased in South Korea. In this study, we investigated the correlation between breast cancer prevalence and socioeconomic status. This study enrolled 27,331 people who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) IV-VI (2007-2015). In addition, we obtained data from the Korean Statistical Information Service (KSIS) on the breast cancer age-standardized incidence rate (AIR), the age-standardized mortality rate (AMR), the number of women screened, and the number of newly diagnosed patients. The KHANES data showed that breast cancer prevalence was significantly associated with educational level (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-3.77 for 10-12 vs. ≤ 6 years of education, and OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10-5.06 for ≥ 13 vs. ≤ 6 years of education). However, there was no significant association of breast cancer prevalence with monthly household income. In a separate analysis of the AIR, AMR, and number of women screened for breast cancer, the AIR increased with the number of women screened, whereas the AMR did not. Furthermore, the number of newly diagnosed patients in all age groups increased over time. The present results demonstrate that the recently increased breast cancer prevalence documented in South Korea may be attributable to earlier detection rather than to a real increase in prevalence, and that breast cancer may be overdiagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2834636902,"Excitotoxic lesions are frequently used to assess the role of cerebral structures in cognitive processes in rodents. However, the precise site and extent of these lesions remain unknown without histological verifications. Using a 7-Teslas MRI system and a T2-weighted turbo-RARE sequence, MR images were acquired at several time points following NMDA lesions (1h, 6h, 24h, 48h, 1 week and 2 weeks). NMDA infusions into the parenchyma induced a clear and delineable hyperintense signal from 1h up to 1-week post-surgery. Hyperintensity volumes were compared with NeuN and Cresyl violet histological quantifications of the lesion magnitude. NMDA-induced hypersignal is observed as soon as 1h post-injection and is a reliable estimate of the presence (or absence) of a lesion. Compared to NeuN, Cresyl violet staining underestimates the extent of the lesion in significant proportions. The MRI hyperintensity generated by NMDA instillation into the parenchyma can be used as a powerful tool to confirm the diffusion of the drug into the cerebral tissue, to ascertain the locus of injection and predict with a high success rate the fate of NMDA lesions as soon as 1h post-surgery. This approach could be very useful in a large variety of lesion studies in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2845315082,"Arterial spin labeling(ASL)with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective method for estimating cerebral blood flow (CBF). Furthermore, assessing perfusion territories of arteries is useful for determining the treatment strategy of patients with carotid artery stenosis. ASL with selective vessel labeling is an effective method to obtain perfusion mapping, however, the application for selective labeling is not installed on all MR scanners. The purpose of this study is to establish a method to selectively mask in the labeling area using material with high susceptibility instead of selectively labeling to obtain a partial perfusion image.ASL perfusion images were performed in five volunteers. Masking was applied by placing a stainless-steel bolt and nuts on the neck. The area of artifacts extended to the carotid artery was confirmed by the localizer image. In the obtained masked ASL, blood flow of the left and right cerebrum and cerebellum was measured and compared with control ASL without masking. By subtracting masked ASL from the control ASL, the perfusion territory of the carotid artery on the masked side was identified.Mean CBF which was 39.6 ml/(100 g × min) in control ASL decreased to 16.1 ml/(100 g × min) in masked ASL, and the masking ratio was 59.6%. There were no significant differences in the CBF of non-masked areas under the control ASL condition (39.6± 5.2 ml/[100 g × min]) btween that under the masked ASL condition (39.4 ± 7.0 ml/[100 g × min]). By subtracting masked ASL from control ASL, we successfully visualized the hemilateral carotid artery's perfusion territory.Intentional susceptibility artifacts with non-magnetic metals on the neck can mask spin labeling of the carotid artery. Furthermore, hemilateral carotid artery perfusion territories can be visualized in hemilaterally masked ASL."
https://openalex.org/W2865650756,"In this work we use a hierarchical Bayesian paradigm to introduce a theoretical framework to determine an individual’s Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) genotype, which heavily influences both the age of onset and probability of acquiring Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This calculation is based solely on an individual’s family history. This APOE4 genotype estimation is then combined with a number of known factors that influence AD onset to produce a function that estimates the onset of AD as a function of age.

https://openalex.org/W2841517068,"Immunosuppression by retroviruses including the human immunodeficiency virus—1 (HIV-1) is well known, however the mechanisms how retroviruses induce this immunosuppression is not fully investigated. It was shown that non-infectious retroviral particles as well as retroviral or recombinant retroviral transmembrane envelope (TM) proteins demonstrated immunosuppressive properties. The same was shown for peptides corresponding to a highly conserved domain in the TM protein. This domain is called immunosuppressive (ISU) domain and it induces modulation of the cytokine release of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. In addition, it changes the gene expression of these cells. Common indications for the immunosuppressive activity were tumour growth in vivo and interleukin—10 (IL-10) release from human PBMCs in vitro. Single mutations in the ISU domain abrogated the immunosuppressive activity. In order to develop a new model system for the expression of the ISU domain and presentation to PBMCs which is not prone to possible endotoxin contaminations, two expression systems were developed. In the first system, designated pOUT, retroviral proteins containing the ISU domain were expressed and released into the cell culture medium, and in the second system, tANCHOR, the ISU domain was presented by a tetraspanin-anchored sequence on the cell surface of human cells. Both systems were exploited to express the wild-type (wt) ISU domains of HIV-1, of the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and of the murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) as well as to express mutants (mut) of these ISU domains. PERV is of special interest in the context of virus safety of xenotransplantation using pig organs. Expression of the TM proteins was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, ELISA and Western blot analyses using specific antibodies. However, when cells expressing and releasing the ISU were co-incubated with human PBMCs, no increased production of IL-10 was observed when compared with the mutants. Similar results were obtained when the released TM proteins were concentrated by immunoprecipitation and added to PBMCs. We suggest that the absence of IL-10 induction can be explained by a low amount of protein, by the lack of a biologically active conformation or the absence of additional factors."
