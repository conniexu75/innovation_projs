https://openalex.org/W1557686543,"The inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) family of genes has an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in animals ranging from insects to humans1,2,3,4,5,6. Ectopic expression of human IAP proteins can suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli, but the mechanism of this inhibition was previously unknown. Here we show that human X-chromosome-linked IAP directly inhibits at least two members of the caspase family of cell-death proteases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. As the caspases are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are the principal effectors of apoptosis7, our findings suggest how IAPs might inhibit cell death, providing evidence for a mechanism of action for these mammalian cell-death suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W1964486755,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade has been intensely studied as a primary biochemical pathway through which a variety of extracellular stimuli initiate and regulate processes of cellular transformation. That MAPKs are abundantly expressed in postmitotic neurons, however, suggests different yet currently unknown functions for this cascade in the mature nervous system. Here we report that the MAPK cascade is required for hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), a robust and widely studied form of synaptic plasticity. We observed that PD 098059, a selective inhibitor of the MAPK cascade, blocked MAPK activation in response to direct stimulation of the NMDA receptor as well as to LTP-inducing stimuli. Furthermore, inhibition of the MAPK cascade markedly attenuated the induction of LTP. PD 098059, however, had no effect on the expression of established LTP, and the MAPK cascade was not persistently activated during LTP expression.

Such work has delineated a pathway by which growth factor receptor activation initiates a complex cascade leading to the activation of Ras, Raf, and MEK, a dual-specific kinase that activates MAPKs via phosphorylations on both threonine and tyrosine residues (reviewed in Refs. 1Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar and 2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this cascade is typically studied in the context of mitotic cell regulation, its components are actually most abundantly expressed in postmitotic neurons of the developed nervous system (3Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D.

Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). At present, however, little is known about the physiologic roles of this cascade in mature neurons. We have begun to investigate the possible involvement of the MAPK cascade in the activity-dependent modulation of synaptic connections between neurons, a putative mechanism for the neuronal basis of learning and memory. In particular, we have examined the role of the MAPK cascade in hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), a widely studied form of synaptic plasticity (reviewed in Refs. 5Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar and 6Roberson E.D. English J.D. Sweatt J.D. Learn. Mem. 1996; 3: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that p42 MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) is activated during the induction of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus (7English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Though this observation identifies the MAPK cascade as a potential component of the LTP induction cascades in area CA1, the physiologic necessity of MAPK activation during LTP induction remains to be established. To address this question, we have utilized the compound PD 098059 (8Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar, 9Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Here we report that inhibition of the MAPK cascade greatly attenuates the induction but not expression of LTP in area CA1. Our observations provide an initial insight into a physiological role for the MAPK cascade in postmitotic neurons in the adult mammalian nervous system: the activity-dependent regulation of synaptic strength. For hippocampal slice preparation, pharmacology, and electrophysiology, transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) from 4–8 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared and maintained as described (7English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Drug application, area CA1 subregion microdissection, tissue sonication, fractionation of soluble extracts, Western blotting, and densitometric analysis of phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity were conducted as described previously (7English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. In the present studies, we also utilized an antibody that selectively recognizes tyrosine phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (New England Biolabs). PD 098059 was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted into artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mm 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2) to give the desired final concentration (with a final Me2SO concentration of 0.33%). For drug application (either PD 098059 or 0.33% Me2SO alone), ACSF solutions were maintained in a 32 °C water bath (to assure the complete solubility of PD 098059). For biochemical analysis of the effect of PD 098059 upon p42 MAPK activation, slices were preincubated in 50 μm PD 098059 or 0.33% Me2SO for 45 min to 1 h prior to NMDA application (100 μm, 4′) or HFS (strong induction paradigm, see below). 0.33% Me2SO alone had no effect on NMDA- or HFS-mediated p42 MAPK activation (not shown). For extracellular field recordings of the Schaffer collateral synapses in area CA1, stimulus intensity was adjusted to elicit a population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) that was approximately 25% of the maximum response (initial slope typically about 1 mV/ms), and responses (obtained at 0.05 Hz) were monitored for at least 15 min to ensure a stable base line. Two LTP induction paradigms were employed: 1) modest: two trains of 1-s, 100-Hz stimulation at the test stimulus intensity, with an intertrain interval of 20 s; and 2) strong: three sets of tetani, each set spaced 10 min apart and consisting of two trains of 1-s, 100-Hz stimulation at a stimulus intensity that generated 75% of the maximal pEPSP, with an intertrain interval of 20 s. PD 098059 or 0.33% Me2SO was applied for 1 h prior to tetanization and was maintained throughout the recording period. In initial experiments testing the effect of PD 098095 on LTP elicited with the strong induction protocol, 30-ml solutions of normal ACSF, 0.33% Me2SO, or 100 μm PD 098059 were prepared and recycled through the recording chambers. Similar results were also obtained using 50 μm PD 098059 (which, as with all other experiments, was not recycled), and these data were pooled as noted. For control experiments illustrated in Fig. 3 B, an NMDA receptor-mediated pEPSP was isolated by perfusing the slices with a modified ACSF (as described, with the following exceptions: 4 mm CaCl2, 0 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione). To test the physiologic significance of MAPK activation during LTP induction, we employed a recently described inhibitor of MEK, the dual-specific protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating and activating MAPKs. We first determined whether this MEK inhibitor, PD 098059, blocks MAPK activation in area CA1 of the hippocampus. PD 098059 completely abolished basal p42 MAPK phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity as well as the NMDA- and HFS-mediated increase in p42 MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A,APT Western). Similar results were obtained using an antibody that selectively recognizes phosphorylated, activated MAPKs (Fig. 1 A, α-PMAPK Western). Quantitative analysis of p42 MAPK APT immunoreactivity is shown in Fig.1 B. Application of either NMDA or HFS led to a significant increase in p42 MAPK phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity (NMDA application: Me2SO alone, 100 ± 13; n= 8; Me2SO/NMDA, 290 ± 38; n = 10 (p < 0.01, Student's t test); HFS application: Me2SO alone, 100 ± 13; n= 6; Me2SO/HFS, 159 ± 20; n = 6; (p < 0.05, Student's t test)). In the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD 098059, however, essentially all phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity (basal as well as the NMDA- and HFS-mediated increases) was eliminated (NMDA application: PD 098059 alone, 6 ± 12; n = 7; PD 098059/NMDA, 16 ± 6; n = 9; HFS application: PD 098059 alone, 9 ± 3; n = 3; PD 098059/HFS, 9 ± 3; n= 3). Together, these data demonstrate that NMDA receptor stimulation or LTP-inducing HFS elicits p42 MAPK activation in area CA1 and that PD 098059 blocks this activation. Having established that PD 098059 blocks MAPK activation in area CA1, we next determined the effect of this inhibitor on LTP induction. LTP observed in control slices was not significantly different at any time point from LTP observed in slices treated with the drug vehicle, 0.33% Me2SO (pEPSP slope att = 90 min, control: 173 ± 9%, n= 6; 0.33% Me2SO: 174 ± 11%, n = 4). Overall, stable LTP was elicited in nine of ten control slices, with the initial slope of the pEPSP potentiated to 173 ± 7% of pre-tetanus levels, 90 min following the tetanus (n = 10; Fig. 2 A, closed circles). In slices treated with 50 μm PD 098059, however, a decaying potentiation was observed in six of six slices; att = 90 min, the pEPSP slope was 116 ± 7% of base-line responses (Fig. 2 A, open circles). Responses in PD 098059-treated slices were significantly different from control responses for each time point from t = 20 to 90 min (time 0–18 min, p > 0.05; 20–46 min,p < 0.05; 48–90 min, p < 0.01.) These data suggest that the MAPK cascade is critical for the induction of stable LTP in hippocampal area CA1. In our initial studies, we employed a modest LTP-inducing paradigm consisting of a single set of tetani. The inhibition of certain enzymes (e.g. nitric-oxide synthase (10Chetkovich D.M. Klann E. Sweatt J.D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Haley J.E. Malen P.L. Chapman P.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 160: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), fyn kinase knockout mice (12Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar)) blocks LTP induced with similar modest paradigms but not LTP induced with stronger paradigms (e.g. multiple sets of tetani), suggesting a modulatory rather than an obligatory function in LTP induction. To begin to determine whether MAPK activation plays an obligatory or modulatory role in LTP induction, we examined the effect of PD 098059 on LTP elicited with a strong induction protocol: multiple sets of tetani. PD 098059 also markedly attenuated the magnitude of LTP induced with this stronger induction protocol. In control slices, stable LTP was elicited in nine of nine slices, with the initial slope of the pEPSP potentiated to 226 ± 12% of pre-tetanus levels, 60 min following the final tetanus (n = 9; Fig. 2 B,closed circles). These data are pooled averages of six control slices and three drug vehicle-treated slices (pEPSP att = 60 min, control: 228 ± 7%, n= 6; 0.33% Me2SO: 224 ± 38%, n = 3). In slices treated with PD 098059, a decaying potentiation was observed in nine of ten slices; at t = 60 min, the pEPSP slope was 132 ± 13% of base-line responses (n = 10). These data are pooled averages of seven slices treated with 100 μm PD 098059 and three slices treated with 50 μm PD 098059 (100 μm: blocked in six of seven slices; pEPSP slope at t = 60 min, 132 ± 19%; 50 μm: blocked in three of three slices; pEPSP slope at t = 60 min, 132 ± 7%; these data were not significantly different and were thus combined). Responses in PD 098059-treated slices were significantly different from control slices for all time points from 2 to 60 min (p< 0.01 for each). That the effect of PD 098059 is similar on LTP elicited with both modest and strong stimuli (i.e. normal initial responses followed by a slowly decaying potentiation) suggests that the MAPK cascade is an obligatory component of the biochemical induction cascades that subserve this form of synaptic potentiation. In control experiments, we found that prolonged application of PD 098059 had no effect upon basal synaptic transmission (Fig.3 A). Following 2.5 h of PD 098059 application (50 μm), average initial slope of the pEPSP were 87 ± 10% of base-line responses (n = 3, not significant). Similar results were also obtained with 100 μm PD 098059 applied for 1 h (not shown). Similarly, PD 098059 had no effect upon NMDA receptor-mediated pEPSPs elicited in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, an antagonist of non-NMDA receptor subtypes of glutamate receptors (Fig.3 B). NMDA receptor-mediated responses following 1 h of 100 μm PD 098059 application were not different from base-line levels (amplitude: 99 ± 2% of base line; initial slope: 94 ± 4% of base line; n = 3;p > 0.05 for each). Application of a competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor,d,l-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (d,l-APV, 50 μm), completely and reversibly blocked the pEPSP. Finally, PD 098059 did not alter the depolarization responses to high frequency stimulation (Fig. 3 C). No differences were observed for either the total depolarization (integral over entire HFS response) or the steady-state depolarization (average over last 50 ms) observed during the initial tetanus for control, Me2SO- and PD 098059-treated slices (Integral: (control: 100 ± 6.5%,n = 6; Me2SO: 88 ± 12%,n = 4; PD 098059: 100.5 ± 13.5%,n = 6). Steady-state depolarization: (control: 100 ± 7.8%, n = 6; Me2SO: 88 ± 14%,n = 4; PD 098059: 97.4 ± 11.7%,n = 6)). Overall, these results demonstrate that PD 098059 does not affect basal synaptic transmission, NMDA receptor-mediated responses, or HFS-mediated depolarization. Previous reports have demonstrated that PD 098059 shows a high degree of selectivity for MEK, because 50 μm PD 098059 did not alter the activity of over 20 protein kinases, including serine/threonine kinases such as PKC, PKA, c-Raf, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (8Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar, 9Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). We replicated and extended these observations by testing the effect of PD 098059 on the activity in vitro of three kinases required for LTP induction: PKA, PKC, and CaMKII. PD 098059 (used at concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 μm) did not affect the activity of these protein kinases (data not shown), suggesting that PD 098059 does not attenuate LTP induction by inhibiting any of these three protein kinases previously implicated in LTP induction. Ongoing kinase activity is thought to underlie LTP expression (13Malinow R. Madison D.V. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 14Wang J.H. Feng D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2576-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and both PKC and CaMKII are persistently activated during LTP expression (15Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24253-24256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ongoing MEK activation is required for LTP expression, we examined the effect of PD 098059 on established LTP in area CA1. In these experiments, stable LTP was elicited in six of six slices using the modest induction protocol, and PD 098059 was applied for 1 h beginning 30 min after tetanization. PD 098059 had no effect on LTP expression (Fig.4 A). Consistent with these observations, PD 098059 also had no effect upon the expression of LTP elicited with the stronger induction paradigm (not shown). Note that a 1-h application of PD 098059 is sufficient for complete reversal of basal p42 MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1). These results suggest that ongoing activation of the MAPK cascade is not necessary for LTP expression. One important caveat to this conclusion, however, is that MAPKs, like PKC and CaMKII, can be persistently activated via phosphorylations (18Murphy T.H. Blatter L.A. Bhat R.V. Fiore R.S. Wier W.G. Baraban J.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1320-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MEK inhibition would have no effect on persistently activated MAPKs, it remains a possibility that persistently activated MAPKs contribute to LTP expression. We tested this hypothesis by examining p42 MAPK activation levels during LTP expression. No difference in either phosphotyrosine or phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity for p42 MAPK was observed between control and LTP samples taken 45 min following delivery of the strong HFS paradigm, indicating that p42 MAPK is not persistently activated during LTP expression (Fig. 4,B and C; normalized p42 MAPK phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity: 114 ± 20% of control; n = 6; not significant). The abundant expression of MAPKs in mature neurons of the developed nervous system suggests a specialized function for the MAPK cascade in these postmitotic cells. At present, however, little is known regarding either the regulatory mechanisms or physiologic roles of MAPKs in neurons. Using both electrophysiology and biochemistry, we have found that the MAPK cascade is involved in the activity-dependent modulation of synaptic strength, the leading candidate for the neuronal basis of information storage. In particular, we have identified p42 MAPK as a critical component of the biochemical cascades that underlie the induction of hippocampal long term potentiation. Finally, it is well established that important early events in LTP induction include NMDA receptor stimulation, subsequent postsynaptic calcium influx, and the initiation of several protein kinase cascades. MAPKs appear to be localized in both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures (4Fiore R.S. Bayer V.E. Pelech S.L. Posada J. Cooper J.A. Baraban J.M. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Jovanovic J.N. Benfenati F. Siow Y.L. Sihra T.S. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3679-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and are thus well positioned to participate in these early events. Interestingly, consideration of several MAPK substrates suggest possible functions of MAPKs in these induction cascades: generation of putative retrograde messengers (e.g. cytosolic phospholipase A2 and the formation of arachadonic acid/platelet-activating factor) (20Lin L.-L.

In short, the necessity of MAPK activation for LTP induction and the known localization of MAPKs in postmitotic neurons strongly suggest that MAPKs play a critical role in LTP induction cascades. An important step in understanding the function of MAPKs in the strengthening of synaptic connections will be the determination of which MAPK substrates are utilized during LTP.

The acoustic properties of phonetic units in language input to young infants in the United States, Russia, and Sweden were examined. In all three countries, mothers addressing their infants produced acoustically more extreme vowels than they did when addressing adults, resulting in a “stretching” of vowel space. The findings show that language input to infants provides exceptionally well-specified information about the linguistic units that form the building blocks for words."
https://openalex.org/W1642524132,"Several members of the chemokine-receptor family serve, in conjunction with CD4, as receptors for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) into cells1,2,3,4,5,6. The principal receptor for entry of macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains is CCR5, whereas that for T-cell-line-tropic (T-tropic) strains is CXCR4. Unlike HIV-1, infection with either M-tropic or T-tropic strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can be mediated by CCR5, but not CXCR4 (refs 7, 8, 9, 10). SIV strains will also infect CD4+ cells that lack CCR5, which suggests that these strains use as yet unidentified receptors7,9,10. Here we use an expression-cloning strategy to identify SIV receptors and have isolated genes encoding two members of the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor family that are used not only by SIVs, but also by strains of HIV-2 and M-tropic HIV-1. Both receptors are closely related to the chemokine-receptor family and are expressed in lymphoid tissues. One of the receptors is also expressed in colon and may therefore be important in viral transmission. Usage of these new receptors following experimental infection of non-human primates with SIV strains may provide important insight into viral transmission and the mechanisms of SIV- and HIV-induced acquired immune-deficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2047604959,"The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the stress-activated group of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that are implicated in the control of cell growth. A murine cytoplasmic protein that binds specifically to JNK [the JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1)] was characterized and cloned. JIP-1 caused cytoplasmic retention of JNK and inhibition of JNK-regulated gene expression. In addition, JIP-1 suppressed the effects of the JNK signaling pathway on cellular proliferation, including transformation by the Bcr-Abl oncogene. This analysis identifies JIP-1 as a specific inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway and establishes protein targeting as a mechanism that regulates signaling by stress-activated MAP kinases."

Bx1 encodes a tryptophan synthase α homolog that catalyzes the formation of indole for the production of secondary metabolites rather than tryptophan, thereby defining the branch point from primary to secondary metabolism. Bx2 through Bx5 encode cytochrome P450–dependent monooxygenases that catalyze four consecutive hydroxylations and one ring expansion to form the highly oxidized DIBOA."

https://openalex.org/W2142980049,"Mice lacking the gene encoding the receptor for prostaglandin F2alpha (FP) developed normally but were unable to deliver normal fetuses at term. Although these FP-deficient mice showed no abnormality in the estrous cycle, ovulation, fertilization, or implantation, they did not respond to exogenous oxytocin because of the lack of induction of oxytocin receptor (a proposed triggering event in parturition), and they did not show the normal decline of serum progesterone concentrations that precedes parturition. Ovariectomy at day 19 of pregnancy restored induction of the oxytocin receptor and permitted successful delivery in the FP-deficient mice. These results indicate that parturition is initiated when prostaglandin F2alpha interacts with FP in ovarian luteal cells of the pregnant mice to induce luteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1529816420,"The TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-related signalling proteins, including Decapentaplegic (Dpp) in Drosophila and bone morphogenic proteins and activin in vertebrates, affect the growth and patterning of a great variety of structures. However, the mechanisms by which these ligands regulate gene expression are not understood. Activation of complexes of type I with type II receptors results in the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of members of the SMAD protein family1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, which are thought to act as co-activators of transcription, perhaps in conjunction with sequence-specific cofactors10. Here we show that the amino-terminal domain of the Drosophila Mothers against dpp protein (Mad), a mediator of Dpp signalling11,12,13,14, possesses a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity that becomes apparent when carboxy-terminal residues are removed. Mad binds to and is required for the activation of an enhancer within the vestigial wing-patterning gene in cells across the entire developing wing blade. Mad also binds to Dpp-response elements in other genes. These results suggest that Dpp signalling regulates gene expression by activating Mad binding to target gene enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W1995016873,"The distance dependence of photoinduced electron transfer in duplex DNA was determined for a family of synthetic DNA hairpins in which a stilbene dicarboxamide forms a bridge connecting two oligonucleotide arms. Investigation of the fluorescence and transient absorption spectra of these hairpins established that no photoinduced electron transfer occurs for a hairpin that has six deoxyadenosine-deoxythymidine base pairs. However, the introduction of a single deoxyguanosine-deoxycytidine base pair resulted in distance-dependent fluorescence quenching and the formation of the stilbene anion radical. Kinetic analysis suggests that duplex DNA is somewhat more effective than proteins as a medium for electron transfer but that it does not function as a molecular wire."
https://openalex.org/W1624420511,"The factors determining disease severity in malaria are complex and include host polymorphisms, acquired immunity and parasite virulence. Studies in Africa have shown that severe malaria is associated with the ability of erythrocytes infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to bind uninfected erythrocytes and form rosettes. The molecular basis of resetting is not well understood, although a group of low-molecular-mass proteins called rosettins have been described as potential parasite ligands. Infected erythrocytes also bind to endothelial cells, and this interaction is mediated by the parasite-derived variant erythrocyte membrane protein PfEMP1, which is encoded by the var gene family. Here we report that the parasite ligand for rosetting in a P. falciparum clone is PfEMP1, encoded by a specific var gene. We also report that complement-receptor 1 (CR1) on erythrocytes plays a role in the formation of rosettes and that erythrocytes with a common African CR1 polymorphism (S1(a-)) have reduced adhesion to the domain of PfEMP1 that binds normal erythrocytes. Thus we describe a new adhesive function for PfEMP1 and raise the possibility that CR1 polymorphisms in Africans that influence the interaction between erythrocytes and PfEMP1 may protect against severe malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2135114842,"Many receptors that couple to heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) have been shown to mediate rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2. In different cell types, the signaling pathways employed appear to be a function of the available repertoire of receptors, G proteins, and effectors. In HEK-293 cells, stimulation of either α1B- or α2A-adrenergic receptors (ARs) leads to rapid 5–10-fold increases in Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in response to stimulation of the α2A-AR is effectively attenuated by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or by coexpression of a Gβγ subunit complex sequestrant peptide (βARK1ct) and dominant-negative mutants of Ras (N17-Ras), mSOS1 (SOS-Pro), and Raf (ΔN-Raf). Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to α1B-AR stimulation is also attenuated by coexpression of N17-Ras, SOS-Pro, or ΔN-Raf, but not by coexpression of βARK1ct or by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The α1B- and α2A-AR signals are both blocked by phospholipase C inhibition, intracellular Ca2+chelation, and inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src or of the negative regulator of c-Src function, Csk, results in attenuation of the α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 signals. Chemical inhibitors of calmodulin, but not of PKC, and overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of the protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 also attenuate mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation after both α1B- and α2A-AR stimulation. Erk1/2 activation, then, proceeds via a common Ras-, calcium-, and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway for both Gi- and Gq/11-coupled receptors. These results indicate that in HEK-293 cells, the Gβγ subunit-mediated α2A-AR- and the Gαq/11-mediated α1B-AR-coupled Erk1/2 activation pathways converge at the level of phospholipase C.

While the effects of these receptors on intermediary metabolism have been extensively studied, recent data have suggested that they play important roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases represent a point of convergence for cell surface signals regulating cell growth and division. The MAP kinases comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1 and Erk2, the Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 mapk (5Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). MAP kinases are regulated via protein phosphorylation cascades whose basic pattern has been highly conserved throughout evolution. In the mammalian Erk1/2 pathway, the proximal kinases Raf-1 and B-Raf phosphorylate and activate the dual function threonine/tyrosine kinases MAP/Erk kinases 1 and 2, which in turn phosphorylate Erk1/2. Once phosphorylated, activated Erk1/2 translocate to the cell nucleus, where they phosphorylate and activate nuclear transcription factors (6Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The signal transduction pathways employed by these receptors are heterogeneous.

In contrast, receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins mediate Erk1/2 activation via a Gα subunit pathway that is p21 ras-independent and may involve PKC (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

This pathway differs markedly from the Gq/11-coupled receptor-mediated p21ras-independent MAP kinase activation that has been described in COS-7 cells (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterize the mechanisms of Erk1/2 activation employed by the Gi-coupled α2A- and by the Gq/11-coupled α1B-adrenergic receptors, heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. We find that both receptors mediate p21 ras-dependent Erk1/2 activation via phospholipase C and calcium-dependent activation of Src family kinases. These data suggest that, in some cell types, the Gβγ subunit complex-dependent α2A-AR and Gαq/11 subunit-dependent α1B-AR signals converge at the level of PLC and proceed via a common, p21 ras-dependent, signaling pathway.

Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was detected by protein immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific MAP kinase IgG (New England Biolabs) with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) as secondary antibody. Quantitation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation was performed after development of membranes with Vistra ECF reagent (Amersham) by scanning on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After scanning, membranes were treated for 30 min with 40% methanol to remove the Vistra ECF reagent, stripped by treatment with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C, and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to quantitate total p42 mapk. LPA receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation in Rat-1 fibroblasts is mediated by Gβγ subunits derived from PTX-sensitive G proteins (33Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and is independent of changes in intracellular cAMP, calcium, or PKC (23van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, stimulation of endogenous LPA or thrombin receptors in these cells resulted in a 3–6-fold increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which was completely inhibited by treatment with PTX. Acute activation of PKC by treatment with phorbol ester resulted in a less than 2-fold increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in a less than 2-fold increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation. HEK-293 cells exhibit a distinct pattern of Erk1/2 activation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Erk1/2 phosphorylation via endogenous LPA and thrombin receptors is mediated via both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins in these cells. LPA and thrombin induce a similar 8–10-fold increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Like Rat-1 cells, the LPA signal is PTX-sensitive. In contrast, the thrombin receptor mediates PTX-insensitive Erk1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that a distinct Erk1/2 activation pathway, mediated by PTX-insensitive G proteins, exists in these cells. Also, acute stimulation of HEK-293 cells with phorbol ester or with A23187 resulted in 24- and 15-fold stimulations of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, respectively, in stark contrast to the above results obtained in Rat-1 cells. To characterize the mechanisms of Erk1/2 activation via PTX-sensitive and insensitive G proteins in HEK-293 cells, we employed a transiently transfected model system in which Gi-coupled α2A-AR and Gq/11-coupled α1B-AR were heterologously expressed. As shown in Fig. 2 A, stimulation of the α2A-AR resulted in PTX-sensitive Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while α1B-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to stimulation was insensitive to pretreatment with PTX. Since Gβγ subunits mediate Erk1/2 activation by several GPCRs, we determined whether cellular expression of a Gβγ-sequestrant polypeptide derived from βARK1ct would inhibit α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, expression of the βARK1ct peptide attenuated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to α2A-AR, but not α1B-AR, stimulation. EGF-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not sensitive to pretreatment of cells with PTX or to overexpression of cDNA coding for the βARK1ct peptide. This suggests that the α2A-AR signals primarily via the Gβγ subunit complex from PTX-sensitive G proteins, whereas the α1B-AR signal is mediated by the Gα subunit from PTX-insensitive G proteins. As shown in Fig.2 C, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Gαq (Gαq-Q209L), but not of Gαi2 (Gαi2-Q204L), was sufficient to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of Gβ1γ2 resulted in a consistent 2-fold stimulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, unlike the 6–8-fold stimulations of MAP kinase activity observed previously in COS-7 cells (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells, α2A-AR stimulation results in Erk1/2 activation by a p21 ras-dependent mechanism, whereas α1B-AR-mediated Erk1/2 activation is insensitive to overexpression of a p21 ras dominant-negative mutant and is inhibited by down-regulation of PKC (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To determine the role of p21 ras in adrenergic receptor-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells, cDNA coding for either the α1B-AR or α2A-AR was coexpressed with cDNA coding for dominant-negative mutant forms of p21 ras (N17-Ras), mSOS1 (SOS-Pro), or p74 raf-1 (ΔN-Raf). As shown in Fig. 3, phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in response to stimulation of both the α1B-AR and the α2A-AR was attenuated in cells coexpressing N17-Ras, SOS-Pro, or ΔN-Raf. Acute stimulation with phorbol esters was attenuated by overexpression of ΔN-Raf, but not by overexpression of N17-Ras or SOS-Pro, indicating that PKC-mediated Erk1/2 activation is Ras-independent. As expected, EGF-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation was sensitive to the effects of overexpressed N17-Ras, SOS-Pro, and ΔN-Raf. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as a result of Gαq-Q209L expression was similarly attenuated in cells coexpressing N17-Ras (data not shown). These data suggest that in HEK-293 cells, stimulation of both Gq/11- and Gi-coupled receptors leads to Erk1/2 phosphorylation in a manner that is dependent upon mSOS, p21 ras, and p74 raf-1 activation. Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gβγ subunit-mediated activation of p21 ras in COS-7 cells is sensitive to inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and requires recruitment of the Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, mSOS (19van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunit effectors responsible for these signals are unknown. Since PLCβ isoforms are regulated by both Gαq/11 and Gβγ subunits and PLCβ overexpression results in Erk1/2 activation in COS-7 cells (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), we tested whether PLC activation was required for α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with the PLC inhibitor, U73122, markedly attenuated both α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Phorbol ester-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation was insensitive to the effects of U73122. The results suggest that one or more isoforms of PLC are required for both Gq/11- and Gi-coupled receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation in HEK-293 cells. Recent reports have suggested that Ras-dependent Erk1/2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (35Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and in neuronal cells (36Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) may be calcium-dependent. As shown in Fig.5, treatment of HEK-293 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in 5–10-fold increases in Erk1/2 phosphorylation, similar to that observed after 5-min stimulation of cells expressing transfected α1B- and α2A-AR. Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with the cell membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelating agent BAPTA abrogated α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated, as well as A23187-induced, Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Erk1/2 phosphorylation after stimulation of BAPTA-pretreated cells with EGF was unaffected. These data suggest that increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, resulting from Gβγ- or Gα-mediated PLC activation, is required for Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein, which supports the SH2 domain-mediated recruitment of Grb2-Sos to the plasma membrane, has been implicated in both receptor-tyrosine kinase- and GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in some cell types (37Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To test whether the calcium-dependent α1B- and α2A-AR signals in HEK-293 cells are also dependent upon tyrosine protein phosphorylation, we determined the effects of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, on α1B- and α2A-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors markedly attenuated α1B-AR-, α2A-AR-, and EGF-R-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 was also tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive, suggesting that elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. Both pertussis toxin-sensitive (38Chen Y. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and -insensitive (39Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) activation of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been described by several laboratories, and Src activity appears to be required for Gβγ subunit-mediated Erk1/2 activation in COS-7 cells (40Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To determine whether Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells, we measured α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cells coexpressing either a catalytically inactive mutant of p60c- src, Src-K298M, or a negative regulatory protein of p60c- src, p50 csk, which phosphorylates and inactivates p60c- src (41Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 B, overexpression of either a constitutively activated mutant form of p60c- src (Src-Y530F) or of wild-type p60c- src in HEK-293 cells was sufficient to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6 C, overexpression of either Src-K298M or p50 csk significantly attenuated Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by either α1B-AR and α2A-AR stimulation or treatment with calcium ionophore. Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by acute stimulation with phorbol ester or by overexpression of wild-type c-Src was unaffected. The inability of overexpressed p50 csk to significantly inhibit Erk1/2 phosphorylation mediated by overexpressed wild-type c-Src probably reflects ineffective competition between the two overexpressed proteins. These data suggest that both α1B- and α2A-AR signals in HEK-293 cells are calcium-dependent and mediated by Src family tyrosine kinase activity. Acute stimulation of PKC with phorbol ester is sufficient to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells. Unlike the α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated signals, the acute PMA signal is insensitive to the effects of N17-Ras, SOS-Pro, overexpressed p50 csk, Src-K298M, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig.7, the PKC inhibitor GFX, which abolished acute PMA-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, had no effect on Erk1/2 phosphorylation after stimulation of cells with adrenergic agonists, EGF, or calcium ionophore. Similar results were obtained through down-regulation of endogenous PKC expression after chronic treatment of cells with phorbol ester. These data suggest that PKC activation mediates Erk1/2 phosphorylation via a pathway that is distinct from the calcium- and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway employed by α1B- and α2A-ARs. Calcium-dependent activation of a novel focal adhesion kinase family protein-tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, has been shown to mediate calcium ionophore-, phorbol ester-, and Gq/11-coupled receptor-stimulated Erk1/2 activation in neuronal cells (36Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) via a direct interaction with c-Src (42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Although Pyk2 is expressed at high levels only in cells of neuronal origin (36Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), it is possible that this or a related kinase might link calcium flux to tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in other cell types. However, as shown in Fig.8 A, protein immunoblots of HEK-293 cell lysates using anti-Pyk2 antisera detect only low levels of Pyk2 expression. To determine whether Pyk2 is involved in the calcium-dependent activation of Erk1/2 in these cells, α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation was assayed in cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of Pyk2 (PKM; Ref. 42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 B, Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to adrenergic receptor stimulation or treatment with calcium ionophore was significantly attenuated, with no effect on EGF- or phorbol ester-induced signals. The mechanism whereby calcium influx regulates the activity of the focal adhesion kinase family member Pyk2 is unknown. Neither Ca2+ nor PKC directly activate Pyk2 in vitro(36Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Recently, calmodulin inhibitors have been shown to inhibit p21 ras-dependent Erk1/2 activation in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (35Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To determine whether calmodulin might play a role in AR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells, we determined the effect of three different calmodulin inhibitors on α1B- and α2A-AR-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.9, pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with fluphenazine, calmidazolium, or ophiobolin resulted in marked attenuation of the phospho-MAP kinase signal, compared with Me2SO-pretreated controls. Erk1/2 phosphorylation resulting from stimulation of endogenous EGF receptors was unaffected. These data suggest that calcium-calmodulin may directly or indirectly contribute to the regulation of Pyk2 kinases and the Src-dependent activation of Erk1/2 by GPCRs. These data suggest a model for α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 activation that is mediated by calcium-dependent regulation of protein-tyrosine kinases. In HEK-293 cells, as in COS-7 cells (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), the α1B-AR-mediated signal is dependent upon the α subunit of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein, while the α2A-AR-mediated signal is sensitive to PTX treatment and is dependent upon the release of free Gβγ subunit complexes. Fig.10 depicts a model of GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells that is consistent with our data. Gαq/11- and Gβγ-dependent activation of PLC increases cytoplasmic levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, resulting in an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. High intracellular concentrations of calcium, perhaps through calmodulin, lead to activation of Pyk2 or a closely related tyrosine kinase, which regulates the activity of p60c- src. Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins, such as Shc, results in recruitment of the Grb2-SOS complex to the plasma membrane, where it catalyzes p21 ras guanine nucleotide exchange. Ras-dependent recruitment of p74 raf-1 kinase to the membrane initiates the phosphorylation cascade leading to activation of Erk1/2. In this system the Gβγ subunit- and Gαq/11 subunit-mediated pathways each require the PLCβ-dependent stimulation of calcium influx. This early convergence is distinct from findings in COS-7 and CHO cells (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and more closely resembles the calcium- and Ras-dependent activation of Erk1/2, which has been reported in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells and ventricular myocytes (35Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 43Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S.

The observation that dominant interfering mutants of p21 ras, p74 raf-1, and SOS do not fully attenuate α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation may reflect incomplete inhibition of receptor-mediated p74 raf-1 activation. Alternatively, these data may be indicative of another, p21 ras-independent, mechanism of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, as has been described for Gq- and Go-coupled MAP kinase activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 45van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M.

Activation of p60c- src is required for Gi-coupled receptor-mediated, Gβγ subunit-dependent activation of Erk1/2 in COS-7 cells (37Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and Gi- and Gq/11-coupled receptor-stimulated Erk1/2 activation in PC12 cells (42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Src family kinase recruitment into Shc-containing protein complexes has been demonstrated following stimulation of formyl-methionyl peptide receptors in human neutrophils (46Ptasznik A. Prossnitz E.R. Yoshikawa D. Smrcka A. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25204-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and following stimulation of LPA and α2-adrenergic receptors in COS-7 cells (37Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Src kinases function as key intermediates in calcium-dependent regulation of Erk1/2, mediated by both Gβγ and Gαq/11 subunits in some cell types. Collectively, these findings indicate that regulation of Src family protein-tyrosine kinase activity, potentially via multiple mechanisms, is a common requirement for GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activation. In neuronal cells, association of p60c- src with the calcium-regulated focal adhesion kinase family member Pyk2 mediates both Shc phosphorylation and Erk1/2 activation (42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Pyk2 was previously thought to be active only in neuronal cells. The detection of Pyk2 in HEK-293 cell lysates as well as the sensitivity of α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells to both the dominant negative mutant of Pyk2 and specific inhibitors of p60c- src suggest that a Pyk2-mediated Src-dependent mechanism of p21 ras activation may represent a paradigm for mitogenic signaling in a variety of non-neuronal cell types. The mechanism of Ca2+-mediated Pyk2 activation remains unclear, however, since calcium does not directly modulate Pyk2 activity (36Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Perhaps significantly, both adrenergic receptor- and calcium ionophore-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells is sensitive to chemical inhibitors of calmodulin. Eguchi et al. (35Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have suggested that calmodulin regulates Erk1/2 activation in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells. In NG108 cells, depolarization induces calcium-dependent Erk1/2 activation, which is mediated by calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (47Enslen H. Tokomitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the calcium-mediated regulation of Src family tyrosine kinases proceeds through a calmodulin-dependent mechanism. These data also suggest that, if Pyk2 directly activates p60c- src in HEK-293 cells, then perhaps calcium/calmodulin is involved in activation of Pyk2, either directly or through a calcium/calmodulin effector protein. The elucidation of GPCR-mediated mitogenic signaling pathways has revealed significant degrees of heterogeneity between cell types. In Rat-1 fibroblasts, Gi-coupled, but not Gq/11-coupled, receptors mediate tyrosine kinase-dependent Erk1/2 activation via a calcium- and PLC-independent mechanism (23van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, Gq/11-coupled receptor stimulation leads to Gαq/11-mediated activation of PKC, p74 raf-1, and Erk1/2 in a tyrosine kinase- and p21 ras-independent manner (34Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In PC12 neuroblastoma cells, both Gi- and Gq/11-coupled receptors have been shown to activate Erk1/2 via calcium-dependent regulation of p112 pyk2, p60c- src, and p21 ras (42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that calcium-dependent regulation of Ras by both Gi- and Gq/11-coupled receptors may represent a common mechanism of GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activation in many non-neuronal cell types. Indeed, Gq/11-coupled receptors mediate calmodulin inhibitor-sensitive, Ras-dependent Erk1/2 activation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (35Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), a calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase has been cloned from calf uterus (48Castoria G. Migliaccio A. Green S. Di Domenico M. Chambon P. Auricchio F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1740-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and Gq/11-coupled receptor-mediated hypertrophy of cultured rat ventricular myocytes is reportedly Ras-dependent (43Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S. Kaplan P.L. Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Characterization of receptor- and kinase-specific differences in the mechanisms of GPCR-mediated mitogenic signal transduction may permit the development of strategies for selective antagonism of distinct G protein-coupled receptor-mediated mitogenic signaling pathways, which ultimately may permit selective modulation of cell proliferation in a variety of pathophysiologic states.

https://openalex.org/W1640055584,"MinK is a widely expressed protein of relative molecular mass ∼15K that forms potassium channels by aggregation with other membrane proteins1,2,3. MinK governs ion channel activation4, regulation by second messengers5,6, and the function and structure of the ion conduction pathway7,8. Association of minK with a channel protein known as KvLQT1 produces a voltage-gated outward K+ current (IsK) resembling the slow cardiac repolarization current (IKs)9,10. HERG, a human homologue of the ether-a-go-go gene of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, encodes a protein that produces the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier (IKr)11,12. These two potassium currents, IKs and IKr, provide the principal repolarizing currents in cardiac myocytes for the termination of action potentials13,14. Although heterologously expressed HERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac IKr, a role for minK in this current is suggested by the diminished IKr in an atrial tumour line subjected to minK antisense suppression15. Here we show that HERG and minK form a stable complex, and that this heteromultimerization regulates IKr activity. MinK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is thus central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm."

These enzymes also yielded a tighter distribution of linking number topoisomers than at equilibrium. Thus, topoisomerases do not merely catalyze passage of randomly juxtaposed DNA segments but control a global property of DNA, its topology. The results imply that type II topoisomerases use the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis to preferentially remove the topological links that provide barriers to DNA segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2137075269,"Loss of expression of the hMLH1 and hPMS2 subunits of the MutL alpha-mismatch repair complex is a frequent event (9/10) in independent cisplatin resistant derivatives of a human ovarian carcinoma cell line. However, only hMLH1 mRNA is decreased in these MutL alpha-deficient lines. No alterations in the levels of the hMSH2 and hMSH6 (GTBP) subunits of the MutS alpha-complex are observed. An increase in the proportion of ovarian tumours negative for the hMLH1 subunit is observed in samples taken at second look laparotomy after chemotherapy (36%: 4/11), compared to untreated tumours (10%: 4/39). No significant difference is observed for hMSH2, hMSH6 or hPMS2. Furthermore, cisplatin and doxorubicin-resistant ovarian lines deficient in hMLH1 expression are cross-resistant to 6-thioguanine and the methylating agent N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Depletion of O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) activity confers only limited increased sensitivity to MNU. Thus the mismatch repair deficient lines retain DNA damage tolerance even after ATase depletion. The hMLH1 deficient lines also lose ability to engage G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest after cisplatin damage. Together these data suggest that loss of hMLH1 expression may be a high frequency event following exposure of ovarian tumour cells to cisplatin and may be critically involved in the development of drug resistance. Thus, the hMLH1 status of these cells appears to be highly correlated with the ability to engage cell death and cell cycle arrest after DNA damage induced by cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2092443284,"In response to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), neonatal rat cardiac myocytes exhibit a hypertrophic response. The elucidation of the IGF-I signal transduction system in these cells remains unknown. We show here that cardiac myocytes present a single class of high affinity receptors (12,446 ± 3,669 binding sites/cell) with a dissociation constant of 0.36 ± 0.10 nm. Two different β-subunits of IGF-I receptor were detected, and their autophosphorylation was followed by increases in the phosphotyrosine content of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), insulin receptor substrate 1, phospholipase C-γ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. IGF-I transiently activates c-Raf in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, whereas A-raf is activated much less than c-Raf. Two peaks of ERK activity (ERK1 and ERK2) were resolved in cardiac myocytes treated with IGF-I by fast protein liquid chromatography, both being stimulated by IGF-I (with EC50values for the stimulation of ERK1 and ERK2 by IGF-I of 0.10 and 0.12 nm, respectively). Maximal activation of ERK2 (12-fold) and ERK1 (8.3-fold) activities was attained after a 5-min exposure to IGF-I. Maximal activation of p90 S6 kinase by IGF-I was achieved after 10 min, and then the activity decreased slowly. Interestingly, IGF-I stimulates incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine (1.6-fold) without any effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation. These data suggest that IGF-I activates multiple signal transduction pathways in cardiac myocytes some of which may be relevant to the hypertrophic response of the heart.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is both an important cardiovascular risk factor epidemiologically associated with cardiac failure and a frequent pathology of major significance in cardiovascular medicine. The myocardium is composed of many different cell types with cardiac myocytes contributing the greatest protein mass.

Because these cells are terminally differentiated cells that have lost the ability to proliferate, cardiac growth during hypertrophy results primarily from an increase in cellular protein content, with little or no change in cardiac myocyte number (7Chien K. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The central features of the myocardial hypertrophic response are increases in the mass, volume, and contractile protein content of the myocytes, the induction of contractile protein gene expression, and the expression of embryonic genes and proto-oncogenes (7Chien K.

Chien K. Ross J. Circulation. 1996; 93: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). IGF-I and its receptor (IGF-IR) are present on the neonatal rat myocardium, consistent with IGF-I regulating growth and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes in the developing heart in an autocrine or paracrine manner (13Engelmann G.L. Boehm K.D. Haskell J.F. Khairallah P.A. Ilan J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 63: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IGF-I acts directly on cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes to induce myocyte hypertrophy, which leads to increases in mRNA expression and synthesis of contractile proteins (14Ito H. Hiroe M. Hirata Y. Tsujino M. Adashi S. Shichiri M. Koyke A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1715-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The administration of recombinant IGF-I enhances ventricular hypertrophy and function during the onset of experimental heart failure in the rat (15Duerr R. Huang S. Miraliakbar H. Clark R. Chien K. Ross J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 619-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cittadini A. Strömer H. Hatz S.E. Clark R. Moses A.C. Morgan J.P. Douglas P.S. Circulation. 1996; 93: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). There is also clear clinical evidence for a role of IGF-I in the initiation and development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure treated with recombinant growth hormone showed increased myocardial mass and contractile performance accompanied by a doubled serum IGF-I concentration (17Fazzio S. Sabatini D. Capaldo B. Vigorito C. Giordano A. Guida R. Pardo F. Biondi B. Sacca L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 18Sacca L. Fazzio S. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, cardiac hypertrophy develops in acromegalic patients with concomitantly increased plasma concentrations of both growth hormone and IGF-I (19Klein I. Ojamaa K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Increased plasma IGF-I concentrations have been reported in patients with hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy (20Laviades C. Mayor G. Dı́ez J Arch. Mal. Coeur Vaiss. 1991; 84: 1039-1041PubMed Google Scholar). The hypertension induces significant increases in cardiac IGF-I mRNA and protein in parallel with the onset and early development of experimental cardiac hypertrophy; this is followed by a normalization of the IGF-I mRNA once the hypertrophic response is established (21Donohue T.J. Dowrkin L.D. Lango M.N. Fliegner K. Lango R.P. Benstein J.A. Slater W.R. Catanese V.M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A very recent report has established that the overexpression of IGF-I in cardiac myocytes leads to cardiomegaly mediated by an increased number of cells in the heart (22Reiss K. Cheng W. Ferber A. Kajstura J. Li P. Li B. Olivetti G. Homcy C.J. Baserga R. Anversa P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8630-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which IGF-I exerts its growth effect on cardiac myocytes is still unknown. The IGF-IR is an α2β2 heterotetrameric protein with ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (23LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Binding of IGF-I to its receptor induces receptor autophosphorylation in the intracellular kinase domain of the β-subunit and results in activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR (24Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The predominant substrate of the IGF-IR is IRS-1, a docking protein that has multiple tyrosines in YMXM or related motifs known to associate with proteins containing SH2 domains. Phosphorylated IRS-1 regulates the activity of certain SH2 domain-containing proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (26Myers M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.-J. Shoelson S.E. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakin M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 27Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). IRS-1 also associates with other SH2 domain-containing proteins involved in growth factor signaling pathways, including Grb-2, Nck, and Syp (23LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Other phosphotyrosine substrates of the IGF-I signaling pathway are PLC-γ and Shc (23LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar); and direct association of Shc with activated IGF-IR has also been detected (28Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Shc associates with Grb-2 and subsequently, through a Grb-2·SOS (Son of Sevenless) complex, activates Ras and Raf-1, an intermediate in the Ras-ERK signaling pathway (29Boguski M.S. McConick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In the ensuing phosphorylation cascade, activation of ERKs occurs after phosphorylation by the mixed function threonine-tyrosine kinase MEK. Some of these kinases, as well as protein kinase C and RSK, can regulate the activities of a diverse array of cellular and nuclear proteins, including transcription factors. The signaling pathways of other hypertrophic agonists (endothelin and acidic fibroblast growth factor) may converge at or above the level of the ERK cascade in cardiac myocytes (30Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1110-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of the IGF-I signal transduction system, and especially the degree of involvement of the IGF-IR and the ERK cascade during the cardiac hypertrophic process, is of considerable interest and constitutes the aim of this work. Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were bred in the Animal Breeding Facilities from the National Heart and Lung Institute (London, U. K.), NIDDK (Bethesda, MD), or the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Chile (Santiago). [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]phenylalanine, and [methyl-3H]thymidine were from Amersham International (Bucks, U. K.), and 125I-IGF-I was from NEN Life Science Products. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), medium 199 (M199),n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, protease inhibitors, protein A-Sepharose, bovine myelin basic protein (MBP), and other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Culture dishes (Primaria) were from Falcon, and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and horse serum were from Sera-Lab. Other tissue culture products were from Life Technologies, Inc. Glutathione-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against COOH-terminal peptide sequences of c-Raf (CTLTTSPRLPVF) or A-Raf (CLLSAARLVP), and the corresponding peptides were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) as were the antibodies raised against IGF-IR β-subunit, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone 4G10), PLC-γ1, and RSK. The polyclonal anti-IGF-IR β-subunit antibody was raised against the COOH-terminal peptide sequence of the β-subunit of IGF-IR (AHMNGGRKNERALPLPQSST). We have also assessed that this antibody does not cross-react with insulin receptor β-subunit using different cell lines that express different numbers of insulin receptor and IGF-IR (31Blakesley V.A.

Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblotting detection reagents, autoradiographic film, and prestained molecular mass standard proteins were from Amersham International. Protein assay reagents were from Bio-Rad. Human recombinant IGF-I was donated by Drs. P. Valenzuela and C. George-Nascimento (Chiron Corp.) or was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). IRS-1 antibody was a gift from Dr. J. Pierce (NCI, NIH). Clones for GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and anti-murine ERK antibody were donated by Prof. C. J. Marshall (Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, U. K.). Recombinant murine ERK2 and MEK1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (29Boguski M.S. McConick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). For the assay of MEK phosphorylation by the immunoprecipitated protein kinases, recombinant MEK1 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to produce GST-MEK1 (R97/A291/A385), a catalytically inactive form of MEK1 in which a Lys residue essential for kinase activity is mutated (K97R) and which also lacks ERK consensus phosphorylation sequences (T291A and T385A). Recombinant GST-ERK2 was stored at −20 °C in 50% (v/v) glycerol (final protein concentration 25 mg/ml), whereas recombinant MEK1 species were stored at −80 °C in 5%(v/v) glycerol (final protein concentration 10 mg/ml). Neonatal ventricular myocytes were prepared from hearts of 1–3-day-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats as described previously (33Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricles were trisected, pooled, and myocytes dissociated in a solution of collagenase and pancreatin. After enzymatic dissociation, the cells were selectively enriched for cardiac myocytes by being preplated in DMEM/M199 (4:1) containing 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) heated-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml). The myocytes, plated at a final density of 1.0–1.4 × 103/mm2 on gelatin-precoated 35-mm or 60-mm dishes, respectively, were confluent and spontaneously beating after 18 h. Serum was withdrawn for 24 h before the cells were treated further with agonists IGF-I (0–100 nm for 0–60 min) or TPA (1 μm for 3–5 min) in serum-free medium (DMEM/M199) at 37 °C. IGF-I binding to ventricular cardiac myocytes was quantified using monoiodinated 125I-IGF-I. Confluent cardiac myocytes in 12-well culture plates were washed with 1 ml of binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated in binding buffer containing 25,000 cpm (approximately 20 pm) of 125I-IGF-I and increasing amounts of unlabeled IGF-I (0–1,000 ng/ml) for 5 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and solubilized in 0.2m NaOH before being counted with a γ-counter (GammaTrac 1290, Tm Analytic, Brandon, FL). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Confluent cardiac myocytes in 60-mm dishes were exposed to IGF-I (0–100 nm) for 0–60 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Upon completion of the exposure protocol, the medium was removed by aspiration and the cells washed twice with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free Dulbecco's PBS. Myocytes were scraped into 150 μl of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mmNaF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein content of the lysate was determined by Bradford's method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 9% gels. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm). The membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were probed with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin using an ECL system. The dilutions of the first and second antibodies were 1:1,000 and 1:4,000, respectively. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry. The amounts of IGF-IR or IRS-1 present were determined by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-IGF-IR β-subunit antibody or with polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibody as described previously (35Hernandez-Sanchez C. Blakesley V. Kalebic T. Helman L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29176-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cleared cell lysates were prepared as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μg of an anti-PLC-γ1 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Then, 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was added and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The precipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mmTris, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) and separated on 9% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1,000 dilution) or anti-PLC-γ1 (1:1,000 dilution). Both antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, respectively (1:4,000 dilution). The blots were then developed by ECL. Confluent cardiac myocytes grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated in serum-free DMEM/M199. After 24 h, IGF-I (0–100 nm) was added in fresh serum-free medium, and dishes were reincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were quickly washed once with ice-cold PBS and twice with wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4, pH 7.5). Cells were solubilized in 600 μl of wash buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.35 mg/ml PMSF. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and tyrosyl-phosphoproteins were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C. Then, 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4, twice with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm LiCl and 100 μm Na3VO4, and once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4. The pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. To each tube was added 10 μl of 100 mm MnCl2 and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol. The phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 m HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The organic phase was extracted and applied to a silica gel TLC plate. The plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The spots were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Serum-starved ventricular myocytes were exposed to agonists in serum-free medium (DMEM/M199). After the medium had been removed by aspiration, cells were washed twice with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free Dulbecco's PBS and scraped into 200 μl of cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 75 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100). Extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C); supernatant fractions were retained for assay. In control experiments, we determined that the detergent-insoluble pellets did not contain Raf isoforms as assessed by immunoblotting, and the pellets were not analyzed further. The detergent-soluble supernatants (approximately 1.5–2.0 mg protein/ml) were retained. When activation of A-Raf was directly compared with activation of c-Raf, each supernatant was divided equally. Antibodies that recognize c-Raf or A-Raf (3 μl) were added to each portion (90 (μl), and these were incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the incubation was continued for a further hour. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and twice with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Protein A-Sepharose immunoprecipitates of c-Raf and A-Raf were assayed for their activation of recombinant GST-MEK1 (36Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using a coupled assay in which GST-MEK1 activates GST-ERK2. The activity of GST-ERK2 is subsequently measured by incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into MBP. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of buffer C (30 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside] that had been supplemented with 80 μm (unlabeled) ATP, 2 μg/ml GST-MEK1, and 20 μg/ml GST-ERK2. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with intermittent mixing, then terminated by mixing 15 μl of the supernatant with 15 μl of ice-cold buffer B containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To assay the activity of GST-ERK2, 10 μl of the diluted supernatants was mixed with 40 μl of MBP phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mmEGTA, pH 8.0, containing 0.4 mg/ml MBP, 50 μm ATP, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C; the reaction was terminated by spotting onto P-81 paper, which was then washed three times in 75 mmH3PO4. Controls consisted of incubations of antibodies alone with buffer A and protein A-Sepharose; these results were subtracted from each data point. One unit of Raf activity is that amount that catalyzed the activation of sufficient GST-ERK2 to transfer 1 fmol of phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to MBP/min in the second stage of the assay. Preliminary experiments showed that no activity from IGF-I-stimulated cells was associated with the protein A-Sepharose after incubation of these detergent-soluble lysates with protein A-Sepharose in the absence of antibodies to c-Raf or A-Raf. Protein A-Sepharose immunoprecipitates of c-Raf and A-Raf were resuspended in 30 μl of buffer C containing 50 μmATP, 1 mg/ml GST-MEK1 (R97/A291/A385), and 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with intermittent mixing. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation of the immunoprecipitated kinases; 15-μl portions of supernatants were then pipetted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Preliminary experiments showed that in the absence of antibodies to c-Raf or A-Raf, no MEK phosphorylation activity from detergent-soluble lysates of IGF-I-stimulated cells was associated with the protein A-Sepharose. Ventricular myocytes were lysed in buffer A. Extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 × 10 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were applied to Mono Q HR5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, containing 0.3 mmNa3VO4, 50 μg/ml PMSF, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing with 5 ml of equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed immediately for MEK and ERK activities. ERK was assayed by the “direct” assay; supernatant samples were incubated with MBP and [γ-32P]ATP as described earlier (37Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by spotting 40 μl of the reaction mixture onto P-81 paper and washing in 75 mm H3PO4 (1 × 5 min, 3 × 30 min). Phosphate incorporation was measured by Cerenkov counting. In these assays, 1 unit of ERK catalyzes the incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate into MBP/min. MEK activity was assayed by a two-step assay using the activation of exogenous recombinant GST-ERK2 (30Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1110-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatant samples were diluted 20-fold in buffer B. After samples (10 μl) had been mixed with 5 μl of GST-ERK2 in Buffer A containing 0.04% (v/v) Brij 35, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 μm okadaic acid, the activation of GST-ERK2 was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 80 mm magnesium acetate and 0.8 μm unlabeled ATP. After 15 min at 30 °C, the activity of GST-ERK2 was assayed by the addition of 25 μl of 0.8 mg/ml MBP in buffer A containing 2.25 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 2.25 μmokadaic acid, and 5 μl of 40 mm magnesium acetate, 0.4 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi/assay). After a further 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by spotting 40 μl of the reaction mixture onto P-81 paper that was washed with 75 mm H3PO4 as described for the ERK assay above. To correct for endogenous ERK activity in samples, rates in control assays carried out in the absence of GST-ERK2 were subtracted. The autophosphorylation and autoactivation of GST-ERK2 occurring in the incubation of GST-ERK2 with ATP in these assays in the absence of cell lysates were also subtracted. One unit of MEK is the amount that, in 1 min of the preincubation in the presence of unlabeled ATP, specifically catalyzes the activation of exogenous GST-ERK2, sufficient to transfer 1 pmol of phosphate into MBP/min in th"
https://openalex.org/W1598503391,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), the long-lasting increase in synaptic transmission, has been proposed to be a cellular mechanism essential for learning and memory, neuronal development, and circuit reorganization. In the original theoretical and experimental work it was assumed that only synapses that had experienced concurrent pre- and postsynaptic activity are subject to synaptic modification. It has since been shown, however, that LTP is also expressed in synapses on neighbouring neurons that have not undergone the induction procedure. Yet, it is still believed that this spread of LTP is limited to adjacent postsynaptic cells, and does not occur for synapses on neighbouring input fibres. However, for technical reasons, tests for 'input specificity' were always done for synapses relatively far apart. Here we have used a new local superfusion technique, which allowed us to assess the synaptic specificity of LTP with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 microm. Our results indicate that there is no input specificity at a distance of less than 70 microm. Synapses in close proximity to a site of potentiation are also potentiated regardless of their own history of activation, whereas synapses far away show no potentiation."

The functional similarities between the Na+-coupled HCO3− transporters and the AE isoforms (i.e. transport of HCO3− and sensitivity to inhibition by 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid) suggested a strategy for cloning the other transporters based on structural similarity with the AE family.

In fact during the revision of this manuscript the sequence of an amphibian Na+:HCO3−cotransporter (NBC) 1The abbreviations used are: NBC, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetomethoxy ester; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; pH i, intracellular pH.1The abbreviations used are: NBC, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetomethoxy ester; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; pH i, intracellular pH. that is related to the AE family was reported 2In previously published abstracts reporting the amphibian NBC (Romero, M. F., Hediger, M. A., Boulpaep, E. L., and Boron, W. F. (1996) FASEB J. 10, A89) and a closely related rat NBC (Romero, M. F., Hediger, M. A., and Boron, W. F. (1996)J. Am. Soc.

Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We report here the isolation and functional characterization of a human kidney NBC using a cloning strategy based on its similarity to the known AE isoforms. The GenBank™ nonredundant EST data base was queried against the three known anion exchangers AE1, AE2, and AE3. A sequence with a score of 172, from a human pancreatic islet cell line (GenBank™ accession number W39298) was a close, but not an identical, match to rat AE3. A sense-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-AGG GAG CAA AGA GTC ACT GGA ACC-3′, from W39298 was synthesized, biotinylated and used in the GeneTrapper™ cDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) to screen a SuperScript™ human (38-year-old Caucasian male) kidney cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) directionally cloned in pCMV·SPORT1. The GeneTrapper™ system uses streptavidin-linked magnetic beads to enrich for sequences complementary to the biotinylated oligonucleotide. After plating, the library was screened by hybridization with 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide, and 21 positive clones were selected. The three largest unique clones were chosen for sequencing. Two of the three clones (one of approximately 5 kb and another of approximately 1.6 kb) contained the EST sequence (W39298) and also contained sequences of perfect homology to each other. An open reading frame analysis suggested that the entire coding region was not contained between the two clones. Therefore, a second oligonucleotide was synthesized (which was 5′ to the EST sequence) for a second round of GeneTrapper™ cDNA selection. The sequence of the second oligonucleotide was: 5′-CAA GCC AAC AAG TCC AAA CCG AGG-3′. A polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed using the T7 and SP6 primers to reveal the size of the cDNA inserts of 48 randomly chosen clones. The largest (with a 3.5-kb insert) overlapped the 5-kb clone by 828 base pairs, included the EST clone W39298, and contained the remainder of the open reading frame (as well as 149 base pairs of the 5′-noncoding region). Two Sse8387I restriction sites, one in the region of overlap and another in the polylinker, allowed the construction of the full-length Na+:HCO3− cotransporter clone. HEK-293 cells, grown for 24 h on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) were transfected with 8 μg of the full-length cDNA construct (in the cloning/expression vector pCMV·SPORT1) by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation (13Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar), and cells were studied 44–52 h after transfection. Changes in intracellular pH (pH i) were monitored in cells using BCECF (14Soleimani M. Singh G. Bizal G.L. Gullans J.R. McAteer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27973-27978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Amlal H. Soleimani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were loaded with 5 μm BCECF and monitored for changes in pH i using a Delta Scan dual excitation spectrofluorometer (14Soleimani M. Singh G. Bizal G.L. Gullans J.R. McAteer J.A. J.

The pH i calibration was generated using the KCl/nigericin technique. To test for the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport, cells were acid loaded by NH4+-prepulse (16Boron W.F. DeWeer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) using solution B and subsequently, solution A (Table I). The initial rate of pH i recovery was monitored in the presence of 1 mmamiloride in a solution containing both HCO3− and Na+ (solution C). To test for the presence of Cl−/HCO3− exchange, cells were switched from a chloride-containing solution (solution C) to a chloride-free solution (solution D) and examined for cell alkalinization (17Lindsey A.E.

Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence and conceptual translation of the open reading frame of the 7.6-kb Na+:HCO3− cotransporter cDNA. The nucleotide sequence encodes a protein of 116 kDa. Three potential N-linked glycosylation sites are found at amino acid numbers 592, 597, and 617. A single cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser) occurs at amino acid number 979. Protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites are indicated in Fig. 1. 149 nucleotides precede the coding region on the 5′-end and are also indicated in Fig. 1. The 4.3-kb 3′-untranslated region is not shown, but is included in the sequence as submitted to GenBank™. An amino acid comparison between the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter and AE3 illustrates significant similarity (29% identity). A hydropathy plot of the Na+:HCO3−cotransporter indicates at least nine transmembrane domains (Fig.2, lower panel). The carboxyl terminus contains a highly hydrophilic stretch of 15 amino acids (12 of which are lysine) corresponding to the extreme hydrophilic region in the plot. A human multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from Clontech and probed with a 32P-labeled polymerase chain reaction product containing nucleotides 2737–2973 (the homologous region of W39298, which was common to both cDNA clones used in the construct). Fig.3 (upper panel) shows a 7.6-kb mRNA in human kidney and pancreas hybridized strongly with the probe, indicating that these tissues express relatively high amounts of the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter under basal conditions. A faint band can also be detected in human brain. The lower panel in Fig. 3 demonstrates the expression of GADPH in all lanes of the multiple tissue Northern blot, indicating that intact mRNA was present in all lanes. To determine the functional identity of the protein encoded by the cDNA, transiently transfected cells were assayed for the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport, Na+-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchange, or Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Accordingly, cells were acidified using an NH-pulse and allowed to recover in the presence of Na+ and 1 mmamiloride (to block Na+/H+ exchange). In the absence of HCO3−, transfected cells showed negligible recovery from intracellular acidosis (data not shown). In the presence of both HCO3−and sodium, control cells showed no pH i recovery from the intracellular acidification (Fig.4 A). However, in transfected cells, switching from the Na+-free solution (solution A, Table I) to the Na+-containing solution (solution C) in the presence of HCO3− resulted in a rapid recovery from acidic pH i (Fig. 4 B), with the recovery of 0.225 pH (ΔpH i of 0.225 ± 0.035 in transfected cellsversus almost 0 in nontransfected cells) (n= 5). The recovery from cell acidification was observed only in the presence Na+ and HCO3− and was completely inhibited by 300 μm DIDS (Fig.4 B), consistent with the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport. Depleting the intracellular Cl− (18Lubman R.L. Chao D.C. Crandall E.D. Respir. Physiol. 1995; 100: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) by incubating the cells in Cl−-free media (only Cl−-free solutions were used for the duration of the experiment) did not reduce the rate of Na+-dependent HCO3− movement into acid-loaded cells (Fig. 4 C), indicating that the cloned transporter is not the Na+-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (ΔpH i was 0.225 ± 0.035 in chlorine-containing cells (n = 5) and 0.28 ± 0.018 in chlorine-depleted cells (n = 4) (p > 0.05). Transfected cells, switched from a Cl−-containing solution (solution C) to Cl−-free media (solution D), demonstrated little cell alkalinization (Fig. 4 D), indicating that under physiological conditions, the cloned transporter does not function in Cl−/HCO3− exchange mode. To determine whether the cloned transporter can mediate HCO3-dependent 22Na influx, HEK 293 cells were grown in 24-well plates, acidified with NH4pulse in a manner similar to Fig. 4 A and assayed for22Na influx in the presence of HCO3−. The results showed that transfected cells mediated significant acid-stimulated DIDS-sensitive22Na influx in the presence of HCO3−, whereas nontransfected cells had no DIDS-sensitive 22Na influx (7.15 ± 0.5 nmol/mg of protein/4 min in transfected versus 0.25 ± 0.1 nmol/mg of protein/4 min in nontransfected cells, p < 0.001,n = 4). The Na+:HCO3− cotransporter can mediate the movement of HCO3− out of or into the cell, depending on the ionic composition of experimental solutions (3Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 392-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Alpern R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 79-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Aronson P.S. Soleimani M. Grassl S.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1991; 11: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, switching the Na+-containing solution to Na+-free media did not result in significant cell acidification, as would have been the case if the transporter were functioning in efflux mode. Rather, the transporter functioned only in an uptake mode. Whether lack of efflux mode was caused by low intracellular Na+ concentration, decreased membrane potential, or other mechanisms is not clear at present. The cDNA clone was identified by virtue of its significant homology with, but divergence from, the anion exchanger family. Both the homology with, and the divergence from AE3, are apparent in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence and conceptual translation of the open reading frame of the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter. The close relationship between the size of the cDNA clone (7586 base pairs, not including the poly(A) tail) and the mRNA found in human kidney indicate that the full sequence has been obtained. Tissue distribution studies show high expression levels in kidney and pancreas, with lower levels of expression in the brain. Expression in the kidney (3Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brain is consistent with functional studies (20Deitmer J.W. J. Gen Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Heart and lung do not appear to express this transporter under basal conditions despite the fact that functional studies demonstrate the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport in these tissues (18Lubman R.L. Chao D.C. Crandall E.D. Respir. Physiol. 1995; 100: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Lagadic-Gossmann D. Buckler K.J. Vaughn-Jones R.D. J. Physiol.

Functional studies upon transient expression in HEK293 cells showed that this transporter causes recovery from acute intracellular acidosis only in the presence of sodium and bicarbonate. The amiloride-insensitive pH i recovery in the presence of bicarbonate was detectable only in the presence of Na+, indicating the presence of a Na+ and HCO3−-dependent cotransport process. The Cl− independence of this cotransporter and sensitivity to inhibition by DIDS indicates that this transporter is distinct from the Na+-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchange and thus demonstrates the presence of Na+:HCO3− cotransport (Figs. 4, B and C). Functional studies have shown inhibition of Na+:HCO3− cotransport by protein kinase C and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (22Ruiz O.S. Arruda J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F560-F565PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is not surprising to find consensus sites for phosphorylation by these two enzymes. A closer look at regulation of Na+:HCO3− cotransport by casein kinase II may be warranted, since a large number of potential phosphorylation sites for this enzyme were found. In certain epithelia, such as kidney and colon, this transporter mediates the exit of HCO3− from the cell to the blood (3Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L.

Soleimani M. Grassl S.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1991; 11: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other epithelial tissues, as well as in non-epithelial tissues, sodium bicarbonate is transported from blood to the cell (18Lubman R.L.

Whether the difference in the direction of the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter movement in kidney and other tissues is due to differences in the membrane potential, cellular ionic composition in these tissues, or whether it suggests the presence of other isoforms of this transporter remains to be determined. In conclusion, a cDNA encoding a Na+:HCO3− cotransporter was cloned based on similarity of the anion exchangers to an expressed sequence tag. The Na+:HCO3−cotransporter cDNA encodes an mRNA of 7.6 kb and a protein molecular mass of 116 kDa. The Na+:HCO3− cotransporter mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including kidney, pancreas, and brain, indicating its pivotal role in cell pH regulation in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1988815880,"The naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple developmental defects and cancer susceptibility, in particular to basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Medulloblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) arising in childhood, occur in about 3 – 5% of NBCCS patients and a subset of PNETs was previously found with allelic imbalance at 9q22-q23, the region containing the gene for NBCCS (PTCH). We have analysed tumour DNA samples from 37 unrelated patients with sporadic PNETs and five medulloblastoma cell lines for PTCH mutations using an exon-by-exon single strand conformation polymorphism assay. We found three missense mutations, which affect conserved residues in transmembrane domains of the gene product and in the extracellular loop implicated in binding sonic hedgehog, one 2 bp deletion and an exon skipping splice site mutation. Most mutations were associated with the absence of the wild-type allele and were found in tumours exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci flanking PTCH. The finding of LOH at 9q22-q23 in most mutated tumours while present in only three out of 26 tumours, in which a mutation was not identified, implicates PTCH as the target gene in PNETs with LOH at 9q22-q23 and deficient PTCH in the development of a subset of these tumours. Since all observed mutations were absent in the germ-line, a sporadic medulloblastoma developing as the first symptom of NBCCS is likely to be a very uncommon event."
https://openalex.org/W2316182158,"Stimulation of B lymphocytes through their antigen receptor (BCR) results in rapid increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, which leads to a cascade of biochemical changes that initiates B cell proliferation and differentiation or growth inhibition. A novel cDNA, designed APS, encoding an adaptor protein with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a tyrosine phosphorylation site was cloned from a B cell cDNA library using a yeast two hybrid system. APS is structurally similar to SH2-B, an SH2 protein that potentially binds to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) as well as Lnk which is postulated to be a signal transducer that links T-cell receptor to phospholipase Cgamma, Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. APS expressed only in human Burkitt's lymphoma cells among cell lines we examined and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR stimulation. APS bound to Shc irrespective of stimulation and bound to Grb2 after stimulation, suggesting that it plays a role in linkage from BCR to Shc/Grb2 pathway. These results indicate that APS, SH2-B and Lnk form a new adaptor family that links immune receptors to signaling pathways involved in tyrosine-phosphorylation."

The morphology of these features, as well as the apparent decoupling gas from dust in the inner coma, suggest that an extended region of icy grains surrounds the nucleus of Hyakutake and contributes substantially to the production of volatiles. Model simulations suggest the same conclusion and indicate that the brighter arc is explainable by the presence of a trailing condensation of ice-bearing granules with a rate of volatile production approximately 23 percent of that of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2009992970,"The E6 proteins originating from the tumour-associated Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have been shown to bind to and target the tumour suppressor protein, p53, for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, in cell lines derived from cervical neoplasias, the predominant early region transcripts are spliced and encode truncated forms of E6, termed E6*. We report here that HPV-18 E6* protein will interact both with the full-length E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 and also with E6-AP, and subsequently blocks the association of full length E6 protein with p53. We also show that, as a result of this block, E6* can inhibit E6-mediated degradation of p53 both in vitro and in vivo. The biological consequences of this are increased transcriptional activity on p53-responsive promoters and an inhibition of cell growth in cells transfected with E6*. This is the first report of a potential biological function for this polypeptide and may represent a means by which HPV is able to modulate the activity of the full-length E6 protein with respect to p53 during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2046274523,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors are phosphorylated by kinases that mediate agonist-dependent receptor deactivation. Although many receptor kinases have been isolated, the corresponding phosphatases, necessary for restoring the ground state of the receptor, have not been identified. Drosophila RDGC (retinal degeneration C) is a phosphatase required for rhodopsin dephosphorylation in vivo. Loss of RDGC caused severe defects in the termination of the light response as well as extensive light-dependent retinal degeneration. These phenotypes resulted from the hyperphosphorylation of rhodopsin because expression of a truncated rhodopsin lacking the phosphorylation sites restored normal photoreceptor function. These results suggest the existence of a family of receptor phosphatases involved in the regulation of G protein–coupled signaling cascades."

https://openalex.org/W2327896526,"The inappropriate activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) has been associated with initiation and progression of several types of human cancers. We therefore postulated that immortalization by DNA tumor viruses results in the induction of PTKs fundamental to these processes. An RT-PCR-based screen was thus used to identify PTKs that were abundantly expressed in HPV-18-immortalized epithelial cells and HPV-containing carcinoma cell lines. One of the genes isolated in this screen was the focal adhesion kinase (FAK; pp125FAK), a cytoplasmic protein kinase that is activated in v-src transformed cells or by stimulation with mitogenic polypeptides. FAK also becomes catalytically active upon integrin engagement with extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin. We found that FAK expression and activity were significantly elevated in HPV-18 E6/E7-immortalized human genital epithelial cells relative to their primary cell counterparts. Protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the putative FAK substrate, paxillin, were also notably increased upon HPV-18 immortalization of genital epithelial cells and in HPV-containing cervical carcinoma cell lines. Most significantly, these cells expressed markedly higher levels of both intracellular and extracellular fibronectin, thus providing a mechanism for activation of FAK and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. These findings suggest a role for the integrin/FAK-mediated signaling pathway in cervical carcinogenesis and represent one of the first demonstrations of a tyrosine kinase whose activity is elevated following viral immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2329224618,"Apoptosis and necrosis, two morphologically distinct forms of cell death, can be induced by common stimuli depending on the doses and the cell type. This study compares the protective effect of oncoprotein Bcl-2 and of the small stress protein Hsp27 on these two types of cell death. We use rat embryo fibroblasts conditionally immortalized by the tsA58 mutant of SV40 large T antigen as parental cells to develop cell lines carrying inducible bcl-2 or hsp27 genes. Two apoptotic stimuli were used: shift to the restrictive temperature that induced p53-mediated apoptosis and treatment with low doses of hydrogen peroxide. Necrosis was induced by high doses of hydrogen peroxide. Although Bcl-2 and Hsp27 protect these cells from necrotic death, only Bcl-2 appears capable of preventing apoptotic death. Bcl-2 protection is not mediated by a negative effect on the induction of the p53 responsive genes bax or waf1 but it slows down at least two stages of apoptosis: decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent morphological changes. In contrast, although Hsp27 has been recently shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by various stimuli, its overexpression has no effect on apoptosis in this cell system. It should be also noticed that the apoptotic stimuli (temperature shift or hydrogen peroxide treatment) induce Hsp27, but not Bcl-2 accumulation suggesting that, in parental cells, Hsp27 might already provide some protection. However, taken together these results suggest that Hsp27, as well as Bcl-2, acts at several levels to inhibit cell death, but that their protective functions only partially overlap."
https://openalex.org/W2044114396,"Transfection and transgenic mouse experiments supported an oncogenic role for cyclin D1 in breast cancer. We recently reported that noninvasive carcinoma in situ lesions of the human breast overexpress cyclin D, suggesting that this molecular event may represent a valuable target for chemoprevention. The purpose of the present series of investigations was to identify agents which could reduce the cyclin D expression of breast cells. We report that 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) and all trans retinoic acid (tRA) inhibited the cyclin D1 and D3 expression levels of human MCF-7, ZR-75 and T-47D breast carcinoma cells in vitro. Where detectable, similar trends were observed in the immortalized, HBL-100 and MCF-10A breast cell lines. Cyclin D2 was undetectable. The effect of retinoids was both dose- and time-dependent, and correlated with altered cell cycle kinetics and proliferative status. Retinoids were also found to inhibit the expression levels of other cell cycle related proteins, including Cdk2 and Cdk4, resulting in lower kinase activities. In contrast to other breast prevention studies, no synergistic effect was observed with retinoids and tamoxifen. The data indicate that retinoids can potently reduce cyclin D expression levels in a variety of breast cell lines in vitro, and suggest further consideration of this mechanism for the chemoprevention of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2041123249,"Normal human breast epithelial (HBE) cells which reached confluence ceased growth and tightly adhered to each other, forming a monolayer. In quiescent cells thus arrested by density, E-cadherin colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with α- and β-catenins in the boundary region between adjacent cells. By contrast, immunocytostaining and Western blot analyses revealed that E-cadherin colocalized and coprecipitated with β-catenin but not with α-catenin in exponentially growing cells at low density. As a comparable amount of α-catenin was detected in the total cell lysate of cells at different densities, it is suggested that α-catenin is present but dissociates from the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex in growing cells. β-Catenin was tyrosine phosphorylated in growing cells at low density but not in quiescent cells at confluence. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of β-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of α-catenin from E-cadherin. Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of β-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of α-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of α-catenin from E-cadherin. β-Catenin thus phosphorylated at tyrosine is suggested to play the role in preventing α-catenin once dissociated from reassociating with E-cadherin until cells reach confluence."
https://openalex.org/W2313812356,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 has a transcriptional activation activity thought to mediate its biologic function including G1 arrest and perhaps apoptosis. To learn more about p53's transactivator function in vivo, we performed genomic footprinting experiments examining p53-DNA interactions in the regulatory regions of the p53-regulated genes p21, GADD45, and MDM2. Using ionizing radiation to induce DNA damage in human ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, the promoter and intronic regions of these genes containing p53-consensus binding sites were examined for in vivo footprints. There was a uniform and sustained expression of p53 protein as well as a strong induction of p21, GADD45, and MDM2 mRNA following irradiation. At the two p53 consensus binding sites in the p21 promoter, reduced DNaseI cleavage was observed in irradiated cells beginning 1 to 2 h after irradiation, being most pronounced after 2 h and diminishing after 8 h. A partial in vivo footprint was also observed in the third intron of the GADD45 gene beginning 2 h after irradiation. No in vivo footprints were seen at the two p53 binding sites in the MDM2 gene. Our study provides direct evidence that the DNA damage-induced activity of p53 is mediated by its consensus DNA binding sites in the p21 and GADD45 genes. We suggest that the transient nature and relative instability of p53-DNA interactions in vivo may make the p53 protein more accessible to a rapid turnover pathway which might be impaired under conditions when the protein is stably bound to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2006928935,"Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) in mammalian cells is synthesized through the exchange of free l-serine for the polar head group (base) of preexisting phospholipid.

In this study, we cloned a CHO cDNA, designated aspssB, which encodes a protein exhibiting 32% amino acid sequence identity with CHO PSS I. Introduction of the pssBcDNA into CHO-K1 cells resulted in striking increases in both the serine and ethanolamine base exchange activities. In contrast to the PSS I cDNA, the pssB cDNA was incapable of increasing the choline base exchange activity.

ThepssB cDNA was found to transform a PtdSer-auxotrophic PSS I-lacking mutant of CHO-K1 cells to PtdSer prototrophy. The PtdSer content of the resultant transformant grown without exogenous PtdSer for 2 days was 4-fold that of the mutant and similar to that of CHO-K1 cells, indicating that the pssB cDNA complemented the PtdSer biosynthetic defect of the PSS I-lacking mutant. These results suggested that the pssB cDNA encoded the second PtdSer synthase PSS II, which catalyzed the serine and ethanolamine base exchange, but not the choline base exchange.

To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway and biological function of PtdSer, we previously isolated a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant that requires exogenous PtdSer for cell growth (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This PtdSer-auxotrophic mutant, PSA-3, is strikingly defective in PtdSer biosynthesis, and its cell extract exhibits an about 50% decrease in the activity of the exchange between freel-serine and the polar head group (base) of preexisting phospholipids for PtdSer formation (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parental CHO-K1 cells, but not the mutant cells, have the ability to use phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) as a phosphatidyl donor for serine base exchange (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PtdCho, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is used by both the CHO-K1 and mutant cells as a phosphatidyl donor for serine base exchange (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant has been shown to grow normally in a growth medium supplemented with PtdEtn, synthesizing a normal amount of PtdSer (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings led us to conclude that PtdSer in CHO cells is synthesized through serine base exchange, which is catalyzed by two kinds of PtdSer synthase (PSS): one, PSS I, which is absent in mutant PSA-3, can use PtdCho as a substrate; and the other, PSS II, uses PtdEtn but not PtdCho as a substrate.PSS I appears to contribute to the formation of both PtdSer and PtdEtn because mutant PSA-3 grown without exogenous phospholipids exhibited decreased levels of both PtdSer and PtdEtn (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been suggested that much of the PtdEtn in CHO cells is synthesized through the decarboxylation of PtdSer (3Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), PtdSer synthesized by PSS I probably serves as an essential precursor of PtdEtn.A CHO cDNA (designated as pssA) which complements the PSS I defect of mutant PSA-3 has been isolated (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With antibodies raised against synthetic pssA peptides, we recently provided several lines of evidence that the pssA cDNA encodes PSS I (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PSS I deduced from the cDNA sequence is composed of 471 amino acid residues and has several potential membrane-spanning domains (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to serine base exchange, PSS I catalyzes the exchange of the base moiety of phospholipid(s) for choline and ethanolamine in cell extracts (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting with an anti-(pssA peptide) antibody indicated that PSS I is enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes and microsomal membranes (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Although the function and structure of PSS I are being elucidated, as described above, less is known concerning PSS II, since neither the mutant nor the gene has been isolated. To address the role of PSS II in PtdSer metabolism and its biological significance, we have attempted to isolate the cDNA of PSS II. Here, we describe the cloning of the PSS II cDNA.DISCUSSIONWe have shown the presence of two different enzymes catalyzing the serine base exchange for PtdSer formation in CHO-K1 cells (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A CHOpssA cDNA encoding one of the enzymes, PSS I, has been isolated by means of genetic complementation with a PSS I-lacking mutant, PSA-3 (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Introduction of the pssA cDNA into the mutant leads to increases in choline and ethanolamine base exchange activities, in addition to an elevation of the serine base exchange activity (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have tried to isolate the cDNA of the second PSS, on the assumption that the second PSS is similar in sequence to PSS I. A CHO pssB cDNA isolated here encodes a protein showing a high (32%) amino acid sequence identity with thepssA-encoding PSS I. Transient transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the pssB cDNA results in a 6-fold increase in the serine base exchange activity. The pssB-transfected cells also exhibit a 10-fold elevated ethanolamine base exchange activity. However, the pssB cDNA is incapable of elevating the choline base exchange activity, in contrast to the pssAcDNA. The expression of the pssB gene in Sf9 insect cells also results in striking increases in both serine and ethanolamine base exchange activities. When the pssBcDNA is introduced into the mutant PSA-3, the mutant recovers a normal level of PtdSer biosynthesis. These results suggest that thepssB cDNA encodes the second PtdSer synthase PSS II, which catalyzes the serine and ethanolamine base exchange but not the choline base exchange.Both the pssB and pssA proteins deduced from the cDNA sequences have several potential membrane-spanning domains, consistent with the fact that the serine and choline base exchange enzymes are firmly embedded in membranes (14Kanfer J.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, thepssB protein has a Met-Arg-Arg-Ala-Glu sequence, which corresponds to an NH2-terminal double arginine motif known as an ER targeting signal (13Schutze M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although the pssA protein does not have the double arginine motif, it has a unique Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Lys sequence at its COOH terminus, which is similar to another ER targeting motif, a COOH-terminal double lysine motif (Lys-X-Lys-X-X orX-X-Lys-Lys-X-X) (15Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of these sequences, the serine and choline base exchange activities are recovered in a microsomal fraction containing the bulk of ER and in a mitochondria-associated membrane fraction containing a subfraction of ER (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Vance J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).PtdSer can be synthesized by the exchange of l-serine with the base moiety of both PtdCho and PtdEtn in CHO-K1 cells (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutant PSA-3 defective in the conversion of PtdCho to PtdSer is incapable of synthesizing a normal amount of PtdSer (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the exchange of the choline moiety of PtdCho with l-serine appears to be a major route for PtdSer formation in CHO-K1 cells. Although the pssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant remains defective in the conversion of PtdCho to PtdSer, the transformant produces a normal amount of PtdSer. The transformant shows striking increases in both activities of serine base exchange and ethanolamine base exchange, which is supposed to be the reverse reaction of PtdSer formation from PtdEtn. These results suggest that the majority of PtdSer in thepssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant is produced through the exchange of the ethanolamine moiety of PtdEtn withl-serine.PtdEtn can be synthesized by three pathways. First, in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, ethanolamine is phosphorylated and converted to CDP-ethanolamine, and then the phosphoethanolamine moiety is transferred to diacylglycerol for PtdEtn formation (19Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second pathway is the decarboxylation of PtdSer. The third is the ethanolamine base exchange. PtdEtn formation through the decarboxylation and ethanolamine base exchange requires PtdSer. Thus, the exchange ofl-serine for the ethanolamine moiety of PtdEtn made by the decarboxylation and ethanolamine base exchange does not yield a net increase in cellular PtdSer content. On the other hand, the ethanolamine-serine exchange using PtdEtn produced through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway results in a net increase in cellular PtdSer content. It is therefore likely that PtdEtn produced through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway contributes to the restoration of PtdSer biosynthesis in the pssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant. Because the restoration of PtdSer biosynthesis in the transformant occurs without ethanolamine supplementation to the medium containing dialyzed newborn calf serum, the level of endogenous ethanolamine appears to be sufficient for PtdSer biosynthesis in the transformant. In contrast, in the PSA-3 mutant cultivated without ethanolamine supplementation, the level of endogenous ethanolamine appears to be insufficient for PtdSer biosynthesis because the mutant is defective in PtdSer biosynthesis unless the growth medium is supplemented with either ethanolamine or PtdEtn (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Why is the pssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant capable of synthesizing normal amounts of PtdEtn and PtdSer in the absence of ethanolamine supplementation? If the ethanolamine-serine exchange reaction is written together with the reutilization of ethanolamine for PtdEtn synthesis via CDP-ethanolamine pathway,Ethanolamine+ATP→phosphoethanolamine+ADPPhosphoethanolamine+CTP→CDP­ethanolamine+PPiCDP­ethanolamine+diacylglycerol→PtdEtn+CMPPtdEtn+L­serine→PtdSer+ethanolamineDiacylglycerol+L­serine+ATP+CTP→PtdSer+ADP+CMP+PPiREACTION 1 a catalytic amount of recycling ethanolamine is sufficient to achieve net synthesis of PtdSer from diacylglycerol andl-serine. Therefore, an increase in the overall rate of the ethanolamine cycle comprising the ethanolamine-serine exchange and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway could lead to increased cellular levels of PtdSer and its decarboxylation product, PtdEtn, without consumption of ethanolamine. Considering the above mentioned results, we speculate that the overexpression of PSS II which catalyzes the ethanolamine-serine exchange for PtdSer formation induces an increase in the overall rate of the ethanolamine cycle, thereby complementing the defect of the PSA-3 mutant in PtdSer and PtdEtn biosyntheses. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; EST, expressed sequence tag; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; EST, expressed sequence tag; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. is one of the major membrane phospholipids in mammalian cells, comprising about 10% of the total phospholipids. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway and biological function of PtdSer, we previously isolated a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant that requires exogenous PtdSer for cell growth (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This PtdSer-auxotrophic mutant, PSA-3, is strikingly defective in PtdSer biosynthesis, and its cell extract exhibits an about 50% decrease in the activity of the exchange between freel-serine and the polar head group (base) of preexisting phospholipids for PtdSer formation (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parental CHO-K1 cells, but not the mutant cells, have the ability to use phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) as a phosphatidyl donor for serine base exchange (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PtdCho, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is used by both the CHO-K1 and mutant cells as a phosphatidyl donor for serine base exchange (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant has been shown to grow normally in a growth medium supplemented with PtdEtn, synthesizing a normal amount of PtdSer (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings led us to conclude that PtdSer in CHO cells is synthesized through serine base exchange, which is catalyzed by two kinds of PtdSer synthase (PSS): one, PSS I, which is absent in mutant PSA-3, can use PtdCho as a substrate; and the other, PSS II, uses PtdEtn but not PtdCho as a substrate. PSS I appears to contribute to the formation of both PtdSer and PtdEtn because mutant PSA-3 grown without exogenous phospholipids exhibited decreased levels of both PtdSer and PtdEtn (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been suggested that much of the PtdEtn in CHO cells is synthesized through the decarboxylation of PtdSer (3Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), PtdSer synthesized by PSS I probably serves as an essential precursor of PtdEtn. A CHO cDNA (designated as pssA) which complements the PSS I defect of mutant PSA-3 has been isolated (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With antibodies raised against synthetic pssA peptides, we recently provided several lines of evidence that the pssA cDNA encodes PSS I (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PSS I deduced from the cDNA sequence is composed of 471 amino acid residues and has several potential membrane-spanning domains (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to serine base exchange, PSS I catalyzes the exchange of the base moiety of phospholipid(s) for choline and ethanolamine in cell extracts (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting with an anti-(pssA peptide) antibody indicated that PSS I is enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes and microsomal membranes (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the function and structure of PSS I are being elucidated, as described above, less is known concerning PSS II, since neither the mutant nor the gene has been isolated. To address the role of PSS II in PtdSer metabolism and its biological significance, we have attempted to isolate the cDNA of PSS II. Here, we describe the cloning of the PSS II cDNA. DISCUSSIONWe have shown the presence of two different enzymes catalyzing the serine base exchange for PtdSer formation in CHO-K1 cells (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A CHOpssA cDNA encoding one of the enzymes, PSS I, has been isolated by means of genetic complementation with a PSS I-lacking mutant, PSA-3 (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Introduction of the pssA cDNA into the mutant leads to increases in choline and ethanolamine base exchange activities, in addition to an elevation of the serine base exchange activity (4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have tried to isolate the cDNA of the second PSS, on the assumption that the second PSS is similar in sequence to PSS I. A CHO pssB cDNA isolated here encodes a protein showing a high (32%) amino acid sequence identity with thepssA-encoding PSS I. Transient transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the pssB cDNA results in a 6-fold increase in the serine base exchange activity. The pssB-transfected cells also exhibit a 10-fold elevated ethanolamine base exchange activity. However, the pssB cDNA is incapable of elevating the choline base exchange activity, in contrast to the pssAcDNA. The expression of the pssB gene in Sf9 insect cells also results in striking increases in both serine and ethanolamine base exchange activities. When the pssBcDNA is introduced into the mutant PSA-3, the mutant recovers a normal level of PtdSer biosynthesis. These results suggest that thepssB cDNA encodes the second PtdSer synthase PSS II, which catalyzes the serine and ethanolamine base exchange but not the choline base exchange.Both the pssB and pssA proteins deduced from the cDNA sequences have several potential membrane-spanning domains, consistent with the fact that the serine and choline base exchange enzymes are firmly embedded in membranes (14Kanfer J.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, thepssB protein has a Met-Arg-Arg-Ala-Glu sequence, which corresponds to an NH2-terminal double arginine motif known as an ER targeting signal (13Schutze M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although the pssA protein does not have the double arginine motif, it has a unique Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Lys sequence at its COOH terminus, which is similar to another ER targeting motif, a COOH-terminal double lysine motif (Lys-X-Lys-X-X orX-X-Lys-Lys-X-X) (15Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of these sequences, the serine and choline base exchange activities are recovered in a microsomal fraction containing the bulk of ER and in a mitochondria-associated membrane fraction containing a subfraction of ER (5Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Vance J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).PtdSer can be synthesized by the exchange of l-serine with the base moiety of both PtdCho and PtdEtn in CHO-K1 cells (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutant PSA-3 defective in the conversion of PtdCho to PtdSer is incapable of synthesizing a normal amount of PtdSer (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the exchange of the choline moiety of PtdCho with l-serine appears to be a major route for PtdSer formation in CHO-K1 cells. Although the pssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant remains defective in the conversion of PtdCho to PtdSer, the transformant produces a normal amount of PtdSer. The transformant shows striking increases in both activities of serine base exchange and ethanolamine base exchange, which is supposed to be the reverse reaction of PtdSer formation from PtdEtn. These results suggest that the majority of PtdSer in thepssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant is produced through the exchange of the ethanolamine moiety of PtdEtn withl-serine.PtdEtn can be synthesized by three pathways. First, in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, ethanolamine is phosphorylated and converted to CDP-ethanolamine, and then the phosphoethanolamine moiety is transferred to diacylglycerol for PtdEtn formation (19Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second pathway is the decarboxylation of PtdSer. The third is the ethanolamine base exchange. PtdEtn formation through the decarboxylation and ethanolamine base exchange requires PtdSer. Thus, the exchange ofl-serine for the ethanolamine moiety of PtdEtn made by the decarboxylation and ethanolamine base exchange does not yield a net increase in cellular PtdSer content. On the other hand, the ethanolamine-serine exchange using PtdEtn produced through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway results in a net increase in cellular PtdSer content. It is therefore likely that PtdEtn produced through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway contributes to the restoration of PtdSer biosynthesis in the pssB-transformed PSA-3 mutant. Because the restoration of PtdSer biosynthesis in the transformant occurs without ethanolamine supplementation to the medium containing dialyzed newborn calf serum, the level of endogenous ethanolamine appears to be sufficient for PtdSer biosynthesis in the transformant. In contrast, in the PSA-3 mutant cultivated without ethanolamine supplementation, the level of endogenous ethanolamine appears to be insufficient for PtdSer biosynthesis because the mutant is defective in PtdSer biosynthesis unless the growth medium is supplemented with either ethanolamine or PtdEtn (2Kuge O.

https://openalex.org/W2061721725,"The α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B), a guanine nucleotide exchange protein that functions in regulation of translation, was observed to associate with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the α2A- and α2B-adrenergic receptors in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library prepared from 293 cells. This protein association was confirmed in vitro by affinity chromatography and was shown to be specific for a subset of G protein-coupled receptors, including the α2A-, α2B-, α2C-, and β2-adrenergic receptors, but not the vasopressin (V2) receptor. Association of these proteins in vivo was confirmed by specific co-immunoprecipitation of eIF-2Bα with full-length β2-adrenergic receptors expressed in transfected 293 cells and by fluorescence microscopy showing co-localization of these proteins in intact cells. Remarkably, eIF-2Bα co-localized with receptors exclusively in regions of the plasma membrane that are in contact with the extracellular medium, but failed to associate with membranes making cell-cell contacts. Overexpression of eIF-2Bα in 293 cells caused a small (∼15%) but significant enhancement of β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, without affecting forskolin or V2receptor-mediated activation.

Using interaction cloning and biochemical techniques, we have observed that several subtypes of adrenergic receptors associate specifically with eIF-2Bα, 2The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. the smallest subunit of a cytoplasmic guanine nucleotide exchange factor. While this protein has a well defined role in regulation of translation, it has never been shown previously to interact with any membrane receptor. Immunocytochemical studies suggest that receptors associate with eIF-2Bα only in restricted regions of the plasma membrane, and functional studies suggest that this protein interaction may play a role in the regulation of receptor-mediated signaling. The MATCHMAKER II two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to screen a 293-cell cDNA library (complexity ∼2.5 × 106 total recombinants) constructed in pACT2 (Clontech) with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of both the murine α2A- and α2B-adrenergic receptors (13Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G.S. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 16-27PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chruscinski A.J. Link R.E. Daunt D.A. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bait plasmids were constructed in pAS2–1 (Clontech) using the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains from the α2A and α2B receptors, starting from the “NPXXY-motif” in the seventh transmembrane domain (e.g. amino acids 422–450 of the α2B receptor), which were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. Screening of ∼1 × 106 transformants yielded two independent clones (B8 and B10), which interacted with both the α2A and α2B receptor tails, but not with the lamin C control (Clontech protocol). The coding sequences of both clones were identical to human eIF-2Bα (EBI data base, accession number X95648). The full-length coding sequence of eIF-2Bα was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This construct, referred to as the M1 form, begins with the first methionine in the predicted coding sequence. Amino-terminal truncations were constructed at each of two downstream ATG codons to generate versions beginning at methionine 14 or 20 relative to the first predicted methionine and are referred to as M14 and M20, respectively. Mutant constructs included an engineeredHindIII site followed by a Kozak consensus sequence to promote initiation of translation at the selected residue (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar, 16Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Constructs were generated using PCR amplification and subcloned into pcDNA3, and sequences were verified using dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In vitrotranslation of these constructs was performed in the presence of35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Corp.) using the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Cytoplasmic receptor tails were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pGEX vector derived from pGEX-KG and expressed in Escherichia coli (17Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were prepared as described (18Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The GST-fusion protein load of individual resins was normalized by densitometric scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. For affinity chromatography of in vitro translated eIF-2Bα on the different receptor tails, 30 μl of the GST-fusion protein loaded resins (50% (v/v) suspensions) were preblocked in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 10 mg/ml ovalbumin for 15 min at room temperature. In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with the GST-fusion protein resins in binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Resins were washed four times with binding buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Carboxyl-terminally HA epitope-tagged versions of the full-length (M1) and amino-terminally truncated (M20) forms of eIF-2Bα were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3. These constructs were expressed in human embryonal kidney 293 cells (ATCC), or in 293 cells stably transfected with FLAG-tagged human β2-adrenergic receptors (19Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by transient transfection using calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection and lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. Receptors were immunoprecipitated with M1 monoclonal antibody, recognizing the FLAG epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA). Epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). HA epitope-tagged versions of eIF-2Bα were transiently transfected into a 293-cell line stably expressing the NH2-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed, and permeabilized as described (20von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα was detected using the monoclonal mouse antibody HA.11 (Babco, Richmond, CA), and β2-adrenergic receptor was detected using receptor-specific rabbit antiserum (21von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with carboxyl-terminally HA epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα and/or FLAG-epitope tagged β2-adrenergic receptor or human vasopressin V2 receptor constructs (22Pan Y. Wilson P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31933-31937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the LipofectAMINE protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells plated in 12-well plates were labeled for 18–24 h with 4 μCi/ml [2,8-3H]adenine (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated in Hepes-buffered medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with or without the indicated drugs for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP to each well. Intracellular [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP were separated subsequently on ion-exchange and alumina columns as described (23Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was expressed as the ratio cAMP/(cAMP + ATP). For receptor quantification, cells were lysed in 5 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, using a glass homogenizer. Crude membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in the same buffer. For assessment of receptor expression levels, 10-μg membrane protein aliquots were incubated with 125I-cyanopindolol (250 pm) in 75 mm Tris/HCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 3 h. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman glass fiber filters. Specific binding was defined as the amount of 125I-cyanopindolol binding inhibited by 1 μm (−)-alprenolol. Nonspecific binding represented <1% of the total binding measured. The yeast two-hybrid system (24Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar, 25Chien C. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) was used to identify candidate proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails of the α2A- and α2B-adrenergic receptors. Screening of approximately 1 × 106transformants resulted in the isolation of two independent clones that interacted specifically with both the α2A- and the α2B-tails. Both of these clones encoded the same polypeptide, a full-length form of the α-subunit of eIF-2B. eIF-2Bα is a subunit of a heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which has a well established function in regulating the initiation of protein translation by mediating GTP exchange on eIF-2 (26Konieczny A.

Biol. 1996; 54: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two products were observed by in vitro translation of this coding sequence, with apparent molecular masses of 34 and 31 kDa (Fig.1 A, first lane). Sequence analysis revealed two favorable Kozak translation initiation sequences (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar, 16Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) in the cloned cDNA (corresponding to methionines in positions 1 (M1) and 20 (M20) of the predicted amino acid sequence) as noted previously in studies of rat eIF-2Bα (30Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Feldhoff R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Jefferson L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4274-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mobility of the two translation products is in agreement with the molecular masses predicted for the M1 (33.7 kDa) and M20 (31.4 kDa) forms by sequence analysis. This was further confirmed by comparing the SDS-PAGE mobility of the translation products with those produced from amino-terminally truncated sequences (Fig. 1 A). To examine the biochemical specificity of the interaction between eIF-2Bα and receptor domains, eIF-2Bα prepared by in vitro translation was tested for specific binding to various cytoplasmic receptor tails fused to GST. Specific binding of eIF-2Bα was observed to the cytoplasmic tails of the α2A-, α2B-, α2C-, and β2-adrenergic receptor, while nonspecific binding to GST alone was negligible (Fig.1 B). eIF-2Bα did not bind to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor, indicating that eIF-2Bα interacts specifically with a subset of plasma membrane receptors. No binding was observed to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the vasopressin (V2) receptor, suggesting further that eIF-2Bα associates specifically with a limited subset of G protein-coupled receptors. Alignment of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the α2A-, α2B-, α2C-, and β2-adrenergic receptors revealed five identical amino acids (Fig. 2). However, only one of those five residues was found to be identical in the vasopressin V2 receptor. This suggests a potential role of the proximal portion of the carboxyl terminus of the adrenergic receptors in binding of eIF-2Bα. Interestingly, while both the M1 and M20 forms of eIF-2Bα were observed to bind to adrenergic receptor tails, examination of SDS-PAGE fluorographs indicated that the M20 form bound considerably more strongly (compare Fig. 1, A and B). These observations suggest that the amino-terminal domain of eIF-2Bα plays a role in mediating or regulating receptor binding. Since both the M1 and M20 forms of eIF-2Bα can be produced in vivo from the same transcript (see below), it is possible that these polypeptides may serve different physiological functions according to their different affinities for receptors. An example of this type of specificity is the Oskar protein in Drosophila, where different protein forms produced by alternative start codon usage serve distinct functions in oogenesis (31Markussen F.-H. Michon A.-M. Breitwieser W. Ephrussi A. Development ( Camb .). 1995; 121: 3723-3732PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of eIF-2Bα to bind to full-length β2-adrenergic receptors in vivo was examined by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected 293 cells. The β2-adrenergic receptor was tagged in the amino-terminal extracellular domain with a FLAG-epitope to facilitate specific immunoprecipitation of receptors using an antibody that does not interfere with the cytoplasmic tail. eIF-2Bα was HA-tagged in the carboxyl terminus to allow detection of proteins originating from alternate start codon usage. Two protein products, corresponding to the M1 and M20 forms of eIF-2Bα, were observed in transfected cells. The M1 form was by far the predominant product (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1and 2). Both forms of eIF-2Bα were co-immunoprecipitated specifically from cell lysates in association with the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6 and7). Neither form of eIF-2Bα was detected in control immunoprecipitates, including those prepared from cells expressing eIF-2Bα without FLAG-tagged receptors (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3–5), confirming the specificity of this protein associationin vivo. Interestingly, the M20 form of eIF-2Bα preferentially associated with immunoprecipitated receptors, even though the M1 form was expressed in significant excess (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 1 and 6). These data further confirm the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation and suggest that individual forms of eIF-2Bα display similar binding selectivity for full-length receptors in vivo as they do for isolated carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains in vitro. The subcellular distribution of epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα was next examined in transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. Epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα was visualized in a diffuse distribution, with increased staining intensity near the cell periphery and no detectable staining at regions of cell-cell contact (Fig.3 A), while β2-adrenergic receptors were localized throughout the plasma membrane (Fig.3 B). Immunoblotting of extensively washed membrane fractions prepared from transfected cells confirmed that a significant fraction of eIF-2Bα was membrane-associated (not shown). Optical sectioning of antibody-labeled cells by confocal microscopy revealed eIF-2Bα distributed throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus, consistent with the known role of this protein in regulating ribosome function in the cytoplasm. In addition, confocal microscopy confirmed that eIF-2Bα was also closely associated with limited regions of the peripheral plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C) which contained relatively high concentrations of β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 3 D). Marked co-localization of eIF-2Bα (green) with β2-adrenergic receptors (red) in these regions of plasma membrane was emphasized by the yellow staining in the merged image (Fig.3 E). This close co-localization, which was observed even at high magnification (Fig. 3 F), suggests that these membrane microdomains may be sites of interaction between eIF-2Bα and receptors. A similar plasma membrane localization pattern for epitope-tagged eIF-2Bα was observed in cells transfected with eIF-2Bα alone or in cells co-transfected with eIF-2Bα and the vasopressin V2 receptor (not shown). These observations and the lack of co-localization of eIF-2Bα with adrenergic receptors at regions of cell-cell contact suggest that the membrane localization of eIF-2Bα may be influenced by additional protein interactions. Nevertheless, the co-immunoprecipitation of eIF-2Bα with β2-adrenergic receptors from intact cells (Fig.1 C) suggests that these proteins physically interact at regions of co-localization. While eIF-2B has a well established role in regulating initiation of translation in the cytoplasm (27Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Kimball S.R. Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Jefferson L.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the association of this protein with receptors in the plasma membrane suggested that eIF-2Bα may have additional physiological role(s). Several proteins that associate with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of G protein-coupled receptors regulate receptor-mediated signaling. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins, causing functional desensitization by reducing the efficacy and potency of agonist-dependent signaling (1Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Fraser C.M. Lee N.H. Pellegrino S.M. Kerlavage A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid. Res. Mol.

Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that eIF-2Bα may also desensitize receptors, the effect of eIF-2Bα overexpression on agonist-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase was examined in cells expressing β2-adrenergic receptors. No inhibition of signaling was observed over a wide range of agonist concentrations, suggesting that eIF-2Bα does not increase receptor desensitization in these cells. In contrast, overexpression of eIF-2Bα actually had the opposite effect on cell signaling. Overexpression of eIF-2Bα caused a modest enhancement of receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase at high concentrations of agonist (not shown). In multiple experiments, activation of adenylyl cyclase caused by the beta agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) was enhanced by an average of 15% in cells co-transfected with HA-tagged eIF-2Bα and β2-adrenergic receptors, when compared with cells examined in parallel that were transfected with β2-adrenergic receptors and control plasmid (p < 0.01, n = 11). Radioligand binding assays using 125I-cyanopindolol indicated that eIF-2Bα overexpression had no effect on the number of β2-adrenergic receptors expressed in transfected cells (n = 4). Furthermore, no effect of eIF-2Bα overexpression was observed under the same conditions on vasopressin V2 receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase (10 μm arginine vasopressin, n = 4), on basal adenylyl cyclase activity, or on direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin (10 μm, n = 4). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that eIF-2Bα specifically enhances signaling by interacting directly with β2-adrenergic receptors, rather than by influencing receptor expression or downstream signaling components. Furthermore, the specificity of this enhancement for β2-adrenergic receptors compared with V2 receptors is consistent with the biochemical specificity of eIF-2Bα association with isolated receptor tails observed in vitro. While eIF-2Bα caused a significant and reproducible enhancement of adenylyl cyclase activation by β2-adrenergic receptors, the magnitude of this effect was relatively small (15% on average) in all experiments. It is possible that endogenous levels of eIF-2Bα in 293 cells may be sufficient to promote receptor signaling, so a relatively small enhancement is observed by overexpression of this protein. Alternatively, the effect of eIF-2Bα on receptor signaling may depend on associations with other proteins (such as other subunits of the eIF-2B heteropentamer) that are present in limiting amounts relative to overexpressed eIF-2Bα. Additional studies will be necessary to elucidate precisely how eIF-2Bα associates with the plasma membrane and enhances receptor signaling. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that additional, as yet unidentified, membrane-associated proteins influence the propagation of agonist-induced signals of G protein-coupled receptors in isolated plasma membranes (32Sato M.

In principle, it is also possible that eIF-2Bα could enhance receptor-mediated signaling by inhibiting a known mechanism of receptor desensitization (e.g. phosphorylation or arrestin binding). While the present studies have focused exclusively on the functional effects of eIF-2Bα on receptor signaling, it is also possible that this protein interaction may play an additional role in regulation of translation. This possibility is consistent with the well established role of eIF-2B in the regulation of initiation of translation and with recent studies indicating that various extracellular stimuli can control eIF-2B activity (34Welsh G.I.

In conclusion, we have shown that eIF-2Bα interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of a subset of G protein-coupled receptors. These results identify a novel protein interaction with adrenergic receptors, suggesting a new role for a previously identified guanine nucleotide exchange protein in receptor biology.

Interestingly, the N termini of two G protein α subunits, Gαq and Gα11, differ from those of other α subunits in that they display a unique, highly conserved six-amino acid extension. To test the hypothesis that this sequence element is critical for proper receptor recognition, we prepared a Gαq deletion mutant (−6q) lacking these first six amino acids. The −6q construct (or wild type Gαq as a control) was coexpressed (in COS-7 cells) with several different Gi/o- or Gs-coupled receptors, and ligand-induced increases in inositol phosphate production were determined as a measure of G protein activation. Whereas these receptors did not efficiently interact with wild type Gαq, most of them gained the ability to productively couple to −6q. Additional experiments indicated that the observed functional promiscuity of −6q is not due to overexpression (as compared with wild type Gαq) or to a lack of palmitoylation. We conclude that the N-terminal extension characteristic for Gαq/11 proteins is critical for constraining the receptor coupling selectivity of these subunits, indicative of a novel mechanism by which the fidelity of receptor-G protein interactions can be regulated.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that the C terminus of the Gα subunits is clearly not the only structural determinant on the G proteins that is critical for dictating receptor-G protein coupling selectivity (2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two G protein α subunits, Gαq and Gα11, contain a unique six-amino acid extension that is not found in other Gα subunits (Fig.1). This short sequence is highly conserved among all vertebrate species from which these subunits have been cloned so far (11Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both studies showed that Gq/11-coupled receptors such as the NK2 neurokinin (16Edgerton M.D. Chabert C. Chollet A. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the m1 muscarinic receptor (17Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A, G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were able to activate −6q in a fashion identical to WTq. Similarly, other functional properties, such as their affinity for βγ subunits and their ability to activate downstream effectors (e.g.phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)), were also found to be very similar for the two G protein subunits (16Edgerton M.D. Chabert C. Chollet A. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A, G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the N-terminal extension in WTq may play a role in maintaining the selectivity of receptor recognition, an issue that had not been addressed yet. Toward this goal, the ability of several different Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors to interact with WTq or −6q were examined in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Whereas none of the receptors (upon incubation with the appropriate agonist ligands) was able to activate WTq to a significant extent, most of the receptors gained the ability to couple to −6q with considerable efficiency (measured biochemical response: stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis). These data suggest that the N-terminal extension characteristic for Gαq and Gα11 subunits is critical for constraining the receptor coupling selectivity of these proteins. To create a construct coding for a mutant Gαq subunit lacking the first six amino acids (−6q), a pcDNAI-based expression plasmid coding for murine WTq (11Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 18Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

To generate the −6q expression plasmid, a 78-base pair syntheticBamHI-FspI fragment containing the desired deletion was used to replace the corresponding sequence in the wild type plasmid. In both plasmids (WTq and −6q), the BamHI site of the pcDNAI polylinker was immediately followed by the initiating ATG codon. Both plasmids contained a short sequence coding for an internal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (DVPDYA), which replaced WTq residues 125–130 (18Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the epitope tag did not affect the receptor and effector coupling properties of WTq (8Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for WTq or −6q (1 μg DNA/dish) and the indicated receptor cDNAs (4 μg DNA/dish) by using a DEAE-dextran procedure (20Cullen B.R.

Approximately 24 h after transfections, cells were split into 6-well dishes (∼0.4 × 106 cells/well) in culture medium supplemented with 3 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (20 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.). After a 24-h labeling period, cells were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 10 mm LiCl. Cells were then stimulated in the same buffer with the appropriate agonist ligands (1 h at 37 °C), and increases in intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP1) levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography as described (10Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a subset of experiments, transfected cells were incubated with pertussis toxin (PTX; 500 ng/ml) for the last 18–24 h of culture. Approximately 48 h after transfections, COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled for 1 h with 800 μCi/ml of [9,10-3H]palmitate (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) in 5 ml of serum-free medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide as described (29Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical nature of [3H]palmitate incorporation into G protein α subunits has been characterized earlier (18Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Cells were fractionated into particulate and soluble fractions as described (29Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (BAbCo) specific for the HA epitope was used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed using equivalent amounts of protein (2.5 mg) from total cell suspension in solubilization buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) of Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS in a total volume of 1 ml. Cell suspensions were added to the solubilization buffer and incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 30 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415 microcentrifuge to pellet insoluble material. Supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and 5 μg of 12CA5 antibody and 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-agarose (Sigma) were added followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rotator. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g in a microcentrifuge, washed twice in 1 ml of solubilization buffer containing 110 of the original detergent concentration, solubilized in 45 μl of gel sample buffer (Novex) in the absence of reducing agents, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-Gly gels (Novex), and prepared for fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorograms were exposed for 4–6 weeks at −70 °C. Immunoblotting was performed by separating equal amounts of protein (100 μg) from subcellular fractions solubilized in gel sample buffer (Novex) with 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol on 10% Tris-Gly gels (Novex), transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, probing with the 12CA5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim), and development with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with IgG as the standard. [Arg8]vasopressin, (−)-isoproterenol, and PTX were purchased from Sigma. All other ligands used in this study were obtained through Research Biochemicals Inc. Initially, a series of receptors that are preferentially coupled to G proteins of the Gi/o family (m2 muscarinic, D2 dopamine, κ-opioid, SSTR1 somatostatin, and A1 adenosine) were coexpressed in COS-7 cells with either WTq or −6q. Transfected cells were then incubated with the appropriate agonist ligands, and the ability of the different receptors to couple to the two G proteins was determined by measuring increases in inositol phosphate production (due to WTq-mediated activation of PLCβ; Refs. 31Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar and 32Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of the different Gi/o-coupled receptors with either vector DNA (pcDNAI) or WTq, followed by ligand stimulation, resulted only in a rather small increase in PLCβ activity (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.3 for the m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine receptors, this small increase in inositol phosphate production could be almost completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with PTX (500 ng/ml). Consistent with previous findings (33Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Peralta E.G. Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Capon D.J. Ramachandran J. Science. 1987; 238: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 34Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), this observation suggests that the m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine receptors do not couple to WTq to a significant extent and that the small increase in PI hydrolysis seen after stimulation of these receptors is most likely due to activation of PLCβ by G protein βγ subunits released upon receptor-mediated activation of endogenous Gi/oproteins (35Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 36Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschick P.

COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for the wild type m2 or the D2 dopamine receptor and vector DNA (pcDNAI), WTq, or −6q. Transfected cells were incubated for 1 h (at 37 °C) in the absence or the presence of the appropriate agonist ligands. The resulting increases in intracellular IP1 levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” either in the absence or in the presence of PTX (500 ng/ml). Data are given as the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate. The following ligands were used: m2 muscarinic receptor, carbachol (100 μm); D2 dopamine receptor, (−)-quinpirole (10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, coexpression of the different Gi/o-coupled receptors with −6q resulted in a significantly increased PI response (as compared with WTq) that was most pronounced in the case of the two biogenic amine receptors (m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine; Fig.2 A). These responses could only be partly blocked by PTX pretreatment (shown for the m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine receptors in Fig. 3), indicating that they were primarily due to receptor-mediated generation of activated −6q. Complete concentration-response curves for m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine receptor-mediated activation of −6q are given in Fig. 4. The EC50values (means ± S.E. of five independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate) for these responses amounted to 7.4 ± 0.3 μm in the case of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (Fig. 4 A), and to 1.4 ± 0.2 μm in the case of the dopaminergic ligand, (−)-quinpirole (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the interaction of the two biogenic amine receptors with −6q was highly efficient. We next examined the ability of three Gs-coupled receptors (D1 dopamine, V2 vasopressin, and β2-adrenergic) to functionally interact with WTq or −6q. Consistent with their known coupling profiles (37Watson S. Arkinstall S. Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-Protein Linked Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, London1994: 1-291Google Scholar), these receptors were unable to activate WTq to an appreciable extent (Fig. 2 B). However, two of the investigated Gs-coupled receptors (D1 dopamine and β2-adrenergic) gained the ability to induce a significant increase in inositol production when coexpressed with −6q (as compared with WTq; Fig. 2 B). Two previous studies have shown that Gq/11-coupled receptors such as the NK2 neurokinin (16Edgerton M.D. Chabert C. Chollet A. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or the m1 muscarinic receptor (17Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A, G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) can activate −6q in a fashion identical to WTq. Our data therefore suggest that −6q, in contrast to qWT, can be activated by receptors that are members of all three major functional classes of GPCRs. The maximum degree of PLC stimulation mediated by the bona fide Gq/11-coupled m3 muscarinic receptor (7Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) amounted to 6–10-fold (data not shown), indicating that activation of −6q by different Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors (most of which mediated a 2–6-fold stimulation of PLC activity; Fig. 2) was not optimal. This observation is consistent with the currently held notion that efficient receptor-G protein coupling involves multiple sites of contact between the receptor protein and the G protein heterotrimer (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that coexpressed −6q did not improve coupling of the V2 vasopressin receptor to PLC stimulation and that the absolute magnitude of responses mediated by −6q upon coexpression with the κ-opioid or the SSTR1 somatostatin receptor, respectively, was quite small (Fig. 2), indicating that −6q is not generally promiscuous. One possible reason for the observed differences in the ability of the studied Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors to interact with −6q may be that the relative functional importance of individual receptor-G protein contact sites may vary among different GPCRs (e.g. peptide receptors versus receptors for biogenic amines). To exclude the possibility that the promiscuous nature of −6q was simply due to exceptionally high expression levels (as compared with WTq), the subcellular distribution of the two G protein subunits was studied by cell fractionation and immunoblotting. Both Gα subunits were detected with the monoclonal antibody, 12CA5, which recognizes the internal HA epitope tag present in both proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.5 A, both G protein constructs were found exclusively in the particulate fraction; however, −6q was expressed at lower levels (approximately 10–20% of WTq, as determined by scanning densitometry; data not shown). The precise reason for this latter observation remains unclear; however, possible factors may include reduced protein stability or translation efficiency. In any case, these data exclude the possibility that the ability of −6q to be activated by multiple classes of GPCRs is due to overexpression of this subunit (as compared with WTq).

To compare the palmitoylation patterns of WTq and −6q, transfected COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid followed by immunoprecipitation of WTq and −6q by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 5 B, WTq and −6q were the only immunoprecipitated proteins, because no labeled proteins could be precipitated when cells were transfected with “empty” vector DNA.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) incorporated considerable amounts of [3H]palmitate (Fig. 5 B). The reduction in signal strength seen with −6q (approximately 10–20% of WTq, as determined by scanning densitometry; data not shown) correlated well with the reduction in −6q levels revealed by immunoblotting (Fig.5 A). This observation suggests that −6q is palmitoylated to an extent similar to that of WTq, as has been observed earlier in transfected COS-7 cells (16Edgerton M.D. Chabert C. Chollet A. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that differences in palmitoylation patterns are responsible for the different functional properties of −6q and WTq. We have shown that −6q, in contrast to WTq, can productively interact with several different Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors, suggesting that the six-amino acid extension that is unique to WTq (as well as Gα11) is critical for constraining the receptor coupling selectivity of this G protein subunit. −6q and WTq were found to be palmitoylated to a similar extent, suggesting that the functional promiscuity of −6q is not due to a lack of acylation. One possibility is that the N-terminal extension characteristic for Gαq/11 subunits constrains the receptor coupling selectivity by preventing access of Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors. Alternatively, it is conceivable that this six-amino acid sequence exerts an indirect conformational effect on the structure of Gαq/11 that is crucial for maintaining the receptor selectivity of these subunits. Clearly, this issue needs to be addressed in future studies. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which receptor-G protein coupling selectivity can be achieved and should contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of receptor-G protein interactions."

We have shown that p202, an IFN-inducible 52kDa primarily nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression in transfected cells inhibits cell proliferation, interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and the transcription factor E2F (E2F-1/ DP-1) in vitro and in vivo. p202 was shown to inhibit E2F-1/DP-1-stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and of endogenous genes. Here we report that expression of p202 inhibited E2F-4/DP-1-stimulated transcription of a reporter gene in transfected cells. Furthermore, this inhibition was associated with the inhibition of the sequence-specific DNA-binding of E2F-4 both in complex with the pocket proteins p107 or p130 and in its 'free' form in vitro. p202 bound to p107 and p130 in vitro and in vivo and also associated with E2F-4, supporting the notion that complexes containing p107/E2F-4 or p130/ E2F-4 and p202 exist in vivo. Moreover, cotransfection of E2F-4-encoding plasmid in AKR-2B cells overcame p202-mediated inhibition of cell growth, raising the possibility that p202 contributes to cell growth inhibition by the interferons, at least in part, by modulating E2F-4-mediated transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2330151932,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binds the type II TGF-beta growth factor receptor (RII) to inhibit the growth of most epithelial tissues. Most human colon and gastric cancers with microsatellite instability (MI) have frameshift mutations in polynucleotide repeats within the RII coding region; these mutations truncate the receptor protein and disable the serine/threonine kinase to produce TGF-beta resistance. To further investigate the type, frequency and tissue distribution of RII mutations, we selected 24 human cancer cell lines from various tissues which were previously reported to be resistant to the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. We developed protocols for non-isotopic SSCP analysis of PCR products from genomic DNA samples, and we tested them for microsatellite instability. PCR-SSCP analysis followed by DNA sequencing identified deletion mutations in the exon 3 poly-adenine tract in three colon tumor cell lines: LS174T and SW48 had a single base deletion and LS411 had a two base deletion. Among the 24 previously unreported cell lines, only these three demonstrated microsatellite instability. These and other recent data indicate that RII mutations are essentially confined to colon and gastric cancers with microsatellite instability. The narrow spectrum of tissues containing RII mutations illustrates the complexity of genetic checkpoints in human carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2320164363,"Raf-1 protein serine/threonine kinase has been implicated in growth and damage-responsive signal transduction pathways. Several reports indicate an important role of Ras protein in the growth factor-induced activation of Raf-1. Here we investigated the possible involvement of Ras in ionizing radiation-induced activation of Raf-1. Irradiation of MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells caused an increase in GTP-binding and hydrolysis on Ras, and co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous Grb2 with Sos and Raf-1 with Ras. An increase in the level of membrane-bound Raf-1, and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Raf-1 were observed after irradiation. Consistent with these changes, irradiation of cells stimulated the catalytic activity of Raf-1. Finally, radiation treatment of breast cancer cells led to an increase in the phosphorylation and activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase. Based on these biochemical modifications in vivo, we conclude that Raf-1 functions as an effector of Ras in the radiation-responsive signal transduction pathway leading to the activities of Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1994579379,"Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 are a common event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because HCCs typically occur in livers with chronic injury and impaired function, we have explored the role of wild-type p53 in regulating the growth and differentiation of Hep 3B hepatoma cells, a p53-negative line derived from a liver cancer. Stable Hep 3B cell lines were generated in which inducible p53 was introduced using either a temperature-sensitive mutant (p53val135) or a tamoxifen-regulated p53-estrogen receptor chimera (p53-mERtm-pBabepuro). In both cell lines, induction of transcriptionally active p53 was confirmed by assessing several p53 targets: Mdm2 protein, p21waf1 mRNA and protein, and the cyclin G promoter. Despite marked induction of p21waf1, cells with active p53 failed to undergo growth arrest, which is probably due to the presence of a non-functional retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in these cells. Apoptosis also was not observed, even after prolonged (48 h) serum starvation or exposure to cisplatinum. Lack of apoptosis was correlated with unchanged bax mRNA levels following p53 induction. Additionally, albumin mRNA levels remained unchanged, and there was no change in basal transactivation of a reporter containing the promoter of the haptoglobin gene, encoding an acute phase protein. This suggests that growth arrest may be required to promote liver-specific gene expression. Overall, our data demonstrate that introduction of transcriptionally active p53 does not alter the malignant, dedifferentiated phenotype of Hep 3B hepatoma cells. Hence, not all cancer cells are equally responsive to the re-activation of wild-type 53. The ability of a cancer cell to undergo p53-mediated phenotypic alterations may depend on the retention of functional downstream effector pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2319935877,"FHIT (fragile histidine triad gene), a candidate tumor suppressor gene, was recently identified and cloned at chromosome 3p14.2. Alterations of this gene have been reported in a number of primary human tumors, including colorectal, esophageal, gastric and lung carcinomas. However, some reports have found no abnormalities in this gene. We investigated a total of 63 primary esophageal tumors, nine esophageal cancer cell lines and 17 ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasms (UCANs) for alterations of FHIT. In 13 esophageal tumors, we employed overlapping reverse transcriptase-PCRs (RT-PCRs) to amplify and sequence the complete open reading frame of FHIT. One of 13 primary esophageal tumors analysed by RT-PCR expressed no detectable FHIT transcript; the remaining 12 expressed normal-sized transcripts with wild-type open reading frame sequences. In an additional 50 esophageal tumors, the polymorphic microsatellite loci D3S1300 and D3S1313 were used to evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p14.2. Eleven of these 50 tumors showed LOH at one or both loci. In all these 11 tumors, genomic PCR and direct sequencing of FHIT exons 5-9 was performed. This analysis revealed that none of these 11 primary esophageal tumors contained any alterations in the FHIT open reading frame or adjacent intron sequences. Finally, among 17 UCANs, the in vitro synthesized protein (IVSP) assay detected no truncated protein products, nor were there any abnormalities in size or DNA sequence of FHIT RT-PCR products. However, in six of nine esophageal carcinoma cell lines, no FHIT RT-PCR product was detectable using either of the overlapping primer sets. Genomic PCR and direct sequencing of exons 5-9, also performed in these nine cell lines, revealed wild-type sequence in eight cell lines; however, one cell line contained no exon 5 PCR product. This cell line also lacked detectable FHIT transcript. These data suggest that the open reading frame of FHIT is not important in the development or progression of most primary esophageal carcinomas or UCANs, although lack of expression of the FHIT transcript may be common in esophageal cancer-derived cell lines. The possibility of an additional tumor suppressor gene at chromosome 3p14.2 remains to be evaluated."

In a search for novel factors that interact with Id1, we identified a component of the 26 S proteasome, S5a, that has previously been implicated only in the recognition of ubiquitinated polypeptides destined for proteolysis. S5a interacts strongly with Id1, less strongly with the basic helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD and E12, and not at all with other Id proteins. S5a restores DNA binding by MyoD-Id1 and E12-Id1 heterodimers, enhances DNA binding by MyoD and E12 homodimers, and reverses Id1-mediated repression of the muscle creatine kinase promoter during myogenic differentiation. Mutagenesis experiments showed that amino acids flanking the helix-loop-helix domain plus three residues in the first helix of Id1 impart S5a recognition. This requires only the NH2-terminal half of S5a. S5a thus appears to promote the positive regulation of myogenic genes through ubiquitin-independent mechanisms involving inhibition of Id1 and the enhancement of DNA binding by MyoD and E12.

Based on such observations, it has been proposed that Id proteins may serve to oppose the positive effects of HLH proteins on their target genes (42Kadesch T. Immunol.

Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar), we have identified a non-HLH protein that interacts with Id1 but not with Id2 or Id3. In vitro, this protein can restore the DNA binding properties of MyoD-Id1 and E12-Id1 heterodimers and can enhance DNA binding by MyoD and E12 homodimers. In vivo, it can overcome the inhibitory effects of transfected or endogenous Id1 to promote muscle-specific gene expression. The protein appears to be the human homolog of S5a, a component of the regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome. These studies suggest novel roles for S5a in the control of gene expression by select HLH proteins.DISCUSSIONThe protein characterized in this report was identified through its interaction with the HLH domain of Id1 and appears to be S5a or a close homolog. In yeast two-hybrid screens, S5a interacts strongly with Id1, less strongly with MyoD and E12, and not at all with the class C HLH-zipper protein Mxi1. S5a also appears to be highly specific for Id1, being incapable of interacting with the highly homologous Id2 or Id3 HLH domains. Deletion mapping indicated that Id1 requires an intact HLH domain to associate with S5a.A number of studies were performed to confirm the specificity of S5a's interactions and to assess their consequences. The results of ourin vitro studies can be summarized as follows. 1) A GST-S5a fusion protein was able to bind 35S-labeled Id1, MyoD and E12. 2) S5a specifically promoted the dissociation of pre-formed MyoD-Id1 complexes. 3) In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, His6-tagged S5a reversed the loss of DNA binding that accompanied the formation of MyoD-Id1 or E12-Id1 heterodimers. 4) S5a greatly enhanced the DNA binding of MyoD and E12 homodimers while having a less pronounced effect on MyoD-E12 heterodimers. Thesein vitro findings together with antibody supershift experiments indicate that S5a enhances DNA binding of bHLH proteins by promoting their dissociation from Id1 as well as by increasing their intrinsic DNA binding as homodimers.In vivo, an interaction between Id1 and S5a was detected using both yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays as well as by a more traditional co-immunoprecipitation approach (Figs. 5 B and6). The co-expression of S5a also completely reversed the inhibitory effect of Id1 on myogenic gene expression in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts following the induction of differentiation. Perhaps most convincingly, the overexpression of S5a was also sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effects of Id1 in either C3H10T1/2 cells or C2C12 myoblasts without the need for induced differentiation (Fig. 8). In the latter case, the expression of only endogenous levels of MyoD and Id1 by these cells indicates that Id1's role in inhibiting the myogenic program can be overridden simply by the expression of S5a. Since myogenic differentiation in cultured cells is typically accompanied by down-regulation of Id1 and withdrawal from the cell cycle following the removal of growth factors (45Christy B.A. Sanders L.K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the results presented in Fig. 8would suggest that the overexpression of S5a can substitute for this more classical differentiation stimulus. We suggest that either changes in Id1 levels (following serum removal) and/or its inhibition by S5a are sufficient to promote this process.In vitro association experiments (Fig. 3 A) as well as yeast two-hybrid data (Table I) indicate a much stronger association of S5a with Id1 than with either MyoD or E12 proteins. On the other hand, electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (Fig.4 A) demonstrated a strong and specific enhancement of MyoD DNA binding by S5a. E12 DNA binding was affected as well although to a lesser degree. These observations are not necessarily at odds as it is possible that relatively weak associations between the homodimeric bHLH proteins and S5a result in greatly increased affinity of the former proteins for the oligonucleotide probe. Our in vivoexperiments also do not allow us to determine how much of the increased reporter plasmid activity following co-expression of S5a is due to Id1 inhibition versus enhanced MyoD or E12 binding. Further work will be required to determine the relative contribution to myogenic differentiation of each of the S5a activities we have observed.In addition to our results indicating that S5a causes a displacement of Id1 from its heterodimeric partners, the foregoing experiments suggest two additional non-mutually exclusive mechanisms by which S5a could function to enhance DNA binding by MyoD and E12: 1) S5a might increase the affinity of the homodimer for its DNA target; 2) S5a might promote the dissociation of higher order oligomers to dimers. This would be especially important in the case of MyoD since only small amounts of it exist in dimeric form in solution, with the majority of it occurring in tetrameric and higher order non-binding complexes (96Anthony-Cahill S.J.

However, since S5a acts to promote DNA binding by both MyoD and E12, the second model seem less likely given that E12 has been reported to exist primarily in dimeric form in solution (96Anthony-Cahill S.J.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In non-differentiating in vitro systems, Id1 and Id3 transcript levels have been reported to decline as cells enter the G0state following contact inhibition or deprivation of growth factors (41Benezra R.

Id1, Id2, and Id3 are rapidly induced following mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells, thus mimicking the behavior of immediate-early response genes (45Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau F.

More direct evidence in favor of a role for Id proteins in cell cycle progression has been obtained by demonstrating that suppression of individual or multiple Id proteins can delay the G0 to G1 transition (94Barone M.V.

Myogenic proteins are expressed in a temporal albeit overlapping manner, with MyoD and Myf5 being expressed earlier than others in committed myoblasts (100Braun T. Bober E. Buschhausen-Denker G.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that these factors are functional at such early times is provided by work indicating the presence of positive autoregulatory and feedback loops involving their cognate genes (103Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 104Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H.

The ability of proteins such as S5a to promote the dissociation of Id1-containing heterodimers and to enhance DNA binding by residual class A and B homodimers may provide a means by which certain classes of myogenic factors could be activated prior to terminal differentiation. This could also explain how some rhabdomyosarcomas are able to express skeletal muscle-specific genes (106Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, MO1988: 448-488Google Scholar, 107Hiti A.L. Bogenmann E. Gonzales F. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 6483-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of their enhanced DNA binding capacity in association with S5a, MyoD and E12 homodimers might contribute more significantly to the transcriptional control of myogenic genes than would otherwise be inferred from their low endogenous levels and intrinsic DNA binding capabilities. Given that the DNA target sites for MyoD and E2A product homodimers are distinct from those for MyoD-E2A heterodimers (7Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H.

Transient p53 overexpression in normal human diploid fibroblasts and p53-deficient cancer cells led to increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1/Sdi1 and an accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb in cells growing asynchronously and in cells synchronized in late G1 or M. Similarly, γ-irradiation of asynchronous, late-G1, or S phase fibroblasts led to an increase in hypophosphorylated pRb. Experiments with fibroblasts expressing the HPV16 E6 protein indicated that accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb required functional p53. Progression into and through S phase was not altered by the presence of hypophosphorylated pRb in late G1, consistent with the failure of p53 to mediate G1 arrest in cells that are past the restriction point. These data indicate that accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb has significantly different effects on cell cycle progression in early G1 versus late G1 or S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2323087188,"FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), a putative tumor suppressor gene, was cloned from fetal brain and colon cDNA libraries. Portions of this gene are deleted in esophageal, colon, lung and breast tumors, but this gene has not been found altered in sporadic renal cell carcinomas. We report here an alternatively spliced form of this gene cloned from a kidney cDNA library. This cDNA is 1189 bp in length, and contains an additional 94 bp exon, designated exon 2a (E2a). This novel sequence is located between exon 2 and exon 3 of the FHIT gene's untranslated region and exon 2a is present in all normal kidney tissues and cell lines. Analyses performed on sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues and cell lines, show consistent loss of exon 8 of the FHIT cDNA in almost 60% of the cases. Interestingly, in a familial, as well as, in a metastatic RCC, derived from a patient with the sporadic form, exon 2a and exon 3 are also deleted. Northern analyses with the exon 2a of the familial and the metastatic RCC demonstrates concurrent loss of expression of a 4.4 kb transcript with the loss of the E2a sequence, suggesting that exon 2a of the FHIT gene may play an important role in the oncogenesis of renal cell carcinoma."
