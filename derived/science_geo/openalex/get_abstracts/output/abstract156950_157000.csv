https://openalex.org/W1636092099,"The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate to the deep ocean and underlying sediments. This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels."

https://openalex.org/W2084383502,"The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated ion channel expressed by monocytes and macrophages. To directly address the role of this receptor in interleukin (IL)-1β post-translational processing, we have generated a P2X7R-deficient mouse line.P2X7R −/− macrophages respond to lipopolysaccharide and produce levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and pro-IL-1β comparable with those generated by wild-type cells. In response to ATP, however, pro-IL-1β produced by the P2X7R −/− cells is not externalized or activated by caspase-1. Nigericin, an alternate secretion stimulus, promotes release of 17-kDa IL-1β from P2X7R −/− macrophages. In response to in vivo lipopolysaccharide injection, both wild-type and P2X7R −/− animals display increases in peritoneal lavage IL-6 levels but no detectable IL-1. Subsequent ATP injection to wild-type animals promotes an increase in IL-1, which in turn leads to additional IL-6 production; similar increases did not occur in ATP-treated, LPS-primed P2X7R −/− animals. Absence of the P2X7R thus leads to an inability of peritoneal macrophages to release IL-1 in response to ATP. As a result of the IL-1 deficiency,in vivo cytokine signaling cascades are impaired in P2X7R-deficient animals. Together these results demonstrate that P2X7R activation can provide a signal that leads to maturation and release of IL-1β and initiation of a cytokine cascade."

https://openalex.org/W1559292459,"There are two main theoretical descriptions of antiferromagnets. The first arises from atomic physics, which predicts that atoms with unpaired electrons develop magnetic moments. In a solid, the coupling between moments on nearby ions then yields antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures1. The second description, based on the physics of electron fluids or ‘Fermi liquids’, states that Coulomb interactions can drive the fluid to adopt a more stable configuration by developing a spin density wave2,3. It is at present unknown which view is appropriate at a ‘quantum critical point’, where the antiferromagnetic transition temperature vanishes4,5,6,7. Here we report neutron scattering and bulk magnetometry measurements of the metal CeCu6-xAux, which allow us to discriminate between the two models. We find evidence for an atomically local contribution to the magnetic correlations which develops at the critical gold concentration (xc = 0.1 ), corresponding to a magnetic ordering temperature of zero. This contribution implies that a Fermi-liquid-destroying spin-localizing transition, unanticipated from the spin density wave description, coincides with the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point."
https://openalex.org/W1633472206,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are characterized by early peaks of viraemia that decline as strong cellular immune responses develop1,2. Although it has been shown that virus-specific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) exert selective pressure during HIV and SIV infection3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, the data have been controversial12,13. Here we show that Tat-specific CD8-positive T-lymphocyte responses select for new viral escape variants during the acute phase of infection. We sequenced the entire virus immediately after the acute phase, and found that amino-acid replacements accumulated primarily in Tat CTL epitopes. This implies that Tat-specific CTLs may be significantly involved in controlling wild-type virus replication, and suggests that responses against viral proteins that are expressed early during the viral life cycle might be attractive targets for HIV vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2007859567,"Poly(ADP-ribose) is formed in possibly all multicellular organisms by a familiy of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). PARP-1, the best understood and until recently the only known member of this family, is a DNA damage signal protein catalyzing its automodification with multiple, variably sized ADP-ribose polymers that may contain up to 200 residues and several branching points. Through these polymers, PARP-1 can interact noncovalently with other proteins and alter their functions. Here we report the discovery of a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding sequence motif in several important DNA damage checkpoint proteins. The 20-amino acid motif contains two conserved regions: (i) a cluster rich in basic amino acids and (ii) a pattern of hydrophobic amino acids interspersed with basic residues. Using a combination of alanine scanning, polymer blot analysis, and photoaffinity labeling, we have identified poly(ADP-ribose)-binding sites in the following proteins: p53, p21CIP1/WAF1 , xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing protein, MSH6, DNA ligase III, XRCC1, DNA polymerase ε, DNA-PKCS, Ku70, NF-κB, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, caspase-activated DNase, and telomerase. The poly(ADP-ribose)-binding motif was found to overlap with five important functional domains responsible for (i) protein-protein interactions, (ii) DNA binding, (iii) nuclear localization, (iv) nuclear export, and (v) protein degradation. Thus, PARPs may target specific signal network proteins via poly(ADP-ribose) and regulate their domain functions.

Jacobson E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 415-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The best understood member of the PARP family is PARP-1. As a highly conserved, multimodular 113-kDa protein, PARP-1 shares many hallmarks with proteins of the cellular DNA damage signal network (2Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Like ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and p53 (3Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), PARP-1 binds to and is activated by DNA strand breaks and interacts with several other DNA damage checkpoint proteins. In addition, PARP-1 can regulate its protein and DNA interactions by catalyzing its automodification with multiple PAR molecules. An alternative product of the PARP-1 gene is sPARP-1, a 55.3-kDa protein with nuclear localization and sequence identity to the catalytic domain of PARP-1 (4Sallmann F.R. Vodenicharov M.D. Wang Z.Q. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15504-15511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is also activated by DNA damaging agents but apparently does not require DNA strand breaks for activation. Tankyrase, another member of the PARP family, is a multimodular 142-kDa protein with a catalytic domain homologous to PARP-1 (5Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In vitro, tankyrase catalyzes its automodification as well as the modification of the telomere-specific protein TRF1 in a DNA-independent manner. The third member of the PARP family, PARP-2, is a 62-kDa protein (6Berghammer H. Ebner M. Marksteiner R. Auer B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). It is activated by DNA strand breaks, but its function is unknown. Finally, vault PARP, a 193-kDa protein, has recently been identified as a protein component of vaults (8Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), large ribonucleoprotein complexes of unknown function (9Kickhoefer V.A. Vasu S.K. Rome L.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 174-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Vault PARP catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of a major vault protein. The presence of a larger family of PARPs in multicellular organisms illustrates the potential importance of PAR in regulating cellular functions. We have previously shown that the noncovalent binding of PAR to p53 (10Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11839-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or members of the MARCKS protein family (11Schmitz A.P. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. Vergères G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9520-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) may drastically alter several domain-specific functions of these proteins. Apart from its specificity, PAR binding to proteins is exceptionally strong. For example, we have previously found that PAR-histone complexes resist phenol partitioning, strong acids, chaotropes, detergents, and high salt concentrations (12Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations led us to postulate the involvement of a specific sequence motif in PAR binding to proteins. The results of the present study confirm the presence of a PAR-binding consensus sequence in a family of important DNA damage checkpoint proteins. The following peptides derived from human proteins were used (Chiron Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia): MARCKS effector peptides, alanine substituted as described in Fig. 1 B; CDN1 (9–32), RQNPCGSKACRRLFGPVDSEQLSR; CDN1 (), RKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFSKRK; XPA (25–46), RASIERKRQRALMLRQARLAAR; XPA (), KQKKFDKKVKELRRAVR- SSVWKR; MSH2 (), RKRADFSTKDIYQDLNRLLKGKK; MSH6 (), KVARKRKRMVTGNGSLKRKSSRK; DNL3 (12–34), KRGTAGCKKCKEKIVKGVCRIGK; DNL3 (), SRKAPSKPSASTKKAEGKLSNS; DPOB (26–48), KNVSQAIHKYNAYRKAASVIAKY; DPOB (39–61), RKAASVIAKYPHKIKSGAEAKKL; KU70 (), RKVRAKETRKRALSRLKLKLNK; KU86 (), KKFEKRHIEIFTDLSSRFSKSQ; DNA-PKCS (2728–2752), RRR- FMRDQEKLSLMYARKGVAEQKR; KBF2 (), KELKK- VMDLSIVRLRFSAFLR; NOS2 (), KRRPKRREIPLKVLVKAVLFA; caspase-activated DNase (CAD) (), RFQSKSG- YLRYSCESRIRSYLR; TERT (), RGFKAGRNMRRKLFGVLRLKCH. Expression and purification of p21 was as described (13Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Goubin F. Ducommun B. Hubscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8869-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), XPA was bacterially expressed with a N-terminal His tag (14Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the hMutSα heterodimer, hMSH2, and hMSH6 were purified from a baculovirus system as described (15Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Polymer blot analysis was performed as described (16Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M.C. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure peptides or proteins were dot-blotted directly onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was rinsed with three changes of TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). [32P]PAR (0.5 μCi/nmol ADP-ribose; 0.5–1.0 nmol of total ADP-ribose; mean PAR size, 20 residues) were diluted to 10 ml with TBST and added to the nitrocellulose. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, the membrane was washed with TBST containing 1m NaCl to eliminate unspecific binding. The results of polymer blot analysis were only considered positive if PAR binding resisted the high stringency (i.e. 1 m NaCl) conditions. The nitrocellulose was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Although proteins and polypeptides immobilized on nitrocellulose still bind sonicated calf thymus DNA, this binding is not resistant to washing with 1 m NaCl (17Malanga M. Atorino L. Tramontano F. Farina B. Quesada P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of a 10-fold excess (w/w) of competing calf thymus DNA, PAR binding to immobilized polypeptides with a PAR-binding motif is not reduced, whereas a 100-fold excess DNA reduces this binding by ∼50% (17Malanga M. Atorino L. Tramontano F. Farina B. Quesada P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when a 27-nucleotide double-stranded DNA fragment was used for competition experiments. Moreover, branched PAR polymers and large linear polymers exhibited a higher binding affinity than short linear polymers (for details, cf. Refs. 11Schmitz A.P. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. Vergères G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9520-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, and17Malanga M. Atorino L. Tramontano F. Farina B. Quesada P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PAR containing photoactive azido groups was prepared as described previously (18Kiehlbauch C.C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Ringer D.P. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The incubations contained 200 μm 2-azido-NAD+ and 800 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD+. Dithiothreitol was removed from all incubations to minimize reduction of the azido group. The fractionation of photoactive PAR was performed by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. The NaCl gradient used was as follows: sample injection followed by a 2-min load/wash without salt, 0 m to 0.22 m in 1 min, 0.22 m to 0.28 m in 4 min, 0.28 mto 0.35 m in 7 min, 0.35 m to 0.38m in 11 min, 0.38 m to 0.40 m in 6 min, 0.4 m to 1.0 m in 4 min, followed by a 5-min wash with 1 m NaCl. Incubation mixtures (15 μl reaction volume) contained 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1–2.0 μg of protein or 0.5–2.0 μg of peptide, and32P-labeled photoactive PAR of a single size class. Samples were preincubated for 5 min on ice in 1.5 ml of microcentrifuge tubes and then irradiated for 1–2 min at room temperature using a hand-held UV lamp (3700 microwatts/cm2) at a distance of 1 cm. The incubations were quenched by addition of 5× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.00125% bromphenol blue). After electrophoresis on 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried under vacuum. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposure at −80 °C using a fast tungstate intensifying screen. In some experiments, photoinsertion was also quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Computer assisted sequence analysis was performed using the GCG programs of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). For profile searching, the C-terminal part of the alignment shown in Fig. 1 C was used to create different profiles. Using PROFILESEARCH, the SWISSPROT data base was searched for matching sequences. The starting point for our studies was a 25-amino acid region encompassing the MARCKS/MARCKS-Related Protein effector domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have previously demonstrated that this domain is both necessary and sufficient for noncovalent PAR binding to MARCKS proteins (11Schmitz A.P. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. Vergères G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9520-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A series of mutated effector peptides was generated, dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and examined for PAR binding (polymer blot analysis) under high stringency (1m NaCl) conditions (Fig. 1). As expected, PAR bound strongly to the native effector domain (M; Fig. 1 A), and a 7-fold excess of competing poly(A) (11Schmitz A.P. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. Vergères G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9520-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or a 10-fold excess of sonicated calf thymus DNA (17Malanga M. Atorino L. Tramontano F. Farina B. Quesada P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) did not reduce PAR binding (cf. “Experimental Procedures”). When clusters of basic amino acids were substituted by alanines individually (M1–M3) or in pairs (M4–M6), PAR binding was not abolished (Fig. 1 A). Notably, alanine substitution of two clusters with up to 10 basic residues reduced the binding only slightly (Fig. 1 A, M4–M6), suggesting that positively charged amino acids do not significantly contribute to PAR binding. Changing all hydrophobic amino acids of the effector peptide to alanine virtually abolished PAR binding (Fig. 1 A, M13), and became undetectable when an additional six N-terminal lysines were substituted by alanines (M12). Alanine substitution of just three (M14) or four phenylalanines (M16) at a time drastically reduced PAR binding and became undetectable by polymer blot analysis when the N-terminal lysine cluster was replaced as well (M15). An altered version of the peptide, in which the serine residues in addition to cluster 1 of basic amino acids was replaced by alanines, was less informative (Fig. 1 A, M11). Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of selected hydrophobic amino acids for PAR binding. With the sequence motif of the MARCKS effector peptide at hand, we searched for the occurrence of similar motifs in other proteins. Fig. 1 C shows a motif alignment with sequences identified in the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (16Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M.C. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common feature of the sequences is again the presence of a pattern of hydrophobic amino acids interspersed with basic residues, and a cluster of basic amino acids at the N-terminal side of the peptides. All these peptides tested positive in the polymer blot assay (data not shown). We used the C-terminal part to construct amino acid profiles with various combinations and expansions of the hydrophobic amino acid spectrum of the histones. These profiles were used to search the SWISSPROT data bank with the generalized sequence profile method (19Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). From the matches, the proteins that were likely to interact with PAR judging from their physiological function and subcellular localization were investigated for the additional presence of a cluster of basic residues at the N-terminal side. Another strategy was to search for the PAR-binding motif in proteins that were known or suspected to interact with PARP-1. Thus, the PAR-binding motif in each protein was typically detected by sequence analysis and biochemical testing. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21 directly mediates growth arrest by inhibiting the kinase activity of a wide range of cyclin-Cdk complexes (20Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar, 21Xiong Y. Hannon G. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). Since PARP-1 has been implicated as a DNA damage checkpoint protein affecting cell cycle activity (22Masutani M. Nozaki T. Wakabayashi K. Sugimura T. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we tested p21 as a PAR-binding protein. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PARP-1-bound PAR interacted noncovalently with human p21 in the polymer blot assay. Examination of the p21 primary structure revealed a stretch of amino acids similar to the putative PAR-binding motif. A synthetic peptide corresponding to this C-terminal region (aa 140–163) was found to bind PAR in the polymer blot assay, whereas a peptide from the N-terminal part of p21 (aa 9–32), which did not show the putative PAR-binding motif, was not able to interact with PAR polymers (Fig. 2 A). In a parallel approach, photoaffinity labeling was used to confirm the results obtained with blot assays. PAR containing a photoactive azido group were prepared (18Kiehlbauch C.C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Ringer D.P. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and radiolabeled with 32P. p21 protein was incubated with [32P]2-azido-PAR of two size classes (13/14-mer) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE after UV irradiation. The autoradiogram in Fig. 2 B shows that p21 was labeled in a UV-dependent manner. The C-terminal p21 peptide (aa 140–163) could also be photolabeled, whereas the N-terminal peptide (aa 9–32) showed no photoinsertion (data not shown). To establish that the observed photolabeling of p21 was specific, increasing amounts of p21 protein were photolabeled with a constant amount of photoactive probe. The photoincorporation was dose-dependent as shown in the autoradiogram of Fig. 2 B. A quantitative analysis of the autoradiogram by scanning densitometry showed that saturation of binding was reached at a molar ratio of p21 to photoactive PAR13/14-mer of approximately 30 (Fig. 2 B,bottom graph). Finally, the specificity of photolabeling was examined in the presence of unlabeled competitor PAR polymers without azido groups (Fig. 2 C). Photoincorporation of azido-PAR was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, when increasing amounts of unlabeled PAR of the same size range were added (Fig. 2 C, autoradiogram). Quantification by scanning densitometry revealed an almost complete inhibition at a competitor PAR/photoactive PAR-ratio of 10 (Fig. 2 C,bottom graph). Taken together, these results indicate that the noncovalent interaction of PAR with p21 occurs in a very well defined region located at the C terminus covering amino acids 140–163. The nucleotide excision repair protein XPA recognizes a wide variety of DNA lesions and recruits other proteins to repair damaged DNA (14Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15915-15918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Wakasugi M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18759-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The presence of a PAR-binding sequence motif at the C terminus made XPA a candidate for polymer interaction. XPA protein and two selected XPA peptides were subjected to polymer blot analysis. Fig. 3 A shows that PAR bound to human XPA and a C-terminal synthetic peptide covering residues 215–237, whereas a N-terminal peptide was negative (aa 25–46). These results could be confirmed using photoaffinity labeling of XPA protein and XPA peptides with photoactive [32P]PAR (Fig. 3 B). The specificity of PAR binding to XPA was demonstrated by two experiments. First, with increasing amounts of XPA, the photoincorporation increased and reached saturation at a molar ratio of XPA to photoactive PAR15/16-mer of about 40 (Fig. 3 C). Second, increasing amounts of unlabeled PAR without azido groups as competitor decreased the extent of incorporation of a constant amount of photoactive [32P]PAR11/12-mer into the XPA protein (Fig. 3 D). Protection of photoincorporation was almost complete at a ratio of competitor PAR to photoactive PAR polymers of about 10, reflecting the specificity of the noncovalent interaction. During mismatch repair, the heterodimer hMutSα is involved in the recognition of G/T mismatches and 1-nucleotide insertion-deletion mismatches (26Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). By polymer blot assay, we observed a noncovalent interaction between PAR and the hMutSα heterodimer, which was due to PAR binding to MSH6 (Fig. 4 A,left panel). The primary sequences of both proteins were examined for the presence of the PAR-binding motif. A PAR-interaction for a MSH6 peptide (aa 295–317) could be confirmed experimentally, but not for a MSH2 peptide (aa 227–249; Fig. 4 A, right panel). PARP-1 is activated after the incision step of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which results in formation of a DNA single-strand break. Therefore, we searched for putative PAR-binding domains in proteins known to act in the BER process. The PAR binding of synthetic peptides derived from different BER proteins was examined by polymer blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). An XRCC1 peptide (aa 379–400) could interact noncovalently with PAR as predicted. Likewise, PAR binding was predicted and confirmed for aa positions 12–34 in DNA ligase III (Fig. 4 B). A peptide derived from DNA polymerase ε, the enzyme most likely responsible for long-patch repair synthesis in BER (27Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), bound to PAR, whereas two overlapping peptides from the N terminus of DNA polymerase β, the enzyme catalyzing short patch repair synthesis, were negative in the polymer blot assay (Fig. 4 B). In this way, functional consensus PAR-binding motifs were identified in XRCC1, DNA ligase III, and DNA polymerase ε. Both DNA-PK and PARP-1 are activated by DNA strand interruptions and probably participate in DNA repair. DNA-PK is an abundant nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of three subunits. The catalytic subunit DNA-PKCS of 470 kDa shares a domain of homology with members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, and the heterodimer Ku70/Ku86 is important for DNA binding (28Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 29Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P.

Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We searched the primary structure of these proteins for the presence of PAR-binding sequences and tested them by polymer blot analysis and photoaffinity labeling. Positive results were obtained for two peptides derived from DNA-PKCS and Ku70 (Fig. 4 C), whereas the Ku86-derived peptide was negative by blot analysis. In agreement with this, no photolabeling was detected with the Ku86 peptide, whereas the peptides from Ku70 and DNA-PKCS were positive in the photolabeling assay (data not shown). PARP-1 has been implicated in necrotic cell death (31Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 32Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) as well as in death by apoptosis (33Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Therefore, several cell death regulating proteins were examined for the presence of PAR-binding sequences. The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors interacts with PARP-1 protein (35Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 36Oliver F.J. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). A PAR-binding site could be confirmed experimentally by polymer blot analysis for the p52 subunit of NF-κB homo- and heterodimers (KBF2, aa 179–199; Fig. 4 D). The inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, contains a PAR-binding sequence motif (NOS2, aa 505–525) in the calmodulin-binding domain. This was confirmed using the polymer blot assay (Fig. 4 D). CAD is responsible for apoptotic DNA degradation (37Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and biochemical testing confirmed the presence of a functional PAR-binding motif (aa 148–169; Fig. 4 D). Likewise, telomerase, a reverse transcriptase regulating telomere length and replication life-span of cells (38Bryan T.M. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), was found to contain a PAR-binding sequence motif in the catalytic subunit (TERT, aa 962–983; Fig. 4 D). From the alignment of the PAR-binding sequences, it is apparent that the PAR-binding domains do not contain a single invariant amino acid, but there is a clear consensus pattern of residues with conserved properties in some positions (Fig. 5). The typical PAR-binding motif comprises approximately 20 amino acids and contains two conserved regions: (i) a cluster rich in positive residues and (ii) the consensus pattern -hxbxhhbbhhb-, where h indicates residues with hydrophobic side chains, b stands for a preference for basic amino acids, and x is any amino acid. The number of basic residues in the consensus pattern varies between 2 and 4. The consensus sequence presented in Fig. 5 may be a good guide for identification and future classification of PAR-binding proteins. Our study demonstrates the presence of a PAR-binding site in several proteins of the DNA damage signal network. A common function of these proteins is that they all contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability in cells. The PAR-binding sequences were found to overlap with five functionally important domains, responsible for (i) protein-protein interactions, (ii) DNA binding, (iii) nuclear localization signaling, (iv) nuclear export signaling, and (v) protein degradation. In p53 protein, three important functional domains are targets for noncovalent PAR binding: the sequence-specific DNA binding domain, the nuclear export signal and the oligomerization domain (Fig. 5; Ref. 10Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11839-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The PAR-binding site of p21 lies within a highly conserved region responsible for PCNA binding (39Huppi K. Siwarski D. Dosik J. Michieli P. Chedid M. Reed S. Mock B. Givol D. Mushinski J.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3017-3020PubMed Google Scholar, 40Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 41Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mutations in this site (M147A, D149A, F150A) abolish PCNA binding and expose p21 to proteasome-dependent degradation (42Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, p21 effects cell cycle arrest following various types of DNA damage by forming quaternary complexes with PCNA, Cdks, and cyclins (21Xiong Y. Hannon G. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar, 43Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The participation of PARP-1 activity in G1 and G2cell cycle checkpoints has been demonstrated (22Masutani M. Nozaki T. Wakabayashi K. Sugimura T. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44Schreiber V. Hunting D. Trucco C. Gowans B. Grunwald D. de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the DNA-PK complex, PAR-binding sequences were identified in DNA-PKCS (aa 2728–2752) as well as in the Ku70 subunit (aa 243–264). The PAR-binding site of Ku70 covers one of the nine conserved regions (region V, aa 243–261) and is in close proximity to a leucine zipper-like region (aa 214–242). The core region of Ku70 () is involved in DNA end binding and heterodimerization (45Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of DNA-PKCS by PARP-1 has been shown recently to stimulate DNA-PK activity (46Ruscetti T. Lehnert B.E. Halbrook J. Le Trong H. Hoekstra M.F. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14461-14467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The covalent modification of DNA-PKCS by PAR could play a role in enhancing the interaction between DNA-PKCS and the Ku70/Ku86 heterodimer via the noncovalent PAR-binding site found in the Ku70 protein. Moreover, the formation of PARP-Ku70/Ku86 complexes has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from nuclear extracts and these complexes specifically bind to matrix attachment regions flanking the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain enhancer (47Galande S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20521-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic complexities of these interactions remain to be elucidated, molecular genetic evidence suggests an important role of PARP-DNA-PK-interactions in maintaining genomic integrity (48Morrison C. Smith G.C. Stingl L. Jackson S.P. Wagner E.F. Wang Z.Q. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A conserved PAR-binding sequence is also present in several DNA repair proteins. In the damage recognition protein XPA, it is located in the C-terminal portion interacting with TFIIH during nucleotide excision repair (49Park C.H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the DNA mismatch recognizing protein hMutSα, a heterodimeric protein consisting of MSH2 and MSH6 (26Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a PAR-binding domain was discovered in MSH6 but not in MSH2. Thus, PAR binding could interfere with the DNA damage recognition step of nucleotide excision and mismatch repair. Several proteins of the BER pathway were also found to contain a PAR-binding sequence. In XRCC1, it maps to a BRCT domain, which is present in a large number of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins (50Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 51Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The BRCT domain of XRCC1 (aa 301–402) has recently been demonstrated to bind preferentially to oligo-ADP-ribosylated PARP-1 protein (52Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). It is very likely that this involves the PAR-binding site of XRCC1 (aa 379–400). Thus, the DNA damage stimulated automodification of PARP-1 may prompt the formation of a PARP-1-XRCC1 complex, whereby XRCC1 is recruited into the complex by PAR polymers. The PAR-binding site of XRCC1 is situated between the binding sites for DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase III (53Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schär P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 54Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), leaving these domains available for recruitment of these other binding partners. Moreover, DNA ligase III contains a PAR-binding site of its own; it maps to the N-terminal domain and could modulate interactions with XRCC1 at the DNA strand break. The binding site for XRCC1 lies within the C terminus of DNA ligase III, which also contains a BRCT domain (50Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 54Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally, a PAR-binding site was identified in DNA polymerase ε (aa 691–709). An attractive model can be proposed in which the PAR-binding motifs contained within XRCC1, DNA ligase III, and DNA polymerase ε are involved in recruiting the proteins to interact at DNA strand breaks. The stimulation of BER synthesisin vitro in the presence of NAD+ supports this idea (55Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Oei S.L. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23234-23239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PAR-binding site in the p52 subunit of NF-κB falls within the Rel homology domain responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, and protein interactions (57Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). The site (aa 179–199) is at the transition between insert region (aa 141–187) and the N-terminal core domain (aa 38–140 and 188–220) within the Rel homology domain. This region presents a potential interaction surface to other proteins (58Cramer P. Larson C.J. Verdine G.L. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7078-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved hydrophobic motif can be found also in p50, suggesting that this NF-κB subunit may also have PAR-binding potential. Co-immunprecipitation of PARP-1/NF-κB complexes has been reported (35Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and PARP-1-deficient cells are defective in NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation and show a down-regulation of iNOS after genotoxic stress (35Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 36Oliver F.J. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Induction of iNOS expression is abolished by inhibitors of PARP-1 (59Hausschildt S. Scheipers P. Bessler W.G. Mulsch A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 255-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A PAR-binding site is also present in iNOS (aa 505–525), which overlaps with the calmodulin-binding site (aa 509–529). A putative calmodulin-binding domain can be found in all members of the NOS family. By analogy to the MARCKS protein family, calmodulin-iNOS interactions could be regulated by PAR polymers (11Schmitz A.P. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. Vergères G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9520-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The PAR-binding site in telomerase localizes to the TERT catalytic subunit at position aa 962–983. This site could be targeted by tankyrase, a recent addition to the PARP family (5Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Tankyrase catalyzes its automodification in a DNA-independent manner, and these PAR polymers could directly interact with telomerase and regulate its activity. This could play a role during the inappropriate expression of telomerase during carcinogenesis, allowing cells to overcome the limited replication life-span and progress toward malignancy (for review, see Ref. 60Greider C.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 109-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). No obvious functional consequence can be derived for the PAR-binding site in CAD, a caspase-activated DNase catalyzing DNA degradation during apoptotic cell death. The site is located at position aa 148–169, between a regulatory domain (aa 1–83) and the catalytic domain (aa 290–345; Ref. 61Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the identification of specific PAR-binding sites in several proteins of the cellular signal network suggests that these proteins may be interaction partners of the PARP protein family. Many of these proteins are like PARP-1 members of the DNA damage signal network. By targeting specific domains in these proteins, PAR could regulate protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, protein localization, or protein degradation. PAR could also play a chaperone function in the DNA damage signal network by facilitating the temporary formation of multiprotein complexes. It remains to be seen whether such complexes are formed in vivo. Preliminary results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments are compatible with this possibility. For example, PARP-MSH6 complexes can be immunoprecipitated with PAR (or MSH6 or PARP) antibodies from TK6 human cell lines. 2H. E. Kleczkowska, F. R. Althaus, and J.

https://openalex.org/W1988810849,"Smads are important intracellular signaling effectors for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and related factors. Proper TGF-β signaling requires precise control of Smad functions. In this study, we have identified a novel HECT class ubiquitin E3 ligase, designated Smurf2, that negatively regulates Smad2 signaling. In both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, we found that Smurf2 could interact with receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), including Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 but not Smad4. Ectopic expression of Smurf2 was sufficient to reduce the steady-state levels of Smad1 and Smad2 but not Smad3 or Smad4. Significantly, Smurf2 displayed preference to Smad2 as its target for degradation. Furthermore, Smurf2 exhibited higher binding affinity to activated Smad2 upon TGF-β stimulation. The ability of Smurf2 to promote Smad2 destruction required the HECT catalytic activity of Smurf2 and depended on the proteasome-dependent pathway. Consistent with these results, Smurf2 potently reduced the transcriptional activity of Smad2. These data suggest that a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism is important for proper regulation of TGF-β signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1624029523,"Recent measurements of the velocities of stars near the centre of the Milky Way have provided the strongest evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole in a galaxy, but the observational uncertainties poorly constrain many of the black hole's properties. Determining the accelerations of stars in their orbits around the centre provides much more precise information about the position and mass of the black hole. Here we report measurements of the accelerations of three stars located approximately 0.005 pc (projected on the sky) from the central radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*); these accelerations are comparable to those experienced by the Earth as it orbits the Sun. These data increase the inferred minimum mass density in the central region of the Galaxy by an order of magnitude relative to previous results, and localize the dark mass to within 0.05 +/- 0.04 arcsec of the nominal position of Sgr A*. In addition, the orbital period of one of the observed stars could be as short as 15 years, allowing us the opportunity in the near future to observe an entire period."

Recently, we have shown that heparin and heparan sulfate bind to papain specifically; this interaction induces an increase of its α-helix content and stabilizes the enzyme structure even at alkaline pH (Almeida, P.

In the present work, a combination of circular dichroism analysis, affinity chromatography, cathepsin B mutants, and fluorogenic substrate assays were used to characterize the interaction of human cathepsin B with glycosaminoglycans. The nature of the cathepsin B-glycosaminoglycans interaction was sensitive to the charge and type of polysaccharide. Like papain, heparin and heparan sulfate bind cathepsin B specifically, and this interaction reduces the loss of cathepsin B α-helix content at alkaline pH. Our data show that the coupling of cathepsin B with heparin or heparan sulfate can potentiate the endopeptidase activity of the cathepsin B, increasing 5-fold the half-life (t12) of the enzyme at alkaline pH. Most of these effects are related to the interaction of heparin and heparan sulfate with His111 residue of the cathepsin B occluding loop.

Nader H.B. Straus H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These classes of compounds are heteropolysaccharides made up of repeating units of disaccharides, an uronic acid residue, eitherd-glucuronic acid or l-iduronic acid, andd-glucosamine with N- and 6-O-sulfates and N-acetyl substitutions (2Dietrich C.P.

Heparan sulfate occurs at the cell surface and in extracellular matrix as proteoglycans. Most of cellular heparan sulfate derives from the syndecans and glypicans proteoglycans. The syndecan family are associated with the cell membranes via transmembrane core proteins (3Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar), and the glypican family is anchored by glycosilyl phosphatidylinositol-anchor core proteins (5David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Also, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present in basement membranes performing the perlecan family (6Iozzo R. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdock A.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 302: 625-629Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate and heparin are particular among glycosaminoglycans in their ability to bind a large number of different proteins. Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans play a complex role in the extracellular matrix, regulating a wide variety of biological process, including hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, growth factors, cell adhesion, and others (7Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Proteolytic enzymes control many of these biological process.

On the other hand, the interaction of cysteine proteinases with glycosaminoglycans has not been completely explored. In mammalians, lysosomal cysteine proteinases have been implicated in a variety of diseases involving tissue remodeling states, such as inflammation (12Katunuma N. Intracellular Proteolysis. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, Japan1989Google Scholar), parasite infection (13Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Juliano L. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 2483-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cathepsin B shows close structural homology to the other cysteine proteases of the papain family (15Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). The main feature that distinguishes cathepsin B is the presence of a large insertion loop structure, termed occluding loop, which covers the active site, occupying the S2 ′-S3 ′ subsites of the enzyme (16Musil D. Zučič D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovič T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It has been shown that lysosomal cysteine proteinases, specially cathepsin B, can participate in tumor invasion by degradation of extracellular matrix components (17Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This can take place either intracellularly by heterophagosomal activity of tumors cell (18Sloane B.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 826-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or extracellularly by cell surface associated cathepsin B (14Sloane B.F. Rozhin J. Johnson K. Taylor H. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 2483-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the presence of cathepsin B at plasma membrane results in focal dissolution of extracellular matrix proteins and enables the tumor cell to invade (19Weiss R.E. Liu B.C.S. Ahlering T. Dubeau L. Droller M.J. Br. J. Urol. 1990; 144: 798-804Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Koblinski J.E. Sloane B.F. Medical Aspects of Protease and Protease Inhibitors. IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1997: 185-193Google Scholar). Trafficking and targeting of lysosomal enzymes is mostly mediated by mannose-6-phosphate receptor pathways (21Brown W.J. Goodhouse J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 110: 1235-1247Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, several reports show that this class of receptors is not sufficient for targeting of lysosomal enzymes along intracellular routes, either by an alteration in these receptors (22Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or by changes in glycosylation pattern of lysosomal enzymes as observed for cathepsin B in carcinoma cells (23Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Shuja S. Cai J. Peng P. Murnane M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29190-29199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, mannose-6-phosphate-independent targeting has been proposed for cathepsin B in normal cell (24Hanewinkel H. Gloss J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human colon carcinoma cell lines (25De Stefanis D. Demoz M. Dragonetti A. Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 289: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A high level of cathepsin B and qualitative changes in cathepsin B protein expression, including abnormal pattern of glycosylation, may be important in maintaining the malignant phenotype in carcinoma cell (23Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Shuja S. Cai J. Peng P. Murnane M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29190-29199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alterations in cathepsin B expression, processing, and cellular localization have been observed in several human tumor tissue; clinical investigations have shown that cathepsin B are highly predictive indicator for prognosis and diagnosis in cancer (26Kos J. Lah T.T. Oncol. Rep. 1998; 5: 1349-1361PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of secretion and insertion of cathepsin B at the plasma membrane are not fully understood (27Kornfeld S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cathepsin B is secreted by normal and by tumor cells as the precursor forms (28Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas many types of tumors cells may also release mature, active form of cathepsin B (29Linebaugh B.E. Sameni M. Day N.A. Sloane B.F. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, it is not know whether the precursors are activated at the plasma membrane or extracellularly. It has been shown that the activation of cathepsins B and L occur autocatalytically triggered by acidic pH and also by anionic polysaccharides such as dextran sulfate and heparin (30Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jerala R. Zerovnic E. Kidric J. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11498-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mature form of cathepsin B and L have been shown to be rapidly inactivated at neutral or alkaline pH end by its endogenous proteins inhibitors, mainly from the cystatin family (15Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that membrane-bound forms of cathepsin B are very resistant to inactivation at neutral pH (32Sloane B.F. Rozhin J. Lah T.T. Day N.A. Buck M. Ryan R.E. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 233: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that heparin and heparan sulfate bind papain specifically; this interaction induces an increase of α-helix content of papain, which stabilizes the enzyme structure even at alkaline pH (33Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Rizzi C.C.A. Júdice W.A.S. Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30433-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that heparan sulfate may be an important binding site of cysteine proteinases at cell surface and basement membrane. Therefore, the study of the interaction of cathepsin B with glycosaminoglycans is of significant interest for the understanding about the biological role of this enzyme. In this work, a combination of circular dichroism analysis, affinity chromatography, cathepsin B mutants, and fluorogenic substrate assays were used to characterize the interaction of cathepsin B with glycosaminoglycans. Cathepsin B from human liver was purchased from Calbiochem Co.; nonglycosylated cathepsin B S115A, denominated wild-type cathepsin, and its punctual mutants H110A and H111A were subcloned, as proenzymes, into the vector pPIC9 and expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris as described previously (34Nägler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The concentration of the active enzyme was determined by titration using the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-641 (35Ménard R. Khouri H.E. Plouffe C. Dupras R. Ripoll D. Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Laliberté F. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Active forms of cathepsin B were stored at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 10 μm methyl methane-thiosulfonate. The irreversible inhibitor E-64, azocasein, the fluorogenic amidomethylcoumaryl substrate Cbz-FR-MCA, and dextran sulfate (5,000 Da) were purchased from Sigma. The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K was synthesized using solid phase chemistry as described previously (36Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In the experiments we have used a size-defined (10 kDa) bovine lung heparin (The Upjohn Co.), prepared by using size exclusion column approach (2Dietrich C.P. Tersariol I.L.S. Toma L. Moraes C.T.

Academic Press Inc., New York1998Google Scholar); heparan sulfate (16,000 Da) from bovine lung were a generous gift from Dr. P. Bianchini (Opocrin Research Laboratories, Modena, Italy) (2Dietrich C.P. Tersariol I.L.S. Toma L. Moraes C.T. Porcionatto M.A. Oliveira F.W. Nader H.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 417-429PubMed Google Scholar); dermatan sulfate (12,000 Da) and chondroitin sulfate (25,000 Da) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin-Sepharose resin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cathepsin B activities were monitored spectrofluorometrically using the fluorogenic substrates Cbz-FR-MCA and Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K on a thermostatic Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. For Cbz-FR-MCA assays, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 380 and 460 nm, respectively. The assay with Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K was monitored at 420 nm using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm (37Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Prado E.S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, the methyl methane-thiosulfonate-inhibited enzymes were activated by incubation for 5 min at 25 °C in 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. For the determination of pH activity profiles, the kinetics of Cbz-FR-MCA and Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K hydrolysis were performed in absence or in presence of different glycosaminoglycans concentrations at 37 °C in 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 5.8–8.0), 50 mm citrate (pH 3.0–5.9) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. The substrate concentrations were kept 20-fold below the Km values. The progress of the reaction was continuously monitored by the fluorescence of the released product. The initial rates were determined, and the kcat/KM values were obtained by dividing the initial rates by enzyme and substrate concentrations. The pH activity profiles for cathepsin B are extremely complex, which precludes the use of well defined models to curve fit the data. Therefore, the empirical equations were included solely for clarity of the graphical display (34Nägler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The kinetic model depicted in Equation 1can describe the effect of heparin on the hydrolysis of Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K by cathepsin B. v=vmax·[S]KsI+[I]KI+[S]Equation 1 where S is Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K, I is heparin,KS is the substrate dissociation constant, and KI is heparin dissociation constant. The influence of heparin upon proteolytic activity of cathepsin B was also assayed against protein substrate using azocasein as described previously (38Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Elvesier/North Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1977: 57-89Google Scholar). The kinetics of cathepsin B inactivation by E-64 was done under pseudo first-order conditions at various heparin concentration as described previously (33Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Rizzi C.C.A. Júdice W.A.S. Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30433-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinetics of alkaline pH-induced inactivation of cathepsins B and its mutants were done at different glycosaminoglycan concentrations in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The inactivation of the enzymes was performed in the presence of 10 μm Cbz-FR-MCA. Progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by the fluorescence of the released product. The obtained exponential decay curves could be best fitted according to the first-order relationship shown in Equation 2. P=P∞1−ekobs·tEquation 2 where P and P∞ are the product concentrations at a given time and at infinite time, respectively, and kobs is the observed first-order rate of alkaline pH-induced enzyme inactivation (39Turk B. Dolenc I. Z̆erovnic E. Turk D. Gubenšek F. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14800-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The influence of heparin and heparan sulfate upon the observed first-order rate cathepsins B inactivation can be described by Equation 3.kobseh=kobse(KH+β·[Hep])KH+[Hep]Equation 3 where k eh and k eare the observed first-order rates in presence and in absence of heparin, respectively; KH is the apparent heparin-cathepsin B dissociation constant; Hep is heparin; and β is the parameter of limit for kobs in presence of heparin. The determination of the cleaved bonds for the peptide Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K by cathepsin B was done by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis as described previously (33Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Rizzi C.C.A. Júdice W.A.S. Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30433-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a JASCO J-700 spectropolarimeter equipped with a stopped flow chamber and thermostated cell holder. Far ultraviolet measurements (260–200 nm) were performed at 37 °C scanning at rate of 10 nm/min on wild-type cathepsin B solution of 0.05 mg/ml in 0.05-cm cells. Circular dichroism spectra of cathepsin B-glycosaminoglycans interactions were done in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 200 mm NaCl. The observed ellipticity was normalized to units of degrees cm2/dmol. Base-line recordings in the presence or in absence of glycosaminoglycans were routinely made and used to correct cathepsin B spectra. Cathepsin B spectra were analyzed for the percentage of secondary structural elements as described previously (40Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The amount of α-helix structure disruption of cathepsin B induced by alkaline pH was continuously monitored by CD spectra measuring the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. Alkaline pH-induced denaturation of cathepsin B was performed in absence or in presence of different heparin concentrations at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mmNaCl. The influence of alkaline pH on α-helix structure of wild-type cathepsin B is a first-order relationship described by Equation 4(39Turk B. Dolenc I. Z̆erovnic E. Turk D. Gubenšek F. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14800-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ehelix=E0·e−Kunfolding·t+REquation 4 where Ehelix is the amount of α-helix structures of wild-type cathepsin B at a given time of pH 8.0 exposition; E0 is cathepsin B α-helix content, dependent on alkaline pH, at zero time of inactivation;Kunfolding is the observed first-order rate of pH 8.0-induced unfolding of cathepsin B; and R is the residual α-helix content, independent of pH 8.0. Wild-type cathepsin B (1 μm) dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was applied on a heparin-Sepharose column (3 ml) previously equilibrated at 4 °C in the same buffer. A linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m) was used to elute the bonded material. The collected fractions were monitored by cathepsin B enzymatic activity upon substrate Cbz-FR-MCA. The interaction of cathepsin B with heparin was observed on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Cathepsin B was eluted from heparin-Sepharose column at 0.42 m of ionic strength (Fig.1). This interaction could be disrupted specifically by the previous addition of 100 μm of heparin or heparan sulfate to cathepsin B solution. Other sulfated glycosaminoglycans, such as dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were not capable of dislodge this binding. These results show that the binding of cathepsin B to heparin is specific and seems to be governed mainly by electrostatic interactions. These data led us to investigate the possible influence of glycosaminoglycans upon cathepsin B activity. Cathepsin B is generally considered to possess both endo- and exopeptidase activity (41Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 42Koga H. Yamada H. Nishimura Y. Imoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Nägler D.R. Tam W. Storer A.C. Krupa J.C. Mort J.S. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To study the influence of heparin upon endopeptidase activity of cathepsin B, we used the substrates Cbz-FR-MCA to analyze the subsites S2 to S1 of cathepsin B. To monitor the influence of heparin upon dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B, we used the substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K, covering the cathepsin B subsites from S2 to S′2. The HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis showed that Arg-Ala is the only peptide bond cleaved by cathepsin B on substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K. The presence of heparin did not change the pattern of cleavage of these peptides by cathepsin B. The pH activity profile for the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B is very different from that observed for its endopeptidase activity; the maximum activity observed for the hydrolysis of substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K was at pH 5.0 (Fig.2 B), whereas the pH dependence for hydrolysis of Z-FR-MCA is characterized by a gradual increase in activity when the pH is raised from 3 to 8 (Fig. 2 A). The effect of heparin on pH activity profiles of wild-type human cathepsin B was analyzed by monitoring the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates. As showed in Fig. 2, when cathepsin B was assayed with substrate Z-FR-MCA in the presence of 100 μmheparin, no significant effect on the endopeptidase pH activity profiles was observed (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, when heparin was assayed with the substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K and used to monitor the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B (Fig.2 B), a dramatic effect of heparin was observed upon the pH activity profile. Basically, heparin promoted a general decrease in observed Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K hydrolysis second-order kcat/Km rates and shifted the cathepsin B pH activity profile about 0.5 unit to the right. This inhibition promoted by heparin is strongly dependent on pH, because no inhibition was observed when cathepsin B was assayed above pH 7. Also, the inhibition promoted by heparin at pH 5.0 is very lower than that promoted at pH 6.0. More importantly, heparin did not show effect upon E-64 cathepsin B inactivation activity (data not shown), and E-64 binds the subsites Sn of cathepsin B (44Katunuma N. Kominami E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the occluding loop of cathepsin B is controlling the heparin efficiency, and that the subsites S′nare involved in the interaction with heparin. The effect of heparin upon cathepsin B exopeptidase activity, at pH 6.0, can be described by a linear competitive type inhibition depicted in Equation 1. The influence of heparin upon substrate dissociation constant is observed in Fig.3. Basically, heparin-cathepsin B interaction did not affect Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K catalytic constant; the presence of the substrate Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K at active site of cathepsin B excludes the binding of heparin. The results show that heparin only binds free cathepsin B with a dissociation constant of KI = 41 ± 3 μm. The exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B is related to the presence of two histidine residues, His110 and His111, located at occluding loop performing the S′ 2 subsite. His110 and His111 residues can interact with the C terminus carboxylate of a substrate (16Musil D. Zučič D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovič T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katuma N. Bode W.

Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate the importance of the His110 and His111 for the effect promoted by heparin upon dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B. The effect of the substitution of the His110 or His111 residues by alanine can be observed in Table I. Kinetic parameters, determined using the C terminus free carboxylate substrate, Abz-FRA(ε-Dnp)K, showed that the substitution of His110 or His111 residues by alanine promoted a significant decrease in the peptidyldipeptidase activity of cathepsin B, as expected (45Illy C. Quraishi O. Wang J. Purisima E. Vernet T. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The kcat/KM value observed for the wild-type enzyme was 1.31 × 106m−1·s−1, and the kcat/KM value was about 6.5-fold lower for the mutant H111A and about 3.5-fold for the mutant H110A. These effects are related to the decrease in kcat; little effect in KM was observed. Surprisingly, the substitution of His111 residue by alanine was able to abolish the effect promoted by heparin upon substrate dissociation constant; the KM value was the same in the presence of 100 μm heparin (13.9 ± 0.9 μm) as in the absence of heparin (16.3 ± 0.8 μm). On the other hand, heparin showed similar effect upon mutant H110A heparin and wild-type enzyme; for both enzymes, the substrate dissociation constant was increased 3.5-fold by 100 μm heparin. These data indicate that heparin changes the dissociation constant of the cathepsin B-substrate interaction for the substrates able to reach the S′ 2 interaction site. The interaction of heparin with wild-type cathepsin B and H110A and H111A mutants did not affect the kcat values.Table IKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of Abz-FRA (ɛ-Dnp)K by wild-type and mutants of human cathepsin B and in the presence of heparinConditionskcatKMkcat/KMs −1μm× 10 6 m −1 · s −1Cat B wild-type Control16.1 ± 0.712.5 ± 0.91.31 Heparin17.9 ± 0.943 ± 10.29Mutant H110A Control5.1 ± 0.413.0 ± 0.80.39 Heparin5.0 ± 0.547 ± 10.11Mutant H111A Control3.2 ± 0.216.3 ± 0.80.20 Heparin2.9 ± 0.213.9 ± 0.90.21 Open table in a new tab The deprotonation of the catalytic residue His199, catalyzed by OH− ions, is considered a crucial event for the alkaline irreversible inactivation of cathepsin B.

These data provide evidence that Tmod and nebulin may work together as a linked mechanism to control thin filament lengths in skeletal muscle. tropomodulin skeletal Tmod erythrocyte Tmod p-nitrophenyl phosphate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay direct calibration ELISA Sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of myofibrils, are complex structures composed of numerous structural and regulatory proteins organized in an exquisitely precise manner. These structures are composed of alternating parallel arrays of thin and thick filaments. Helical, polar actin polymers are the principal component of the thin filaments. In vitro, actin monomers polymerize at both the fast growing (barbed) and the slow growing (pointed) ends of the actin filaments until the critical concentration is reached. Once this is attained, the length distribution of the filaments becomes exponential (for further discussion, see Refs. 1Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 2Fowler V.M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to this, skeletal muscle cells exhibit a strikingly narrow thin filament length distribution (e.g. 1.1 ± 0.03 μm in rabbit psoas muscle) (3Sosa H. Popp D. Ouyang G. Huxley H.E. Biophys J. 1994; 67: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, although cardiac muscle has a wider range of thin filament lengths compared with skeletal muscle (e.g.0.6–1.1 μm in rat heart) (4Robinson T.F. Winegrad S. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the distribution is much more uniform than that of pure actin filaments in vitro. Thus, regulatory mechanism(s) must exist in striated muscle to tightly control thin filament length. Although these mechanisms remain unknown, one highly favored hypothesis that has existed for years is that a “molecular ruler” protein works together with actin filament capping proteins to regulate thin filament length (reviewed in Refs. 1Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 5Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The giant, actin-binding protein, nebulin, is an excellent candidate for a molecular ruler that functions to specify thin filament length in skeletal muscle (reviewed in Refs. 1Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 6Wang K. Adv.

Sci. 1994; 19: 405-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the molecular mass of nebulin (∼600–800 kDa) correlates with variations in thin filament lengths observed in different types of skeletal muscle (10Kruger M. Wright J. Wang K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, a great deal of evidence indicates that single molecules of nebulin associate with the thin filaments along their entire length. The extreme C-terminal region of nebulin is inserted in the Z disc (11Wang K. Wright J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 127: 2199-2212Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Wright J. Huang Q.Q. Wang K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Millevoi S.

This region contains a unique 20-kDa domain and an Src homology 3 domain (13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). More is known about this region of nebulin in comparison with other parts of the molecule, since a significant amount of recent work has focused on deciphering the molecular interactions and targeting domains responsible for anchoring nebulin in the Z disc (e.g. 15Ojima K. Lin Z.X. Bang M. Holtzer S. Matsuda R. Labeit S. Sweeney H.L. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Bang, M.-L, Mudry, R. E., McElhinny, A.

Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The vast majority of nebulin, however, is composed of ∼185 modular repeats that are each ∼35 amino acids in size. Groups of seven of these modules are classified as “super repeats” (13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Labeit S. Gibson T. Lakey A.

Quian X.L. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies suggest that a single nebulin module interacts with a single actin monomer and that each super repeat interacts with each regulatory unit of the thin filament (comprised of a troponin complex and a tropomyosin molecule for every seven actin monomers) (13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Labeit S. Gibson T. Lakey A. Leonard K. Zeviani M. Knight P. Wardale J. Trinick J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Last, the N-terminal region of nebulin is predicted to be located at or near the pointed ends of the thin filaments (12Wright J. Huang Q.Q. Wang K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Herrera A.H. Elzey B. Law D.J. Horowits R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2000; 45: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This region contains eight unique “linker” modules (M1–M8) as well as a unique, acidic 8-kDa domain (13Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The function of these N-terminal domains is unknown, but it is intriguing to speculate that they are specialized for interacting with other sarcomeric proteins and have distinct functions. Nebulin's periodic, modular structure probably enables it to dictate the number of actin monomers to be polymerized into the thin filaments in skeletal muscle. What is the mechanism, then, that prevents the thin filaments from elongating once their specified length is attained? In this regard, actin filament capping proteins that bind to the ends of actin filaments prevent actin monomer addition and filament growth (for a review, see Ref. 21Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 12: 97-103Google Scholar). In striated muscle, CapZ has been shown to cap the barbed ends of the thin filaments at the Z line, while the pointed ends of the filaments are capped by tropomodulin (Tmod)1 (22Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Caldwell J.E. Heiss S.G. Mermall V. Cooper J.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Investigations of CapZ and Tmod in cultured myocytes suggest that CapZ plays a role in nucleating the initial assembly of actin filaments into sarcomeres, while Tmod functions later to maintain thin filament lengths (25Schafer D.A. Hug C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M.

Res. 1997; 82: 94-105Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, microinjection of an antibody to Tmod that disrupts its capping activity in in vitroassays results in abnormal elongation of the thin filaments from their pointed ends in chick cardiac myocytes (26Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 337: 83-86Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Additionally, cells in which Tmod function is inhibited no longer beat, and overexpression of Tmod in the myocardium of transgenic mice causes myofibrillar disarray and dilated cardiomyopathy (26Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 337: 83-86Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Sussman M.A. Baque S. Uhm C.S. Daniels M.P. Price R.L. Simpson D. Terracio L. Kedes L.

Invest. 1998; 101: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Tmod regulation of thin filament length is critically important for muscle function. Tmod, first identified as a tropomyosin-binding protein in the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton (E-Tmod; Ref. 29Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is present at thin filament pointed ends in chicken slow skeletal muscle fibers, in embryonic skeletal muscle, and in heart (30Fowler V.M. Sussman M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A second isoform, skeletal Tmod (Sk-Tmod), is present at thin filament pointed ends late in chicken fast skeletal muscle differentiation (32Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de-Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In vitro assays indicate that both E-Tmod and Sk-Tmod bind to tropomyosin (Kd ∼150–200 nm) (29Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de-Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the presence of tropomyosin, Tmod completely blocks the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments at their pointed ends (Kd ∼50 pm), while in the absence of tropomyosin, Tmod has a lower affinity for the pointed ends (Kd ∼0.3–0.4 μm) (24Weber A. Pennise C.C. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggests that the tight capping of tropomyosin-coated actin filaments is due to Tmod's ability to bind both tropomyosin and actin (reviewed in Ref. 34Weber A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, actin and tropomyosin are the only identified binding partners for Tmod. While investigations into the properties of Tmod described above demonstrated that Tmod is a critical component for maintaining thin filament length by blocking actin polymerization at the pointed end, there is no evidence that Tmod is involved in specifying the lengths (for a review, see Ref. 35McLellan C. Gregorio C.C. Dube D.K. Myofibrillogenesis. Springer-Verlag, New York2000Google Scholar). In fact, it is difficult to envision how a capping protein, which is present only at the end of the filament, could alone determine the characteristic thin filament lengths that differ among various types of skeletal muscle. Thus, we hypothesized that the N-terminal region of nebulin, the part of the molecule predicted to be at or near the pointed ends of the thin filaments, interacts directly with Tmod as part of a linked regulatory mechanism in skeletal muscle to determine and maintain the lengths of the thin filaments. To test this idea, we first established by immunofluorescence microscopy that Tmod and the N-terminal end of nebulin colocalize in skeletal tissue. Next, we determined that Tmod specifically binds to a 13.5-kDa recombinant fragment from the extreme N-terminal modules of nebulin, as demonstrated by blot overlay, bead binding, and solid phase binding assays. Interestingly, the Sk-Tmod/nebulin interaction is of higher affinity than the E-Tmod/nebulin interaction. This isoform specificity of nebulin binding suggests that thin filament length regulation by nebulin and Tmod may differ in some respects in fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers and/or during skeletal muscle differentiation. The data presented here demonstrate that the N terminus of the nebulin molecule extends to the extreme end of the thin filament and also establish a novel biochemical function for this end. This study provides direct evidence to support the proposed model that the interaction of the capping protein, Tmod, with the molecular ruler, nebulin, may be pivotal for regulating actin filament assembly and length in skeletal muscle. Antibodies against human E-Tmod were generated in rabbits and affinity-purified as described (36Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Antibodies to recombinant fragments from the N-terminal region of nebulin (see below for details on expression and purification of recombinant nebulin fragments) were generated in rabbits (RR Research and Development, Stanwood, WA) and affinity-purified. Monoclonal anti-E-Tmod antibody (monoclonal antibody 95) was purified from hybridoma supernatants on a protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (37Almenar-Queralt A. Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1111-1123PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant chicken Sk-Tmod and recombinant chicken E-Tmod were prepared and purified as described previously (32Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de-Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tropomyosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle, and human E-Tmod was purified from erythrocytes as described (36Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant chicken E- and Sk-Tmods were biotinylated using aminohexanoyl-biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Briefly, after dialysis against 0.1 m bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.4, Tmod was incubated at a molar ratio of 1:10 with aminohexanoyl-biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide) at room temperature for 1 h. The biotinylated Tmod was then immediately dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Primary cultures of embryonic chicken skeletal myotubes were prepared as described (37Almenar-Queralt A. Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1111-1123PubMed Google Scholar), and indirect immunofluorescent staining to localize Tmod and the N-terminal region of nebulin was performed (40Gregorio C.C. Trombitás K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunke K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed cultures were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and immediately blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The myotubes were stained with monoclonal antibodies to Tmod (monoclonal antibody 95) at 2 μg/ml, followed by rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:200) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Next, the cells were incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-neb N-term + M1 (see below for nomenclature of nebulin fragments) antibodies (10 μg/ml), followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The myotubes were analyzed on a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC600), and digital images were processed and merged using Adobe Photoshop software (San Jose, CA). Nebulin was solubilized from rat psoas muscle fibers and resolved from other myofibrillar proteins using a large pore, 3.3–12% linear gradient SDS-gel electrophoresis system, under conditions optimized to resolve giant myofibrillar proteins (41Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar, 42Granzier H.L.M. Wang K. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm; Schleicher and Schuell), blocking, and incubation with 1 μg/ml purified human E-Tmod in binding buffer (80 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2% Triton X-100, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), Tmod binding to nebulin was detected by incubation with affinity-purified rabbit anti-human E-Tmod antibodies followed by125I-protein A and autoradiography. Nebulin was detected on a parallel nitrocellulose strip by immunoblotting with goat anti-nebulin antibodies (generously provided by Dr. Kuan Wang, University of Texas at Austin) followed by rabbit anti-goat antibodies and 125I-protein A. Nebulin cDNA fragments encoding various domains were amplified from total human skeletal muscle cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, using a matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The primer sequences used are listed in the . The obtained fragments were subcloned into the T7 promoter-regulated pET vectors, which express their inserts C-terminally fused to 6× histidine tags (Novagen, Madison, WI). The expressed nebulin fragments corresponded to neb N-term (11.3 kDa); neb N-term + M1 (13.6 kDa); neb N-term + M1-M2-M3 (21.8 kDa); M1-M2-M3 (13.5 kDa); M1-M8 (33.7 kDa); and M9-M15 (32.8 kDa). Additionally, a fragment corresponding to the unique acidic N-terminal domain plus the first three N-terminal modular repeats (nette + R1-R2-R3) of the cardiac nebulin-like protein, nebulette, was also expressed as a control (24.3 kDa). To exclude potential artifacts from the histidine tags, the M1-M2-M3 nebulin fragment also was expressed in the pETM-11 vector, which allows histidine tag removal after cleavage by the TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.). The inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the expression vectors were transformed into Epicurian Coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Large scale preparations of the nebulin fragments and the nebulette fragment were purified from the cell lysates according to instructions from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Briefly, a 100-ml overnight culture of the transformed bacterial cells was used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria broth containing 35 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8, induced with 0.2–0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma), and 3–4 h later were collected by centrifugation. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol plus 100 μg/ml of tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm PefaBloc) and sonicated to lyse cells and reduce viscosity of the lysate. The lysate was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a column containing 300 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The column was washed sequentially with 30 ml of lysis buffer, 30 ml of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, 1 ml of 1 m NaCl, and 50 ml of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The His6-tagged protein was eluted from the column with 10 ml of 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and peak fractions were pooled. Some nebulin fragment preparations (containing contaminating bacterial proteins) were further purified using a fast protein liquid chromatography system on a Mono Q anion exchange column or Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pooled peak fractions were concentrated using Centriplus centrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cut-off of 3,000) (Millipore Corp.), and dialyzed against binding buffer for the solid phase binding assays (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.002% NaN3) using Slide-A-Lyzers (molecular weight cut-off of 3,000) (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). All proteins were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Solid phase binding assays were performed in duplicates using flat-bottom Costar EasyWash, High Binding, 96-well microtiter plates (Corning, Acton, MA). The volume of all solutions used was 100 μl/well. Wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 nm nebulin fragments or the N-terminal nebulette fragment or with 100 nm skeletal muscle tropomyosin (as a positive control), diluted in 0.1 mcarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The wells were washed three times with binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.002% NaN3, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) and then blocked in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The wells were then incubated with binding buffer only or with 2.5 nm (or otherwise noted concentrations) biotinylated recombinant E or Sk-Tmod for 1 h at 4 °C. After three additional washes, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated ImmunoPure streptavidin (Pierce) was diluted 1:10,000 in binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, the washes were repeated, and 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) (diluted into 0.1 m glycine, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, pH 10.4) was added to the wells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Binding of Tmod to nebulin was determined by a colorimetric reaction at A405 on a Tecan plate reader (Phenix; Hayward, CA) using Tecan Winselect software (Phenix). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. For determining the dissociation constant (Kd) for the Tmod/nebulin interaction, a direct calibration ELISA (dcELISA) study was performed (43Fuchs H Orberger G. Tauber R. Gessner R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 188: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The dcELISA utilizes a series of linearized plots to accurately quantify association constants. Briefly, in a series of ELISA experiments within the linear range, the absorbance is related by a constant, unknown calibration factor (c) to the amount of immobilized “receptor” (i.e. the M1-M2-M3 nebulin fragment) bound to its soluble “ligand” (i.e.the biotinylated Tmod). This calibration factor can be determined assuming that a defined amount of ligand in solution becomes completely bound to an immobilized receptor upon repeated transfer from one receptor-coated well to another in a series of “transfer assays.” For the dcELISA, three sets of experiments were required, using the solid phase binding assay conditions described above. First, the incubation time of the receptor with the ligand was varied in a time course to determine the rate constant, kc . Second, a series of “transfer assays” (where unbound ligand from one receptor-coated well is transferred to the next, identically coated well) was performed at various times of incubation (10, 15, 20, and 30 min) in order to determine the transfer factor, Ft as well as c. Finally, a saturation curve under equilibrium conditions was generated to determine the amount of immobilized receptor available to bind to the ligand. The obtained results allowed for the calculation of the association constant, Ka , the inverse of which is equal to the Kd value. An assay to confirm binding of Tmod to nebulin under native conditions was adapted from Watakabe et al. (44Watakabe A. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μg of biotinylated Tmod was incubated with 1 μg (or otherwise noted amount) of the recombinant nebulin fragment, M1-M2-M3, in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.002% NaN3) at room temperature for 1 h. 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer were added to the protein solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. 20 μl of the supernatant, containing unbound proteins, were recovered and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The Sepharose slurry was washed five times with 400 μl of binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by incubating the slurry with 20 μl of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, for 1 h at room temperature. The eluted proteins were neutralized with 1 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The same volume of unbound and eluted proteins was separated on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Previous immunolocalization studies have revealed that the N-terminal region of nebulin is located at or in close proximity to the pointed ends of the thin filaments (10Kruger M. Wright J. Wang K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Wright J. Huang Q.Q. Wang K. J. Muscle Res.

To determine if the N-terminal region of nebulin colocalizes with Tmod at the pointed ends of the thin filaments, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy studies were performed. Polyclonal antibodies were generated against a recombinant fragment comprising nebulin's extreme N-terminal uniqu"
https://openalex.org/W2009973632,"We cloned and sequenced the acetylcholinesterase gene and cDNA of zebrafish, Danio rerio. We found a single gene (ache) located on linkage group LG7. The relative organization of ache, eng2, and shhgenes is conserved between zebrafish and mammals and defines a synteny. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was allowed to identify several allelic variations. We also identified two transposable elements in non-coding regions of the gene. Compared with other vertebrate acetylcholinesterase genes, achegene contains no alternative splicing at 5′ or 3′ ends where only a T exon is present. The translated sequence is 60–80% identical to acetylcholinesterases of the vertebrates and exhibits an extra loop specific to teleosts. Analysis of molecular forms showed a transition, at the time of hatching, from the globular G4 form to asymmetric A12 form that becomes prominent in adults. In situhybridization and enzymatic activity detection on whole embryos confirmed early expression of the acetylcholinesterase gene in nervous and muscular tissues. We found no butyrylcholinesterase gene or activity in Danio. These findings make zebrafish a promising model to study function of acetylcholinesterase during development and regulation of molecular forms assembly in vivo.

In addition to hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synapses, AChE was shown to be involved in non-cholinergic functions, influencing differentiation and neuronal outgrowth (reviewed in Ref. 1Brimijoin S. Koenigsberger C. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 1: 59-64Google Scholar). During development in vertebrates, AChE appears long before synapses are functional, and its role in this context is not clear (2Layer P.G. Alber R. Rathjen F.G. Development. 1988; 102: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar, 3Layer P.G. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Successive expression of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, EC 3.1.1.8) and AChE was associated with transition from the proliferation state to differentiation in embryonic chick somites (2Layer P.G. Alber R. Rathjen F.G. Development. 1988; 102: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Zebrafish is a useful model for vertebrate early development and is amenable to experimental modulation of the cholinergic system, AChE activity, or ache gene expression. In this fish, AChE is expressed in neurons long before axons reach their target (4Hanneman E. Trevarrow B. Metcalfe W.K. Kimmel C.B. Westerfield M. Development. 1988; 103: 49-58PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanneman E. Westerfield M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 284: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Wilson S.W. Ross L.S. Parrett T.

When embryos were bathed with organophosphate (diisopropylfluorophosphate), AChE was totally inhibited, and somitogenesis was altered (8Hanneman E.H. J. Exp. Zool. 1992; 263: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is to note, however, that effect on development may not be related to AChE inhibition since diisopropylfluorophosphate inhibits many hydrolases. In vertebrates, AChE is characterized by a large set of molecular forms. During development and tissue differentiation their proportion varies. This polymorphism is due to alternative mRNA processing at the 3′ end of the gene resulting in proteins containing different C-terminal peptides. Exon H encodes a hydrophobic peptide that is cleaved upon glycolipid addition. Exon T encodes a peptide highly conserved among species. Soluble monomers (G1), dimers (G2), and tetramers (G4) are composed of T subunits. In addition these tetramers may be associated with structural subunits, a collagenic tail in neuromuscular junctions, or a membrane protein in brain (9Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In some cases, the genomic sequence following the last common exon is retained into the mRNA. Physiological significance of this readthrough transcript is not known (9Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to study AChE functions during development of Danio rerio, we first characterized its early expression. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the zebrafish ache gene and cDNA. We showed that zebrafish has a single ache gene encoding only T subunits and has no bche gene. We located the ache gene in the zebrafish genome on LG7 near eng2 and shh. It contains transposable elements in non-coding regions and also presents allelic variations. We show that the fully mature pattern of AChE molecular forms is reached only after 1 week of development, in free swimming larvae, whereas the AChE expression pattern analysis showed an early expression from the 5- to 7-somite stage (12 h). D. rerio adults and embryos were from our facility. Fish are maintained at 28 °C on a 13-h light/11-h dark cycle. The AB strain was a gift of Dr. Bricaud (Universitédes Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, Montpellier, France), and the ABO strain was a gift of Dr. Strähle (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). Embryos were collected from spontaneous spawnings and staged according to Westerfield (10Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). All molecular biology procedures including genomic DNA and RNA isolation, Northern and Southern blots, PCR amplification followed standard techniques (10Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar, 11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the manufacturer's protocols. Chemicals are from Sigma, Fluka, or Aldrich, and enzymes are from Promega, New England Biolabs, and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sequencing was performed with the Big Dye kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences following the supplier's protocol. Degenerate primers P1, P2, and P3 were designed from conserved sequences of AChEs. Reverse transcription was performed with Expand RT (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using primer (P3) 5′ GAACTC(A/G)AT(C/T)TCATAGCC(A/G)TG 3′ on total adult RNAs. A first cDNA fragment was isolated by PCR using primers (P1) 5′ TT(T/C)C(C/A)(G/A)GGTTCiGAGATGTGGAA 3′ and (P2) 5′-GC(T/G)(G/C)(G/C)iCCiGCACTCTC(C/T)CC(A/G)AA-3′. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments were performed to find the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and to locate the transcription start site. A zebrafish genomic library cloned in Lambda Fix II vector was purchased from Stratagene. Approximately 1 × 106clones were first screened with the P1–P2 cDNA fragment. Clone 14 was fully sequenced, and although it covered 8 kb of genomic AChE sequence, it did not contain non-coding exon 1. We performed a second screen with a 220-bp probe covering exon 1. Two additional clones 8N and 14N were isolated and sequenced, and they both contained the transcriptional start site and promoter region. Sequence analysis using the blast algorithm (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) was performed at NCBI. For identification of transposable elements, blastn (nucleotide search versus a nucleotide data base) was performed versus the “non-human, non-mouse EST” or versus the non-redundant GenBankTM nucleotide data base. Blastx analysis (translated nucleotide sequence search versus a protein sequence data base) was performed versus the GenBankTM non-redundant protein data base. Cholinesterase sequence analysis was performed at ESTHER data base. The polymorphism found in the fourth intron (see “Results”) in genomic clones was used to search for segregation in the MOP haploid mapping cross-panel (13Postlethwait J.H. Yan Y.-L. Gates M. Horne S. Amores A. Brownlie A. Donovan A. Egan E. Ekker M. Force A. Gong Z. Goutel C. Fritz A. Kelsh R. Knapik E. Liao E. Paw P. Ransom D. Singer A. Thomson M. Abduljabbar T.S. Yelick P. Beier D.

The allele-specific oligonucleotides, indicated in Fig. 1, (Forward) 5′ GAGGAAGTCATAACAGAAGTGAGAAT 3′ and (Reverse) 5′ CGCAGACAAGGCATTTCCTTGATAA 3′ amplified a fragment of 300 bp for one allele or 1100 bp for the other allele. The mapping panel was previously genotyped for over 800 PCR-based markers (13Postlethwait J.H. Yan Y.-L. Gates M. Horne S. Amores A. Brownlie A. Donovan A. Egan E. Ekker M. Force A. Gong Z. Goutel C.

Genomics. 1999; 58: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The strain distribution patterns were analyzed using MapManager. The sequences of zebrafish loci, including simple sequence length (14Shimoda N. Knapik E.W. Ziniti J. Sim C. Yamada E. Kaplan S. Jackson D. de Sauvage F. Jacob H. Fishman M.C. Genomics. 1999; 58: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) were compared with sequences of human and mouse genes in GenBankTM using the blastx algorithm (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar). The map locations of human ACHE and mouse Ache genes were found in On Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneMap 99, and Mouse Genome Data base. Human/mouse comparative mapping was accomplished at the NCBI HomoloGene site. For Southern blot experiments, about 30 μg of DNA were digested with each restriction enzyme and loaded on 0.8% agarose gels. After migration, the DNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight in 0.4 n NaOH, 1 m NaCl. Probes were synthesized with [32P]dCTPs and Megaprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on G-50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were done in 6× SSC, 0.25% powdered milk, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C with 2 × 106dpm/ml. After a 2-min wash in 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and two times for 20 min in 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C, membranes were exposed 24 h on a phosphoactivable screen and analyzed on a StormImager (Molecular Dynamics). PCRs analyses were performed on genomic DNA from the two parent fish and nine 4-day-old offspring from one cross. For a single embryo, 5 μl of genomic DNA were used in PCR at a total volume of 50 μl. 5 μl of PCR products were digested with 10 units of EcoRI during at least 3 h at 37 °C. The entire reaction was loaded on 0.8% agarose gel. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in fixation buffer (0.15 m CaCl2, 4% sucrose in 0.1 m NaPO4, pH 7.4) for 12–16 h at 4 °C, washed twice for 5 min in PBST (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), pH 7.4, and conserved in methanol at −20 °C. Before staining, embryos were rehydrated 10 min in solutions containing 75, 50, and 25% methanol in PBST and washed 5 min in PBST. A cDNA, covering the entire coding sequence from the start codon to the stop codon, was obtained by high fidelity RT-PCR and cloned in the pBS-SK+ vector. Sense and reverse constructs were used to synthesize in situ hybridization antisense and sense mRNA probes. Fluorescein or digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized with T7 polymerase and NTP-labeling mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was performed according to the method described (10Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Staining was performed with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate disodium (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). AChE activity was detected on fixed embryos (6–8 h in fixation buffer at room temperature) with a method adapted from Karnovsky and Roots (15Karnovsky M.J. Roots L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Embryos were incubated 4–5 h in 60 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.4, 5 mm sodium citrate, 4.7 mmCuSO4, 0.5 mmK3(Fe(CN)6), and 1.7 mmacetylthiocholine iodide and washed extensively with PBST before observation. AChE proteins were extracted from adult zebrafish or embryos. Tissues were homogenized sequentially in 5–10 volumes of low salt (LS), high salt (HS), low salt-Triton (LST) buffers, or a unique extraction in high salt-Triton (HST) buffer. LS buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, and aprotinin (7.5 × 10−3 trypsin inhibiting unit/ml, Sigma). HS buffer was LS + 1 m NaCl. LST and HST buffers contained the same components as LS or HS + 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). The AChE activity of extracts and gradient fractions was assayed according to the spectrophotometric method of Ellman et al.(16Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21715) Google Scholar) using acetylthiocholine iodide or butyrylthiocholine iodide (Sigma) as substrates. Protein content of samples was estimated following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Molecular forms were analyzed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed in a Bio-Rad apparatus (5 × 8-cm gels of 7.5% bisacrylamide). Gels and running buffers contained 50 mm Tris glycine, pH 8.9, with detergents 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% deoxycholate. Gels were washed in distilled water and stained with acetylthiocholine as substrate according to Karnovsky and Roots (15Karnovsky M.J. Roots L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.25 milliunits/phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) before loading. For collagenase treatment, HS extracts were diluted six times to a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Collagenase (Clostridiopeptidase A, Worthington) was added to a final concentration of 125 μg/ml and incubated at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of NaCl to 0.5 m final and stored on ice prior to centrifugation on sucrose gradient. Sedimentation analysis was performed in 11 ml of 5–20% sucrose gradients in LS, HS, LST, or HST buffers. Samples (250 μl) were loaded and centrifuged for 18 h at 40,000 rpm (200,000 ×g) at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor. Forty fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient and assayed for AChE activity at pH 7. Alkaline phosphatase from calf intestine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (s20, w w = 6.1) and β-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (s20, w w = 16) were used as internal markers of migration. A mini-gene containing the entire coding sequence of AChE was assembled from three genomic fragments and cloned in the expression vector pMT/V5-His (Invitrogen). The gene extends from 117 bases upstream of exon 2 (183 upstream of start codon) to the stop codon. The final construct was totally sequenced before transfection in Drosophila S2 cells. This mini-gene was also introduced in pcDNA3 vector for in vivo overexpression in zebrafish embryos. Transfection of 50 μg of plasmid and expression in Drosophila S2 cells (3 × 106 cells/ml) was performed with the Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen). After induction of expression with copper, no serum was added to the cell growth medium. AChE was recovered from the cell medium. Microinjections into 1–2-cell stage embryos were performed with 200 ng/μl AChE-pcDNA3 plasmid in 0.5 m KCl, 2.5% rhodamine-B isothiocyanate dextran (Sigma). About 500 pl of solution were injected into each embryo using a Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf). In kinetic experiments we used recombinant AChE secreted in growth medium or native AChE from whole zebrafish extracts. Activity was assayed in Ellman reaction buffer (16Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21715) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.01% bovine serum albumin. AChE extracts were incubated for 15 min with buffer reaction before addition of various concentrations of acetylthiocholine iodide at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored in a spectrophotometer at 412 nm. Km and Kss values were determined according to the Haldan equation with 0.01–100 mm acetylthiocholine. Apparent first order rate constant,kcat, was calculated as described previously (17Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The constants of inhibition, Ki and αKi , were determined for several inhibitors with acetylthiocholine from 0.06 to 0.7 mm. Each experiment was repeated 3–5 times using 5 concentrations of ASCh and 4–5 concentrations of inhibitor. Results were identical for recombinant or native AChE, with a standard error less than 10%. Cholinesterase activity was first detected, in whole embryos, using a histochemical reaction adapted from Karnovsky and Roots (15Karnovsky M.J. Roots L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). In 24-h embryos, strong activity appeared with acetylthiocholine (ASCh) within a few hours of staining, whereas there was no staining with butyrylthiocholine (BSCh). Eserine (10−5m) inhibited all ASCh hydrolysis and staining of embryos. Cholinesterase activity was also measured in protein extracts. The level of BSCh hydrolysis in 24-, 48-, and 72-h embryo extracts was less than 1% of the rate of ASCh hydrolysis. This value is similar to the ratio determined for AChE of lamprey and hagfish, which have only an AChE (18Pezzementi L. Sutherland D. Sanders M. Soong W. Milner D. McClellan J.S. Sapp M. Coblentz W.B. Rulewicz G. Merritt S. Doctor B.P. Taylor P. Quinn D.M. Rotundo R.L. Gentry M.K. Structure and Function of Cholinesterases and Related Proteins. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 105-110Crossref Google Scholar). A low VmaxBSCh/VmaxASCh ratio is consistent with the properties of AChE (19Vellom D.C. Radic Z. Li Y. Pickering N.A. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We also analyzed cholinesterase activity in adult in total extracts and in brain and heart extracts. In all tissues there was no residual ASCh or BSCh hydrolysis activity when a specific inhibitor of AChE, BW284c51, was used at 10−6m. We conclude that a single AChE was responsible for ASCh and BSCh hydrolysis in zebrafish. Cholinesterase activity in zebrafish heart is sensitive to BW284c51, contrary to the cholinesterase activity found in the heart of Torpedo, mainly originating from BChE (20Toutant J.P. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 580-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, an excess of the substrate ASCh inhibits activity of the enzyme, showing a specific property of AChEs versus BChEs. We failed to detect bche gene by RT-PCR with degenerated oligonucleotides specific for BChEs. We did find, however, the 3′-coding region of an esterase (GenBankTM accession numberAF003943) 67% homologous to carboxyl ester lipase from Salmo salar (GenBankTM accession number L23929). This indicates that we used conditions that were relaxed enough to allow us to detect hybridization of oligonucleotides to a putative zebrafish bche gene if it had been present. By using primers P1 and P2, we first isolated a cDNA fragment that was used to screen a genomic library. We isolated three independent genomic clones (see “Experimental Procedures”). They overlap as shown in Fig. 1. The total sequence covered 12 kb of genomic sequence including 3.3 kb of 5′ potential promoter region. The ache gene contains 5 exons; the first is non-coding and is followed by a large intron of 5 kb. Compared with other vertebrate ache gene sequences, the zebrafish ache gene contains an insertion interrupting the large exon 2. This 226-nt insertion encodes 30 amino acids (Fig. 2) followed by a small intron of 136 bp (Fig. 1). The inserted amino acids were located on the protein surface as determined by three-dimensional modeling (21Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The last exon is a T exon. We fully sequenced all intronic sequences upstream of the T exon where the H exon is located in other vertebrate ache genes. We did not find any sequence in genomic DNA that could correspond to a hydrophobic H exon. The start of transcription, a cytosine, was found 303 bp upstream from the Met initiation codon. A canonical TATA box is found 28 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Coding sequence covers 1905 bp, and at the 3′ end, a poly(A) site identified with 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends defined a non-coding sequence of 340 bp. An additional downstream poly(A) site may be also used as PCR performed with an oligonucleotide located after the first poly(A) signal also amplified AChE cDNA. The total length of sequenced cDNA is 2548 bp, and a unique mRNA was detected on Northern blots (data not shown). We never found 3′ alternative splicing or readthrough cDNA as seen in some vertebrate AChEs (Massoulié et al. (9Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). Only T exon is present. No cryptic alternative splicing could be found similar to what was described for Electrophorus electricus AChE (21Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 634-amino acid sequence of zebrafish AChE is 62% identical to mammalian AChE, 64% identical to Torpedo, and 80% identical to Electrophorus. We found at conserved positions all the elements specific of AChEs, detailed in Fig. 2. The protein contains 6 potential N-glycosylation sites, all identical in position to glycosylation sites in a ray-finned fish, the electric eel Electrophorus, but only two of them were conserved in the AChE of a cartilagenous fish, the electric ray Torpedo. In the non-coding region of the zebrafish ache gene (Fig. 1 and3), we identified three domains presenting high similarity to some otherwise unrelated fish genes and ESTs. Domain I, located upstream from non-coding exon 1, is 1162 bp long. It is flanked by two inverted repeats of 35 nt showing 80% of identity (see Fig. 8, in “Discussion”). Blastx analysis with the protein data base showed that almost all the sequence inside the inverted repeats was highly homologous to the Tc1-like transposase family. A translated sequence of transposase could be assembled by removing frameshifts and stop codons. We identified 3 boxes corresponding to the catalytic domain (for a review see Ref. 22Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 326-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The second D box is shortened compared with the canonical sequence, and therein aspartic acid is changed to an asparagine. We also identified a G-rich region as well as the nuclear localization signal. The DNA binding domain is difficult to recognize in this sequence as such domains in transposases are structural elements with low sequence conservation (22Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 326-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Blast analysis showed that more than 50 zebrafish ESTs showed homology with the transposase region. This is also the case of 7 non-coding regions of cloned genes from fish (4 from zebrafish and one from either medaka fish Oryzia latipes, tilapia Haplochromis burtoni or pufferfish Fugu rubripes). A 443-bp internal segment of this domain I is deleted in the AB line and in one of the isolated genomic clones (Fig. 1). Domain II (822 bp) is located inside intron 1. As in the case of the first domain, it is flanked by two inverted repeats (58 nt with 57% of identity). Domain II has no homology with coding sequences when compared with protein data base. It includes two sub-domains (Fig. 3). A first sub-domain shows a large number of blast homology hits with ESTs (>100), with non-coding region of 11 zebrafish genes, and contains several large direct repeats. A second sub-domain is characterized by two large inverted repeats separated by an A-rich domain. This second sub-domain is homologous to Danio-specific transposable element called angel(23Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Shimoda N. Mohn D. Okamoto H. Hackett P.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We identified only one of the T2 domains that form short inverted repeats at both ends of angel elements (23Izsvak Z. Ivics Z. Shimoda N. Mohn D. Okamoto H. Hackett P.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Domain III is located in intron 4 and was only found in genomic clone 14N (Fig. 1). A 16-nucleotide sequence (AGCCCCTTTCACACAG) is found in inverted orientation at both ends of the insertion. The central 0.5-kb domain was flanked by direct long repeats of about 60 bp. As for domains I and II, this sequence shows homology with a large number of zebrafish ESTs (Fig. 3). A commercial genomic library made with DNA from several adults was screened. Three independent clones were isolated. They differed from one other by two large insertions and multiple point mutations (Fig. 1). The whole domain III, previously described in intron 4, was only found in the clone 14N. This insertional polymorphism was used to map ache on zebrafish genetic map (see below). In addition, a 443-bp segment located inside domain I is deleted in fish from our stock, in AB strain, and in one genomic clone. Southern analysis of genomic DNA was first performed on fish from our stock using probes 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1). Fifteen restriction enzymes were used, and some results are presented on Fig.4 A. For most restriction enzymes, or combinations, the size of the bands matched the expected size deduced from the gene restriction map, but an extra high molecular weight band was detected when EcoRI or HindIII were used. Sizes of these second bands correspond to a genomic sequence in which one HindIII and one EcoRI site, previously located in intron 1 and 2, are missing (Fig. 1). The same experiment performed on AB and ABO fish showed that AB was polymorphic, whereas ABO genomic DNA had only the short HindIII and EcoRI fragments. To ensure that the extra bands were due to allelic polymorphism rather than the presence of a gene duplicate, we analyzed genetic transmission of the two forms. We performed PCRs on genomic DNA with primers surrounding the alternative EcoRI site, on adult breeding pairs, and their progeny. Amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI to determine the genotype of each fish. When one parent was homozygous for one variant and the other parent was homozygous for the alternative variant (Fig. 4 B), all F1 progeny were heterozygotes and presented bands both resistant and sensitive to EcoRI digestion. We also observed mendelian transmission of this variation of restriction site by crossing one homozygote and one heterozygote (not shown). By using the restriction polymorphism, we have cloned and sequenced the HindIII-EcoRI-resistant allel"
https://openalex.org/W2087139409,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase belonging to the Tec family of kinases, has been shown to be critical for B cell proliferation, differentiation, and signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in the Btk gene lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency in humans, and the less severe condition xid in mice. Although Btk is mainly localized in the cytoplasm under steady state conditions, it translocates to the plasma membrane upon growth factor stimulation and cross-linking of the B cell receptor. Nevertheless, in ectopically as well as endogenously Btk-expressing cells, it can also translocate to the nucleus. Deletion of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (ΔPH1) leads, however, to an even redistribution of Btk within the nucleus and cytoplasm in the majority of transfected cells. In contrast, an SH3-deleted (ΔSH3) mutant of Btk has been found to be predominantly nuclear. We also demonstrate that the nuclear accumulation of ΔPH1 is dependent on Src expression. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is sensitive to the exportin 1/CRM1-inactivating drug, leptomycin B, indicating that Btk utilizes functional nuclear export signals. In addition, while the ΔPH1 mutant of Btk was found to be active and tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, ΔSH3 displayed decreased autokinase activity and was not phosphorylated. Our findings indicate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Btk has implications regarding potential targets inside the nucleus, which may be critical in gene regulation during B cell development and differentiation.

Btk is the only member of this family in which mutations have been found to be associated with disease. To date, more than 300 unique mutations have been identified in this gene (4Vihinen M.

Loss-of-function mutations in Btk lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans, the hallmark of which is the absence of circulating B lymphocytes. A mutation in the corresponding gene in mice results in X-linked B cell immunodeficiency with a milder phenotype (5Thomas J.D. Sideras P. Smith C.I. Vorechovsky I. Chapman V. Paul W.E.

The genetic blueprint of Btk reveals a complex structure shared by many other members of this group of kinases. It is characterized by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and finally a kinase domain. The TH domain itself is split into an amino-terminal part, the Btk motif, and a C-terminal domain with a doubly repeated proline-rich stretch (1Mano H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PH domain of Btk has been shown to bind to phosphorylated inositol lipids and may also have other functions, such as protein-protein interactions (8Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although Btk has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in nearly all cells of the hematopoietic lineage, except plasma and T cells, it is only the B cells that have been shown to be most vulnerable regarding the functional integrity of Btk. Thus, Btk has been shown to be crucial for B lymphocyte development, differentiation, proliferation, and signaling (9Conley M.E. Cooper M.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Scand. J. Immunol. 1999; 49: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism(s) underlying Btk activation and signaling in B cells are not fully understood, a plethora of Btk-interacting proteins as well as downstream targets/substrates have been described over the last years (7Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Smith, C. I. E., Islam, T. C., Mattsson, P. T., Mohamed, A. J., Nore, B. F., and Vihinen, M. (2001)Bioessays, in press.Google Scholar). Although Btk has been shown to be predominantly cytoplasmic and can translocate to the plasma membrane upon, for example, growth factor stimulation of cells, a small pool of the protein can also translocate to the nucleus under certain physiological growth conditions (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most proteins that normally reside in the nucleus contain specific targeting sequences called nuclear localization signals (NLS). The core of the classical NLS utilized by the majority of mammalian proteins consists of a few positively charged residues, mainly arginine and lysine, that assist the interaction with the importin α/β complex before docking to the nuclear pore (14Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The cut-off size regarding the transport of macromolecules through the nuclear pore complex is believed to be roughly 40–50 kDa. Thus, smaller proteins can simply diffuse in and out of the nucleus, while proteins that are larger than 60 kDa gain access to the nuclear compartment only if they contain import signals. Proteins that have functions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm contain nuclear export signals (NES) in addition to the NLS. NES are entities specifically recognized by the nuclear export receptor CRM1/exportin 1 for transport of proteins out of the nucleus (15Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The prototype NES is a leucine-rich hydrophobic sequence initially identified in Rev, an mRNA-exporting protein from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (16Fridell R.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4421-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The nuclear export of proteins that contain NES can be inhibited by leptomycin B, a Streptomyces metabolite that binds covalently to CRM1 (17Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 18Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl.

In the present work, we have extended our initial investigation regarding the intracellular distribution of Btk to include events taking place in the nucleus. Our results show that Btk can translocate to the nucleus of cells. In addition, we provide evidence that Btk utilizes functional CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal(s) to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Also, in Src-deficient fibroblasts, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a deleted PH domain mutant of Btk was found to be dependent on c-Src expression. The protease inhibitor mixture in the form of a tablet was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. LMB was a generous gift of Dr. Minoru Yoshida (University of Tokyo, Japan). Anti-Btk rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), as has the use of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit antiserum to Lyn was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. COS-7, 293T, NIH 3T3, SYF, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1000 units of penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The B cell lymphoid cell lines Ramos and Raji and the pre-B cell line Nalm6 were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The HMC-1 mast cell line was grown in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. Transfections were carried out by using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell fusion and the interspecies heterokaryon assay were performed essentially as described (19Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The Btk-GFP and K430E-GFP constructs have been described previously (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For generation of a GFP-Btk chimeric protein, the Btk cDNA was cloned in frame into plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) using conventional cloning procedures. The double tyrosine-mutated Btk, Y223A/Y551F (2YF), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For the ΔSH3-GFP (ΔSH3) fusion construct, residues 201–253 were deleted from the SH3 domain using overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction. This modified segment was transferred to plasmid Btk-GFP by replacing the corresponding fragment in the wild-type counterpart. All constructs involving manipulations by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced to ensure the absence of mutations. To create a PH-deleted green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct, the Btk cDNA was excised using relevant restriction endonucleases that selectively truncate the PH-TH region, and the resulting fragment was subsequently ligated in frame into the C terminus of plasmid pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). These constructs have been referred to as GFP-ΔPH1 (Δ1–195) and GFP-ΔPH2 (Δ1–173), respectively, throughout (or ΔPH1 and ΔPH2). Plasmid pSGT-Src527 was kindly provided by Dr. G. Superti-Furga (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Actively growing cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.15% Nonidet P-40, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors), subjected once to a freeze-and-thaw procedure, and kept on ice for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and stored as cytoplasmic extract. The pellet was washed with lysis buffer, and nuclei were resuspended in 400 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.15% Nonidet P-40, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and left on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and stored in aliquots at −80 °C for later use. Cells were routinely analyzed 48 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation, in vitro kinase assay, and Western blotting were performed essentially as described (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded overnight at 50% confluence onto coverslips in six-well dishes and transfected the following day with the different fusion constructs. Leptomycin B-treated cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml LMB for 3–16 h. Cells were processed 48 h post-transfection for confocal microscopy analysis as described (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have undertaken a GFP fusion approach to investigate and explore the intracellular localization of Btk and also its trafficking properties. In an earlier work, we extensively described the usefulness of this system for dissecting the dynamics of in vivoredistribution of this protein in response to a wide variety of stimuli, both in native and in transfected cells (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have previously described a fusion construct consisting of Btk and GFP, where the Btk cDNA is genetically hooked to the amino terminus of GFP (Btk-GFP) (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This fusion construct was shown to be functionally and biochemically indistinguishable from native Btk. In the present work, to exclude the possibility that the addition of GFP into one end of the Btk moiety does not affect its trafficking properties and intracellular distribution adversely, we have fused the Btk cDNA to the C terminus of GFP to create a GFP-Btk chimeric protein (GFP-Btk). Transfection of this construct into 293T cells resulted in the expression of a protein product with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 104 kDa, a size that corresponds well to that anticipated for the fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). Expression of this GFP-Btk fusion protein was found to be substantially higher than that of the Btk-GFP previously described. This could be explained by the fact that the translation initiation site of the GFP protein exactly matches the conserved Kozak sequence found in most mammalian messenger RNAs (20Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PH-deleted mutant, GFP-ΔPH2, was up-regulated. The molecular mechanism(s) behind this, however, have yet to be determined. We have also expressed this new GFP-Btk construct in several different cell lines and analyzed the localization pattern by confocal microscopy. We found that the kinase properties as well as the subcellular location were indistinguishable from that of Btk-GFP (data not shown), indicating that tagging of Btk with GFP does not compromise the function and/or localization of Btk in any way. To further monitor the trafficking and subcellular localization of Btk, we transfected Btk-GFP and GFP-Btk fusion constructs into COS-7 cells and carefully analyzed their intracellular distribution. Although Btk has been found to be predominantly cytoplasmic, the protein also localized to the nucleus in a small subset of cells, corresponding to less than 10% of the total (Fig. 1 B). In addition, Btk translocation to the nucleus was reproducible in several different cell lines irrespective of whether these have been transiently or stably transfected (not shown). Finally, transfection of the pre-B cell line Nalm6 with the same construct gave a similar fluorescence pattern, whereby Btk, again in a few cells, localized to practically all parts of the cell including the nucleus (Fig. 1 C). To exclude the possibility that the observed nuclear localization of Btk in these transfected cells is artifactual due to the consequences of overexpression, we investigated Btk localization in different hematopoietic cells. Since we have not been able to use anti-Btk antibodies successfully in an immunofluorescence setting, we employed biochemical and subcellular fractionation techniques for determining localization in the nucleus. Btk was detected in the nuclear fraction in B cells (Ramos), pre-B cells (Nalm6), and mast cells (HMC-1), indicating that the protein can indeed localize to the nucleus of endogenously expressing cells. Nuclear accumulation of Btk was, however, more robust in Nalm6 (pre-B) and HMC-1 (mast) cells than in mature B cells (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). The presence of Btk in the nuclei of transfected cells as well as hematopoietic cells indicates that there might be a dynamic movement of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of how Btk translocates to the nucleus of cells, we treated Btk-GFP-transfected COS-7 cells with the exportin 1 (CRM1)-inactivating antibiotic, leptomycin B. Under steady state conditions, Btk localized exclusively to the cytoplasm in more than 90% of untreated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Incubation of cells with the drug resulted in the dramatic accumulation and retention of Btk in the nucleus of all cells, indicating that Btk or a Btk-interacting protein might indeed harbor functional nuclear export signal(s) (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, LMB treatment induced the nuclear accumulation of endogenous Btk in hematopoietic cells (Fig. 3, Aand B).Figure 3LMB stimulated nuclear accumulation of endogenous Btk. Western blot analysis is shown of lysates from nuclear (N) and cytosolic (C) extracts of Ramos (A) and Nalm6 cells (B) incubated with and without LMB. The tyrosine kinase Lyn was included as a cytosolic marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inspection of the amino-terminal region of the PH domain of Btk reveals several short lysine- and arginine-rich regions that could function as potential nuclear localization signals. Furthermore, the PH domain also contains a unique motif with considerable resemblance to the bipartite-basic type of nuclear localization signal carried by nucleoplasmin. To determine whether these basic-rich motifs of the PH domain can play any role in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Btk, a mutant protein that lacks its entire PH-TH domain doublet was generated. Transfection of a plasmid construct encoding ΔPHBtk fused to the C terminus of GFP (GFP-ΔPH1) in COS-7 cells resulted in a diffuse fluorescence pattern strongly reminiscent of that of GFP, with some cells displaying higher intensity in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B). Although ΔPH1 did not translocate to the plasma membrane, it distributed equally well in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the majority (>80%) of cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that while the PH-TH region seems to influence the nuclear export, it is not required or crucial for the translocation of Btk to the nucleus. Phosphorylation and activation of Btk in transfected fibroblast cells, such as COS-7 cells, has been shown to be dependent on the concomitant overexpression of most members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (21Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that, when co-expressed with Src, Btk translocated to the plasma membrane of cells, while a portion of it accumulated intracellularly (13Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of active Src in cells normally causes profound morphological changes such as cell rounding and subsequent detachment of cells from the substratum, making interpretation of results difficult. Therefore, we have undertaken another approach to investigate the biochemical and functional roles of Src regarding the subcellular distribution of Btk. We therefore transfected the Src-deficient cell line, SYF, with our fusion constructs. SYF is an immortalized fibroblast cell line derived from a knockout mouse having the major ubiquitously expressed Src family members (Src, Yes, and Fyn) deleted (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of the wild-type Btk and the SH3-deleted mutant was indistinguishable from that in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4, compare A andD and compare C and F). In contrast, the PH-deleted mutant was excluded from the nucleus and was entirely cytoplasmic (Fig. 4 E). However, LMB treatment induced complete accumulation of this mutant in the nucleus (Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we decided to determine whether reconstitution of c-Src into these Src-deficient cells affects subcellular distribution of ΔPH1. Therefore, we co-transfected the SYF cells with c-Src and plasmids encoding the different fusion constructs. While the subcellular localization pattern of Btk and ΔSH3 remained the same in the absence or presence of active Src, ΔPH1 accumulated in the nucleus in all cells (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the PH-deleted mutant of Btk is controlled by members of the c-Src family. The SH3 domain of Btk is an important module mediating protein-protein interactions as well as potential intramolecular associations involving the proline-rich motifs (23Yang W. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20832-20840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Btk has been shown to reside in the SH3 domain (25Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Remarkably, not a single X-linked agammaglobulinemia-causing missense mutation has so far been found in the SH3 domain, indicating that it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Btk. However, deletion of the SH3 domain of Btk has been shown to produce a protein that had decreased autokinase activity in comparison with the wild type (26Afar D.E. Park H. Howell B.W. Rawlings D.J. Cooper J. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3465-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, a naturally occurring alternatively spliced isoform of Tec having its entire SH3 domain deleted has been shown to be highly active (27Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Mano H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 1106-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We decided, therefore, to reinvestigate and evaluate the role of the SH3 domain in the regulation of Btk. Along that line, we set out also to explore whether this domain contains information that could be essential for the intracellular trafficking and subcellular localization of the protein. Thus, the large majority of amino acids that contribute to the SH3 domain were deleted, and the resulting mutant was fused to GFP (ΔSH3-GFP). The fusion protein was expressed in COS-7 and SYF cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, Cand F, deletion of the SH3 domain renders Btk predominantly nuclear in more than 90% of cells. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells, indicating that the observed protein distribution was not due to the cell line used (not shown). Since the ΔSH3 is the prototype nuclear form of Btk, we asked whether it cannot only enter and accumulate in the nucleus but can also be efficiently exported from there. Therefore, we utilized an interspecies heterokaryon analysis, a very sensitive in vivo assay that allows the simultaneous monitoring of the exit of the protein of interest from the donor nucleus to the cytoplasm and import into the surrounding acceptor nuclei. HeLa cells transfected 24 h earlier with a plasmid encoding ΔSH3-GFP were mixed and fused with a large excess of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. ΔSH3 could be detected readily in the nuclei of the mouse 3T3 cells (acceptor nucleus) following cell fusion after only 1 h (Fig. 5, E and F). These data strongly suggest that Btk unequivocally shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In addition, the autokinase activity of this mutant was found to be severely diminished, indicating that the SH3 domain could be important for the enzymatic regulation of Btk (Fig. 6 B). Finally, the ΔSH3 mutant was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 6 C). Earlier studies have shown that the PH domain may exert a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the activity of some members of Tec family kinases, protein kinases B and protein kinase D (28August A.

Therefore, we decided to characterize this mutant in order to understand the implications of deleting the PH domain of Btk. To test whether the mutant protein has some autokinase activity, we transfected 293T cells with the GFP-ΔPH constructs and performed an in vitro kinase complex assay. We found that deletion of the PH domain did not compromise the autokinase activity of Btk (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, the ΔPH2 mutant displayed higher activity than ΔPH1 and was comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Next, we sought to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of this construct occurs in vivodespite the removal of the PH domain. Total lysate from 293T cells transfected with this construct was subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 6 C shows that the ΔPH mutants can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation similar to the wild-type counterpart. We also sought to determine whether the small fraction of Btk that is present in the nucleus is phosphorylated. Accordingly, we used the pre-B cell line Nalm6 as a model cell to investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk. The main reasons for choosing this cell line are 1) this is the developmental stage at which the phenotype in X-linked agammaglobulinemia is first manifested, 2) expression of Btk is relatively high compared with mature B cells, making biochemical detection easier, 3) tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is constitutive, obviating the need for prior stimulation of cells (32Kitanaka A. Mano H. Conley M.E. Campana D. Blood. 1998; 91: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 4) we found in preliminary studies that, under normal physiological growth conditions, a substantial amount of Btk is present in the nucleus (this study). To that end, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions have been extracted from actively growing Nalm6 cells, and lysates from these were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Btk antibodies followed by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10. Our results show that Btk can be readily tyrosine-phosphorylated in these cells and that this active Btk exists in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 7,left). The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated Btk in the nucleus, however, is far less than that in the cytosolic fraction. Instead, a shorter significantly phosphorylated Btk-specific band can be detected in the nuclear fraction of these cells. Moreover, under the experimental conditions employed, the anti-Btk antibody precipitated several additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins ranging between 56 and 160 kDa (Fig. 7, short arrows). The major finding in this study has been the discovery of the remarkable ability of Btk to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The majority of proteins that do so, however, perform duties in both compartments. Btk translocates to the nucleus but seems to be exported rapidly. As far as we know, Btk phosphorylates its major substrates primarily in the cytoplasm or in the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Whether corresponding nuclear targets of Btk also exist remains to be established. There are, however, examples of other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that translocate to the nucleus by virtue of their distinct nuclear localization signals (33Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, these kinases utilize specific NES in order to exit from the nucleus. We do not, at the present time, understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Btk. Two lines of evidence suggest, however, that this shuttling is independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the protein. This is clearly evident in circumstances whereby in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is not feasible. Transfected fibroblasts and unstimulated B cells are a case in point. Yet, in both cases, Btk translocates to the nucleus. Second, Btk mutants that lack catalytic activity or have their major tyrosine-phosphorylated residues mutagenized can translocate to the nucleus (data not shown). These findings provide further evidence that neither tyrosine phosphorylation nor the catalytic activity is required for the nuclear translocation of Btk. Nonetheless, the machinery used by Btk to get into the nucleus is enigmatic, and whether it is mediated by specific NLS remains to be established. There is, however, a short basic region containing a cluster of positively charged residues in the PH domain that may, at first glance, correspond to an NLS region. Our analysis, however, indicates that these sequences are neither necessary nor required for the nuclear translocation of Btk, since a PH-deleted mutant of Btk has been found to be equally distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The PH domain, on the other hand, functions as a protein-protein interacting module that mediates the association of Btk with other ligands. Therefore, disruption of such interaction(s) as a result of deleting the PH domain may compromise the cytoplasmic retention or sequestering of Btk. Although both ΔPH1 and ΔSH3 mutants efficiently translocate to the nucleus, they show significant biochemical and subcellular localization differences. First, ΔPH1 displays substantial autokinase activity. In addition, we found that the ΔPH1 mutant is also tyrosine-phosphorylated. This observation is in striking contrast to recent data reported by others where in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of a similar construct involving Itk failed to materialize unless it was delivered to the plasma membrane (28August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The most plausible explanation regarding these discrepancies is differences in the nature of the constructs as well as the expression systems employed. We used a PH-TH deletion construct, while the deletion in those constructs was confined either to the PH domain or included part of the TH. Moreover, the host cells that we used for expressing the constructs were the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, while these investigators used COS-7 and Jurkat cells, respectively (28August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Ching K.A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Tsoukas C.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6006-6013PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Itk may be different with regard to its phosphorylation and activation mechanisms. The tyrosine phosphorylation of a PH domain-lacking molecule is intriguing, since the PH domain has itself been suggested to be a prerequisite for the plasma membrane targeting and subsequent activation of Btk (34Li T. Rawlings D.J. Park H. Kato R.M. Witte O.N. Satterthwaite A.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ΔSH3 mutant, which had substantially low autokinase activity, compared with ΔPH1 and wild-type Btk, showed virtually no evidence ofin vivo tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C). While the PH domain-deleted mutant is excluded from the nucleus in the Src-deficient cell line SYF and may also show cell line-dependent localization, the ΔSH3 is predominantly nuclear (Fig. 4, C and F). Furthermore, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ΔPH1 was found to be dependent on Src expression, indicating that a Btk-interacting protein may translocate to the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. Alternatively, another Src-dependent protein that sequesters Btk in the cytoplasm may release it when tyrosine-phosphorylated, leading to the nuclear translocation of Btk. Finally, interaction of Btk with other Src substrates may expose masked NLS. As described above, deletion of the SH3 domain renders Btk predominantly nuclear, suggesting that this domain contains nuclear export signal(s) and/or enables Btk to localize to the cytoplasm through its protein interacting capacity. Careful inspection of the PH domain reveals a unique leucine-rich sequence motif located between residues 22 and 32 (PLNFKKRLFLL) that mimics classical NES. Leptomycin B also induced nuclear accumulation of the ΔPH1 mutant in SYF cells, suggesting that other candidate NES sequences, in addition to this motif, might exist in Btk. This argument has support, since the increased accumulation of ΔSH3 in the nucleus suggests that the leucine-rich motif in the PH domain is not sufficient for mediating nuclear export of Btk. Alternatively, the nuclear translocation of ΔSH3 could be dominant over its nuclear export, since, in an interspecies heterokaryon analysis, this mutant has been shown to be exported efficiently from the donor nucleus (producer cell) and accumulated in that of a recipient cell shortly afterward. In conclusion, in the current study we have demonstrated that active Btk, albeit in a much lower amount, is present in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells. It is intriguing to learn that Btk can, under certain conditions, move to the nucleus perhaps to regulate gene expression. In fact, Btk and Tec have been shown to modulate transcription of cytokine genes in mast and T cells, respectively (35Hata D. Kitaura J. Hartman S.E. Kawakami Y. Yokota T. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10979-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Yamashita Y. Watanabe S. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Komatsu N. Hatake K. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Mano H. Blood. 1998; 91: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Btk has been shown to be involved in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, thus linking B cell receptor stimulation with nuclear responses (37Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, a shorter isoform of Rlk, which lacks the cysteine string motif, translocates to the nucleus and has been shown to be crucial for interferon-γ induction in T cells (38Kashiwakura J. Suzuki N. Nagafuchi H. Takeno M. Takeba Y. Shimoyama Y. Sakane T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, since only a fraction of the phosphorylated protein is found to be present in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells, it could be envisaged that a specific nuclear phosphatase causes dephosphorylation of Btk. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling process could therefore tightly control Btk phosphorylation and its subsequent activation. The major challenge ahead is to find out how the nuclear translocation of Btk takes place. Is it a “piggy-back” mechanism, whereby Btk shuttling is facilitated by another protein, or does Btk itself have intrinsic functional signals that enable it to move between the cytoplasm and the nucleus? Most importantly, it will be of considerable interest to understand the biological as well as functional implication(s) of Btk localization in the nucleus. We thank Dr. M. Yoshida (University of Tokyo, Japan) for providing leptomycin B. We are also grateful to Dr. P. Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) for making the SYF cell line available."

SHP-1 is thought to dephosphorylate tyrosines in ITAMs, protein-tyrosine kinases, and/or adapter proteins whose phosphorylation is critical for activation signals, thereby stopping the initial steps of transduction. SHP-1 was recently found to inhibit the redistribution of cholesterol/sphyngolipid-rich membrane lipid microdomains following the engagement of a KIR3DL, on NK cells, by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells (21Zhenkun L.

The preferred substrate of SHIP1 is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which enables the membrane recruitment of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase viaits pleckstrin homology domain (15Bolland S.

Noticeably, ITIM-bearing molecules recruit fewer phosphatases in vivo than bind in vitro to corresponding pITIMs. Thus, when expressed in mast cells and coaggregated with ITAM-bearing high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI), FcγRIIB were found to recruit SHIP1 but not SHP-1 or SHP-2 in vivo (28Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We investigated here the molecular basis of the recruitment of SHIP1 by FcγRIIB1. This question was addressed by a mutational analysis of the Y−2 residue, which determines the recruitment of SHPs, and of the Y+1 and Y+2 residues, which contribute to the binding of SH2 domains (29Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Hasetr W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechlelder R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Conversely, the same residues of the KIR N-ITIM were substituted for corresponding residues of the FcγRIIB ITIM. The properties of wild type (w.t.) and modified ITIMs were analyzed by examining the in vitro binding of SH2 domain-bearing phosphatases to pITIM peptides and the in vivo recruitment of these phosphatases by FcγRIIB1 bearing corresponding ITIMs, when expressed in mast cells or in B cells. We found that, like a Y−2 hydrophobic amino acid determines the affinity of ITIMs for SHP-1 and SHP-2, a symmetrical Y+2 hydrophobic amino acid determines the affinity of the FcγRIIB ITIM for SHIP1 and SHIP2. The presence of this residue is correlated with the ability of pITIMs to bind SHIP1/2. The FcγRIIB ITIM therefore contains two distinct though overlapping binding sites, for SHPs and for SHIPs, respectively, the SHIP-binding site being preferentially used in vivo. RBL-2H3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. IIA1.6 cells were cultured in the same RPMI-based culture medium supplemented with 0.5 μm2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse IgE anti-dinitrophenyl mAb 2682-I was used as culture supernatant. The rat anti-mouse FcγRIIB 2.4G2 mAb was purified by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose. F(ab′)2 fragments were obtained by pepsin digestion for 48 h. The purity of IgG and F(ab′)2 fragments was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. F(ab′)2 fragments of polyclonal mouse anti-Rat Ig (MAR) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and trinitrophenylated (TNP) with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (Eastman Kodak Co.). TNP4-MAR F(ab′)2 were obtained. Rabbit antibodies against recombinant EC domains of FcγRIIB and mouse mAb anti-GST were kind gifts from Prof. Catherine Sautès-Fridman and Dr. Jean-Luc Teillaud (Institut Curie, Paris, France), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs (PY-20) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); mouse mAbs anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); rabbit anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, and anti-SHIP1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies anti-SHIP2 were kind gifts from Dr. David Wisniewski (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Rabbit anti-mouse Ig (RAM) IgG were purchased from Cappel Laboratories (West Chester, PA). Mutant FcγRIIB were constructed in two steps. Sequences encoding the N-terminal part of the IC domain were first amplified using a 5′ primer that hybridized with sequences encoding the nine N-terminal amino acids (Primer N): AAG AAA AAG CAG GTA CCA GCT CTC CCA, containing a KpnI site (underlined) and a 3′ primer encoding the mutation to introduce. Sequences encoding the C-terminal part of the IC domain were amplified using a 5′ primer encoding the mutation and a 3′ primer that hybridized with sequences encoding the five C-terminal amino acids and the first 16 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated sequences (Primer C): GAG ACA CTAGAG CTC GGC CTT TCT GGC TTG C, containing a SacI site (underlined). The two overlapping PCR fragments were used as templates to amplify the whole mutated sequence using Primers N and C. The resulting PCR product was either used as such or used as a template to introduce additional mutations. cDNA templates and corresponding primers used are listed below. When sense and corresponding antisense primers are complementary, only the sense primer is indicated. The primers used with w.t. FcγRIIB template were: I(−2)A mutation, GCT GAG AAT ACG GCC ACC TAC TCA CTT; SL(+1+2)AQ mutation, ACG ATC ACC TAC GCA CAA CTC AAG CAT CCC; I(−2)A + SL(+1+2)AQ mutation, GCT GAG AAT ACG GCC ACC TAC GCA CAA CTC; FcγRIIB/KIR N-ITIM substitution, sense, GAT CCG CAA GAG GTC ACC TAC GCA CAA CTC AAT CAT TGC GAA GCC CTG GAT GAA, and antisense, GCA ATG ATT GAG TTG TGC GTA GGT GAC CTC TTG CGG ATC CTC AGT TTT GGC AGC. The primers used with a FcγRIIB bearing N-terminal-KIR2DL3-ITIM template were: V(−2)A mutation, GAT CCG CAA GAG GCC ACC TAC GCA CAA CTC; AQ(+1+2)SL mutation, CAC CTA CTC ACT ACT CAA TCA TTG CGA AGC C. The primer used with FcγRIIB bearing V(−2)A N-terminal-KIR2DL3-ITIM template was: V(−2)A + AQ(+1+2)SL mutation, CAC CTA CTC ACT ACT CAA TCA TTG CGA AGC C. The resulting mutated fragments were cloned at KpnI andSacI sites into a NT vector containing sequences encoding the FcγRIIB EC and TM domains under the control of the SRα promoter as described (30Bruhns P. Marchetti P. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3168-3175PubMed Google Scholar). All amplified fragments were sequenced on the two strains. cDNA sequence encoding the TM and IC domains of human KIR2DL3 were amplified from the p58.183 KIR2DL3 cDNA (31Wagtmann N. Biassoni R.

KpnI (GGTACC) and SacI (GAGCTC) sites are underlined. PCR products were inserted into an expression cassette under the control of the SRα promoter in pBR322, containing a resistance gene to neomycin (NT-neo) and the EC domain of FcγRIIB. cDNAs were stably transfected in RBL-2H3 and IIA1.6 cells by electroporation. Transfectants were selected with neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cloned as described (30Bruhns P. Marchetti P. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3168-3175PubMed Google Scholar, 32Daëron M. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1365-1373PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of recombinant receptors on clones remained stable over the duration of experiments. Several clones of each transfectant were used and gave similar results. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 0 °C with 10 μg/ml 2.4G2 in balanced salt solution containing 5% fetal calf serum, washed, and stained with 50 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MAR F(ab′)2. Fluorescence was analyzed with a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). RBL transfectants were incubated with IgE anti-dinitrophenyl (culture supernatant diluted 1:10) and with 3 μg/ml 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, washed, and challenged for 3 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml TNP-MAR F(ab′)2. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). IIA1.6 transfectants were stimulated at 37 °C for 3 min with 45 μg/ml RAM IgG and lysed. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (50-μl beads diluted 1:2) was used to precipitate 2.4G2-bound FcγRIIB in lysates from RBL transfectants and 2.4G2-coated Sepharose beads (30-μl beads diluted 1:2) were used to precipitate FcγRIIB in lysates from IIA1.6 transfectants. Immunoadsorbents were washed in lysis buffer and boiled in sample buffer. Eluted material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto two Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were saturated with either 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or 5% skimmed milk (Régilait, Saint-Martin-Belle-Roche, France) diluted in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, in 150 mmNaCl containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Merck). One membrane was Western blotted with either HRP-conjugated anti-PY antibodies or anti-FcγRIIB followed by HRP-conjugated GAR. One membrane was cut and Western blotted with anti-SHIP1 or anti-SHIP2 antibodies (upper part) or with anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 (lower part), followed by HRP-conjugated GAR or GAM. Labeled antibodies were detected using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. cDNA encoding the SH2 domain of SHIP1 was amplified by PCR, using as a template cDNA generated from RNA extracted from RBL-2H3 cells. The following primers were used: sense, 5′-CTG ACC CAG TCT AGA GGA TCC ATG CCT GCC ATG GTC CCT G-3′; antisense, 5′GAC ACC TCG AGC TCT CAG GGA GGC AGC TCA-3′. The sequence was checked on the two strands by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The SHIP1 SH2 domain cDNA and the SHP-1 SH2 domain cDNA were inserted into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transfected into DH5-α Escherichia coli. All GST fusion proteins were produced in DH5-α E. coli following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Soluble SH2 domain-containing GST fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-agarose beads with a solution of 50 mm Tris, 25 mm glutathione, pH 8.0. Biotinylated ITIM peptides were purchased from Neosystems (MPS, San Diego, CA) or from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). They were coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads. Beads were saturated with 1 mg/ml d-biotin, washed in lysis buffer, and incubated for 2 h in lysates from 1 × 107cells or with SH2 domain-containing GST fusion proteins. Beads were washed and boiled in sample buffer. Eluted material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane, and Western blotted with anti-phosphatase antibodies or anti-GST antibodies. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore apparatus (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Before use, GST-SHIP1 SH2 fusion proteins were dialyzed in HBS buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA). Protein purity was assessed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Running buffer consisted of HBS buffer supplemented with 0.05% surfactant P20. Biotinylated phosphopeptides were immobilized on streptavidin microchips (Sensorchip SA, BIAcore). The measurement of phosphorylated peptide binding to GST-SHIP1 SH2 fusion protein was performed at a constant 30 μl/min flow rate. The regeneration was performed using HBS buffer supplemented with 0.02% SDS. k offand k on determination were performed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The equilibrium dissociation constantsK D were calculated as thek off/k on ratio. To identify ITIM amino acids that determine the in vivo recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatases by FcγRIIB, mutations were introduced in cDNA encoding murine FcγRIIB1 by exchanging nucleotides encoding the serine and leucine residues, at positions Y+1 and Y+2, for nucleotides encoding alanine and glutamine that are present at the same positions in the N-terminal ITIM of KIR2DL3 (SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB1). Nucleotides encoding the isoleucine, at position Y−2 were or not also exchanged for nucleotides encoding alanine (I(−2)A FcγRIIB1). w.t. and mutated cDNAs were stably transfected in the rat mastocytoma cells RBL-2H3 (Fig.1 A) and in the FcγRIIB-negative mouse lymphoma B cells IIA1.6 (Fig. 1 B), which constitutively express FcεRI and B cell receptors for antigen (BCR), respectively. Recombinant FcγRIIB1 were coaggregated with FcεRI in RBL transfectants sensitized with mouse IgE anti-dinitrophenyl, incubated with F(ab′)2 fragments of the rat anti-mouse FcγRIIB mAb 2.4G2, and stimulated with TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 as described (13Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J., C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant FcγRIIB1 were coaggregated with BCR in IIA1.6 transfectants stimulated with intact RAM IgG. Wild type and SL(+1+2)AQ, I(−2)A, and I(−2)A + SL(+1+2)AQ mutant FcγRIIB1 became comparably tyrosyl-phosphorylated when coaggregated with FcεRI in mast cells (Fig. 1 A) and with BCR in B cells (Fig.1 B). As described previously (13Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J., C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M.

FcγRIIB1 but also with I(−2)A FcγRIIB1 in RBL cells (Fig.1 A) and in IIA1.6 cells (Fig. 1 B). None of the three phosphatases was detectably coprecipitated with SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB1 or with I(−2)A + SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB1 in the two cell types. These results indicate 1) that the conservation of SL(+1+2)is critical for FcγRIIB1 to recruit SHIP1 in vivo, 2) that, although it prevents the recruitment of SHIP1, the SL(+1+2)AQ mutation does not confer FcγRIIB1 the ability to recruit SHP-1 or SHP-2, and 3) that I(−2) plays no role in the recruitment of SHIP1 by FcγRIIB1. The specificity of tyrosyl-phosphorylated w.t. or modified peptides corresponding to the FcγRIIB ITIM was analyzed by examining their ability to bind SH2 domain-containing phosphatases when coated onto agarose beads and incubated with a lysate of RBL-2H3 cells. Neither w.t. (Fig. 2 A) nor modified peptides (not shown) bound detectable amounts of SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP1 when nonphosphorylated. As observed previously (17D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.H. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 19Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the FcγRIIB ITIM bound SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP1. The substitution of the serine and leucine residues, at positions Y+1 and Y+2, for alanine and glutamine, respectively (SL(+1+2)AQ), abrogated the ability of phosphopeptides to bind SHIP1 but had no effect on their ability to bind SHP-1 and SHP-2. As previously reported (27Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron M. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the substitution of the isoleucine, at position Y−2, for an alanine (I(−2)A), abrogated the ability of phosphopeptides to bind SHP-1 and SHP-2 but had no effect on their ability to bind SHIP1. The substitution of I(−2) and SL(+1+2) for alanine, alanine, and glutamine, respectively (I(−2)A + SL(+1+2)AQ), abrogated the ability of phosphopeptides to bind all three phosphatases (Fig. 2 A). The binding of phosphopeptides to phosphatases present in a cell lysate may be direct or indirect via intracellular intermediates that could possibly bridge the two molecules. To exclude the latter possibility, we examined the in vitro binding of soluble GST fusion proteins containing either the single SH2 domain of SHIP1 (GST-SHIP1 SH2) or the two SH2 domains of SHP-1 (GST-SHP-1 SH2s) to agarose beads coated with w.t. or SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB pITIM. As revealed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies, w.t. FcγRIIB pITIM bound both GST fusion proteins, whereas SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB pITIM bound GST-SHP-1 SH2s but not GST-SHIP1 SH2 (Fig. 2 B). Biacore analysis of the interactions between w.t. and SL(+1+2)AQ FcγRIIB pITIMs with GST-SHIP1 SH2 confirmed the requirement of SL(+1+2)for FcγRIIB pITIM to bind the SH2 domain of SHIP1 (Fig.2 C) and permitted to quantify the affinity of the interaction. The SL(+1+2)AQ substitution resulted in a 118-fold reduction of the k on, a 34-fold increase of the koff and, as a consequen"

In the present study, we demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM), but not IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc isoforms p52 and p66 and their association with Grb2. Concomitantly, OSM turns out to be a stronger activator of ERK1/2 MAPKs. Shc is recruited to the OSM receptor (OSMR), but not to gp130. Binding involves Tyr861 of the OSMR, located within a consensus binding sequence for the Shc PTB domain. Moreover, Tyr861 is essential for activation of ERK1/2 and for full activation of the α2-macroglobulin promoter, but not for an exclusively STAT-responsive promoter. This study therefore provides evidence for qualitative differential signaling mechanisms exerted by IL-6-type cytokines.

These cytokines play an important role in hematopoiesis, inflammation, the acute phase response, bone, and heart development as well as neurogenesis. Their redundant effects can be attributed to the shared use of the common signal transducing receptor chain glycoprotein (gp) 130. gp130 is homodimerized by IL-6 and IL-11 upon binding to their ligand-specific α-receptors. The other cytokines of this family trigger the heterodimerization of gp130 with the LIF receptor (LIFR) or the OSM-specific receptor (OSMR). Whereas human OSM has the capability to signal both via gp130-LIFR and gp130-OSMR heterodimers, murine OSM solely utilizes the gp130-OSMR heterodimer for signal transduction (1Heinrich P.C.

Due to its ability to induce TIMP-1 and TIMP-3, profibrotic properties have been attributed to this cytokine (7Richards C.D. Shoyab M. Brown T.J. Gauldie J. J.

In addition, OSM is suggested to play a role in the wound healing process and in attenuation of the inflammatory response (11Wallace P.M. MacMaster J.F. Rouleau K.A. Brown T.J. Loy J.K.

Compared with other IL-6-type cytokines, OSM often induces stronger effects e.g.with regard to STAT and MAPK activation, induction of protease inhibitors, or growth inhibition (11Wallace P.M.

Concerning the functional properties of the three signal transducing receptor subunits, much progress has been achieved in elucidating the signaling events initiated by the gp130 receptor chain (reviewed in Ref. 1Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). gp130 associates with tyrosine kinases of the Janus family (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2). Upon ligand binding and receptor dimerization, Jaks are activated and in turn phosphorylate gp130 on several cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, which then provide docking sites for SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as transcription factors of the STAT family (STAT3 and STAT1). Upon phosphorylation, the STATs translocate as dimers into the nucleus, where they bind to promoter regions of their specific response genes. Additionally, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 becomes recruited to gp130 via tyrosine residue 759 (16Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). SHP-2 has been implicated in the down-regulation of gp130-mediated signals (17Symes A. Stahl N. Reeves S.A. Farruggella T.

In the present study, we addressed the question whether the OSMR contributes distinguishably to signal transduction. We demonstrate that in contrast to gp130, the human OSMR does not recruit SHP-2 but utilizes another protein implicated in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, Shc. This protein exists in three different isoforms of 46 kDa (p46), 52 kDa (p52), and 66 kDa (p66); p46 and p52 are produced by using alternative translation initiation sites of the same transcript, whereas p66 results from a differentially spliced message (21Bonfini L.

Shc contains an SH2 and a PTB domain, separated by a proline/glycine-rich collagen homology domain (CH1). The p66 isoform contains a further CH domain (CH2) at the N terminus (23Migliaccio E. Mele S.

We provide comparative data showing that upon receptor activation Shc binds to the OSMR (and not to gp130), whereas SHP-2 only binds to gp130 (and not to the OSMR). We locate the site of Shc/OSMR interaction to tyrosine residue 861 of the OSMR. Point mutation of this residue abrogates ERK activation and reduces the induction of an α2M-promoter-driven reporter gene. This finding promises to contribute to the understanding of specific characteristics that have been attributed to OSM. Simian monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. The human melanoma cell line A375 was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin.

Two further C-terminal deletion mutants, β/OSMRΔ4 and β/OSMRΔ5, were generated by polymerase chain reaction using an antisense oligonucleotide incorporating an in-frame termination codon followed by the recognition site for BamHI. They retain 105 and 75 amino acids of the OSMR cytoplasmic tail, respectively. The point mutated constructs containing the amino acid substitution Y861F were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the respective mutated oligonucleotides with either the cDNA for β/OSMR or β/OSMRΔ1 as a template. The resulting products were cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI-digested expression plasmid pSVL-IL-5Rβ/OSMR, thereby generating the constructs encoding β/OSMRY861F and β/OSMRΔ1Y861F. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analyses using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For transfection of HepG2 cells,XhoI/BamHI fragments comprising the cDNA encoding the various receptor constructs were inserted intoXhoI/BglII-digested pCAGGS expression vector (51Nakajima K.

Expression plasmids for Jak1 and Jak1K907E were kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). A375 and HepG2 cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with 20–200 ng/ml IL-6, 100–500 ng/ml LIF, or 10–100 ng/ml OSM. Immediately after stimulation, cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), scraped off the dish, and left on ice for 30 min. For coimmunoprecipitations, COS-7 cells were stimulated for 20–30 min with 10 ng/ml IL-5 and lysed in BRIJ97 lysis buffer (as Triton lysis buffer but with 1% BRIJ97). Lysates were centrifuged with 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with either α-Shc or α-IL-5Rβ (S-16) antibody. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose during a 60-min incubation, washed twice with washing buffer (as lysis buffer, but with only 0.1% BRIJ97), and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5, 10, or 12.5% gels, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL, Dreieich, Germany). Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 20 min at 75 °C. The polyclonal antiserum against Shc and the monoclonal α-STAT3 antibody were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); monoclonal α-IL5Rβ (S-16), polyclonal α-IL5Rβ (N-20), polyclonal α-Grb2 (C-23), polyclonal α-SHP-2 (C-18), polyclonal α-ERK1 (C-16-G), and α-ERK2 (C-14-G) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The phosphospecific antibody against activated ERK1/2 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI); phosphospecific polyclonal α-STAT3(Y705) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). The polyclonal antiserum against Jak1 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Ziemiecki (University of Bern, Switzerland). pGL3α2M-215Luc contains the promoter region, −215 to +8, of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene upstream of the luciferase-encoding sequence of plasmid pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). The SIE-tk-Luc construct contains three copies of the STAT consensus binding sequence from the c-fos promoter upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter (52Coqueret O. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18794-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. H. Gascan (INSERM, Angers, France). HepG2 cells were transfected with 6 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 2 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 3 μg of each receptor expression vector using the calcium phosphate transfection method (12Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated for 18 h with 10 ng/ml IL-5. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system. The IL-6-type cytokines IL-6, LIF, and OSM transduce their signals either via formation of a gp130 homodimer, a gp130-LIFR heterodimer, or a gp130-OSMR heterodimer. HepG2 hepatoma cells express all three signal-transducing receptor chains. We stimulated these cells for different periods of time with either LIF, OSM, or IL-6 in the presence of sIL-6R, which is known to act agonistically (53Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 54Mackiewicz A. Schooltink H. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a phosphorylation of the p66 and p52 isoforms of Shc occurs only after stimulation with OSM but not after treatment with IL-6 or LIF as demonstrated upon immunoprecipitation of the Shc proteins from lysates. The phosphorylation was transient with a maximum reached after 5 min, which continued for 30 min. Then the proteins become dephosphorylated again (Fig. 1 A, upper right panel). The p46 isoform of Shc could not be detected, although equally well expressed (data not shown), due to comigration with the Ig heavy chain. As shown in Fig. 1 A(upper right panel), several additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of high molecular mass were coimmunoprecipitated with Shc. One protein might represent the wild-type OSMR. Since there are no antibodies available for Western blot analysis, we are presently unable to verify this prediction. The phosphoproteins could not be identified as Sos, ErbB2, or members of the Janus kinase family (data not shown), which have either been implicated in signal transduction downstream of Shc or coprecipitated with Shc (21Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 55Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 4097-4103PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies will aim at the identification of the coimmunoprecipitated proteins. Several reports have demonstrated that Shc is able to bind Grb2 after tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr317, thereby linking cytokine or growth factor receptors to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Indeed, we could demonstrate a transient coimmunoprecipitation of Grb2 with Shc that parallels Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, lower right panel). The lack of Shc phosphorylation in response to IL-6 and LIF was not due to limited amounts of cytokines applied, since no Shc phosphorylation was detectable after increasing the concentration of IL-6 up to 200 ng/ml and of LIF up to 500 ng/ml (data not shown). In contrast, an OSM concentration of 10 ng/ml was sufficient to induce Shc phosphorylation (not shown). However, all three cytokines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, indicating that the Jak/STAT pathway is activated by IL-6, LIF, and OSM (Fig. 1 B, top panel). Analyzing the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway as an additional signaling route activated by IL-6-type cytokines showed that OSM has a much higher potential to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with IL-6 or LIF (Fig. 1 B,third panel). This suggests that Shc may play a key role in bridging the gp130-OSMR complex to the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Human OSM is able to transduce signals via gp130-LIFR and gp130-OSMR complexes. The experiments performed in HepG2 cells showed that stimulation with OSM but not with LIF mediates Shc activation, indicating the involvement of the OSM-specific receptor in phosphorylation of Shc. To verify this assumption, we took advantage of A375 melanoma cells expressing only gp130 and the OSMR, but not the LIFR (45Auguste P. Guillet C. Fourcin M. Olivier C. Veziers J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15760-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 57Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Therefore, all signals occurring after OSM stimulation must be transduced via the gp130-OSMR heterodimer. Indeed, Shc p66 and p52 isoforms were also phosphorylated in A375 cells in response to OSM but not to IL-6 (Fig. 2, upper right panel). We conclude that the phosphorylation of Shc can be attributed to the OSM-specific receptor. Since Shc phosphorylation turned out to be an OSMR-dependent event, we investigated whether the OSMR is able to recruit Shc. The studies were performed in COS-7 cells, since these cells can be transfected efficiently and yield high levels of heterologously expressed proteins. To analyze mutated receptors independently of endogenous receptors, we took advantage of receptor chimeras that have been described previously (12Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar, 49Behrmann I. Janzen C. Gerhartz C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Hermanns H. Heesel B.

Moreover, this approach enabled us to use the same precipitating antibody (α-IL5Rβ) for a comparative side-by-side analysis of OSMR and gp130. We overexpressed a Janus kinase (Jak1) along with the IL-5Rβ chimeras in COS-7 cells. As demonstrated by others (58Pratt J.C. Weiss M. Sieff C.A. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Ravichandran K.S. J.

After lysis of the cells and immunoprecipitation of the receptor chimeras, we observed binding of Shc p66 and p52 to chimeras containing the intracellular part of the OSMR but not to chimeras containing gp130 cytoplasmic sequences (Fig. 4, upper left panel) or LIFR sequences (not shown). In contrast, SHP-2 bound exclusively to β/"

Invest. 1997; 100: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of kallistatin have not been well defined, previous studies indicate that kallistatin acts as a multifunctional protein that exhibits unique functions at different tissues (4Chao J. Stallone J.N. Liang Y.M. Chen L.M. Wang D.Z. Chao L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reactive-center loop, particularly the P1 residue, determines the inhibitory specificity of a serpin. Substitutions of the P1 residue of kallistatin dramatically change the inhibitory specificity of kallistatin (1Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, (in press)Google Scholar). High specificity and selectivity of kallistatin for tissue kallikrein is determined by its unique Phe at P1 position and probably also by other subsite-binding residues in the reactive-center loop (1Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, (in press)Google Scholar). Other than the reactive-center loop, heparin-binding sites of a serpin can also regulate its inhibitory activity toward target serine proteinase. Kallistatin is one of the heparin-binding serpins, which include antithrombin, protein C inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor, heparin cofactor, and protease nexin. For most of the heparin-binding serpins, heparin accelerates the inhibitory activity toward their target serine proteinases (5Griffith M.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12629-12642Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unlike most of these serpins, heparin suppresses the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein, whereas it accelerates the interaction between kallistatin and chymotrypsin (1Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, (in press)Google Scholar). The mechanism by which heparin inhibits the interaction between kallistatin and tissue kallikrein has not been explored. The heparin-binding site of a serpin is pivotal not only in regulating the inhibitory specificity of a serpin but also in directing a serpin to its target tissues to perform its function (11Jin L.

It has been demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans located on the extracellular matrix and surface of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells can trigger the inhibition of proteinases by bringing serpins into close apposition with their target proteinases (14Cooper S.T.

As in the case of other heparin-binding serpins, the heparin binding activity of kallistatin may play an important role in its function on cellular surfaces. The heparin-binding sites of proteins usually contain clusters of basic amino acid residues, which provide positively charged regions for binding to the acidic groups of heparin by electrostatic interaction (17Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin-binding sites of antithrombin, plasminogen activator inhibitor, protease nexin, and heparin cofactor II have been located in the D helix (6Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28690-28695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the heparin-binding site in kallistatin, however, has not been identified. In the present study, we attempted to identify the heparin-binding sites in kallistatin by two approaches: 1) to design synthetic peptides derived from surface regions of kallistatin that contain a high density of basic residues and to assess their heparin binding capacity; 2) to create kallistatin mutants by substituting basic residues with alanine in the putative heparin-binding regions and to analyze the heparin binding capacity of these mutants as well as the effects of heparin on the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein. Identification of heparin-binding sites in kallistatin could provide significant insights into the structural and functional relationship of kallistatin, and pave the way for further studies of the regulation and the physiological function of kallistatin. Escherichia coli strain TOP10, the pTrc-His B expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA); restriction enzymes, and isopropylthio-β-galactoside were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD); Taq polymerase was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Norwalk, CT); nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA); the POROS HE/1 column was from PerSeptive Biosystems (Cambridge, MA); Low molecular mass heparin (4500 Da) was purchased from Rhône-Poulenc (Aventis) and Upjohn (Kalamazoo, MI);d-Val-Leu-Arg-MCA (methylcoumarinamide) was from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA); human tissue kallikrein was purified as described previously (22Shimamoto K. Chao J. Margolius H.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); synthetic peptides were synthesized and provided by Dr. L. Juliano (from the Department de Biofisica, Escola Paulista de Medicima, Sao Paulo, Brazil). The atomic coordinates of the intact serpins, α1-antitrypsin (1qlp), ovalbumin (1ova), antithrombin (1ant), and cleaved form of protein C inhibitor (1pai) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank at Rutgers University. A molecular model was created using the homology modeling module, Composer, in the SYBYL program (version 6.5, Tripos, Inc.). The topologically equivalent residues across these serpins were determined first based on sequence homology. A structural alignment of the serpins was then performed with the equivalent residues as a starting point. This alignment determined the structurally conserved regions (SCRs)1 as well as the average framework of the SCRs. SCRs of kallistatin were generated by using fragments of the homologs to construct the backbone of the SCRs and a rule-based procedure to generate the side chains. The structurally variable regions were constructed by using fragments from known structures, which are compatible with the rest of the model, and then using sequence information to postulate which single fragment is best for use in the final model. The kallistatin model was then refined by side-chain torsion relieving and energy minimization. The backbone of the whole model was constrained and then energy minimized by steepest descent until the maximum derivative was less than 50 kcal/(mol·Å). The constraint was then removed, and additional minimization was performed until the maximum derivative was less than 5 kcal/(mol·Å) using steepest-descent algorithm. Finally, conjugate gradient minimization continued until the maximum derivative was less than 0.1 kcal/(mol·Å). Surface regions of kallistatin were determined by the kallistatin model created by the SYBYL program and a program, PEPTIDESTRUCTURE, in Wisconsin Package Version 10.0 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). The synthetic peptides were designed according to surface regions that encompass a high density of positively charged residues. The kallistatin variant P1Arg, created as described previously (23Chen V.C. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrc His B was used as a backbone to construct kallistatin mutants containing mutations at putative heparin-binding sites. The expression vector adds a hexahistidine sequence at the N terminus of the recombinant kallistatin for protein purification by metal-affinity chromatography. The kallistatin variants K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A were designed to contain alanine replacing the basic amino acid residues in the putative heparin-binding sites of the region between the H helix and C2 sheet and the other variant K187A/K188A in the F helix (Fig. 1). K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A were created by site-directed mutagenesis of kallistatin P1Arg cDNA using a sequence overlap-extension PCR method (24Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The internal primers 5′-CAACTTGTTGCGGGCGGCGAATTTTTACAAG-3′/5′-CTTGTAAAAATTCGCCGCCCGCAACAAGTTG-3′ were employed to replace Lys307 and Arg308 with Ala to create the kallistatin mutant, K307A/R308A, and 5′-GAATTTTTACGCGGCGCTAGAGTTGC-3′/5′-GCAACTCTAGCGCCGCGTAAAAATTC-3′ were used to replace Lys312 and Lys313 with Ala to create the mutant K312A/K313A. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The outside primers were 5′-CGTCTATGAGGCTAAC-3′ and 5′-CTATGGTTTCGTGGGGT-3′ for both mutants. The mutant fragments synthesized by PCR were cleaved with XhoI and SalI and replaced the counterparts of the pTrc His-based kallistatin P1Arg expression plasmids excised by the same restriction enzymes. The mutant K187A/K188A was created by the PCR method described previously. The primers 5′-TGATGGTGAGAGTTGCA-3′ and 5′-TCCCTCGAGTTTCCGCCGCGACGTGGTCG-3′, encompassing the desired alanine codon substitutions (underlined) for Lys187-Lys188 and a XhoI site, were used to synthesize the mutant fragments of K187A/K188A by PCR. The PCR fragment was cleaved with SmaI/XhoI and cloned into the kallistatin P1Arg expression plasmid that had its counterpart excised by the same restriction enzymes. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The kallistatin mutants containing Ala substitutions at the putative heparin-binding sites were expressed in a large scale of cell culture, and then soluble cell lysates were isolated and purified by nickel-affinity (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen) and heparin-affinity chromatography as described previously (23Chen V.C. Chao L. Chao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining by Coomassie Blue. Concentrations of the mutants were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for human kallistatin (4Chao J. Stallone J.N. Liang Y.M. Chen L.M. Wang D.Z. Chao L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides, dissolved in Me2SO at 5 μm, were preincubated with 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 unit/ml heparin in 17 μl of reaction buffer, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 20 min. The same amount of Me2SO was added to the control groups containing no synthetic peptides. Subsequently, 1 μl of the recombinant kallistatin (concentration, 0.4 mg/ml) was added into the reaction (final concentration, 0.4 μm) for a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. Finally, 2 μl of125I-labeled tissue kallikrein at 1 × 104cpm/μl was incubated with the mixture at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by SDS-loading buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. A dose-dependent peptide competition assay was also performed to demonstrate the specific binding of the peptides to heparin. Different concentrations of the synthetic peptides were used to compete with 0.4 μm kallistatin for 0.05 and 0.1 unit/ml of heparin in a 20-μl reaction mixture. The synthetic peptides, F peptide at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10 and 15 μm, HC2 peptide at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 μm, and C4 peptide at 5, 10 and 20 μm, were used in the dose-dependent peptide competition assay. A solution of kallistatin wild type (0.116 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, 0.2% (w/v) PEG 6000, pH 7.4, at 20 °C was titrated with small aliquots of a high concentration of heparin solution with minimal dilution (<10%). The protein fluorescence (λex = 280 nm, λem = 340 nm, 10-nm slits) was measured in a 1-ml quartz cuvette, thermostabilized, and held in a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorometer under constant agitation. The dependence of the relative fluorescence change, i.e.ΔF/F0 = (F0− Fobs)/F0, where F0 and Fobs represent starting and observed fluorescence values, respectively, can be analyzed by nonlinear least-squares data fitting by the binding equation (Eq. 1) (25Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using the Grafit program (version 3.0, Erithacus Software Ltd.).ΔFF0=ΔFmaxF0×[(P0+H0+Kd)−(P0+H0+Kd)2−4P0H0]2P0Equation 1 In this equation, P0 is the total protein concentration, H0 represents the heparin concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and ΔFmax/F0 is the maximum relative fluorescence change. For kallistatin P1Arg, K312A/K313A, and K307A/R308A mutants, the concentrations in the assay were 0.170, 0.141, and 0.160 μm, respectively. Kallistatin wild type (0.116 μm) was titrated with small aliquots of low molecular weight heparin in the same conditions as described above in the presence of different concentrations of synthetic peptides. The apparent Kd (Kd -app) for the interaction of each peptide was determined by plotting the observed Kd (Kd -obs) determined for the interaction of each peptide versus its concentration in the assay. The relative affinity of kallistatin P1Arg and the kallistatin mutants for immobilized heparin was determined by heparin-affinity chromatography in a BioCAD SPRINT system. Samples of approximately 40–100 μg in 2 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, were loaded onto an HE1/M column, which was saturated with the same buffer. The flow rate was controlled at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer until the absorbance reached the base line. The mutant proteins were eluted with 50 ml of a NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mm. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The salt gradient and elution profiles were plotted, and the concentrations of NaCl at elution peak were measured. Three different batches of each recombinant protein were analyzed for their heparin binding capacity. Tissue kallikrein binding activity of the kallistatin mutants containing Ala substitutions in the putative heparin-binding sites was assessed by kallikrein-binding assay in the presence of different concentrations of heparin. Kallistatin P1Arg and mutants at concentration 0.6 μm were preincubated with different concentrations of heparin, 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 30 units/ml, in 18.5 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 1.5 μl of 125I-labeled tissue kallikrein at 1 × 104 cpm/μl was added into the reactions, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition and analyzed by autoradiography. The effects of heparin on the inhibitory activity of the kallistatin mutants were analyzed by preincubating 0.2 μm of the kallistatin mutants with 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 units/ml heparin in 45 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were then started by adding 5 μl of 2 ng/μl tissue kallikrein (final concentration, 6 nm) into the reaction mixtures and incubating at 37 °C for 90 min. The residual tissue kallikrein activity was determined by adding 20 μl of the reaction mixture in 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 30 μm of Val-Leu-Arg-MCA. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 380-nm excitation and 460-nm emission. The conformation of the kallistatin mutants was estimated by CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter at a resolution of 0.2 nm, with a bandwidth of 2 nm. Ten spectra were averaged for each derivative. The recombinant kallistatins were diluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml using a cell of 0.02-cm path length. Mean residue ellipticity was calculated according to the literature (26Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 27: 675-735Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were derived from UV spectroscopy and confirmed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (4Chao J. Stallone J.N. Liang Y.M. Chen L.M. Wang D.Z. Chao L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of kallistatin was created by homology modeling as shown in Fig.1 A. Because the reactive-center loop is a highly variable region among serpins, there is no good template for modeling the reactive-center loop of kallistatin. Our previous study suggested that replacing the residues in the hinge region of the reactive loop with bulky residues may hinder a partial insertion of the reactive loop into A β-sheet and thus converting kallistatin from an inhibitor to a substrate for tissue kallikrein (data not shown). We assumed that the partial insertion of the hinge region is critical for the inhibitory conformation of kallistatin. Therefore, the atomic coordinates of antithrombin were chosen to model the reactive-center loop of kallistatin, P16-P5′, because the reactive loop of antithrombin has the same number of residues as kallistatin and the hinge region of the reactive loop was partially inserted into the A β-sheet as predicted for serpins (27Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The conformational energy of the kallistatin model is approximately −1300 kcal·mol−1, indicating an acceptable conformation without serious steric clash. The F helix, H helix, and C2 sheet are indicated in Fig. 1. The length of the kallistatin molecule is about 72 Å as measured from the protruding reactive loop to the distal end of the molecule. The F helix is distant from the reactive loop, and the distance measured between the Cα of the basic residues Lys187-Lys188 in the F helix and the Cα of the reactive center is about 46–48 Å. The loop between the H helix and C2 sheet crosses through the reactive loop and locates the basic residues Arg306-Lys307-Arg308 and Lys312-Lys313 in a proximate position to the reactive center with distances of 20–25 and 11–13 Å, respectively. Surface regions of kallistatin were determined by the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE in Wisconsin Package Version 10.0 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG)). A kallistatin model was created by homology modeling using COMPOSER, in SYBYL, to assist in the selection of the surface regions. Two surface regions, the F helix and the loop between the H helix and C2 sheet, contain clusters of positive-charged residues (Fig. 1 B). To test whether these two highly positive-charged regions are capable of binding with heparin, two synthetic peptides corresponding to both regions were synthesized: F peptide, VGTIQLINDHVKKETRGKIV-NH2, spanning amino acids 176–195, and HC2 peptide, RWNNLLRKRNFYKKLELHLP-NH2, spanning amino acids 300–319. A scrambled peptide SCR, derived from HC2 peptide, was synthesized as RWNRLFRYLKNEPKLHNLKL-NH2. The putative heparin-binding sites are underlined. A negative control C4 peptide derived from the surface region around the C4 sheet was synthesized as PFISSRTTPKDFYVDENTTV-NH2, spanning amino acids 222–242. All synthetic peptides were dissolved in Me2SO for use. Heparin binding activity of the synthetic peptides was compared by peptide competition assay as shown in Fig. 2. Peptides with heparin binding activity can prevent heparin from binding to kallistatin by competing for the heparin-binding sites. Consequently, an effective competing peptide can free kallistatin from heparin binding and thus restore its tissue kallikrein binding activity. Kallistatin P1Arg forms a complex with tissue kallikrein in the absence of heparin (lane 1). The complex formation was inhibited in the presence of different concentrations of heparin (lanes 2, 5, and 8). The F peptide, representing the F helix region of kallistatin, did not reverse the inhibition of the complex formation by 0.2 and 01 unit/ml heparin (lanes 3 and 6). Only at a lower heparin concentration, 0.05 unit/ml, did the F peptide start to restore the tissue kallikrein binding activity of kallistatin (lane 9). The HC2 peptide, spanning the H helix and C2 sheet, however, restored the tissue kallikrein binding activity of kallistatin efficiently under 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 unit/ml heparin (lanes 4, 7, and 10). Fig. 3 shows dose-dependent competition of the peptides with kallistatin for heparin. The HC2 and F peptides compete dose-dependently for heparin and reverse the inhibition of complex formation (Fig. 3, A and B). The HC2 peptide at 1 μm starts to show competition for 0.2 unit/ml heparin, whereas the F peptide at 5 μm competes for 0.1 unit/ml heparin. The control peptide C4, spanning over the C4 sheet, did not reduce the heparin inhibition of the tissue kallikrein-kallistatin binding at concentrations as high as 20 μm (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that heparin-binding sites of kallistatin are likely located within the F helix and the region between the H helix and C2 sheet, and the latter region is probably the major heparin-binding site of kallistatin.Figure 3Dose-dependent effects of the synthetic peptides on the heparin-inhibited complex formation between kallistatin and tissue kallikrein.

In this study, multiple approaches addressed the functional contributions by specific PKC isozymes to megakaryocytic lineage commitment of two independent cell lines, K562 and human erythroleukemia (HEL). Pharmacologic profiles of induction and inhibition of megakaryocytic differentiation in both cell lines suggested a role for the calcium-independent novel PKCs, in particular PKC-ε. In transfection studies, the isolated variable domain of PKC-ε selectively blocked exogenous activation of the megakaryocyte-specific αIIb promoter. Constitutively active mutants of PKC-ε, but not of other PKC isozymes, cooperated with the transcription factor GATA-1 in the activation of the αIIb promoter. The functional cooperation between GATA-1 and PKC-ε displayed dependence on cellular milieu, as well as on the promoter context of GATA binding sites.

In aggregate, the data suggest that PKC-ε specifically participates in megakaryocytic lineage commitment through functional cooperation with GATA-1 in the activation of megakaryocytic promoters. protein kinase C(s) classical or conventional PKC(s) novel PKC(s) mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate human embryonic kidney constitutively active hemagglutinin N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts catalytic domains human erythroleukemia A role for protein kinase C (PKC)1 signaling in megakaryocytic differentiation has been established by numerous experiments over the past two decades. In early studies, the PKC agonist phorbol diester selectively enhanced megakaryocyte colony formation by primary mouse bone marrow cells (1Long M.W. Smolen J.E. Szczepanski P. Boxer L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1686-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). More recent studies using primary human progenitors confirmed the promegakaryocytic effects of phorbol ester and showed such effects to be inhibitable by the PKC antagonists GF-109203X and Ro-31–8220 (2Lumelsky N.L. Schwartz B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In numerous cell line models of megakaryocytic differentiation, PKC activation induced an array of features including the following: cell cycle arrest, secretion of megakaryocytic cytokines, up-regulation of megakaryocytic surface antigens, cellular enlargement, polyploidization, development of proplatelet processes, and appearance of demarcation membranes (3Alitalo R. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,4Long M.W. Heffner C.H. Williams J.L. Peters C. Prochownik E.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The PKC serine/threonine kinase family consists of at least 11 distinct isozymes organized into three subgroups, based on biochemical, pharmacologic, and structural properties (5Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The classical or conventional PKCs (cPKCs) require diacylglycerol and Ca2+ for activation and consist of the α, βI, βII, and γ isozymes. The novel PKCs (nPKCs) require only diacylglycerol for activation and consist of the δ, ε, θ, η, and μ isozymes. The atypical PKCs lack responsiveness to diacylglycerol and Ca2+ and consist of the λ and ζ isozymes. Striking functional differences exist among PKC isozymes, with divergent functions noted even for factors with high structural homology (6Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) PKC signaling may influence megakaryocytic differentiation through several isozymes. In K562 cells, PKC-mediated, sustained activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is necessary for initiation of megakaryocytic differentiation (9Racke F.R. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23366-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Stines Nahreini T. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Multiple PKC isozymes, in particular α, βI, η, and δ, possess the capacity to activate the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (11Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 12Ueda Y. Hirai S.-I. Osada S.-I. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway appears not to be required for megakaryocytic differentiation of primary progenitor cells, suggesting that PKC signaling plays an additional role in megakaryopoiesis independent of ERK activation (13Fichelson S. Freyssinier J.-M. Picard F. Fontenay-Roupie M. Guesnu M. Cherai M. Gisselbrecht S. Porteu F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of specific PKC isozymes to megakaryocyte differentiation, we initially employed isozyme-selective pharmacologic agents in two independent cell line models of megakaryocytic differentiation, K562 and HEL. GF-109203X, an inhibitor of cPKCs and nPKCs but not of atypical PKCs, potently blocked megakaryocytic induction in both cell lines. By contrast, Gö 6976, an inhibitor only of cPKCs (14Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failed to block megakaryocytic differentiation, suggesting a specific requirement for nPKC signaling. For both cell lines, the PKC-ε-selective agonist, ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB) (15Asada A. Zhao Y. Kondo S. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28392-28398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Iwata M. J.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 848-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) induced megakaryocytic differentiation, as well as selective nuclear translocation of PKC-ε. In transfection assays, the isolated variable domain of PKC-ε, but not that of PKC-α, completely blocked exogenous activation of the megakaryocytic αIIb promoter. Constitutively active mutants of PKC-ε activated the αIIb promoter 3–6-fold. We also addressed whether PKC-ε signaling influenced the function of GATA-1, a transcription factor known to play a critical role in megakaryopoiesis and in activation of the αIIb promoter (18Martin F. Prandini M.-H. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. Uzan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21606-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Indeed, GATA-1 and constitutively active PKC-ε showed synergistic activation of the αIIb promoter. Notably, the ability to synergize with GATA-1 distinguished PKC-ε from other PKC isozymes, depended on cellular milieu, and depended on the context of GATA binding sites within the promoter. K562 and HEL, obtained from the ATCC, were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. C3H10T1/2, obtained from ATCC, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% neonatal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEK-293T, provided by Dr. Kevin Lynch (Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine), was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All experiments using K562 and HEL employed mid-log phase cells at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml. Conditioned media was obtained as described previously by 72 h of treatment of either K562 or HEL cells with 25 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-ester (Sigma) followed by harvesting and dialysis of supernatant (9Racke F.R. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23366-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For megakaryocytic induction, cells were resuspended in conditioned media and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1–3 days, as indicated. The compounds GF-109203X, Gö 6976, and IDB were purchased from LC Laboratories. The PKC inhibitors GF-109203X and Gö 6976 were added, at indicated concentrations, to conditioned media at the initiation of megakaryocytic induction. Staining of cells for surface CD41 employed the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody PLT1-FITC (Coulter) at 25 μg/ml. Staining of cells for surface glycophorin A employed the phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody GA-R2-PE (Pharmingen) at 10 μg/ml. Appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated, isotype-matched antibody controls were used at concentrations identical to the corresponding experimental antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan system utilizing Lysys II software (Becton Dickinson). Treated cells were cytospun onto glass slides and fixed for 2 min in ice-cold methanol followed by 2 min in ice-cold acetone. After blocking for 30 min at room temperature with 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, primary antibodies in 0.1% normal goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Murine monoclonal antibodies to PKC-ε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and to PKC-α (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used at 200 ng/ml and at 1.25 μg/ml, respectively. Control murine antibody (NOR 3.2;BIOSOURCE International) was used at 1 μg/ml. Secondary antibody, consisting of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Tago, Inc.) diluted 1:100 in 0.1% normal goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline, was applied for 30 min at room temperature. For nuclear visualization, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was included in the coverslip mounting medium. Cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM 410 (Jena, Germany) using Zeiss LSM analysis software. The αIIb-luciferase reporter constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of bases −598 to +32, bases −98 to +32, or bases −348 to +32 from a human αIIb promoter fragment kindly provided by Dr. Samuel Santoro (21Fong A.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18441-18447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products were co-digested with XhoI plus HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGL3-Basic (Promega). The β-galactosidase expression vector consisted of pCMVβ (CLONTECH). The GATA-1 expression vector employed the EF-1-α-neo expression plasmid and has been previously described (22Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian expression of a full-length constitutively active (CA) mutant of PKC-ε employed SRD-ε-K155A/R156A/A159E (AE3), kindly provided by Dr. S. Ohno (23Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Expression of a full-length CA mutant of PKC-δ employed SRD-δR144/145A (DRA), also kindly provided by Dr. S. Ohno (23Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S.

Expression of a full-length CA mutant of PKC-α employed pRc-CMV-PKC-α A25E, kindly provided by Dr. Gottfried Baier (24Uberall F. Giselbrecht S. Hellbert K. Fresser F. Bauer B. Gschwendt M.

Expression of a full-length CA mutant of PKC-θ employed pRc/CMV-PKC-θ R145I/R146W, kindly provided by Dr. J. Anthony Ware (25Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression constructs for HA-epitope-tagged, isolated PKC catalytic and regulatory domains have been previously described (26Soh J.-W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In brief, fragments encoding the catalytic domains of α (amino acids 326–672) and ε (amino acids 395–737) were ligated into the pHANE vector. The fragment encoding the catalytic domain of δ (amino acids 334–674) was ligated into the pHACE vector. Fragments encoding the variable domains of α (amino acids 2–325) and ε (amino acids 2–394) were ligated into the pHANE vector. Transfection of K562 and C3H10T1/2 cells employed the liposomal reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using ∼6 μg of DNA in 200 μl of HBS (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) combined with 30 μl of DOTAP in 200 μl HBS. The DNA/DOTAP mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and was then added dropwise to 1. 6 × 106 K562 cells in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum. For C3H10T1/2 cell transfections, the DNA/DOTAP mixture was added to ∼60% confluent cells in 6-well plates. Transfection of HEK-293T cells was performed as described for C3H10T1/2 cells except that 4 μg of DNA in 50 μl of HBS was combined with 20 μl of DOTAP in 100 μl of HBS. After overnight incubation, cells were changed to fresh complete medium. Cells were subsequently incubated 24 h prior to harvesting for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Luciferase assays were performed using the commercial luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) colorimetric substrate. All transfections were performed at least in triplicate, and all luciferase values were normalized according to β-galactosidase readings. K562, C3H10T1/2, and HEK-293T cells were transfected and harvested as for the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, except that whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in 1× SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equivalent lane loading was confirmed by Ponceau staining of membranes. Probing of membranes was carried out as described previously (27Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S. Mickelson D. Greenberg J.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of HA-tagged PKC regulatory and catalytic domains, the primary antibody consisted of 12CA5, a murine monoclonal directed to the HA epitope tag, employed as ascites fluid diluted 1:2000. The secondary antibody consisted of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Sigma) used at a dilution of 1:3000. For detection of GATA-1, the primary antibody consisted of the rat monoclonal N6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml. The secondary antibody consisted of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat (Sigma) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Signal detection employed enhanced chemiluminescence. Previous work in our laboratory indicated that sustained activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in the K562 hematopoietic cell line resulted in production of autocrine factors promoting megakaryocytic maturation (9Racke F.R. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23366-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To identify signaling pathways triggered by such autocrine factors, we analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors on megakaryocytic induction in two independent cell lines, K562 and HEL. The induction stimulus consisted of conditioned media from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-ester-treated HEL cells, which show identical activity to that previously reported for K562 cells (9Racke F.R. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23366-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The only compound in our screening that potently and specifically blocked megakaryocytic induction by conditioned media was GF-109203X. GF-109203X inhibits both cPKC and nPKC isozymes, as well as pp90rsk2 (14Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Swanson K.D. Taylor L.K. Haung L. Burlingame A.L. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3385-3395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, parallel experiments were carried out using the compound Gö 6976, known to inhibit cPKCs and pp90rsk2 but not nPKCs (14Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Swanson K.D. Taylor L.K. Haung L. Burlingame A.L. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3385-3395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in the flow cytometric profiles in Fig. 1, conditioned media alone induced up-regulation of the megakaryocyte surface antigen CD41 and down-regulation of the erythroid surface antigen glycophorin A. Whereas GF-109203X completely blocked both responses, Gö 6976 at similar doses showed no inhibition of either response. Analysis of cellular morphology supported the flow cytometric results in Fig. 1. In particular, HEL cells exposed to conditioned media undergo spreading and enlargement as part of their megakaryocytic differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, the morphologic changes induced in HEL cells by conditioned media were abrogated by GF-109203X. By contrast, Gö 6976 strikingly enhanced the cellular spreading and enlargement induced by conditioned media. These data confirm that biologically active doses of Gö 6976 acted to enhance rather than inhibit features of megakaryocytic differentiation. In an alternative approach, the isozyme-selective PKC agonist IDB was applied directly to K562 and HEL cells in standard growth media. Multiple previous studies have indicated that IDB is a selective activator of nPKCs, particularly PKC-ε (15Asada A. Zhao Y. Kondo S. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28392-28398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Iwata M. J.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 848-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, IDB caused CD41 up-regulation and glycophorin A down-regulation in K562 and HEL cells. In addition, HEL cells treated with IDB manifested the standard morphologic changes seen with megakaryocytic induction (not shown). Immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 4) showed that treatment of K562 cells with IDB induces rapid nuclear translocation of PKC-ε but no change in the subcellular localization of PKC-α. Rapid nuclear translocation of PKC-ε was also observed in HEL cells treated with IDB (data not shown). Thus, both agonists and antagonists implicate nPKC, in particular PKC-ε, in the induction of megakaryocytic differentiation.Figure 4Immunofluorescent subcellular localization of PKC-ε and PKC-α in K562 cells, untreated and treated with IDB.

Accordingly, we examined whether transfection of isolated regulatory domains from either PKC-α or PKC-ε could interfere with exogenous activation of the megakaryocyte-specific αIIb-598 promoter (31Era T. Takagi T. Takahashi T. Bories J.-C. Nakano T. Blood. 2000; 95: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells transfected with control vector, 24 h of conditioned media caused an ∼14-fold up-regulation of the αIIb-598-luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 5 A). Expression in cells of the isolated α regulatory fragment (α-Reg) minimally inhibited conditioned media activation of αIIb-598-luciferase. In striking contrast, expression in cells of the isolated ε regulatory fragment (ε-Reg) almost completely eliminated responsiveness to the conditioned media stimulus. Immunoblotting showed similar expression levels of the HA-epitope-tagged α and ε regulatory domains in HEK-293T transfectants (Fig. 5 B). We next tested whether constitutively active PKC mutants could activate the αIIb megakaryocytic promoter. Fig. 6 A demonstrates the similar results obtained with two different types of constitutively active mutants, inhibitory domain point mutants (CA mutants in left graph), and isolated PKC catalytic domains (CAT mutants in right graph). The inhibitory domain point mutants consist of full-length PKCs with point mutations in the autoinhibitory regulatory domains (23Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Uberall F. Giselbrecht S. Hellbert K. Fresser F. Bauer B. Gschwendt M. Grunicke H.H. Baier G. J. Biol.

The isolated PKC CAT completely lack regulatory domains, which have also been implicated in Ca2+and lipid binding, interaction with RACKs, and kinase-independent signaling (26Soh J.-W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Using the megakaryocyte-specific αIIb-598 reporter, we tested the effects of PKC isozymes alone and in conjunction with GATA-1, a known positive regulator of the αIIb promoter (18Martin F. Prandini M.-H. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. Uzan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21606-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, constitutively active PKC-ε mutants alone modestly activated the αIIb promoter (3–6-fold) but demonstrated clear functional cooperation with GATA-1. In fact, coexpression of GATA-1 with either CA or CAT mutants of ε led to levels of reporter activation analogous to those obtained with conditioned media induction. Functional cooperation with GATA-1 was clearly isozyme-restricted in that constitutively active mutants of α, δ, and θ all failed to augment GATA-1-mediated αIIb activation. In fact, δ caused a 2–3-fold inhibition of GATA-1 activation. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated equivalent levels of GATA-1 expression in all transfectants, indicating that the differential effects of the PKC isozymes were not because of differences in GATA-1 levels (Fig. 6 B). In addition, immunoblot demonstrated analogous expression levels of the HA-epitope-tagged ε, α, and δ catalytic domains in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 6 C). To determine whether functional interaction between PKC-ε and GATA-1 occurred also in non-hematopoietic cells, cotransfections were carried out in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts rather than in K562 hematopoietic cells. The full-length CA ε mutant, as well as the isolated ε CAT, failed to augment GATA-1-mediated αIIb activation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (Fig.7 A). Immunoblotting demonstrated equivalent expression of GATA-1 in all of the transfectants (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the functional interaction of PKC-ε with GATA-1 clearly depends on the cell type employed for transfection. The αIIb promoter contains multiple GATA binding sites, including a functional site within the promoter-proximal −98 fragment (18Martin F. Prandini M.-H. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. Uzan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21606-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether specific promoter regions were required for PKC-ε/GATA-1 cooperativity, 5′ truncated reporter constructs, αIIb-98 and αIIb-348, were compared with αIIb-598 for responsiveness to PKC-ε ± GATA-1 in K562 cells. Surprisingly, the αIIb-98 and αIIb-348 reporters showed full activation by GATA-1 alone but no evidence of augmentation by PKC-ε (Fig. 7 C). Thus, the functional GATA binding sites in the αIIb −348 to +32 fragment were insufficient to mediate PKC-ε/GATA-1 cooperativity. Involvement of PKC signaling in hematopoietic lineage commitment decisions has been well documented. In progenitors transformed by the E26 avian leukemia virus, thresholds of PKC activity correlated with cell fate determinations as follows: (a) no kinase activity was associated with undifferentiated cells; (b) low activity was associated with myelomonocytic differentiation; and (c) high activity was associated with eosinophil differentiation (32Rossi F. McNagny K.M. Smith G. Frampton J. Graf T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In primary, bipotential granulocyte macrophage colony-forming cells, activation of PKC-α induced commitment to the macrophage lineage (33Pierce A. Heyworth C.M. Nicholls S.E. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Lord J.M. Owen-Lynch P.J. Wark G. Whetton A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, our data suggest that signaling via PKC-ε may promote megakaryocytic lineage commitment of the bipotential BFU-E/MK progenitor, a cell with capability for either erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation (34Debili N. Coulombel L. Croisille L. Katz A. Guichard J. Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1996; 88: 1284-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have notably shown that PKC-ε undergoes down-regulation during erythroid differentiation and that inhibition of PKC-ε specifically enhances erythroid differentiation (35Myklebust J.H. Smeland E.B. Josefsen D. Sioud M. Blood. 2000; 95: 510-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bassini A. Zauli G. Migliaccio G. Migliaccio A.R. Pascuccio M. Pierpaoli S. Guidotti L. Capitani S. Vitale M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1178-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms by which PKC-ε signaling might contribute to the activation of the megakaryocytic αIIb promoter remain unclear. Earlier studies with isolated catalytic domains have shown PKC-ε to activate multiple pathways that converge on the serum-response element of the c-fos promoter, c-Raf-MEK1-ERK, MEK kinase 1-stress-activated protein kinase kinase-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and rhoA (26Soh J.-W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, those studies showed equivalent activation of the various pathways by the PKC-α catalytic domain. Our results, by contrast, show no activation of the αIIb promoter by the PKC-α catalytic domain. The rapid nuclear translocation of PKC-ε observed with megakaryocytic induction by IDB (Fig. 4) raises the possibility that PKC-ε itself might act directly upon critical nuclear substrates. The functional cooperation of PKC-ε with GATA-1 raises a number of mechanistic possibilities. One scenario is that PKC-ε signaling targets a transcriptional complex containing GATA-1 and enhances GATA-1 function by phosphorylation of one of the members of this complex, such as GATA-1 itself or the cofactor friend of GATA-1. The absence of functional interaction in C3H10T1/2 cells argues against direct phosphorylation of GATA-1 by PKC-ε as a sufficient mechanism. This scenario also fails to account for the dependence of PKC-ε signaling on promoter context, as illustrated in Fig. 7 C. Accordingly another possibility is that PKC-ε signaling targets GATA-1 complexes binding to specific regions of the αIIb promoter. A recent study employing embryonic stem cell hematopoiesis has defined within the human αIIb promoter a 200-base pair critical enhancer region, −398 to −598, that is necessary and sufficient for megakaryocyte-specific transgene expression (31Era T. Takagi T. Takahashi T. Bories J.-C. Nakano T. Blood. 2000; 95: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data indicate that a similar region (from −348 to −598 of the human αIIb promoter) is required for responsiveness to PKC-ε signaling. Future studies will attempt to correlate PKC-ε response elements within the αIIb promoter with megakaryocyte-specific enhancer function. A major question in the molecular characterization of hematopoietic lineage commitment is how two lineages with highly similar arrays of transcription factors can show non-overlapping, indeed mutually exclusive, patterns of gene expression. Erythroid and megakaryocytic cells share expression of the highly restricted factors GATA-1, GATA-2, Lmo2, NF-E2, friend of GATA-1, and SCL/tal. Most striking among these factors is GATA-1, which dominantly activates erythroid genes only in erythroblasts and dominantly activates megakaryocytic genes only in megakaryocytes. Our current data raise the possibility that isozyme-specific signaling by PKC may modify GATA function in accordance with promoter context. In particular, PKC-ε signaling might specifically augment GATA-1 function in the context of megakaryocytic promoters, thereby redirecting the entire transcriptional program of a cell from erythroid to megakaryocytic.

https://openalex.org/W2065634344,"DNA topoisomerase (topo) I is a nuclear enzyme that plays an important role in DNA metabolism. Based on conserved nuclear targeting sequences, four classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) have been proposed at the N terminus of human topo I, but studies with yeast have suggested that only one of them (amino acids (aa) 150–156) is sufficient to direct the enzyme to the nucleus. In this study, we expressed human topo I fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in mammalian cells and demonstrated that whereas aa 150–156 are sufficient for nuclear localization, the nucleolar localization requires aa 157–199. More importantly, we identified a novel NLS within aa 117–146. In contrast to the classic NLSs that are rich in basic amino acids, the novel NLS identified in this study is rich in acidic amino acids. Furthermore, this novel NLS alone is sufficient to direct not only EGFP into the nucleus but also topo I; and the EGFP·topo I fusion driven by the novel NLS is as active in vivo as the wild-type topo I in response to the topo I inhibitor topotecan. Together, our results suggest that human topo I carries two independent NLSs that have opposite amino acid compositions.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Thus, topo I plays an important role in different aspects of DNA metabolism such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, transcription, and, possibly, DNA repair (2Trowbridge P.W. Roy R. Simmons D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Fleischmann G. Pflugfelder G. Steiner E.K. Javaherian K. Howard G.C. Wang J.C. Elgin S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to its catalytic activity on DNA, the enzyme has been shown to have other activities functioning as a ribonuclease and a kinase (5Rossi F. Labourier E. Forne T. Divita G. Derancourt J.

Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J.F. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Topo I may also play a role in chromatid condensation (8Castano I.B. Brzoska P.M. Sadoff B.U. Chen H. Christman M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In lower eukaryotic organisms, topo I seems to be dispensable, in part because of the fact that other topoisomerases can subserve its role in its absence. However, mammalian topo I is essential for cell growth. Furthermore, topo I is a target for clinically important anticancer drugs such as topotecan and SN-38, the metabolic product of CPT-11 (9D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitors target nuclear topo I and stabilize transient DNA-enzyme complexes, leading to cell death (9D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar). Human topo I is a 765-aa protein that is exclusively localized to the nucleus because the N-terminal domain of the enzyme carries essential sequences for its nuclear localization (10D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie III, H. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although this N-terminal domain does not seem to contribute to its catalytic activityin vitro, it is essential for its in vivoactivity because the enzyme exerts its functions in the nucleus (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although all nuclear localization signals (NLSs) for nuclear proteins seem to play the same role, i.e. targeting the nucleus, they vary considerably from short peptide motifs to large protein domains (14Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The classic peptide motifs are those rich in basic amino acids and are represented by a well known NLS found in SV40 T-antigen (15Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Based on their conserved amino acid sequences, four putative NLSs have been suggested to be in the N-terminal domain of human topo I (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 17Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar). The first putative NLS (NLS-I) is at aa 59–65, and the other three putative NLSs are clustered at aa 150–198 (NLS-II, aa 150–156; NLS-III, aa 174–180; and NLS-IV, aa 192–198) (see Fig. 1). These NLSs consist of seven amino acids, each characterized by its high content of basic amino acids (16Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), and are thereby considered “classic” peptide NLSs (14Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human topo I in yeast revealed that a region covering 71 amino acids (aa 140–210) of the N terminus is sufficient to direct the enzyme to the nucleus (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By amino acid alignment, a conserved sequence (PKKIKTE) exists among human and yeast topo I and SV40 T antigen, suggesting that this is sufficient to direct the topo I to the nucleus (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this sequence is functional in mammalian cells or whether all these putative NLSs are required for nuclear localization. Furthermore, topo I is predominantly localized in the nucleolus (18Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the sequence for this nucleolar localization has not been defined. We have recently shown that overexpression of catalytically active human topo I in mammalian cells can be achieved by fusion to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the EGFP·topo I fusion protein provides a useful tool to examine the subcellular localization of topo I in live cells. Our data revealed that the EGFP·topo I closely associates with chromosomal DNA at both interphase and mitosis (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our studies also revealed that the N-terminal domain is essential for the enzyme to get into the nucleus, suggesting that the functional NLS of the human topo I is located at the N terminus, consistent with findings in yeast (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the specific sequences required for topo I to target the nucleus in mammalian cells, we expanded our deletion analysis of its N-terminal domain. To our surprise, as described herein, we found a novel NLS that does not fall into the classic basic peptide motif and is sufficient to direct topo I into the nucleus in mammalian cells. HeLa, COS-7, and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Chinese hamster ovary cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2. Plasmids carrying the EGFP·topo I gene were introduced into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (20Mo Y.-Y. Ameiss K.A. Beck W.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 1052-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were subcultured in 6-well plates with one coverslip in each well and allowed to grow for another 16–24 h before microscopic examination. Transfection of COS-7, NIH 3T3, and Chinese hamster ovary cells was conducted by electroporation, using Electroporator with Extender II (Bio-Rad). Cells at the log phase were trypsinized, harvested, and then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum at 1 × 107 cells/ml. An aliquot of 0.4 ml of such cell suspension was mixed with 15 μg of plasmid DNA and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were subjected to an electric pulse (950 microfarads and 220 volts), as suggested by the manufacturer. Expression plasmids used in this study are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 7 A. The full-length topo I·EGFP fusion construct (pTI-2) and the N-terminal fusion (pTI-5) have been described previously (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pTI-2/X1 encompassed aa 1–140 and was constructed by digestion of pTI-2 with EcoRI and partial digestion with XhoI. The topo I fragment with the vector was isolated and purified by Gene Clean II (Bio 101, Vista, CA). The overhanging ends of this fragment were blunted by treatment with mungbean nuclease and then self-ligated in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. For deletions involving other regions of topo I, where no suitable restriction enzyme sites were available in the original topo I cDNA sequence, PCR was performed to introduce appropriate enzyme sites for convenient subcloning. PCR reactions were essentially performed using a standard method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 15.1.1-15.1.15Google Scholar). In general, appropriate DNA fragments were first amplified by PCR, cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and then subcloned into the pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).

Open table in a new tab pTI-28 carried aa 1–199 with a deletion of aa 148–157 and was constructed as follows. First, a fragment that covers aa 1–147 was amplified by PCR using primers I-5.1 and I-3.3B (where aPstI site was introduced; see Table I); a second fragment that covers aa 158–199 was amplified by primers I-5.1L (where aPstI site was also introduced; TableI) and I-3.2. These two fragments were then ligated and cloned into pEGFP-C3 so that the resultant plasmid (pTI-28) carried the N terminus of topo I with a deletion of aa 148–157. The same strategy was used to construct pTI-29, pTI-31, pTI-32, and pTI-33 using appropriate primer sets. The control vector pT104/B1 has been described previously (22Mo Y.-Y. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 25: 50-62Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Either nuclear extract or total protein was prepared for Western blot as described previously (23Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8425-8433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To detect the expression of the EGFP·topo I fusion proteins, immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH). Topo I-specific antibody TI-I (24Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to detect both endogenous and EGFP·topo I fusion proteins. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (25Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.-Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but with a slight modification. In brief, HeLa cells were grown over coverslips in 6-well plates overnight. The cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100. After incubation with the primary antibody against Hsp70 (monoclonal, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the cells were then incubated with secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The samples were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using a filter with maximum excitation at 480 nm and maximum emission at 520 nm. To detect subcellular localization of EGFP·topo I, cells were subcultured after transfection with an appropriate plasmid in 6-well plates with a coverslip in each well and grown for 16–24 h. When needed, cells were also fixed with cold fixing solution (1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline). For nuclear staining, the fixed cells were incubated with Hoechst dye (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. Fluorescent signals were revealed under the fluorescence microscope using the filters for EGFP and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, respectively. Band depletion and growth inhibition assays have been described previously (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the N-terminal domain is essential for human topo I to target the nucleus in HeLa cells (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and four putative NLSs have been proposed at this region (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether any or all of these NLSs are actually functional in mammalian cells, we made a series of deletion mutants for the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Expression of those deleted EGFP·topo I fusion constructs was examined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2, the fusion proteins were detected at the sizes expected. For instance, we detected an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa for pTI-5, which is in good agreement with its predicted size (Fig. 2). Similarly, we also detected the rest of the fusion proteins roughly within their predicted molecular masses (Fig. 2). Once these fusion constructs were confirmed to be expressed exogenously in HeLa cells, we followed their subcellular localization. Consistent with our previous results (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), cells transfected with pTI-5 (Clone #1 in Fig. 1) displayed green fluorescent protein in the nucleus, and was concentrated in nucleoli (Fig. 3). Consequently, experiments were designed to determine what specific sequences are required for nuclear/nucleolar localization. Among four putative NLSs at the N terminus of human topo I, NLS-I (aa 59–65) is well separated from the other three (aa 150–198; see Fig. 1) (13Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, we attempted initially to test whether NLS-I plays any role in targeting the nucleus. Hence, we made a fusion construct, pTI-7 (Clone #4, aa 1–146), in such a way that the cloned DNA fragment ended immediately before NLS-II (aa 150–156). The fusion protein encoded by pTI-7 showed exclusively nuclear distribution (Fig. 3), suggesting that a functional NLS exists at aa 1–146, even in the absence of the other three putative NLSs. To determine whether NLS-I (aa 59–65) is responsible for the observed nuclear localization, we made pTI-8 (Clone #2, aa 1–67) that included NLS-I, but we deleted the rest of the sequences (aa 68–146). The fusion protein from pTI-8 revealed cytoplasmic distribution just like that of the vector control (pT104/B1) (Fig. 3), suggesting that NLS-I is not functional for nuclear localization or is not sufficient for it. The presence of a functional NLS at aa 1–146 suggests that human topo I might carry two NLSs, because previous studies suggested that NLS-II (aa 150–156) is important, at least in yeast (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether NLS-II, -III, and -IV are functional in HeLa cells, we made pTI-10 (Clone #5, aa 148–199), with no overlap with pTI-7. As expected, we found that cells transfected with pTI-10 displayed green fluorescent nuclear staining (Fig. 3). Therefore, two functional NLSs exist at the N terminus of human topo I, one located at aa 1–146, and another located at aa 148–199. Importantly, they appear to function independently. Because amino acids 148–199 carry three putative NLSs, we made further deletions to delineate a minimal sequence that is sufficient to support nuclear localization. We first made pTI-27 (Clone #7, aa 148–187) that includes NLS-II and -III but lacks NLS-IV. As seen for pTI-10, the fusion protein from pTI-27 displayed nuclear staining (Fig. 4), suggesting that NLS-IV is not essential. To test the role of NLS-II in nuclear localization, we deleted NLS-II from pTI-10 (aa 148–199), resulting in pTI-13 (Clone #6, aa 157–199). Although pTI-10 retained nuclear localization capability, a deletion involving NLS-II (pTI-13) abolished its ability to target the nucleus (Fig. 4). These results indicate that NLS-II (aa 150–156) has the capability of nuclear targeting. To further determine whether NLS-II alone is sufficient to support nuclear localization, a peptide (KPKKIKTED) was fused to EGFP (pTI-26, Clone #8). As expected, cells transfected with pTI-26 clearly revealed nuclear localization (Fig. 4). These results indicate that although three putative NLSs are clustered at aa 148–199, in HeLa cells, NLS-II is the only functional one among them and that neither NLS-III nor NLS-IV is important for nuclear localization. Topo I has been shown to be predominantly in the nucleolus (18Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the fusion protein from pTI-5 was detected in the nucleus and particularly concentrated in the nucleolus (Figs. 3 and 4). To further confirm that the green fluorescent particles observed in pTI-5-transfected cells (Fig. 3) are nucleoli, we immuno-stained HeLa cells with an antibody specific to Hsp70, a well known protein that is localized to the nucleolus when cells are under heat stress (28Vincent M. Tanguay R.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Morcillo G. Gorab E. Tanguay R.M. Diez J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The staining patterns by the anti-Hsp70 antibody were basically identical to those of EGFP staining by pTI-5 (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the green fluorescent particles seen in cells transfected with pTI-5 are localized in nucleoli. Heat shock treatment did not change the nucleolar localization pattern of pTI-5. Cells transfected with pTI-10 revealed both nuclear and nucleolar localization, similar to pTI-5 (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that the signal for nucleolar localization resided at aa 150–199. Further deletion analyses support this notion, because both pTI-26 and pTI-27 resulted only in nuclear but not nucleolar localization of the fusion proteins (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, although neither NLS-III nor NLS-IV is required for nuclear localization, at least NLS-IV is important for nucleolar localization. Data from Figs. 3 and 4 indicated that the N terminus of human topo I carries multiple NLSs that function independently. More importantly, NLS at aa 1–146 might be novel, because NLS-I within this region does not appear to play such a role (Fig. 3). To better understand this potential novel NLS, we first made pTI-2/X1 (Clone #3), which carried only aa 1–140, because previous studies suggested that the sequence covering aa 1–140 lacked nuclear targeting ability in yeast (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, we found that green fluorescent protein encoded by pTI-2/X1 was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm, consistent with the previous results (12Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although we occasionally observed a few cells with the green fluorescent protein in the nucleus (<5%). Compared with pTI-2/X1, pTI-7 carries an additional six amino acids (DEDDAD, aa 141–146), suggesting that these six amino acids play an important role in targeting the nucleus. To test whether the sequence DEDDAD alone is sufficient to target the nucleus, we fused this fragment to pEGFP-C3 (pTI-16, Clone #13) and found that the fusion protein from this clone carried no functional NLS (Fig. 5), suggesting that the sequence DEDDAD alone is not sufficient to function as an NLS. It is obvious that the sequence DEDDAD is rich in acidic amino acids, in contrast to classic monopartite NLSs that are rich in basic amino acids (14Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). To further delineate the sequence that carries a potential novel NLS, we first tested the effect of deletion of NLS-I on its nuclear localization, and thus we made pTI-9 (Clone #9, aa 69–146) in which NLS-I (aa 59–65) was excluded. The fusion protein from pTI-9 was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5), as seen for pTI-7 (aa 1–146), indicating that NLS-I plays no role in targeting the nucleus. To determine the minimal sequence for the novel NLS, we made a series of deletion constructs: pTI-17 (Clone #10, aa 84–146), pTI-18 (Clone #11, aa 117–146), and pTI-20 (Clone #12, aa 125–146). We observed nuclei stained with green fluorescent protein in the cells transfected with pTI-17 and pTI-18 (Fig. 5 A), as seen for pTI-7 (Fig. 5 A). A further deletion involving aa 117–125,i.e. pTI-20, drastically reduced the nuclear localization capability of the fusion protein, resulting in a predominant cytoplasmic distribution of the fusion protein (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that the minimal sequence for the novel NLS is located within aa 117–146. Because aa 117–146 are an essential part of the novel NLS that alone is sufficient for nuclear import (Fig. 5 A), these amino acids were used to search for amino acid homology. As shown in Fig. 5 B, this sequence was found in topo I of mice, Chinese hamsters and chickens, in addition to humans, with an almost perfect match (26Tanizawa A. Beitrand R. Kohlhagen G. Tabuchi A. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25463-25468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Koiwai O. Yasui Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Ishii K. Yanagihara S. Andoh T. Gene. 1993; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A high homology was also found with topo I of frogs (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, the yeast or Drosophilatopo I lacks this sequence. Because the six amino acids (DEDDAD, aa 141–146) are important for nuclear localization and are highly acidic, we thought that it would be interesting to determine whether there is any effect on the subcellular localization of the fusion protein by mutations of this region. Thus, DD at aa 143–144 in this sequence was replaced by KK, thus representing a double point mutation (pTI-19, Clone #14). Indeed, whereas pTI-18 retained its functional NLS, pTI-19 lost the ability to target the nucleus, displaying cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that these two aspartic acids play an important role in nuclear targeting. Although the fusion proteins from pTI-7, -9, -17, and -18 were localized in the nucleus, they showed little nucleolar green fluorescent staining (Fig. 5). This is in contrast to that of pTI-5, which was mostly localized in the nucleolus, suggesting that the novel NLS either plays no role in nucleolar localization or is not sufficient to do so. To test whether the novel NLS can replace NLS-II for nucleolar accumulation in the presence of NLS-III and -IV, we made a fusion construct, pTI-28 (Clone #15; see Fig. 1), in which NLS-II was deleted from pTI-5. Transfection of HeLa cells with pTI-28 revealed a similar nucleolar accumulation to that of pTI-5 (Fig. 4 A). These results indicated that NLS-II is not required for nuclear/nucleolar localization of the fusion protein if the novel NLS is present with NLS-III and NLS-IV. To further test the effect of the novel NLS on nuclear/nucleolar localization of the full-length topo I, we made three deletion constructs (pTI-31, pTI-32, and pTI-33) as seen in Fig. 6 A. pTI-31 carried the full-length topo I with a deletion of NLS-II (Δ aa 148–157); pTI-32 carried the full-length topo I with a deletion of the novel NLS (Δ aa 117–146); and pTI-33 carried the full-length topo I with a deletion of NLS-IV (Δ aa 188–198). Although not all pTI-2-transfected cells displayed nucleolar localization (Fig. 6 B), which is consistent with our previous results (19Mo Y.-Y. Wang P.C. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), like pTI-2, pTI-31 and pTI-32 resulted in a similar ratio of nucleolar localization (∼50%), calculated from 200 transfected cells for each plasmid. These results suggest that the novel NLS can replace NLS-II for nucleolar localization. To determine the role of NLS-IV in nucleolar localization, we deleted NLS-IV from pTI-28, resulting in pTI-29 (Clone #16; see Fig. 1). Like pTI-27, the fusion protein from pTI-29 displayed only nucle"

TSP1 is composed of three identical 150-kDa monomers connected by disulfide bridges (5Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Each monomer contains an N-terminal globular module (N), a central stalk region, and a globular C-terminal assemblage. The central stalk region is composed of the oligomerization sequence (o) that has the cysteines that form the interchain disulfide linkages, a procollagen module (C), three type 1 modules (properdin), and three type 2 modules (epidermal growth factor-like, EGF-like). The C-terminal assemblage is composed of 13 tandem aspartate-rich Ca2+ binding repeats and a globular C-terminal module. Functions of TSP1 include cell adhesion (6Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J.

The procollagen module is repeated four times in chordin, SOG, and SAS; twice in vWF; and once in the other proteins.

These observations raise the questions of whether C andN fold independently of the other modules and have structural properties of homologous modules. In order to answer these questions and to understand the structure/function of the modules, we have characterized recombinant C andN of human TSP1 using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation. DNA encodingC was inserted into a baculovirus transfer vector (pAcGP67.coco) developed in our laboratory. Briefly, pAcGP67.coco is a modification of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67A (Pharmingen) with the addition of a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) and a six-histidine tag (His tag) immediately 3′ to the multiple cloning site. The cDNA encoding C (residues 294–356 of mature human TSP1) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a full-length cDNA clone of human TSP1 (generously donated by Dr. Vishva Dixit), inserted in the vector, and expressed in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen). The recombinant protein (C.coco) produced has the following sequence: ADPG 294LRRPPL CYHNGVQYRN NEEWTVDSCT ECHCQNSVTI CKKVSCPIMP CSNATVPDGE CCPRCWP356LELVPR↓ GSAAGHHHHHH, where ↓ indicates the thrombin cleavage site. Leucine 294 was chosen as the start site forC because it is the N terminus of a 140-kDa fragment of TSP1 that was identified as an inhibitor of angiogenesis (35Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F.

Proline 356 was chosen as the end of the module based on the location of the intron-exon junction (36Wolf F.W. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Dixit V.M. Genomics. 1990; 6: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). C.coco was expressed by infecting High Five cells in SF900II serum-free media with high titer virus (>108 pfu/ml) at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5–10. Conditioned medium was collected approximately 65 h postinfection, cells were spun down and removed, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The medium was then dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 7.5 mm imidazole, pH 8, and incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed with dialysis buffer, and C.coco was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Overall yield was 20–25 mg of recombinant protein per liter of conditioned media. The His tag was removed after dialysis of C.coco into 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, pH 8.5, by digestion with 2 units of biotinylated thrombin (Novagen)/mg of protein overnight at room temperature. Thrombin was removed using streptavidin-agarose (Novagen). Undigested protein was removed by purification with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid, as described above, and 1 mm Pevabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and a calculated extinction coefficient of 14,605m−1 cm−1(37Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 261-298Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was used to confirm the extinction coefficient (data not shown). C (procollagen module without the His tag) was concentrated using Centriplus 3 concentrators (Amicon) and purified further using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech S-100 gel filtration column equilibrated in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7, buffer. The N-terminal end of TSP1 through the end of C (residues 1–374) was expressed in High Five insect cells using the same expression system as above. The expressed protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin in a similar manner as above for C.coco, except the medium was incubated with the resin without prior dialysis. Imidazole (5 mm) was added to the medium during incubation with the resin, and the resin was washed with 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (TBSC), containing 20 mm imidazole prior to elution ofNoC with TBSC containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluted NoC was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5, prior to storage at −70 °C. Overall yield was 4–5 mg of recombinant protein per liter of conditioned medium. N was cleaved off ofNoC by digesting with trypsin (1:500, w/w) at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The digest was purified using a heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in TBSC. The flow-through contained the trimer composed of the oligomerization sequence through the procollagen modules (oC). N was eluted using 10 mm Tris, 0.55 m NaCl, 0.3 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4. Digestions were followed using SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained using Gel-Code Blue (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined using calculated extinction coefficients of 70,005m−1 cm−1for NoC, 48,660 m−1cm−1 for oC and 7115m−1 cm−1for N (37). The mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) using a Bruker REFLEX II (Billerica, MA) equipped with delayed extraction, reflectron, and a 337-nm laser. The matrix was a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid (Sigma). The calibrants were insulin and trypsinogen (Sigma). The acceleration voltage, positive ion mode, was 25 kV. Protein was prepared prior to analysis by extensive dialysis into 5% acetic acid. Molecular weight was determined via equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation using a Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge at 27,000, 36,000, and 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein was 0.1–0.35 mg/ml in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7, buffer. CD studies were performed on an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer, model 62A DS. Far UV measurements were taken in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette using protein dialyzed into 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, while near UV measurements were taken in a 1-cm path length cuvette using protein dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7, buffer. Time constants were either 5 or 10 s. Three scans were averaged for each measurement and base line-subtracted. The resulting spectra were converted to mean residue weight ellipticity and smoothed using Aviv's Igor Pro software. Thermal stability of C was examined by monitoring the ellipticity at 228 nm every 5 °C as temperature was raised from 25 to 95 °C at 50 °C/min. The SOPM program was used for secondary structure prediction (38Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar), while the K2D program (39Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 40Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Moran F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was used for deconvolution of the CD spectrum. The probability of a coiled-coil in the oligomerization sequence was examined by sequence analysis using the Paircoil (41Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and COILS (38Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar, 42Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) programs. Steady state emission spectra were obtained at 25 °C using an SLM-8000C fluorimeter. Excitation and emission slit widths were 2 and 4 nm, respectively. Tryptophan emission was observed using excitation at 295 nm. Buffer was 10 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4 (TBSC) with or without 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) or 6 m ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) (ICN Biomedicals). Three scans were averaged for each measurement and base line-subtracted. Corrections due to inner filter effects were not incorporated, since the absorbance values did not exceed 0.01. In order to determine the average accessibility of emissive tryptophans in C and N, fluorescence quenching experiments with acrylamide and KI were performed at 25 °C. Protein in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was quenched in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide (0–100 mm) or KI (0–100 mm). The KI stock solution also contained 0.1 mm potassium thiosulfate in order to prevent formation of I3−. The fluorescence measurements were performed as described above, as continuous emission spectra between 300 and 400 nm with excitation at 295 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence intensities were obtained for each experiment by integrating the fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation which isFo/F = 1 + Ksv [Q], whereFo and F are the integrated fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of quenchers, respectively,Ksv is the collisional Stern-Volmer constant, and [Q] is the quencher concentration (43Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 44Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The plot ofFo/F versus [Q] is linear if the population of emitting fluorophores is homogeneous. The solvent accessibility of the tryptophan residues in C was examined by measuring the differential absorbance spectra in the presence and absence of 20% glycerol in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, buffer. Measurements were made using tandem cuvettes in a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. Four scans were averaged for each measurement. The change in the extinction coefficient at 292 nm was used to estimate the exposure of the tryptophan residues as described by Herskovits (45Herskovits T.T. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 748-775Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). An equimolar mixture of the N-acetyl ethyl esters of tryptophan and tyrosine was used as the model compound. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was done using a Microcal differential scanning calorimeter withC at 1.5 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3m NaCl, pH 7. The scans were from 15 to 95 °C at a rate of 60 °C/h. Endothelial cell migration was measured in a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Nucleopore) with cells and mediators in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin as described by Tolsma et al. (7Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.V. Good D.J. Frazier W.A. Polverini P.J. Bouck N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes with 5-μm pores (Whatman) were coated with collagen I (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) before use. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells (VEC Technologies) or fetal bovine heart endothelial cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were plated at 25,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere to the lower surface of a membrane in an inverted chemotaxis chamber for 2 h at 37 °C. The chamber was reinverted, and test samples were added to the top wells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C to allow migration. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control, and 1 μm sphingosine 1-phosphate (Alexis Corp.) was used as the stimulant (46Panetti T.S. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was generously provided by Dr. Johan Stenflo (University of Lund, Sweden). The protein was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, where it was stained with Amido Black prior to sequencing. Amino acid analysis for determining the extinction coefficient was done at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Wisconsin. The presence of glycosylation of C was tested using a digoxigenin glycan detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as directed by the manufacturer, and by treatingC.coco-infected SF9 cells with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin.C with or without 6 m guanidine hydrochloride was reduced with DTT in 0.25 m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, prior to alkylation with iodoacetic acid (47Wada Y. Chapman J.R. Protein and Peptide Analysis by Mass Spectrometry. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 101-113Google Scholar, 48Rademaker G.J. Thomas-Oates J. Chapman J.R. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 231-241Google Scholar). C was expressed and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” N-terminal sequencing showed C began with ADPGLRRPPL, indicating that the signal sequence was cleaved. The expected mass was 8204.5 Da (TableI). On SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the protein migrated as an approximately 10,000-Da protein (Fig. 2 A). Under nonreducing conditions, it migrated as a smear, most likely due to binding of SDS at substoichiometric amounts due to the high disulfide bond content. MALDI-MS yielded peaks with masses of 9090, 9239, 9406, and 9575 Da (Fig. 2 B). C has one consensus sequence forN-linked glycosylation (NAT) at residues 354–356. The mass difference observed via MALDI-MS is explained by glycosylation ofC with (N-acetylglucosamine)2(mannose)3(mass 911 Da) along with an additional sugar or two (each sugar adds an additional 150–180 Da depending on the type). The presence of glycosylation was verified using a digoxigenin glycan kit. Treatment of infected cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor ofN-glycosylation, greatly reduced protein secretion and resulted in protein of the expected unmodified mass by SDS-PAGE, further indicating that C is glycosylated (data not shown).Table IMolecular weight of CMass expectedSDS-PAGEEquilibrium ultracentrifugationMALDI-MSDaDaDa8204.510,0009483 ± 309091, 9244, 9408, 9584The masses of the four peaks observed using MALDI-MS presented are the average of four determinations.

Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation of C at concentrations of 0.1–0.35 mg/ml was done in order to determine its molecular weight and aggregation state in physiologic salt solution. The molecular weight was determined to be 9483 ± 30 (TableI). This agreed with the MALDI-MS mass and indicates that Cis monomeric. In order to determine the disulfide bond content of C, the protein was denatured, reduced, and alkylated. The masses of the iodoacetic acid-treated native protein, denatured protein, and denatured/reduced protein were determined by MALDI-MS and compared (Table II). A mass shift due to alkylation was only detected after reductive exposure of all cysteine residues.Table IIDetermination of disulfide bond content of CTreatmentMass (peak 2)Mass change from nativeMass change/Mass CMDaDaGuHCl/IA9240−4.4<0.1DTT/IA983258810.1GuHCl/DTT/IA98175739.9C with or without 6 m GuHCl was reduced with DTT in 0.25 m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, buffer prior to alkylation with iodoacetic acid (IA).

Although NF-κB activation is critical for hepatocyte resistance to TNF toxicity, the contribution of other TNF-inducible transcription factors remains unknown. To determine the function of c-Myc in hepatocyte sensitivity to TNF, stable transfectants of the rat hepatocyte cell line RALA255-10G containing sense and antisense c-myc expression vectors were isolated with increased (S-Myc cells) and decreased (AN-Myc cells) c-Myc transcriptional activity. While S-Myc cells proliferated in response to TNF treatment, AN-Myc cells underwent 32% cell death within 6 h. Fluorescent microscopic studies indicated that TNF induced apoptosis and necrosis in AN-Myc cells. Cell death was associated with DNA hypoploidy and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage but occurred in the absence of detectable caspase-3, -7, or -8 activation. TNF-induced, AN-Myc cell death was dependent on Fas-associated protein with death domain and partially blocked by caspase inhibitors. AN-Myc cells had decreased levels of NF-κB transcriptional activity, but S-Myc cells maintained resistance to TNF despite NF-κB inactivation, suggesting that c-Myc and NF-κB independently mediate TNF resistance. Thus, in the absence of sufficient c-Myc expression, hepatocytes are sensitized to TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis. These findings demonstrate that hepatocyte resistance to TNF is regulated by multiple transcriptional activators.

Remick D.G. Friedland J.S. Cytokines in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 223-240Google Scholar). The biological effects of TNF in cultured hepatocytes are relevant to the liverin vivo, since TNF also acts as a hepatic mitogen (2Akerman P. Cote Y. Yang S.Q. McClain C. Nelson S. Bagby G.J.

TNF has been implicated as a mediator of hepatocyte death following injury from toxins, ischemia/reperfusion, and hepatitis virus (for a review, see Ref. 7Bradham C.A. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. Brenner D.A. Trautwein C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G387-G392PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of an injurious cofactor such as a toxin, hepatocytes are resistant to TNF cytotoxicity, and the mechanism by which they become sensitized to TNF-induced death in the setting of cell injury remains unknown. The pathway from TNF stimulation to cell death has been well described (for a review, see Ref. 8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). TNF binding to the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR-1) causes receptor trimerization and the recruitment and binding of a series of intracellular proteins including TNFR-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). FADD binding leads initially to activation of caspase-8, and subsequently to activation of caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis (8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). While the steps in the TNF death pathway leading to apoptosis are known, the mechanism by which cells inactivate this caspase cascade and maintain resistance to TNF toxicity is unclear. A recent advance in our understanding of cellular TNF resistance has come from the demonstration that activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is critical for the induction of cellular resistance to TNF toxicity (9Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 10Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) converts the hepatocellular TNF response from one of proliferation to one of apoptosis. This finding fits well with the fact that in vitro resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity requires RNA and protein synthesis (16Kull F.C. Cuatrecasas P. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4885-4890PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF signaling up-regulates a protective cellular gene(s). NF-κB inactivation may sensitize cells to TNF toxicity by preventing the transcriptional up-regulation of an NF-κB-dependent protective gene(s). However, TNF activates other transcriptional activators, including c-Myc and AP-1, and their potential contribution to the transcriptional regulation of hepatocyte resistance to TNF toxicity is unknown. c-Myc is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 17Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). c-Myc expression not only promotes proliferation but also can induce or sensitize cells to apoptosis (18Hoffman B. Lieberman D.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3351-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 11-28PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-myc under circumstances in which this gene is usually down regulated such as serum deprivation, results in apoptotic cell death in nonhepatic cells (20Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H.

Miyamoto K. Tsukidate L. Yamanaka T. Katayama K.I. Yamatsu I. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), TNF induces hepatocyte injury and death associated with a block in the up-regulation ofc-myc mRNA expression that normally occurs during a hepatic proliferative response (28Schmiedeberg P. Biempica L. Czaja M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that hepatocytes may undergo TNF-induced death in the absence of c-Myc expression or even become sensitized to TNF toxicity by a failure to up-regulate c-Myc. We therefore tested the hypothesis that c-Myc expression promotes hepatocyte resistance to TNF toxicity by examining the sensitivity of rat hepatocyte cell lines with differential c-Myc expression to TNF toxicity. Cells lines with differential c-Myc expression were derived from the wild-type RALA255–10G rat hepatocyte cell line (29Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These cells are conditionally transformed with a temperature-sensitive T antigen. Cells were grown at the permissive temperature of 33 °C and then maintained at 37 °C to allow suppression of T antigen expression and development of a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype as described previously (29Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in cells cultured at 37 °C. The c-myc cDNA subcloned into the expression vector pMEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as described previously (21Xu J. Xu Y. Nguyen Q. Novikoff P.M. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G60-G70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into RALA hepatocytes using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected by resistance to 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). The subsequent experiments employed pooled transfectants expressing sense (S-Myc cells) and antisense (AN-Myc cells) c-myc constructs. All cells were cultured in 50 μm zinc for 4 days prior to the start of experiments in order to induce transgene expression from pMEP4, which contains a zinc-inducible human MT IIa promoter. In some experiments, cells were treated with rat recombinant TNF (TNF-α, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, 50 μm C2 ceramide (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), or 1.25 μmol/106 cells of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Sigma). To inhibit caspase activity, cells were pretreated for 1 h before the addition of TNF with the following caspase inhibitors dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide: 100 μm Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (BACHEM, Torrance, CA), 50 μm N-[(indole-2-carbonyl)-alaninyl]-3-amino-4-oxo-5-fluoropentanoic acid (IDN-1529), orN-[(1,3-dimethylindol-2-carbonyl)-valinyl]-3-amino-4-oxo-5-fluoropentanoic acid (IDN-1965) (IDUN Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA). IDN-1529 and IDN-1965 have broad anti-caspase activity, inhibiting caspase-1, -3, -6, and -8. 2J. Wu, personal communication.

Cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) a Renilla luciferase vector driven by a Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, which served as a control for transfection efficiency. To assay luciferase activity, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and the cell extract was assayed for firefly luciferase activity in a luminometer. Renilla luciferase was assayed in the same sample according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was then normalized to Renillaluciferase activity. RNA was extracted from cells as described previously (32Czaja M.J. Weiner F.R. Freedman J.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Steady-state mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot hybridizations using samples of 20 μg of total RNA (32Czaja M.J. Weiner F.R. Freedman J.H. J. Cell.

The membranes were hybridized with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled cDNA clones for lactate dehydrogenase A (33Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell survival was calculated as a percentage of control cells by taking the optical density reading of cells given a particular treatment, dividing that number by the optical density reading for the untreated, control cells, and then multiplying by 100. The numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined by examining cells under fluorescence microscopy following costaining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide (14Xu Y. Bialik S.

The percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology (nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation) under acridine orange staining was determined by examining >400 cells/dish. Necrosis was determined by the presence of ethidium bromide staining in the same cell population. The identification of hypoploid cells by FACS detection of DNA loss after controlled extraction of low molecular weight DNA was performed as described previously (35Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Liu H.

Cells were trypsinized and centrifuged, and the cell pellets were fixed in 70% ethanol and placed at −20 °C for a minimum of 17 h. The cells were washed and resuspended in Hanks' buffered saline solution and incubated in phosphate-citric acid buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 mcitric acid, pH 7.8) for 5 min. The cells were then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing propidium iodide (20 μg/μl) and RNase (100 μg/ml). Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) at an excitation of 488 nm. DNA fluorescence pulse processing was used to discriminate between single cells and aggregates of cells (Doublet Discrimination) by evaluating the FL2-Width versusFL2-Area scatter plot. Light scatter gating was used to eliminate smaller debris from analysis. An analysis gate was set to limit the measurement of hypoploidy to an area of 10-fold loss of DNA content. For protein isolation for Western immunoblots of c-Myc and protein-disulfide isomerase, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Cells were then mixed at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Fifty micrograms of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE as described previously (14Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Ponceau red to ensure equivalent amounts of protein loading and electrophoretic transfer among samples. Membranes were exposed to a rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or protein-disulfide isomerase rabbit antiserum (36Terada K. Manchikalapudi P.

Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura Extended; Pierce). For poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) immunoblots, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitors as above. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the cell suspension was sonicated. Fifty micrograms of protein were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-PARP polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution followed by a goat anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:20,000 dilution. For caspase immunoblots, cells were scraped in medium; centrifuged; resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 42 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors listed previously; and mixed at 4 °C for 30 min. Fifty micrograms of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3, -7, and -8 antibodies (IDUN Pharmaceuticals) at 1:2000, 1:1000, and 1:4000 dilutions, respectively, followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. To examine mitochondrial cytochrome c release, mitochondrial fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation in sucrose as described previously (35Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Liu H. Srinivasan A.

Fifty micrograms of mitochondrial protein were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE as described above. A mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal IgG (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and a mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV monoclonal IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used at 1:1000 dilutions together with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies). The following adenoviruses were employed: a control virus Ad5LacZ that expresses theEscherichia coli β-galactosidase gene; NFD-4 containing a dominant negative FADD; a CrmA-expressing adenovirus; and Ad5IκB, which expresses a mutated IκB that irreversibly binds NF-κB, preventing its activation (13Bradham C.A.

Viruses were grown in 293 cells; purified by banding twice on CsCl gradients; dialyzed against 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin; and stored at −80 °C. Cells were infected with 5 × 109 particles of the appropriate virus per 35-mm culture dish (∼1.5 × 103 particles/cell or 5–15 plaque-forming units/cell) as described previously (14Xu Y. Bialik S.

Nuclear proteins were isolated by the method of Schreiber et al. (37Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar), modified as described previously (21Xu J. Xu Y. Nguyen Q. Novikoff P.M. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G60-G70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed on 5 μg of protein with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide for the NF-κB consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The DNA binding reaction was performed as described previously (21Xu J. Xu Y. Nguyen Q. Novikoff P.M. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G60-G70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. All numerical results are reported as mean ± S.E. and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. RALA hepatocytes were transfected with the pMEP4 expression vector containing the c-myc cDNA in either a sense or antisense orientation. Stable transfectants were selected in hygromycin and initially screened for c-myc expression by Northern blot analysis. Two polyclonal cell lines were selected in which expression of sense c-myc (S-Myc cells) and antisense c-myc(AN-Myc cells) constructs resulted in maximally increased and decreasedc-myc levels, respectively. Western immunoblotting confirmed that S-Myc cells had increased c-Myc levels compared with AN-Myc cells, while the two cell lines had equivalent levels of the constitutively expressed protein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 1 A). The relative amounts of c-Myc transcriptional activity in the two cells lines were measured with a transiently transfected c-Myc firefly luciferase reporter, and the results were normalized to a cotransfected Renillaluciferase reporter under the control of a minimal reporter. c-Myc transcriptional activity in untreated cells was increased over 14-fold in S-Myc cells as compared with AN-Myc cells (Fig. 1 B). Although c-Myc-dependent transcriptional activity increased in both cell lines following TNF treatment, the activity in AN-Myc cells was still less than 10% of the activity in S-Myc cells (Fig. 1 B). As additional evidence of differential c-Myc transcriptional activity in the two cell lines, mRNA levels for the c-Myc-dependent lactate dehydrogenase A gene (33Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), were determined by Northern blot analysis. S-Myc cells had significantly increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A relative to AN-Myc cells, while RNA levels of the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene were equivalent in the two cell lines (Fig. 1 C). Thus, as assessed by protein levels, transcriptional activity, and c-Myc-dependent gene expression, c-Myc levels were increased in S-Myc cells relative to AN-Myc cells. TNF treatment of RALA hepatocytes results in a proliferative response (14Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the known mitogenic effect of TNF on the liver in vivo following partial hepatectomy (2Akerman P. Cote Y. Yang S.Q.

To convert the TNF response from proliferation to apoptosis requires either cotreatment with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or inhibition of activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (14Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Liu H. Srinivasan A. Streetz K. Valentino K.L. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 705-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similar to wild-type RALA hepatocytes, S-Myc cells were resistant to TNF toxicity as determined by MTT assays 6 and 24 h after TNF treatment (Fig. 2 A). Despite the use of highly confluent cultures, S-Myc cell number increased 11% at 24 h, indicating that these cells underwent a proliferative response to TNF, a result identical to previous findings in wild-type cells (14Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF treatment of AN-Myc cells resulted in a 32% decrease in cell number within only 6 h and only a slight further decrease in cell number by 24 h (Fig. 2 A). In keeping with previously published results (14Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TNF at 10 ng/ml resulted in a maximal death response because no further decrease in cell number occurred when AN-Myc cells were treated with a higher TNF concentration of 30 ng/ml (data not shown). To examine whether AN-Myc cell sensitivity to TNF toxicity represented a nonspecific sensitization to any cell death stimulus, cell survival was determined following treatment with C2 ceramide and H2O2. Ceramide is a known apoptotic stimulus that has been implicated as a downstream mediator of TNF-induced cell death (38Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The oxidant H2O2 triggers apoptosis in many cell types, including RALA cells (39Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Liu H. Pradhan Z. Garcia L. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G693-G699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and oxidative stress has been implicated as a mechanism of TNF toxicity (1Tracy K.J. Remick D.G. Friedland J.S. Cytokines in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 223-240Google Scholar). Identical to previous reports in wild-type RALA hepatocytes (40Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), both S-Myc and AN-Myc cells were resistant to ceramide toxicity at the 6-h time point, at which sensitization to TNF toxicity had occurred (Fig. 2 A). Both S-Myc and AN-Myc cells underwent significant cell death 24 h after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2 A), indicating no significant alteration in sensitivity to this toxin between the two cell lines. Inhibition of c-Myc expression did not sensitize RALA hepatocytes indiscriminately to any form of cell death but specifically modulated resistance to TNF-induced cell death. Cell death from TNF may result from apoptosis or necrosis depending on the cell type. To determine which type of cell death occurred in TNF-treated AN-Myc cells, cells were examined for morphological and biochemical evidence of apoptosis. AN-Myc cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy following costaining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide to quantitate the numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Over the 6 h after TNF treatment, AN-Myc cells had marked increases in both the numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells (Fig. 2 B). As additional evidence that inhibition of c-Myc expression sensitized cells to death at least in part from apoptosis, FACS analysis was performed to quantitate the numbers of hypoploid cells as a measure of the presence of DNA fragmentation. Despite 24 h of culture in serum-free medium, S-Myc cells had a low level of hypoploidy that decreased slightly with TNF t"

We identified a highly conserved 12-nucleotide motif present in all A. gambiae and Anopheles stephensi trypsin promoters. We investigated the role of this putative trypsin regulatory element (PTRE) in controlling the transcription of the trypsin genes. Gel shift experiments demonstrated that nuclear proteins of A. gambiae cell lines formed two distinct complexes with probes encompassing the PTRE sequence. Mapping of the binding sites revealed that one of the complex has the specificity of a GATA transcription factor. Promoter constructs containing mutations in the PTRE sequence that selectively abolished the binding of either one or both complexes exerted opposite effects on the transcriptional activity of trypsin promoters in A. gambiae and Aedes aegypti cell lines. In addition, the expression of a novel GATA gene was highly enriched in A. gambiae guts. Taken together our data prove that factors binding to the PTRE region are key regulatory elements possibly involved in the blood meal-induced repression and activation of transcription in early and late trypsin genes.

Hecker H. J. Med. Entomol. 1991; 28: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In Anopheles gambiae, seven trypsin genes have been identified, Antryp1 to Antryp7, all clustered together in a relatively small chromosomal locus of 11 kb1 (2Müller H.M. Crampton J.M. della Torre A. Sinden R. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2891-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These genes were arranged in the following two distinct groups on the basis of their expression pattern: constitutively expressed “early ” trypsins (Antryp3, -4, -5, -6, and -7) and blood meal induced “late ” trypsins (Antryp1 and -2). Unfed female mosquitoes were shown to constitutively transcribe in their gut Antryp1 and Antryp4 and to a lesser extent Antryp3, -5, -6, and -7. After blood feeding, the transcription of Antryp1 and -2 was rapidly induced, whereas the expression of Antryp3, -4, -5, -6, and -7appeared to be down-regulated (3Müller H.M. Catteruccia F. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The identification of the DNA elements and transcription factors that regulate the expression of the early and late trypsin genes has important implications to understand the molecular mechanisms that control gene expression in the mosquito gut. This information is anticipated to shed new light on how distinct members of complex gene families in different organisms are differentially transcribed in a spatial and temporal regulated manner. Moreover, the functional characterization of early and late trypsin promoters may prove invaluable for the development of control measures against vector-borne diseases based on transgenic mosquitoes expressing anti-parasitic or antiviral agents in the gut. Transformation experiments of Drosophila melanogaster with Anopheles gambiae trypsin promoter constructs revealed that promoter sequences of Antryp1 and -2 were constitutively active in the gut of the fruit fly (4Skavdis G. Siden-Kiamos I. Müller H.-M. Crisanti A. Louis C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cis-acting elements were mapped to DNA sequences encompassing nucleotides −360 to −153 and −418 to −168 of the Antryp1 and Antryp2 promoter, respectively (4Skavdis G. Siden-Kiamos I. Müller H.-M. Crisanti A. Louis C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and binding sites to D. melanogaster nuclear factors were identified (5Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this experimental system the trypsin promoters were transcribed in the gut of both female and male flies. These findings indicated that all A. gambiae and D. melanogastershare DNA elements and factors that selectively control gene expression in their gut, additional transcription control mechanisms are responsible for the temporal, sex-restricted, and mutual exclusive transcription of the trypsin genes in A. gambiae. Sequence analysis of the trypsin locus revealed the presence of a highly conserved motif of 12 nucleotides upstream to the TATA box of all seven trypsin genes outside the region controlling tissue-specific transcription in transgenic flies (Fig. 1). The sequence and the structural organization of this motif and its upstream region suggested that it could be implicated in controlling the transcription of the early and late trypsin genes in a mutually exclusive manner. This putative trypsin regulatory element (PTRE) encompassed a TATCA-conserved motif and a TTAATC consensus sequence, which are known to function as binding sites for GATA transcription factors and homeobox genes, respectively. The analysis of the DNA sequences immediately upstream to the PTRE motifs showed a structural organization that substantially differed in earlyand late trypsin genes. In the late trypsin genes, Antryp1 and -2, the PTRE is part of a large palindromic sequence (4Skavdis G. Siden-Kiamos I. Müller H.-M. Crisanti A. Louis C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This organization generates a second GATA-binding site oriented in opposite direction to the PTRE. With the exception of Antryp7, the palindromic structure of the early trypsin genes appears largely degenerated and contains only a few conserved nucleotides. The PTRE palindrome of Antryp7 is highly conserved; however, this sequence contains a single nucleotide substitution that disrupts the GATA consensus sequence upstream to the PTRE thus suggesting that Antryp7may have switched from late to early trypsin after losing this second GATA site. We report here on a series of experiments aimed at identifying factors able to bind to the PTRE and its palindrome and at investigating the ability of these DNA elements to regulate the transcription of the trypsin genes. Oligonucleotides spanning the PTRE of earlyand late trypsin genes and a series of PTRE mutated versions were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays together with nuclear extracts from a collection of A. gambiae cell lines. Different early and late trypsin promoter constructs carrying either single nucleotide substitutions and/or deletions in the PTRE and its palindromic sequence were assessed in transient transfection experiments to analyze their transcriptional activity. All plasmid constructs were generated by subcloning the DNA inserts into pBluescript SK plasmid (Stratagene). Plasmid pBLuc contains the luciferase cDNA (1.7 kb) followed by 0.9 kb of SV40 polyadenylation signal. Plasmid pT4-Luc contains the luciferase cDNA and SV40 polyadenylation signal under the control of 1.375 kb of the Antryp4 putative promoter sequences, from nucleotide −1 to −1375. Plasmids pAct-Luc and pAct-LacZ contain 2.7 kb of D. melanogaster 5C actin promoter followed by the luciferase or the LacZ-coding sequences and SV40 polyadenylation signal. In order to manipulate the DNA motifs of Antryp4described in the Introduction, oligonucleotides T4-Eco-S and T4-Eco-AS were used to engineer two EcoRI sites in positions −46 and −124, positions chosen to minimize the number of introduced mutations, using a SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intervening sequences encompassed the putative regulatory elements of the Antryp4 promoter. This procedure generated a DNA cassette that could be easily removed and replaced with a given DNA sequence flanked by two EcoRI sites. Sequence substitutions and point mutations were introduced in the DNA regions encompassing the two EcoRI sites using an overlap PCR approach. Briefly, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations and a short 5′-overlapping sequence were used in two separate amplifications using external primers. The products thus generated were gel-purified, mixed at equal concentrations in a PCR mix containing the external primers, and amplified to obtain a product carrying the desired mutations. This product was then digested with EcoRI and inserted into EcoRI-digested pT4. All mutated constructs were verified by sequencing the DNA region using a T7 Sequencing kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Sau3AI partially digested A. stephensi genomic library was prepared in λEMBL3A as described previously (2Müller H.M. Crampton J.M. della Torre A. Sinden R. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2891-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For library screening, a PCR-amplified 772-base pair DNA fragment, corresponding to the complete coding sequence of Antryp1, was labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as a probe, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Four positive clones were identified, and the 14.5-kb clone λT3 was used for subcloning and sequencing the A. stephensi trypsin genes Astryp1 (GenBankTM accession numberU52359) and Astryp3 (GenBankTMaccession number AF012809). The A. gambiae lines Sua 1.0, Sua 1B, Sua 4.0, Sua 5.0, Sua 5B, 4a-3A, 4a-2.4, and L35-5 were established as described for cell line 4a-3A (6Müller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Blass C. Kafatos F.C. J. Biol.

Insect cells were grown at 22–26 °C in Schneider's medium prepared as recommended by Sigma, supplemented with 5–10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MOS 20 cells were grown at 22–26 °C in M199 medium containing 11 g/liter M199, 4 g/liter lactalbumin, 12.5 ml/liter yeastolate, 0.35 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 5–10% fetal calf serum (Sebam), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfection, 1–4 × 105 per cm2 cells were plated in 24-well (2 cm2 each) plates (Costar) in M199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. After approximately 24–48 h, when optimal cell density was reached, cell medium was replaced with 0.9 ml of incomplete M199 medium, lacking fetal calf serum and antibiotics. In 1.5-ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes, a mixture containing 95 μl of incomplete M199, 5 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1.5 μg of DNA trypsin promoter constructs, and 1.5 μg of pAct-LacZ for normalization purposes was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then added to each well. The cells were incubated in transfection mixture for 6 h up to overnight at 26 °C. After transfection, medium was replaced with complete M199 or Schneider's medium, and cells were incubated for approximately 24 h before lysis. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Plates were stored at −80 °C before determination of reporter activity. Luciferase activity was assessed according to manufacturer's protocol (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) with a Berthold luminometer and measuring the light emission for 20 s. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured by incubating 5–20 μl of cell lysate diluted in a total of 150 μl of Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) in a mixture containing 150 μl of 2× Assay Buffer (β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System, Promega) at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m Tris, and absorbance was read at 420 nm. Only values within the linear range were considered. Relative luciferase units were normalized to β-galactosidase units and expressed relative to the control plasmid in each assay. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate wells for each construct, and all experiments were repeated at least twice. A. gambiae and Aedes aegypti cells were grown at 26 °C as described above in 75-cm2 flasks. Cultured cells were harvested either by vigorous pipetting or by scraping. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 1000 × g,and resuspended in hypotonic buffer, containing 10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/liter leupeptin and antipain (Sigma). PMSF, DTT, leupeptin, and antipain were added just before use. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then lysed in a Dounce homogenizer, with 20 strokes of a type B pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged 15 min at 3300 ×g. The supernatants were collected and directly dialyzed for cytoplasmic extract. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in half-packed volume of low salt buffer, containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmPMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/liter leupeptin and antipain. An equal volume of high salt buffer, containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/liter leupeptin and antipain, was slowly added to the nuclei. After 30 min of incubation with gentle stirring, the extracted nuclei were centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 × g. The supernatant, containing the nuclear proteins, was recovered and dialyzed against dialysis buffer, containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT. All incubations and centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were distributed in aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations was determined according to Bradford (7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides designed according to the putative regulatory sequences of Antryp1, -2, and -4 were annealed to the complementary strand, in order to constitute a double strand probe. Each oligonucleotide contained a 5′-protruding tail of four deoxythymidine residues that did not anneal to the complementary strand, to allow labeling by fill-in procedure. Approximately 10 pmol of double strand oligonucleotides were radiolabeled in 10 μl of labeling buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 2–3 μl of α-35S-dATP (10 μCi/μl, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Labeled probes were purified from the non incorporated [α35S]dATP using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSA were performed according to standard procedures (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons Publishers, New York1992Google Scholar). A suspension containing approximately 1.5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 0.2 pmol of radiolabeled probe, 0.5 μg of denatured herring sperm DNA, 1 μg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid, in 10% glycerol. The binding buffer contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmDTT, in a final volume of 15 μl. For competition experiments, a 150-fold molar excess of cold competitor was added. The samples were run on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide-bisacrylamide (30:0.4) gel containing 6.8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5% glycerol in Low Ionic Strength Electrophoresis buffer, containing 6.8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.9. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. Genomic DNA from Sua 4.0 cells was extracted according to a standard procedure (7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Approximately 300 ng of genomic DNA was used in PCR amplification with primers BAC-ZFS (5′-GAGGGACGAGAGTGCGTCAAC-3′) and GATA-Rev-Deg-Xba (5′-GATCTCTAGADCCRCANGCRTTRCANACNGGRTCDCC-3′). Primer BAC-ZFS was designed from a sequence found in the A. gambiae Genoscope data base and sharing high homology to the first zinc finger motif of GATA factors. The degenerate GATA-Rev-Deg-Xba primer encompassed the amino acid sequence GDPVCNACG and was previously used by Drevet et al. (9Drevet J.R. Skeiky Y.A. Iatrou K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10660-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to identify two GATA factors from the silkworm Bombyx mori. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 50 °C for the first 3 cycles and 55 °C for the next 32 cycles. A PCR product of the expected size (376 base pairs) was cloned in pGEM-T Vector (Promega) and sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AJ404478). Total RNA was extracted from guts and carcasses of young male and freshly emerged female A. gambiae mosquitoes as well as from Sua 4.0 and Sua 5.0 cells as described previously (10Holmes D.S. Bonner J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DNase I-treated total RNA (2–5 μg) was incubated for 5 min at 65 °C with 50 ng of random hexamer oligonucleotides (Promega) before adding RT buffer (Promega), 40 units of RNAsin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega), 1.25 μl of 10 mm each dNTP, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega)-reverse transcriptase. The equivalent of approximately 200 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA was processed for PCR using the primers 3/10-RT1S (5′-CGTGCGCGCTATACACGAGACA-3′), 3/10-AS2 (5′-ATGCGTTGCAGACCGATCGCC-3′), and 3/10-AS3 (5′-AGTTGGCACAGGTCACGCCCGAA-3′), annealing to different regions of the AgGATA sequence. Products obtained with 3/10-RT1S and 3/10-AS2 were cloned and sequenced. Alternatively, the identity to the AgGATA product was confirmed by PCR with nested primer 3/10-AS3. As control the cDNA was amplified using the primers Act-F1 (5′-ACCCCATCTCACACAC-TTC-3′) and Act-R1 (5′-ATGTCTTTCATTGCCGCC-3′) annealing to the A. gambiae actin 5C gene. A duplicate of each RNA sample was processed for PCR without the reverse transcriptase, to detect genomic DNA contamination. The oligonucleotides used for EMSA are as follows: T4-Eco-S, CCCCAATCTTCTGAATTCACGT; T4-Eco-AS, TGATACGATGAATTCTGATTTTCTACATG; T4 PTRE, TTTTAGTATCAGTTAATCAG; T4 5′-Flk, TTTTACGATCATTCACGATC; T2 PTRE, TTTTAGTATCAAATAATCAG; T2 5′-Flk, TTTTGCAGTATTTGATAGTG; T2 Ups, TTTTTGCTATCAGTATTTCG; T1 PTRE, TTTTAGTATCAATTAATAAG; T1 5′-Flk, TTTTGCAGCAATTGATATCG; T1 Ups, TTTTACGATCAGCAATTGCG; h-GATA, TTTTGGCCTTATCTCTTTACCCCCCAC; h-GATA CT, TTTTGGCCTTAAGTCTTTACCCCCCAC. To facilitate the structural and functional analysis of the trypsin promoters in Anopheles mosquitoes, we have analyzed the DNA regions flanking the trypsin genes of A. stephensi. We have isolated the genomic clones of two trypsin genes from A. stephensi. Sequence analysis allowed the identification of two genes named Astryp1 and Astryp3 for the sequence similarities with their A. gambiae homologues Antryp1 and Antryp3. The putative promoter proximal regions of Astryp1 and Astryp3 contained a sequence showing a high degree of similarity to the PTRE regions of A. gambiae trypsin genes (Fig. 1). The PTRE and 5′-Flk regions of Astryp1 and Astryp3 showed the same structural organization found in Antryp1. Sequence alignment of the upstream regions of A. aegypti trypsin genes (11Barillas-Mury C. Noriega F.G. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 241-246Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the corresponding region of anopheline genes revealed the presence of a DNA motif showing some homology to the PTRE. Similarly to what has been observed in A. gambiae, early and latetrypsin genes of A. aegypti differed for the distribution of potential GATA sites in front of the PTRE sequence. These findings indicated that early and late trypsin genes share a similar structural organization in the distribution and orientation of PTRE sequences near the TATA box thus suggesting the presence of a common transcription regulatory mechanism in anopheline species, possibly conserved in distantly related mosquitoes. To search for A. gambiae nuclear proteins selectively binding to the PTRE and its 5′-flanking sequence (5′-Flk) we have designed a series of double strand oligonucleotide probes that encompassed the PTRE and the 5′-Flk region of different early and late trypsin genes (Fig. 1). These probes were used in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from a collection of A. gambiae cell lines that have been recently developed (6Müller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Blass C. Kafatos F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11727-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The cell lines were employed in this study as an alternative to mosquito guts that proved not to represent a useful source of nuclear extracts for EMSA experiments. After dissecting thousands of A. gambiae guts, we could not recover suitable material to study DNA-protein interactions, possibly because of the low number of epithelial cells and the presence of high concentrations of activated proteases (12Müller H.M. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Parassitologia. 1993; 35 (suppl.): 73-76PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA experiments revealed that the nuclear extract of the larvae-derived A. gambiae Sua 4.0 cells contained factors forming two different complexes (A and B) with a probe spanning the PTRE of Antryp4 (T4 PTRE) (Fig.2 A). A single band that showed an electrophoretic mobility similar to complex A was also observed when incubating the same nuclear extracts with a probe encompassing 12 nucleotides upstream to Antryp4 PTRE (T4 5′-Flk) (Fig.2 A). Proteinase K treatment prevented the formation of complexes A and B thus demonstrating that the electrophoretic mobility shift of T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk were due to the presence of nuclear proteins that bound to these probes. To rule out the possibility that additional complexes were binding to target sites spanning across the PTRE and the 5′-Flk probes, we have carried out EMSAs using a probe that encompassed both sequences. This analysis revealed that no additional complexes bound to the PTRE and the 5′-flanking sequences of Antryp4 (data not shown). We have extended the search of factors binding to the PTRE to a vast repertoire of A. gambiae cell lines and S2 cells from D. melanogaster. Our results indicated that nuclear proteins from most of the A. gambiae cell lines with the exception of Sua 5.0 and Sua 5B showed a binding pattern to T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk similar to that observed with Sua 4.0 cells (Fig. 2 B).D. melanogaster S2 nuclear extracts formed a complex showing an electrophoretic motility similar to complex B. Nuclear extracts from Sua 5.0 and Sua 5B cells formed with the T4 PTRE probe only complex A and complex B, respectively. Moreover, nuclear extract from the A. aegypti cell line MOS 20 incubated with a probe encompassing both PTRE and 5′-Flk motifs formed two complexes showing the electrophoretic mobility of complex A and complex B of A. gambiae cells (not shown). These findings would indicate that the expression of the two complexes is not ubiquitous and can be independently regulated. These experiments also provided the rationale to employ Sua 4.0, Sua 5.0, and Sua 5B cells for further analyzing the transcriptional activity of complex A and B on promoter constructs. To investigate the specificity of the interaction between nuclear proteins and the T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk probes, we carried out EMSA experiments in the presence of different competitor oligonucleotides. The binding of Sua 4.0 nuclear proteins to T4 PTRE was abolished by the presence of an excess of the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide. A mutated T4 PTRE probe, carrying two nucleotide substitutions at position 3 and 9 (G3C9), was unable to inhibit the formation of complex A and B (Fig.3 A); accordingly, nuclear extracts of Sua 4.0 cells failed to bind to this probe. Interestingly, an excess of unlabeled T4 5′-Flk oligonucleotide efficiently inhibited the formation of complex A with T4 PTRE, whereas complex B was not affected. Similarly, the formation of complex A with the T4 5′-Flk probe was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 A), thus indicating that complex A proteins could bind to both T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk probes. These experiments also showed that complex B differed from complex A in terms of size and DNA sequence specificity. To map exactly the nucleotide residues forming the binding sites of complex A and B within the PTRE sequence, we carried out EMSAs using a series of oligonucleotides that contained point mutations in each of the 12 residues of T4 PTRE. The mutated probes were incubated with nuclear extracts of Sua 4.0 and Sua 5.0 cells. Mutations in the residues spanning the TATCA motif either reduced or abolished the ability of the oligonucleotides to form complex B with nuclear extracts of Sua 4.0 cells. The formation of complex A with Sua 4.0 nuclear extracts was severely impaired by mutations in any of the 12 residues of the PTRE sequence (Fig. 3 B). When using Sua 5.0 extracts, which lacked complex B, some differences could be detected in the binding of complex A to the mutated probes (Fig. 3 B). Substitutions in the residues 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11 completely inhibited the formation of complex A with the PTRE, whereas mutations at the other positions still allowed a reduced binding to occur. Sequence comparison revealed that most of these residues form a motif (ATCANTNA) that is present in both the PTRE and 5′-Flk regions of Antryp4 thus providing the basis for understanding the binding of complex A to both T4 PTRE and T4 5′-Flk. Competition experiments using mutated T4 5′-Flk oligonucleotides confirmed that the ATCA sequence is implicated in the formation of complex A with the 5′-Flk region (data not shown). The identification of complex B-binding site revealed that this complex had the binding specificity of GATA transcription factors (13Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this property further, we have analyzed the ability of Sua 4.0 nuclear extracts to bind to a probe (h-GATA) designed to encompass a sequence of the human porphobilinogen deaminase promoter. This probe contained a GATA site (14Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and flanking sequences totally unrelated to the PTRE region. Our results indicated that the h-GATA probe formed with nuclear extracts of Sua 4.0 cells a single complex that showed the electrophoretic mobility of complex B and was competed by an excess of T4 PTRE and T2 5′-Flk, (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the h-GATA oligonucleotide selectively competed the binding of complex B to T4 PTRE (Fig. 4 B), whereas oligonucleotides either lacking a GATA sequence (T4 5′-Flk) or containing mutations in this motif (h-GATA-CT) had no effect (Fig. 4, A and B). While the PTRE showed little sequence variation among the trypsin genes, the 5′-Flk sequences significantly differed in the early and late trypsin genes for the presence of additional GATA sites. This observation prompted us to compare the PTRE and the 5′-Flk sequence of early (Antryp4) and late (Antryp1 and 2) trypsin genes for their binding pattern to nuclear extracts of Sua 4.0 cells (Fig. 5). Our results indicated that the PTRE and the 5′-Flk probes of Antryp1 and Antryp2 efficiently bound to complex B which is in agreement with the presence of palindromic GATA sites in the 5′-Flk sequences of the late trypsin promoters. The T2 Ups probe, encompassing a sequence immediately upstream to the 5′-Flk of T2, showed a strong binding to complex B, whereas the corresponding T1 Ups probe that lacked a GATA sequence did not bind to any factor (Fig. 5). The binding of complex A to the T1 and T2 5′-Flk and T2 PTRE probes was detectable but weak (Fig.7).Figure 7Transient transfection of Sua 4.0, 5B, and MOS 20 cells with constructs containing mutations in the Antryp4 PTRE region.

https://openalex.org/W2060471476,"In human, germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb) predispose individuals to retinoblastoma, whereas somatic inactivation of Rb contributes to the progression of a large spectrum of cancers. In mice, Rb is highly expressed in restricted cell lineages including the neurogenic, myogenic, and hematopoietic systems, and disruption of the gene leads to specific embryonic defects in these tissues. The symmetry between Rb expression and the defects in mutant mice suggest that transcriptional control of Rb during embryogenesis is pivotal for normal development. We have initiated studies to dissect the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of Rb during development by promoter lacZtransgenic analysis. DNA sequences up to 6 kilobase pairs upstream of the mouse Rb promoter, isolated from two different genomic libraries, directed transgene expression exclusively to the developing nervous system, excluding skeletal muscles and liver. Expression of the transgene in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the retina, recapitulated the expression of endogenous Rb during embryogenesis. A promoter region spanning ∼250 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional starting site was sufficient to confer expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems. To determine whether this expression pattern was conserved, we isolated the human Rb 5′ genomic region and generated transgenic mice expressing lacZ under control of a 1.6-kilobase pair human Rb promoter. The human Rb promoter lacZ mice also expressed the transgene primarily in the nervous system in several independent lines. Thus, transgene expression directed by both the human and mouse Rb promoters is restricted to a subset of tissues in which Rb is normally expressed during embryogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that regulatory elements directing Rb expression to the nervous system are delineated within a well defined core promoter and are regionally separated from elements, yet to be identified, that are required for expression of Rb in the developing hematopoietic and skeletal muscle systems.

Bremner R. Jiang Z. Gill R.M. Muncaster M. Sopta M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 115-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rb was subsequently found to be frequently inactivated in human cancers either by mutations in the gene itself or by alterations in upstream factors that control the activity of the protein (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4309) Google Scholar). During most of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, hypo-phosphorylated Rb inhibits progression into S phase by forming specific complexes with certain transcription factors. One of the main partners of Rb, E2F1, regulates expression of genes required for the transition into S phase and DNA synthesis (3Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signals are propagated through the G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, which phosphorylate and inactivate Rb, thereby allowing progression into S phase (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar). Differentiation signals inhibit the G1 cyclins and associated cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby maintaining Rb in the under-phosphorylated, active state. Active Rb is required for permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle and suppression of cell death during the onset of differentiation (5Morgenbesser S.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 6Lee E.Y.-H.P. Hu N. Yuan S.-S.F. Cox L.A. Bradley A. Lee W.-H. Herrup K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that under-phosphorylated Rb can interact with differentiation factors such as MyoD and myogenin during myogenesis (8Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ during adipogenesis (9Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H.

Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Another major mechanism of regulation of Rb is at the transcriptional level. Although initial analysis indicated that Rb is ubiquitously expressed in adult mouse tissues (11Bernards R. Schackleford G.M. Gerber M.R. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Schartl M. Bogenmann E. Rapaport J.M. McGee T. Dryja T.P. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6474-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), subsequent studies revealed that Rb is up-regulated during differentiation of various cell types in vitro (12Coppola J.A. Lewis B.A. Cole M.D. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1731-1733PubMed Google Scholar, 13Slack R.S. Hamel P.A. Bladon T.S. Gill R.M. McBurney M.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1585-1591PubMed Google Scholar). By using in situ hybridization analysis, we have shown (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that levels of Rb transcripts are temporally and spatially regulated during embryogenesis. High expression of Rb is restricted to a subset of tissues during development including the nervous system, hematopoiesis, skeletal muscles, and lens. The pattern of Rb expression correlates very well with the phenotype of Rb mutant mice. Rb knockout mice die at embryonic day 13–14 with specific defects in cell cycle exit, cell survival, and terminal differentiation during neurogenesis, hematopoiesis, and lens development (15Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 16Lee E.Y.H.P. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C.J. Lai C.C. Herrup K.

Nature. 1992; 359: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). A defect in terminal myogenesis was also observed in Rb mutant embryos partially rescued to birth by a Rb minigene composed of the mouse Rb promoter and Rb cDNA (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Jiang, Z., Liang, P., Leng, R., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Bubnic, S., Keating, A., Murray, D., Goss, P. E., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000)Dev. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the mouse Rb minigene only suppresses the Rb−/− neurogenic defects, a human Rb minigene could completely rescue the Rb−/− phenotype (16Lee E.Y.H.P. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7342-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The correlation between Rb expression and the phenotypes of Rb mutant embryos suggests the existence of a mechanism that ensures that Rb is expressed in the appropriate tissues when cells receive signals to exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate. Analysis of transcriptional regulation of Rb during embryogenesis may unravel this developmental program. Here, we initiated studies to dissect the transcriptional regulation of Rb during embryogenesis. We show that two independent DNA segments containing the mouse Rb promoter can direct expression of a linked reporter gene, lacZ, to the nervous system, excluding the myogenic and hematopoietic systems. A region of ∼250 bp upstream of the transcription starting site is sufficient to confer lacZ expression during neurogenesis in the central and peripheral nervous systems including the retina. Transgene expression under control of the human Rb promoter was also detected primarily in the nervous system in most transgenic lines. These findings delineate the promoter region required for expression of Rb during neurogenesis and indicate that different mechanisms, yet to be defined, govern Rb expression during hematopoiesis and skeletal myogenesis. A genomic phage library, generated in λFixII from mouse 129/sv DNA (purchased from Stratagene), was screened by plaque lift hybridization, using nylon membranes (DuPont) as recommended by the manufacturer. A BglII-SfiI fragment from the mouse Rb promoter was used as a probe. A recombinant phage, λ-129-1, was plaque-purified, and the phage DNA was extracted using Qiagen phage DNA kit. The physical map of λ-129-1 was determined by multiple digestions with restriction enzymes. A 6-kb NotI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript, yielding pmRb(Not-Not), and the sequence of the core promoter and the 5′-CR was determined using specific primers designed based on the sequence of the mouse Rb promoter (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A human placenta genomic library (purchased fromCLONTECH) was screened with a 455-bp non-GC region from the human genomic Rb promoter as a probe (21Hong F.D. Huang H.J. To H. Young L.J. Oro A. Bookstein R. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5502-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. Zhe J. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar), and several recombinant phages were isolated and purified. A 4.5-kb BamHI fragment containing the human promoter region was identified by Southern blot of BamHI-digested recombinant phage and was subcloned into pBluescript (phRb.B-B). This BamHI fragment includes 2-kb human Rb promoter and approximately 2.5 kb of the first exon and part of the first intron. Physical mapping and DNA sequencing verified that this DNA fragment contained the human Rb promoter. To create lacZ transgenic constructs, we generated a plasmid pEZ25/26, a derivative of pBluescript, in which the SacI-KpnI linker of pBS was replaced by a linker with following sites: SpeI, XhoI,NotI, NcoI, BamHI, SpeI. The NotI site, located at the N terminus of lacZin this construct, pEZ25/26, is in frame with the NotI and EagI sites in the mouse and human Rb promoters, respectively. A lacZ-SV40 poly(A) cassette was introduced between the NcoI and BamHI sites yielding pEZ25/26.lacZ. To create mRbP(L).lacZ, a 4.5-kb Rb promoter region, previously isolated from mouse L-cell genomic library (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned from the recombinant phage into pEZ25/26.lacZ. To create pmRbP.(129).lacZ, the NotI fragment from pmRb(Not-Not) was subcloned into a NotI-linearized pEZ25/26.lacZ. The SfiI deletion was made by cutting with SfiI (50 °C) followed by XhoI (at 37 °C), blunt ending with Klenow, and re-ligation. To create hRbP.lacZ, an XhoI-EagI fragment was purified from phRb.B-B and subcloned into XhoI- plus NotI-digested pEZ25/26.lacZ. Transgene plasmid DNA was purified on Qiagen midi-columns. COS7 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% serum in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium-phosphate method, as described (24Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Hei Y. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after transfection, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and treated with X-gal solution as described (25Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Intensive X-gal staining confined primarily to the cytoplasm was observed microscopically within 1–2 h. To release the insert DNA fragments, pmRbP(L).lacZ, pmRbP(129).lacZ, and pmRbP.Δsfi.lacZ were digested with SpeI and phRbP.lacZ with BamHI. The DNA inserts were extracted from agarose gels with a Qiagen kit and further purified on Elutip-D columns (Schleicher & Schuell) from Xymotech. Microinjection of DNA and generation of chimeric mice were done in the transgenic mouse facilities at the Hospital for Sick Children and the Ontario Cancer Institute. Transgenic mice were initially identified by Southern blot hybridization and later genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. lacZ was amplified with a forward primer EZ74 (5′ GTT CCG TCA TAG CGA TAA CG) and reverse primer EZ64 (5′ TCA ATC CGG TAG GTT TTC CG), yielding a polymerase chain reaction product of 649 bp. For timed pregnancy and embryo staging, the mornings of vaginal plug observations were considered as E0.5. Pregnant females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the embryos were retrieved and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min to 2 h depending on the developmental stage as described (25Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The embryos were washed several times in phosphate-buffered saline and treated overnight with X-gal solution as in Ref. 25Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. Stained embryos were photographed under a stereomicroscope (Leica). To identify internal organs, the embryos were dissected sagittally and examined microscopically. Some embryos were dehydrated, embedded, and sectioned at 20 μm. Sections were deparaffinized with xylenes, rehydrated with ethanol, counter-stained with eosin, dehydrated again, and mounted with Permount (Fisher). In situ hybridization analysis for Rb was performed as described (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Rb plasmid DNA was linearized with BglII, and 35S-labeled antisense riboprobe was prepared with T7 polymerase and used at 2 × 105 cpm/μl. Brains and carcasses were recovered from staged embryos. Nuclear preparation, chromatin digestion with DNase I, and DNA extraction were performed as described (26Ellis J. Tan-Un K.C. Harper A. Michalovich D. Yannoutsos N. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). DNA samples were further digested with SacI or BglII to detect the CP or 5′-CR, respectively, and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using dextran sulfate and GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes as recommended by the supplier (Dupont) as described (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). We previously described the isolation and in vitrocharacterization of a mouse Rb promoter region isolated from a mouse L-cell genomic library (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the expression pattern of the Rb promoter during embryogenesis, the promoter (L) was placed upstream of the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene, and five mRbP(L).lacZ transgenic founders were created (Fig.1 b; TableI). F1 transgenic males were then used to set up timed pregnancies with wild type females to obtain staged embryos. X-gal staining of E13.5 embryos revealed that three independent transgenic lines (mRbP(L).lacZ 19, 37, and 5) expressed the transgene exclusively in the nervous system (Fig. 1 and Table I). Two other lines, mRbP(L).lacZ 27 and 29 expressed the transgene in the nervous system as well as the skin (not shown, Table I). Whole mount and cross-section analysis of the mRbP(L).lacZ 19, 37 and 5 transgenic embryos revealed exclusive X-gal staining in the central (brain, spinal cord, Fig. 1 e, top) and peripheral (dorsal root ganglia, Fig. 1 e, bottom) nervous systems. X-gal staining was also detected in the follicles of vibrissae (Fig. 1 d) where endogenous Rb is normally expressed (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to endogenous Rb, no X-gal staining was detected in the liver or any muscle mass throughout embryogenesis (Fig. 1, c and e,top; Table I).Table IDifferential expression of endogenous Rb versus mouse and human Rb promoter transgenesLineCNSPNSRetinaVibraseaLiverMusclesOthersmRbP(L).lacZ 19++++−−− 37++++−−− 5++++−−− 27++++−−Skin 29++++−−SkinmRbP(129).lacZ 10++++−−− 2+++Variable−−− 1++LowLow−−−mRbPΔSfi.lacZ 3++LowHigh−−− 7+++Low−−− 16+++Low−SomeHeart, kidney, skinhRbP.lacZ 5LowLowLow−LowSomeID, PS, Int. 15LowLowHigh−−−− 22+++−−−Low heart, ID 7+++Low−SomeKidney, ID 21+++−−−Kidney, IDEndogenous Rb++++++IensExpression of endogenous Rb was determined by in situhybridization (Fig. 3 and see Ref. 14Jiang Z.

The expression pattern of the mRbP(L).lacZ transgenes is consistent with the phenotypes of the partially rescued mgRb:Rb−/− fetuses (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,18Jiang, Z., Liang, P., Leng, R., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Bubnic, S., Keating, A., Murray, D., Goss, P. E., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000)Dev. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 27Yule, L., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). In these fetuses, the neurogenic, but not hematopoietic, skeletal muscle and lens defects in Rb−/− embryos are rescued by an Rb minigene containing the same mouse Rb promoter (L) fused to the mouse Rb cDNA (Fig. 1 a). The mgRb:Rb−/− embryos survive to birth and exhibit aberrant myogenesis and other developmental defects, whereas the neurogenic phenotype is specifically suppressed (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Jiang, Z., Liang, P., Leng, R., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Bubnic, S., Keating, A., Murray, D., Goss, P. E., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000)Dev. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 27Yule, L., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). The specific expression of the mouse Rb promoter (L) in the nervous system could reflect the absence of essential regulatory elements for expression in other tissues. Alternatively, this promoter DNA from a mouse L-cell genomic library could harbor mutations, deletions, or rearrangements that might have disrupted important regulatory elements required for faithful expression of the transgene. To address these issues, we re-isolated the mouse Rb promoter region from a 129/sv-mouse tissue genomic library (Stratagene) (Fig.2 a). A 6-kb Rb promoter fragment from the recombinant phage was subcloned into a lacZ cassette, yielding mRbP(129).lacZ (Fig. 2 b), and three transgenic founders mRbP(129).lacZ 1, 2, and 10 were created (Table I). Whole mount X-gal staining revealed that the three independent transgenic lines expressed lacZ exclusively in the nervous system, excluding the liver and skeletal muscles, in a manner that was indistinguishable from the mRbP(L).lacZ lines (Fig. 2,c versus d and e; TableI). The initial X-gal analysis was performed at E13.5 when endogenous Rb expression is maximal (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine the temporal expression pattern of the mRbP(129).lacZ transgene during embryogenesis, embryos were collected from E9.5 to E17.5 and subjected to whole mount X-gal staining followed by cross-section analysis. The patterns of X-gal staining were then compared with endogenous Rb expression at similar developmental stages as detected by in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 3). This comparison revealed that independent mRbP(129).lacZ lines expressed lacZ in the nervous system in a pattern that recapitulated the expression of endogenous Rb during neurogenesis. Specifically, both endogenous Rb and the mRbP.lacZ transgenes were expressed in the developing neural tube and brain folds, the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, other cranial nerves, and the ganglion layer of the retina (Fig. 3 and Table I). Even in younger or older embryos, there was no evidence of X-gal staining in the liver and skeletal muscles where Rb is normally expressed, suggesting that regulatory regions required for expression of Rb in these tissues are located outside the first 6 kb of the mouse Rb promoter. We next sought to identify regulatory DNA sequences that might be involved in controlling Rb expression during neurogenesis. The mouse Rb core promoter (CP) is located about 200 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and overlaps the major transcription starting site (Fig.4 a) (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). The human and mouse Rb core promoter sequences are virtually identical (21Hong F.D. Huang H.J. To H. Young L.J. Oro A. Bookstein R. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5502-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). They both lack characteristic TATA and CAAT elements and contain consensus-binding sites for Sp1, ETS, ATF, and E2F (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sowa Y. Shiio Y. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. Okuyama Y. Kato D. Inoue J. Sawada J. Goto M. Watanabe H. Handa H. Sakai T.

Nature. 1991; 353: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis in vitro (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the Sp1, ETS, and ATF consensus sites are positively required for expression, whereas the E2F site functions as a negative element in some cellular contexts (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). Since many regulated genes contain upstream enhancers that control spatial expression, we searched the human and mouse upstream DNA sequences for the presence of conserved homologous regions. We identified a 5′-conserved region (5′-CR) at nucleotides −1545 to −1465 in human and −1141 to −1065 in the mouse (Fig.4 a). The 5′-CR contains potential binding sites for bHLH and MYB factors within two sequential regions that share 32/40 and 23/23 nucleotide identity in human and mice. In addition, there are clusters of bHLH- and GATA-binding sites and an NFκB/REL site around both 5′-CRs, which are not embedded in conserved regions but are found both in human and mouse (Fig. 4 a). The binding of transcription factors to promoters and enhancer elements is accompanied by destabilization of the chromatin, and this can experimentally be visualized as increased sensitivity to certain enzymes such as DNase I (26Ellis J. Tan-Un K.C. Harper A. Michalovich D. Yannoutsos N. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31Elgin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the chromatin around the conserved regions in the Rb promoter is in open conformation, we examined the presence of DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites around the mouse Rb promoter during embryogenesis. A strong HS region was found in the CP in brain and carcass tissues from E13.5 (Fig. 4, b–d) and E17.5 (not shown) embryos. This region consisted of a major HS band corresponding to the CP as well as two smaller HS fragments, indicating the presence of destabilized nucleosomal regions within and immediately upstream of the CP (Fig.4 d). Two additional bands of ∼1.5–2.5 kb were identified, suggesting the existence of HS sites within the first intron of Rb. In contrast, analysis of the 5′-CR and upstream DNA sequences revealed no obvious HS regions in chromatin extracted from E13.5–E17.5 brain tissues (data not shown). A very faint signal in the predicted location of the 5′-CR was detected in nuclei isolated from carcasses of E13.5 embryos (data not shown). Thus, the main HS region in the Rb promoter appears to surround the CP; the 5′-CR may be important for certain cell lineages in carcasses or other embryonic or adult tissues. The presence of multiple HS sites around the Rb core promoter but not at the 5′-CR, suggested that the core promoter alone may direct transgene expression to the nervous system, independently of the 5′-CR. To examine this possibility directly, we generated a deletion construct, mRbΔSfi.lacZ, in which the 5′-CR and most upstream DNA sequences were removed (Fig.5 a). Five mRbΔSfi.lacZ transgenic founders were generated, three of which expressed the transgene (numbers 3, 7, and 16). The mRbΔSfi.lacZ 16 transgene was expressed in the nervous system as well as other tissues such as isolated groups of muscles and the heart (Table I). In contrast, both mRbΔSfi.lacZ 3 and 7 lines expressed lacZ only in the nervous system in a pattern that appeared identical to mRbP(129).lacZ and mRbP(L).lacZ transgenic mice (Fig. 5, b–i). At various developmental stages, the mRbΔSfi.lacZ 3 and 7 transgenes were detected in the central and peripheral nervous systems, follicles of vibrissae, and retina but not in liver, skeletal muscles, or other tissues (Fig. 5, b–i). Thus, the Rb 5′-CR is dispensable for expression in the nervous system, and a segment of 450 bp encompassing the Rb core promoter contains all the regulatory elements required to direct Rb expression to the central and peripheral nervous systems during embryogenesis. We note that the relative levels of transgene expression within the nervous system varied among and within several lines. For example, mRbΔSfi.lacZ 7 showed weak expression in the follicles of vibrissae, whereas mRbΔSfi.lacZ 3 was highly expressed in this tissue (Fig. 5,c and i); within the mRb(129).lacZ 10 line, some embryos exhibited intense staining in the vibrissae, whereas other embryos, in the same litter, showed little expression (Table I and data not shown). The exclusive expression pattern of the mRbP.lacZ transgenes in the nervous system (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and 5) is consistent with our observation that the mouse Rb minigene can only rescue the neurogenic defect of Rb−/− mutant embryos (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Jiang, Z., Liang, P., Leng, R., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Bubnic, S., Keating, A., Murray, D., Goss, P. E., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000)Dev. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 27Yule, L., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, a human Rb minigene consisting of a 1.6-kb human Rb promoter region, linked to the human Rb cDNA, completely rescues the Rb−/− lethal defect (16Lee E.Y.H.P. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C.J. Lai C.C. Herrup K. Lee W.H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) and induces dwarfism in transgenic mice (32Bignon Y.J. Chen Y. Chang C.Y. Riley D.J. Windle J.J. Mellon P.L. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1654-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that unlike the mouse counterpart, the human Rb promoter may either direct expression to all the tissues where Rb is normally expressed or that the human promoter transgene is dysregulated in the mouse, directing ubiquitous expression to many tissues at levels sufficient to rescue the Rb−/− lethal defect. To test these possibilities directly, we isolated the human Rb promoter from a normal human placental genomic library (Fig.6 a). A 1.6-kb BamHI-EagI segment containing the human Rb promoter was transferred to a lacZ cassette yielding hRbP.lacZ (Fig. 6 b). This construct is similar to the human Rb minigene that was used to rescue the Rb−/− defect (32Bignon Y.J. Chen Y. Chang C.Y. Riley D.J. Windle J.J. Mellon P.L. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1654-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the hRbP.lacZ minigene utilizes an SV40 polyadenylation signal (Fig.6 b), whereas the human Rb minigene contains a β-globin cassette at the 3′ end (32Bignon Y.J. Chen Y. Chang C.Y. Riley D.J. Windle J.J. Mellon P.L. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1654-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Five transgenic hRbP.lacZ lines were established, and the expression patterns of lacZ were determined during embryogenesis (Fig.6, c—m, and Table I). Three of these transgenic lines (numbers 7, 21, and 22) exhibited X-gal staining primarily in the nervous system like the mRbP.lacZ lines (Fig. 6, c–i). The 21 and 7 lines also exhibited some expression in the kidney, and number 22 was expressed at low level in the heart. The hRbP.lacZ 15 line exhibited high level of expression in the retina and low levels in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Table I). The hRbP.lacZ line 5 was expressed in the spinal cord, the cartilage of palate shelf, intervertebral disks, intestines. and isolated groups of skeletal muscles (Fig. 6, j—m, and data not shown). The expression pattern of hRbP.lacZ 5 may represent activation of cryptic elements in the human Rb promoter at some integration sites. In addition to the hRbP.lacZ 5, three other lines, 7, 21, and 22, expressed lacZ in the intervertebral disc (ID, Fig.6 f, and Table I). As shown in Fig. 6 n, endogenous Rb transcripts were also detected, although at relatively low levels, in the intervertebral disks. The relax expression patterns of the hRbP.lacZ mice compared with the tight expression of the mRbP.lacZ lines in the nervous system may point to some differences in the levels of expression of the human and mouse Rb genes in certain tissues. Alternatively, this discrepancy may reflect partial dysregulation of the human promoter in mouse tissues. Importantly, four of five hRbP.lacZ lines directed transgene expression primarily to the nervous system but not the liver and skeletal muscles where endogenous Rb is highly expressed. Thus, both the human and mouse Rb core promoters evolved to direct Rb expression to the nervous system. Other, yet to be defined, regulatory elements, located outside the first 6 kb upstream of the Rb core promoter, may be required for expression of Rb during hematopoiesis and skeletal myogenesis. Although Rb is expressed in all adult tissues (11Bernards R. Schackleford G.M. Gerber M.R. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Schartl M. Bogenmann E. Rapaport J.M. McGee T. Dryja T.P. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6474-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the gene is highly expressed only in a subset of cell lineages during development (Fig. 3, e, g, and i) (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The correlation between Rb expression and the spectrum of developmental defects in Rb null mice suggests the existence of a mechanism that coordinates the expression of Rb during embryogenesis with the onset of terminal differentiation in certain tissues. We initiated a transgenic analysis, described herein, with the goal of defining the regulatory regions that control Rb expression during embryogenesis and elucidating this developmental program. We found that mouse Rb promoter DNA sequences up to 6 kb in length directed transgene expression exclusively to the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the developing retina. Our results suggest that regulatory regions required for expression of Rb in the liver and skeletal muscles where Rb is normally expressed may be physically separated from regulatory elements that control Rb expression in the nervous system. This regulatory arrangement, also found in other genes (33Lehman D.A. Patterson B. Johnston L.A. Balzer T. Britton J.S. Saint R. Edgar B.A. Development. 1999; 126: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar), is consistent with the notion that an ancestor Rb might have initially evolved to exert neurogenic functions and was later recruited by other tissues that acquired appropriate regulatory elements elsewhere in the Rb locus. The regulatory DNA sequences required for transcription of Rb in the liver, lens, and skeletal muscles may be located in other genomic regions surrounding the Rb gene. Alternatively, the 3′-UTR of Rb may control the stability of the Rb message in the liver, lens, and skeletal muscles. Arguably, the Rb promoter contains all the necessary regulatory elements, but the lacZ cassette suppresses the Rb promoter specifically in the liver, lens, and skeletal muscles but not in the nervous system. We consider this possibility unlikely because mouse Rb promoter minigenes, containing the Rb cDNA rather than lacZ, are also expressed exclusively in the nervous system and specifically rescue the neurogenic but not hematopoietic skeletal muscle and lens defects in Rb−/− embryos (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Jiang, Z., Liang, P., Leng, R., Guo, Z., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Bubnic, S., Keating, A., Murray, D., Goss, P. E., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000)Dev. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 27Yule, L., and Zacksenhaus, E. (2000) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). We previously thought that the expression pattern of these Rb minigenes reflected the differential stability in different tissues of the human growth hormone cassette at the 3′ end of the Rb minigene (Fig. 1 a). The present study indicates that the Rb promoter dictates this expression pattern. Since the Rb promoter directs expression exclusively to the nervous system, the mgRb:Rb−/− fetuses can be viewed as null for Rb in tissues other than the nervous system. As the Rb minigene can rescue the mid-gestation death of Rb−/− embryos, but is only expressed in the nervous system but not the hematopoietic system, it is tempting to speculate that Rb−/− embryos die at E13.5–E14.5 due to a neurogenic rather than hematopoietic deficiency. In addition to the 4.5-kb Rb minigene (Fig. 1 a), another Rb minigene capable of partially suppressing the Rb−/− defect contains a 1.3-kb mouse Rb promoter region and the first intron of Rb (7Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since this minigene could also only rescue the Rb−/− neurogenic defect, it is unlikely that the regulatory elements required for expression of Rb in liver, lens, and muscles are located in the first intron. Thus, the HS sites detected in the first intron of Rb (Fig. 4, b and c) may not be important for expression in these tissues. To identify the regulatory elements required for expression of Rb during hematopoiesis, skeletal myogenesis, and lens development, large DNA segments 20–40 kb upstream of the Rb CP, the 3′-UTR, and downstream sequences will have to be subject to DNase I HS and transgenic analysis. In contrast to the mouse minigenes, which only partially rescue the Rb−/− embryonic defect, a human Rb minigene consisting of a similar promoter DNA segment used in our study can completely rescue the Rb defect (16Lee E.Y.H.P. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C.J. Lai C.C. Herrup K. Lee W.H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 20Riley D.J. Liu C.Y. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7342-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between these observations is not clear but may be attributed to different 3′-UTR used in the two studies or to the widespread, deregulated, expression of the human Rb transgene in some transgenic lines (Fig. 6, j–m), which might be sufficient for phenotypic rescue of the Rb−/− defect. Recently, transgenic mice expressing N-terminal deletions of Rb under control of the human Rb promoter were found to rescue the neurogenic but not skeletal or hematopoietic defects of Rb−/− mutant embryos (16Lee E.Y.H.P. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C.J. Lai C.C. Herrup K. Lee W.H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 20Riley D.J. Liu C.Y. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7342-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), yielding a phenotype similar to the mgRb:Rb−/− fetuses. It would be interesting to determine the expression of the N-terminal Rb mutants in the liver and muscles relative to the nervous system. It is somehow puzzling that the highly conserved 5′ region, 5′-CR, is not involved in transcriptional activation as determined by transgenic and DNase I-hypersensitive analyses. The 5′-CR may, however, communicate with upstream or downstream elements and assist in expression of Rb in some specific cell lineages or adult tissues. We delineated the region required for mouse Rb transgene expression during neurogenesis to 250 bp upstream of the transcription starting site. This region contains several consensus-binding sites including an E2F site that functions as a negative element in vitro (23Zacksenhaus E. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2343-2351PubMed Google Scholar). This E2F site may allow autoregulation by Rb or cross-regulation by p107 (and/or p130). The latter possibility is attractive considering the almost mutually exclusive expression patterns of Rb and p107 during embryogenesis (14Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the core promoter (RbPΔSfi) is sufficient to direct transgene expression to the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as the retina (Fig. 5). Inactivation of the Rb promoter by methylation or specific mutations has been implicated in the initiation of retinoblastoma (19Sakai T. Toguchida J. Ohtani N. Yandell D.W. Rapaport J.M. Dryja T.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 880-888PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sakai T. Ohtani N. McGee T.L. Robbins P.D. Dryja T.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that perhaps similar alterations may also suppress transcription of the Rb gene in other neuronal tissues. Although several transcription factors were shown to bind the Rb core promoter in certain tissues, the neurogenic factors that control the expression of Rb during development are not known. Future experiments should allow us to identify the cis-elements and the corresponding factors that control Rb expression in the retina, the central, and peripheral nervous systems and study their effects on expression of Rb in the contexts of normal development as well as neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2152871735,"The adenovirus DNA-binding protein (DBP) binds cooperatively to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and stimulates both initiation and elongation of DNA replication. DBP consists of a globular core domain and a C-terminal arm that hooks onto a neighboring DBP molecule to form a stable protein chain with the DNA bound to the internal surface of the chain. This multimerization is the driving force for ATP-independent DNA unwinding by DBP during elongation. As shown by x-ray diffraction of different crystal forms of the C-terminal domain, the C-terminal arm can adopt different conformations, leading to flexibility in the protein chain. This flexibility is a function of the hinge region, the part of the protein joining the C-terminal arm to the protein core. To investigate the function of the flexibility, proline residues were introduced in the hinge region, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity after baculovirus expression. The mutant proteins were still able to bind ss- and double-stranded DNA with approximately the same affinity as wild type, and the binding to ssDNA was found to be cooperative. All mutant proteins were able to stimulate the initiation of DNA replication to near wild type levels. However, the proline mutants could not support elongation of DNA replication efficiently. Even the elongation up to 26 nucleotides was severely impaired. This defect was also seen when DNA unwinding was studied. Binding studies of DBP to homo-oligonucleotides showed an inability of the proline mutants to bind to poly(dA)40, indicating an inability to adapt to specific DNA conformations. Our data suggest that the flexibility of the protein chain formed by DBP is important in binding and unwinding of DNA during adenovirus DNA replication.

Optimal replication efficiency is obtained when two cellular transcription factors are added, nuclear factor I (NFI) and Oct 1 (for reviews see Refs. 1Hay R.T. Freeman A. Leith I. Monaghan A.

The adenoviral dsDNA genome contains two terminal proteins (TP) covalently linked to the 5′ ends. The inverted terminal repeats contain the origins of replication. pTP and pol are tightly associated in solution. During initiation of replication pTP functions as a primer to which the first nucleotide, dCTP, is covalently coupled. Both NFI and Oct 1 stimulate the initiation by recruiting the pTP-pol complex to the origin of replication (4Bosher J. Robinson E.C. Hay R.T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chen M. Mermod N. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol.

After formation of a pTP-trinucleotide (pTP-CAT) (8King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the complex jumps back and CAT becomes paired with template residues 1–3. Shortly after jumping back, the polymerase dissociates from pTP and elongation proceeds via strand displacement (9King A.J. Teertstra W.R. van der Vliet P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24617-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DBP has several functions during the adenovirus life cycle. Besides DNA replication, the protein is involved in transcriptional control and mRNA stability (10Zijderveld D.C. d'Adda d.F. Giacca M. Timmers H.T. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8288-8295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cleghon V. Voelkerding K. Morin N. Delsert C. Klessig D.F. J.

Intervirology. 1974; 3: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), virion assembly (13Nicolas J.C. Sarnow P. Girard M. Levine A.J. Virology. 1983; 126: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and determination of the host range (14Anderson C.W. Hardy M.M. Dunn J.J. Klessig D.F. J.

DBP performs several functions in DNA replication. During initiation, it stimulates directly the formation of a pTP-CAT intermediate by lowering the Km value of the reaction (16Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), possibly via a direct interaction with the pTP-pol complex. Indirectly, DBP stimulates initiation by increasing the binding of NFI to the origin (17Lindenbaum J.O. Field J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cleat P.H. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1841-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Stuiver M.H. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 379-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of initiation by DBP is most pronounced at low pTP-pol concentrations, suggesting a role of DBP in recruitment of the pTP-pol complex to the origin. Furthermore, DBP plays an essential role during the elongation phase of DNA replication, where it helps to unwind the parental strand (20Zijderveld D.C. Stuiver M.H. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2591-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and enhances the processivity of the polymerase (17Lindenbaum J.O. Field J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved by cooperative binding to the displaced strand during replication, thereby protecting it from nuclease digestion and facilitating strand displacement. Strand displacement is ATP-independent and requires only the helix DNA unwinding activity of DBP, unlike helicase activity, which does require ATP (21Pronk R. Van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Monaghan A. Webster A. Hay R.T.

Finally, DBP enhances the renaturation of complementary displaced strands (20Zijderveld D.C. Stuiver M.H. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2591-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of DBP (amino acids 174–529, ΔN-DBP) has been solved (24Tucker P.A. Tsernoglou D. Tucker A.D. Coenjaerts F.E. Leenders H. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This region contains the DNA binding domain and is functional in in vitro assays (25Ariga H. Klein H. Levine A.J. Horwitz M.S. Virology. 1980; 101: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Friefeld B.R. Krevolin M.D. Horwitz M.S.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 188: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein is mainly globular except for the last 17 amino acids, which form a protruding arm. This C-terminal arm binds to a hydrophobic cleft of another DBP molecule, allowing protein chain formation which is essential for the function of DBP in elongation and cooperative binding on ssDNA as shown by deletion studies (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). A second crystal structure of ΔN-DBP has been described, which superimposes except for the C-terminal arm (Fig. 1) (29Kanellopoulos P.N. Tsernoglou D. van der Vliet P.C. Tucker P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of the last 17 amino acids of the crystal forms 1 and 2 demonstrates a difference in the arrangement of residues Asn512–Leu515, called the hinge region. Further investigations have revealed amino acids Asn512 and Ser514 to be responsible mainly for the conformational changes. The ability of the C-terminal arm to adopt several orientations suggests that the DBP protein chain is flexible and can adopt different arrangements. This effect could explain different estimations of the length of the binding sites found for different homopolynucleotides (29Kanellopoulos P.N. Tsernoglou D. van der Vliet P.C. Tucker P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. van der Vliet P.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4646-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we have studied the role of the flexibility of the C-terminal arm in ssDNA binding and DNA replication using DBP with mutations in the hinge region that are expected to lead to reduced flexibility. We find that the proline mutations severely impair the capability of DBP to sustain elongation and to unwind DNA, although protein chain formation is still possible. This indicates that flexibility of the protein chain is essential for its function, possibly by enabling adaptation to different DNA conformations. The hinge mutants were prepared by PCR in two steps from the adenovirus 5 ΔN-DBP (amino acids 174–529) gene (31Kanellopoulos P.N. van der Zandt H. Tsernoglou D. van der Vliet P.C. Tucker P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in the pVL1392 baculovirus vector. In the first step the 5′ primer was TTTAGATCTTCATGAGTGTGCCGATCGTGTCTGC and the 3′ primers were CGCGCATCGCTATGCGCCACTGGCAGGGACACGGGGCGATACT, CGCGCATCGCTATGCGCCACTGGCAGGGACAGGTTGCGATA, and CGCGCATCGCTATGCGCCACTGGCAGGGGAGGTGGGCGATACT for the N512P, V513L, and NVS512–514PPPmutants (changes in bold), respectively. In the second PCR step the generated PCR product was, in each case, annealed with the 3′ end of a common 3′ primer GGCACGAATTCTCAAAAATCAAAGGGGTTCTGCCGCGCATCGCTATGCGCCAC, and the DNA was amplified using the same 5′ primer as above. In each case the constructs were prepared by isolating, purifying, and annealing three DNA fragments as follows: (a) the pVL1392-ΔN-DBP vector processed with EagI (cleavage site at position 128) and opened 3′ with EcoRI; (b) this fragment further cut with BanI (cleavage site at position 897) to yield the EagI-BanI piece; and (c) the second PCR product digested with BanI andEcoRI. The third fragment (containing the mutations) was sequenced to check the correctness of the construct. ΔC-DBP (aa 174–511) was constructed and purified as described by Dekker et al. (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monolayers of SF9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at 28 °C for 72 h. The titer giving optimal protein expression levels was determined beforehand in pilot experiments. The purification of wild type and mutant DBP was as follows. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 followed by homogenizing using a Dounce homogenizer. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in DEAE buffer, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, to lower the salt concentration to 100 mm. The diluted supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-FF-Sepharose column equilibrated in DEAE buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The flow-through was applied to an ssDNA-cellulose column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl (ssDNA buffer). The column was washed in buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, and the protein was eluted with buffer containing 2 mNaCl. The protein was dialyzed to 100 mm against 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. To concentrate the protein, the solution was loaded on a MonoS1 FPLC column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, and 80 mm NaCl and developed with a linear gradient of 80–600 mm NaCl. The proteins eluted around 200 mm and were shown to be at least 95% homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. For the ssDNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a 114-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pHRI was Klenow end-labeled in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and denatured by boiling. The dsDNA assays were performed with a 50-nt dsDNA oligonucleotide (TD50), containing the first 50 base pairs of the Ad5 origin. Binding assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm DTT, 4% Ficoll, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.05 ng of denatured DNA or dsDNA, and the indicated amounts of ΔN-DBP or mutants. Bound and free DNAs were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. The running buffer contained 0.5 TBE and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Gels were dried and quantified using a PhosphorImager Storm 820 from Molecular Dynamics with ImageQuaNT 4.2a, Build 13 software. The concentration at which 50% of the ssDNA is complexed with DBP is used as a measure of the ssDNA binding affinity. A more accurate calculation as described by Verrijzer et al. (32Verrijzer C.P. Kal A.J. van der Vliet P.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was not possible since binding of DBP to ssDNA is cooperative and does not fit a normal Scatchard plot. DNA unwinding assays were performed using a partially double-stranded oligonucleotide consisting of the last 50 bases of the template strand of the adenoviral origin of replication, hybridized with an oligonucleotide containing the complementary bases 15–50 from the displaced strand, thereby creating a dsDNA oligonucleotide with a 3′ (template) 15-base pair single-stranded overhang. Both strands were 5′-labeled prior to hybridization. DNA (0.5 ng) and indicated amounts of DBP or mutant forms of DBP were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 25 μl in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm NaCl. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of 40% sucrose, 1.2% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and 0.1% xylene cyanol. Products were analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using a running buffer containing 1 TBE and 0.2% SDS. Gels were dried and quantified using a PhosphorImager. The pTP-pol complex was purified as described (8King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Terminal protein containing Ad5 DNA (TP-DNA) was obtained as described (33Dekker J. Coenjaerts F.E. van der Vliet P.C. Adoph K.W. Viral Genome Methods. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 269-282Google Scholar). Adenovirus DNA replication was performed in a final reaction volume of 25 μl in the presence of 25 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 500 nm [α-32P]dCTP, and 40 μmdATP, dTTP, and dGTP, and 30 ng of TP-DNA cut with XhoI. 140 ng of pTP-pol was added to the reaction. The amounts of ΔN-DBP and mutants are indicated in the legends. After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C reactions were stopped by addition of 2.8 μl of stop mix (40% sucrose, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Replication products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Gels were dried followed by autoradiography. Replication products were quantified by densitometric analysis using a PhosphorImager. Initiation of replication on TP-DNA was performed in a final reaction volume of 25 μl in the presence of 25 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 nm[α-32P]dCTP, 90 ng of Ad5 TP-DNA, and 50 ng of pTP-pol. When partial elongation was performed extra 1 μm dCTP, 1 μm dATP, 1 μm dTTP, and 5 μmddGTP together with 100 ng of pTP-pol and 26 nm[α-32P]dCTP were added. The amounts of ΔN-DBP and mutants are indicated in the legends. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for TP-DNA and at 30 °C when a synthetic oligonucleotide was used. After 45 min the reactions were stopped by addition of 80 mm EDTA. The samples were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. Precipitates were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, resolved in sample buffer, and analyzed on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Initiation products were quantified by densitometric analysis using a PhosphorImager. ΔN-DBP (wild type) and the mutants N512P (P-DBP), V513L (L-DBP), and NVS512–514PPP (PPP-DBP) were purified and assayed for their ability to bind to ss- and dsDNA as shown in Fig. 2. All proteins bound cooperatively to ssDNA resulting in fully saturated protein-DNA complexes without intermediate complexes (Fig. 2 A). Multiple intermediate complexes can be seen when ΔC-DBP was used in this assay (Fig. 2 B). ΔC-DBP lacks the C-terminal arm and is therefore not able to form multimers on ssDNA, resulting in the loss of cooperative binding (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To estimate the binding affinity, the concentration required to shift 50% of the probe was determined after quantification (Table I). All proteins bound to ssDNA with approximately wild type affinity. The slight differences in binding affinity for the different mutants are not significant in view of the scattering of the data around the 50% shift point.Table IBinding affinity of ΔN-DBP and mutants on ssDNAProteinProtein concentration at which 50% of DNA has shiftedςnmΔN-DBP0.150.07 (n = 7)L-DBP0.170.05 (n = 5)P-DBP0.230.06 (n = 5)PPP-DBP0.250.3 (n = 5) Open table in a new tab The binding of the mutants to a 50-base pair dsDNA probe is shown in Fig. 2 C. All three mutants were able to bind to dsDNA with wild type affinity. Binding to dsDNA is not cooperative for DBP, and therefore intermediate complexes can be found in this assay. We assume that the band with the slowest migration is fully saturated, whereas the fastest migrating band contains only 1 monomer. However, we have not studied the stoichiometry of the bands in detail. The lack of cooperativity also leads to a lower binding affinity that is reflected by the higher concentration of proteins needed to obtain a shifted complex (35Kuil M.E. van Amerongen H. van der Vliet P.C. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9795-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We tested the hinge mutants for their activity to support DNA replication in an in vitro assay, see Fig. 3 A. Ad5 DNA isolated from virus particles and containing the terminal protein was digested with XhoI and used as template. The reaction was carried out in the presence of pTP-pol, NFI, Oct 1, radiolabeled dNTPs, and increasing amounts of wild type or mutant DBP. Analysis of the products on agarose gels shows specific labeling of two restriction fragments, B and C, containing the origin of replication. In addition two labeled fragments migrating with higher mobility are observed which contain ssDNA. These originate from second rounds and further of displacement synthesis, indicative of effective template usage (Fig. 3 B). Quantitation of the total DNA replication activity, the 1st as well as further rounds together, was performed and compared for the 500 (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 14) and 1000 ng (4, 8, 12, and 15) lanes. P-DBP had a slightly lowered replication activity (4.2- to 1.1-fold), whereas PPP-DBP had a 100- to 50-fold decrease in activity and could hardly support any replication. L-DBP behaved wild type-like with a slight decrease in activity (1.4-fold) at 500 ng. The differences in activity are most prominent at low protein concentrations. To test whether the loss of activity for PPP-DBP is due to the presence of inhibitors in the protein solution, a control was performed by mixing in PPP-DBP in a ΔN-DBP replication (lane 18). Inhibition of DNA replication was not detected. Lane 17, the negative control (no DBP), contains some background bands, caused by aspecific labeling of all XhoI TP-DNA fragments not related to protein-primed replication. To test whether the observed decrease in replication efficiency is due to reduced initiation levels, an initiation assay was performed. The first step in initiation is the covalent coupling of dCTP to the pTP of the pTP-pol complex. This reaction is enhanced considerably by DBP when the pTP-pol concentration is low (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) A low amount of pTP-pol (50 ng) was incubated together with TP-DNA and dCTP. The stimulation of pTP-C formation was determined for two DBP concentrations (250 and 500 ng) (Fig. 4 A). Without DBP only a low level of initiation was observed (1%). L-DBP and P-DBP stimulated the initiation like wild type with activities ranging from 86 to 116%. For a quantitation see Fig. 4 A. The stimulation by PPP-DBP was slightly lower (25–36%) but was still considerable. To distinguish between defects during the initiation and elongation phase, we performed a partial elongation. This leads to the formation of a pTP-CAT initiation intermediates (8King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as a pTP-26 nucleotide product indicative of early elongation (Fig. 4 B). The elongation to initiation ratio was calculated after quantitation (Fig. 4 B). This ratio is indicative of the ability to stimulate the elongation by DBP. Whereas ΔN-DBP as well as L-DBP and P-DBP were all able to stimulate elongation efficiently, PPP-DBP was deficient indicating that stimulation of elongation is already inhibited at an early stage of elongation. The pTP-CAT formation is slightly stimulated by all mutant DBPs, but the absolute rate of stimulation is lower that in Fig. 4 A, due to the higher pTP-pol (100 ng) concentration, and for PPP-DBP the increase is minimal as this mutant is already less efficient stimulating initiation (Fig. 4 A). For ΔN-DBP the pTP-CAT formation decreases at the highest amount of protein (1000 ng), due to efficient elongation of this intermediate. For L- and P-DBP, however, no decrease in pTP-CAT formation was observed, presumably since higher protein concentrations are required for optimal stimulation of elongation by these mutants. A small band below the pTP-C and pTP-26n products was also observed, presumably due to degradation of pTP. During elongation, DBP destabilizes dsDNA and facilitates elongation of the DNA polymerase. The unwinding of dsDNA is ATP-independent and only DBP is required, cooperative binding of the DBP monomers to the displaced strand being the driving force (21Pronk R. Van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Monaghan A. Webster A. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 742-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Zijderveld D.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1158-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in unwinding will therefore result in diminished, or loss of, replication activity. An unwinding assay was performed with a partial duplex DNA (TD15) to investigate the unwinding activity of DBP and the hinge mutants (Fig. 5 A). The percentages of unwinding were calculated and presented in Fig. 5 B. All proteins were able to unwind TD15, but the activity of the hinge mutants was diminished as higher protein concentrations were required. The differences in unwinding activity were calculated from the slope of the curves. Most prominent was the decrease of unwinding activity for PPP-DBP (125-fold), whereas the reductions forl- and P-DBP were 1.25- and 23-fold, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The decrease in unwinding activity for PPP-DBP can account for the large decrease found in the DNA replication activity during the elongation phase. Both the unwinding and replication assays show large differences in activity for the hinge mutants, with L-DBP behaving like wild type, P-DBP having an intermediate effect, and PPP-DBP being most severely impaired. An explanation for these results could be that the flexibility of the C-terminal arm is gradually reduced. This could lead to a change in the multiprotein chain making adaptation to rigid or irregularly shaped DNA more difficult. To investigate this, we tested the proteins for binding to homo-oligonucleotides containing either 40 A, T, C, or G residues. Binding to poly(dT)40, (dC)40, and (dG)40 showed only small differences and are not shown. In contrast, P- and PPP-DBP are unable to bind to poly(dA)40 efficiently (Fig. 6). The highest concentration used in Fig. 6 was 40 ng for P- and PPP-DBP. No binding of P- and PPP-DBP could be found up to 1000 ng (data not shown). This suggests that reduction of the flexibility of the C-terminal arm can result in loss of the ability to bind particular sequences, possibly caused by the presence of aberrant secondary or tertiary structures in these homopolymers. The ss- and dsDNA binding capabilities of the hinge mutants were not significantly reduced. This is in contrast with deletion of the C-terminal arm (ΔC-DBP), which leads to a 100-fold reduction in ssDNA binding, whereas no change in dsDNA binding is detectable (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. van Oosterhout J.A. Stier G. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This has been explained by the lack of cooperativity in ΔC-DBP. Since the cooperative binding is not lost in the hinge mutants, this strongly suggests that the hinge mutants are still able to form multimers on DNA. Direct assays to test this (electron microscopy with negative staining and dynamic light scattering) were inconclusive perhaps due to aggregation problems. A small decrease in ssDNA binding was found for P- and PPP-DBP. A low resolution crystal structure of DBP complexed with ssDNA shows that although Asn512 approaches the DNA, it is unlikely to make any interaction with the phosphate backbone (31Kanellopoulos P.N. van der Zandt H. Tsernoglou D. van der Vliet P.C. Tucker P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rather than a loss of direct contacts, the slight decrease in binding affinity for ssDNA could be due to the reduced flexibility of the C-terminal arm. Possibly, the mutant protein chain is not able to adapt to certain secondary structures or conformations in the ssDNA strand as indicated by the inability to bind poly(dA) efficiently. P-DBP and, in particular, PPP-DBP have a reduced replication activity. No strong differences in stimulation of initiation were detected, and direct assays show that the main defect lies in elongation. This is in agreement with the reduced unwinding. A similar effect was observed upon deletion of the C-terminal arm (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like PPP-DBP, the ΔC-DBP mutant was still able to stimulate initiation with a slight reduction in efficiency while being unable to support replication or DNA unwinding. From this we have concluded earlier that oligomerization of DBP is the driving force of ATP-independent DNA unwinding during the elongation phase. Although this may be true, multimerization apparently is not the only requirement for DBP to function effectively in elongation. Previously we showed the need for an intact flexible loop located between aa Lys296 and aa Ser332 that ensures high affinity binding to ssDNA (34Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. van Oosterhout J.A. Stier G. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we suggest yet another requirement,i.e. the need for flexibility in the protein chain even in the presence of an intact flexible loop and multimerization What could be the function of the flexibility of the C-terminal arm during elongation and replication fork destabilization? We propose (Fig. 7) that reduction of the flexibility of the C-terminal arm leads to an inability to hook into a neighboring DBP molecule when bound to the replication fork. In particular we assume that a conformational change is required to accommodate the transition of DBP bound to the double-stranded parental strands to that when bound to the displaced single strand, which is situated at the ssDNA part of the replication fork. The high off rate of DBP on dsDNA coupled to an impairment of the transition will prevent unwinding at the replication fork. Why is multimerization possible when bound on single-stranded DNA and not in the replication fork? Presumably less mobility exists in the replication fork, compared with single-stranded DNA. As an addition to the model, binding of a less flexible DBP protein to the displaced strand could also lead to difficulties when AT tracts, hairpins, or other secondary DNA structures are encountered. This might be reflected by the problems in binding poly(dA) which has an aberrant structure and a different binding site for DBP (30van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. van der Vliet P.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4646-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35Kuil M.E. van Amerongen H. van der Vliet P.C. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9795-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The model might explain the lack of unwinding by hinge region mutants during elongation. This situation might also apply to the early stages of elongation. For stimulation of initiation DBP monomers suffice (28Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but even early in elongation multimerization is required. Although the conformation of the preinitiation complex and the changes occurring during transition of initiation to early elongation are unknown, we assume that the same flexibility of DBP is needed at this stage. Alternatively, we could envisage the dsDNA breathing and the irreversible steps that occur when DBP binds cooperatively to the part unwound by breathing to be slowed down with the mutants. However, we consider this to be less likely because this effect would mainly influence unwinding of long stretches of DNA, and we observe already a block in unwinding with a 35-bp probe. We thank R. N. de Jong, K. D. Augustijn, and A. B. Brenkman for critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2134375276,"The human lumican gene was shown to possess one major transcription start site, resulting in exon 1 of the gene giving rise to the first 74 base pairs (bp) of the 5′-untranslated region. About 1.6 kilobase pairs of upstream promoter sequence were sequenced and analyzed to identify elements responsible for gene expression. No typical TATAA sequence was identified in the vacinity of the transcription start site, but an atypical TATCA sequence residing 41 bp upstream was shown to be necessary for transcription, although it was incapable of supporting transcription by itself. A GC box residing 74 bp upstream of the transcription start site also was essential for the initiation of transcription. Sp3 was identified as the transcriptional activator binding to the GC box. No additional elements that significantly modulated transcription were noted in the promoter sequence analyzed, when using human adult chondrocytes as the cell source for transfection in reporter assays. In contrast, reporter assays carried out in human fetal lung fibroblasts, where lumican expression is deplete, revealed the presence of a repressor element located between 384 and 598 bp upstream of the transcription start site. A GATA-binding site located between bp −386 and −391 was identified as being necessary for repression of transcription. The mouse lumican promoter does not possess an equivalent site, and this may explain why the lumican gene is expressed in fetal murine cartilage but not in fetal human cartilage."
