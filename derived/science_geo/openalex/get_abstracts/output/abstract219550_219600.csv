A number of fluorescence-based studies suggested that these molecules cross the plasma membrane by an energy-independent process, directly gaining access to the cytoplasm. Recent reports have questioned this conclusion, attributing the prior observations to artifacts resulting from fixation procedures used to prepare cells for fluorescence microscopy. These studies analyzed live cells and showed that the peptides entered through endocytosis and accumulated in endocytic vesicles, without necessarily entering the cytoplasm. To resolve this controversy and to extend the analyses to non-natural β-peptide sequences, we studied the cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of a fluorescein-labeled 9-residue sequence derived from the human immunodeficiency virus transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide, TAT-(47–57), as well as a similarly labeled 12-residue β-peptide, β-(VRR)4, in live cells. Using fluorescence confocal microscopy, we show that when added to cells, both peptides are found in endocytic vesicles containing the transferrin receptor as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus (TAT-(47–57)) or nucleolus (β-(VRR)4). The cells were verified to be intact through all experimental procedures by demonstrating their ability to exclude propidium iodide. Endocytic entry of the peptides was blocked by the energy poisons sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose, whereas staining of the nucleus (nucleolus), but not endocytic vesicles, was abrogated by treating the cells with ammonium chloride. Our observations are consistent with the proposal that TAT-(47–57) and β-(VRR)4 enter cells by endocytosis and then exit an endosomal compartment to enter the cytoplasm by means of a mechanism requiring endosome acidification.

Delivery requires translocation of the peptide across the plasma membrane or an intracellular membrane of a living cell, a behavior that has been ascribed to arginine-rich peptides and related oligomers (22.Bogoyevitch M.A. Kendrick T.S.

The mechanism by which these highly charged peptides are able to translocate from the extracellular milieu into the cytoplasm and nucleus without breach of the plasma membrane permeability barrier is unknown. One possible translocation mechanism is direct transfer of the peptide across the plasma membrane by means of a reverse micelle, which would ensure that the peptide remains in a hydrophilic environment during membrane transit (1.Derossi D.

Although functional studies leave little doubt that TAT and Antp peptides can carry cargo into cells, resulting in a biological effect (23.Tung C.H. Weissleder R. Adv. Drug Deliv.

Ther. 2003; 8: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), recent reports have called into question the fluorescence-based methodologies that are commonly used to assess peptide translocation (25.Lundberg M.

Fluorescence microscopy studies of peptide translocation into the cytoplasm and nucleus have commonly involved exposing cells to the fluorescently tagged peptide of interest, washing to remove residual peptide, fixing the cells, and examining them via confocal fluorescence microscopy to determine intracellular peptide distribution (1.Derossi D.

In live cells that were shown to be impermeable to propidium iodide, TAT-(48–60) and R9 accumulated in vesicles containing known endocytic markers such as transferrin receptor and the lipophilic dye FM 4–64 but showed no fluorescence in the cytoplasm or nucleus (26.Richard J.P.

Studies conducted at low temperature or after depletion of cellular ATP with azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose showed no evidence of uptake, implying that the entry process is energy-dependent, as expected for endocytosis. Similar conclusions of endocytic uptake have been reported for peptide cargo conjugates such as TAT-green fluorescent protein (28.Lundberg M. Wikström S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and complexes such as fluorescein isothiocyanate-Avidin/TAT (29.Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). No cytoplasmic or nuclear staining was observed in either case. It has also been demonstrated that TAT-(44–57) and Antp-(43–58) are not able to translocate across liposomal membranes, providing further evidence for an energy-dependent pathway of internalization (30.Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31.Drin G. Cottin S. Blanc E. Rees A.R. Temsamani J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Endocytic uptake of Antp-(43–58) and SynB5, an analogue of protegrin 1, has also been reported (31.Drin G. Cottin S. Blanc E. Rees A.R. Temsamani J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31192-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These peptides were also unable to enter liposomes. A recent critical review of the literature supports an endocytic mechanism of basic peptide uptake (24.Leifert J.A. Whittion J.L. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, a report from Thorén et al. (27.Thorén P.E.G. Persson D. Isakson P. Goksör M. Önfelt A. Nordén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 307: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) contains somewhat different conclusions. This work showed that analogues of TAT-(48–60) and hepta-arginine containing one tryptophan residue (designated TAT P59W and R7W, respectively) were taken up into live PC-12 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, unlike other reports, (26.Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 28.Lundberg M. Wikström S. Johansson M. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), Thorén et al. (27.Thorén P.E.G. Persson D. Isakson P. Goksör M. Önfelt A. Nordén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 307: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) observed weak fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells after incubation with these peptides. In addition, use of low temperature or depletion of cellular ATP with rotenone and 2-deoxy-d-glucose slowed but did not stop uptake, which led the authors to conclude that uptake occurs at least in part via an energy-independent process, i.e. a process other than endocytosis. Zaro and Shen (33.Zaro J.L. Shen W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 307: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have used a cell fractionation protocol to try to distinguish peptide entry via endocytosis from direct entry in the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane (the latter process is designated “transduction”). These authors concluded that the majority of TAT-(47–57) enters Chinese hamster ovary cells via transduction rather than endocytosis. Here we report fluorescence microscopy studies that extend recently reported conclusions (26.Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in several important dimensions. Working with the TAT-(47–57) sequence, we show that fluorescently labeled peptide can gain access to the cytoplasm and ultimately the nucleus via endocytic uptake in live cells. The integrity of the plasma membrane permeability barrier was confirmed throughout our experimental procedures by demonstrating the ability of the cells to exclude propidium iodide. In addition, we show that a basic β-amino acid oligomer (“β-peptide”) displays comparable or better uptake behavior than TAT itself. For both TAT-(47–57) and β-(VRR)4, experiments with ammonium chloride suggest that acidification plays an essential role in escape from endosomes to the cytoplasm and nucleus/nucleolus. Synthesis of Fmoc-β Amino Acid Monomers—Fmoc-protected β3hArg(PMC)-OH and β3hVal-OH were synthesized via Arndt-Eistert homologation (52.Guichard G. Abele S. Seebach D. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1998; 81: 187-206Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using a modified procedure described by Muller et al. (53.Muller A. Vogt C. Sewald N. Synthesis. 1998; 6: 837-841Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fmoc-protected α-amino acids were obtained commercially. Peptide Synthesis and Labeling with Fluorescein (Flu)—Synthesis of Flu-α-TAT and Flu-β-(VRR)4 were performed on an Applied Biosystems Model 432A Synergy peptide synthesizer using the standard Fmoc solid-phase strategy with O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N-N-N′-N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) activation and 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HOBt) additive. Two-hour coupling times and extended deprotections were employed to synthesize β-(VRR)4. A β-homoglycine residue was incorporated at the N terminus of the peptide; the free N-terminal was then conjugated to 6-carboxyfluoresein manually using 3 equivalents of HBTU/HOBt in N,N-dimethylformamide. After a 12-h coupling, the resin was washed with 3× N,N-dimethylformamide, 3× methylene chloride, and 3× diethyl ether, and the peptide was then cleaved from resin using a solution of 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, and 2.5% ethanedithiol. Peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis. The purified peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in deionized distilled water. Peptide concentrations were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy at 494 nm. Peptide stock solutions were stored frozen at –70 °C. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 (gas). Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells that had been grown on 90-mm plates to sub-confluence were dissociated from the plates by treatment with Trypsin/EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. An aliquot of 1 × 105 cells was plated on 30-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp.) and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to allow the cells to adhere. The medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3. The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 ml Opti-MEM containing 7 μm peptide (Flu-TAT or Flu-β-(VRR)4) and 8 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). The medium was again discarded, and the cells were washed 3 × 5 min with 2 ml PBS. Each wash solution contained 8 μg/ml PI. PBS (2 ml) containing 8 μg/ml PI was added to the cells, and the cells were then placed on ice. The cells were then viewed by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope. Co-localization Studies—Cells, grown and plated as described above, were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 1.5 μm or 7 μm Flu-TAT or Flu-β-(VRR)4, 8 μg/ml PI, and either 25 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled transferrin (TR-Tf) or 1.25 μm Syto-60. The cells were washed after the incubation period and placed on ice as above. Fluorescence Bleed-through Controls—Control cells that had been incubated with only peptide or only the costain (TR-Tf or Syto-60) were used to determine appropriate microscope parameters that would prevent bleed-through among the far-red, red, and green fluorescence channels. These parameters were used to view cells that had been incubated with peptide, PI, and the desired costain. Energy Poison Studies—Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in glass-bottom plates as described above, then incubated with 1 ml of glucose-free Hepes buffered saline (HBS) (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 10 mm sodium azide (NaN3) for 30 min at 37 °C. Peptide (7 μm), 25 μg/ml TR-Tf, and 8 μg/ml PI were added to the HBS solution. The cells were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C, washed with 3 × 2 ml of glucose-free HBS containing 2-deoxy-d-glucose and NaN3, and viewed by confocal microscopy. Treated cells were compared with mock-treated cells that had been incubated with HBS that did not contain NaN3 or 2-deoxy-d-glucose. Ammonium Chloride Studies—Cells plated to a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in glass-bottom plates were incubated with 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 30 min at 37 °C (34.Nicola A.V. McEvoy A.M. Straus S.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 35.Poole B. Okhuma S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Peptide (7 μm) was added, and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with 3 × 2 ml of PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl, and viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Mock-treated cells that had been incubated with Opti-MEM that did not contain NH4Cl were viewed in parallel. The difference in uptake efficiencies in the presence and absence of NH4Cl was determined by cell counting of nuclear staining. The peptides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Flu-TAT is a fluorescein-labeled, 9-amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 47–57 (YGRKKRRQRRR) of HIV TAT; Flu-β-(VRR)4 is a fluorescein-labeled 12-residue β-peptide. HeLa cells were incubated with Flu-TAT and Flu-β-(VRR)4 for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. All assays were conducted in small glass-bottom dishes, thus allowing the cells to be viewed in buffered solution instead of in mounted preparations. PI (8 μg/ml) was included during the incubation with peptide, as well as in all wash buffers, to establish cell viability. Because PI is membrane impermeant it cannot enter viable cells; non-viable cells with a compromised plasma membrane are readily detected because PI enters these cells and fluoresces strongly upon binding to nucleic acid. All of the data described in this paper are derived from an examination of live cells, i.e. those that excluded PI. Fig. 2A illustrates uptake of Flu-TAT into the cytoplasm and nucleus of a live cell; the fluorescence image also shows a non-viable cell displaying PI staining of the nucleus.Fig. 2Transport of Flu-TAT into endosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleus of live HeLa cells.A, confocal microscopy images of HeLa cells incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 7 μm fluorescein-conjugated Tat peptide and 8 μg/ml propidium iodide in 1 ml of Opti-MEM.

A small fraction of cells (5–10%) showed no detectable fluorescence. Three distinct fluorescence patterns were observed (Fig. 2B). Some cells showed only punctate fluorescence (Fig. 2B, left panel), whereas others showed a combination of punctate fluorescence and more diffuse fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2B, center panel). A third group of cells showed only cytoplasmic and nuclear staining with little or no punctate fluorescence (Fig. 2B, right panel). The TAT peptide did not localize to nucleoli as reported in previous studies on fixed cells (3.Pooga M. Hallbrink M. Zorko M. Langel U. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but instead showed a diffuse nuclear staining that tended to exclude nucleoli. Upon incubation with a lower concentration of Flu-TAT (1.5 μm), the majority of cells showed only punctate fluorescence as in Fig. 2B, left panel. At 7 μm peptide, ∼50% of the cells showed nuclear fluorescence (resembling the images in Fig. 2B, center and right panels), whereas the remaining cells showed only a punctate distribution with a faint, diffuse fluorescence background (as in Fig. 2B, left panel). To test whether the punctate distribution of Flu-TAT was due to endocytosis of the peptide, we performed a double-labeling experiment using a TR-Tf conjugate (Molecular Probes) and Flu-TAT (Fig. 2C). TR-Tf binds to the cell surface transferrin receptor (TfR) and is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, thus providing a well characterized marker for the endocytic pathway (36.Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Google Scholar). Prior to imaging double-labeled cells, fluorescence images were taken of cells incubated with Flu-TAT or TR-Tf alone to determine the appropriate microscope parameters to minimize fluorescence bleed-through (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2C shows the top and equatorial views of cellular distribution of Flu-TAT (Fig. 2C, green, left panel), TR-Tf (Fig. 2C, red, center panel), and an electronically merged image (Fig. 2C, right panel) showing the overlap (yellow) between the Flu-TAT and TR-Tf distributions. The merged image clearly shows that there is considerable overlap between the punctate structures seen in the Flu-TAT image and the endocytic vesicles defined by TR-Tf, but that there are also TR-Tf-positive vesicles that do not contain Flu-TAT and a few Flu-TAT positive vesicles that do not contain TR-Tf. This result is consistent with other reports of endocytic uptake of the TAT peptide (26.Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

The TR-Tf-positive, Flu-TAT-negative structures may correspond to endosomes committed to the recycling pathway that is responsible for returning TfR to the cell surface (36.Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E.

https://openalex.org/W2011540992,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been found to be expressed by endothelial cells and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Previous studies were mainly focused on the extracellular domain of NRP-1 that can bind to VEGF165 and, thus, enables NRP-1 to act as a co-receptor for VEGF165, which enhances its binding to VEGFR-2 and its bioactivity. However, the exact functional roles and related signaling mechanisms of NRP-1 in angiogenesis are not well understood. In this study we constructed a chimeric receptor, EGNP-1, by fusing the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NRP-1 and transduced it into HUVECs with a retroviral expression vector. We observed that NRP-1/EGNP-1 mediates ligand-stimulated migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not proliferation. Our results show that NRP-1 alone can mediate HUVEC migration through its intracellular domain, and its C-terminal three amino acids (SEA-COOH) are essential for the process. We demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 and the p85 dominant negative mutant can block NRP-1-mediated HUVEC migration. NRP-1-mediated migration can be significantly reduced by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of RhoA (RhoA-19N). In addition, Gq family proteins and Gβγ subunits are also required for NRP-1-mediated HUVEC migration. These results show for the first time that NRP-1 can independently promote cell signaling in endothelial cells and also demonstrate the importance of last three amino acids of NRP-1 for its function.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7189) Google Scholar). Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) plays a major role in the regulation of angiogenesis; it is regarded as a key contributor to the growth of cancer and vascular disease (2.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitc S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). VPF/VEGF activities are mediated by high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases that are associated primarily with ECs (2.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitc S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Two important VPF/VEGF binding receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1), have been identified, both of which are functionally active during angiogenesis. Recent studies have found a third VPF/VEGF receptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), that is expressed by ECs and tumor cells (3.Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Boil. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 4.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

NRP-1 is a 130–135-kDa cell surface glycoprotein. It was originally characterized as a semaphorin III receptor that is important for guiding neural development (5.He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 6.Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that NRP-1 mediates angiogenesis. NRP-1-null mice were found to be embryonic lethal and exhibit cardiovascular defects (7.Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H.A. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of NRP-1 in mice resulted in excessive capillary and blood vessel formation and hemorrhaging in embryos (8.Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRP-1 also contributes to tumor angiogenesis. Induction of NRP-1 expression in tumor cells in vivo resulted in larger and more vascular tumors (9.Miao H.Q. Lee P. Lin H. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The stronger evidence for the role of NRP-1 in angiogenesis is its expression on ECs in the adult uterus (10.Pavelock K. Braas K. Ouafil L. Osol G. May V. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and on new vasculature in healing wounds (11.Matthias A.M. Low Q. Lingen M.W. Dipietro L.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that expression of NRP-1 on ECs enhanced the VEGF165 binding to VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-2-mediated chemotactic activity of VEGF165 (4.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). This suggests that NRP-1 is a co-receptor for VPF/VEGF, which has led to postulate that NRP-1 is involved in VPF/VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in vivo. Further studies on NRP-1 function have also provided evidence for its role in EC as a critical VEGFR-2 co-receptor that facilitates VPF/VEGF-mediated signaling through this tyrosine kinase-linked receptor (12.Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Additionally, the study in Dunning rat prostate carcinoma AT2.1 cells which express NRP-1 but not VEGFR-2 found that the expression of NRP-1 resulted in enlarged tumors associated with substantially enhanced tumor angiogenesis (9.Miao H.Q. Lee P. Lin H. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that NRP-1 bound with high affinity to VEGFR-1 and that this interaction inhibited the binding of VEGF165 to NRP-1 (13.Fuh G. Garcia K.C. De Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a study by Bachelder et al. (14.Bachelder R.E. Crago A. Chung J. Wendt M.A. Shaw L.M. Robinson G. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5736-5740PubMed Google Scholar) first demonstrated that NRP-1 supported VPF/VEGF autocrine function in cells lacking VEGFR-2 expression. All this evidence raises the possibility that NRP-1 functions either alone or in concert with other tyrosine kinase-linked receptors to transduce the VPF/VEGF signaling in different cells. However, neither of the above signaling pathways has been investigated to date. NRP-1 contains a relatively large extracellular domain of 860 amino acids, a very short transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids, and an intracellular domain of 40 amino acids. Previous studies were mainly focused on the extracellular domain that consists of five domains: a1/a2, b1/b2, and c (a MAM domain). The b1/b2 domains of NRP-1 contain the epitopes for both VPF/VEGF 165 and the positively charged C terminus of semaphorins (15.Giger R.J. Urqucart E.R. Gillespie S.K. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neurobiology. 1999; 21: 1079-1092Google Scholar, 16.Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neurobiology. 1999; 21: 1093-1100Google Scholar, 17.Mamluk R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that are the structural basis for NRP-1 function as a VEGFR-2 co-receptor for VPF/VEGF signaling. Research from the nervous system showed that the intracellular domain of NRP-1 was not required for semaphorin signaling (16.Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neurobiology. 1999; 21: 1093-1100Google Scholar), and it did not contain sequences predictive of enzymatic activity nor sequences predicted to be involved in coupling to intracellular signaling molecules. Nevertheless, the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NRP-1 share >90% amino acid identity across species (18.Takagi S. Kasuya Y. Shimizu M. Matsuura T. Tsuboi M. Kawakami A. Fujisawa H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19.Kawakam A. Kitsukawa T. Takagi S. Fujisawa H. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which suggests an important role for this domain in terms of the NRP-1 functions. Moreover, the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH), which are conserved from Xenopus to human, were responsible for binding to a PSD-95-Dlg/ZO (PDZ) domain (20.Cai H.B. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6519-6527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.DeVries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and NRP-1 are all expressed on ECs, it is difficult to delineate the distinct biological functions and signaling pathways of each induced in ECs by VPF/VEGF. Therefore, to elucidate the respective roles of these receptors in ECs, an approach engineering the chimeric construct of each of the receptors by replacing the extracellular domain of each with the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was established previously in our laboratory (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In this study, using a chimeric receptor EGNP-1 (fusing the extracellular domain of the EGFR and the transmembrane/intracellular domains of NRP-1) we examined the distinct biological function of the intracellular domain of NRP-1 and its signaling pathways in vascular endothelium. We found that NRP-1 alone can mediate HUVEC migration but not proliferation, and the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH) are required for NRP-1-mediated HUVEC migration. The activation of RhoA can be mediated by NRP-1 through Gq family proteins, Gβγ subunits, and PI3K pathways that are required for HUVEC migration. Materials—Human EGF, human VEGF, primary HUVECs, EGM-MV bullet kit and EC basic medium (EBM) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against the EGFR N-terminal domain, goat polyclonal antibody against the NRP-1-C-terminal domain, and rabbit polyclonal antibody against RhoA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [3H]Thymidine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Transwell plate inserts were purchased from Fisher. Calcein-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Pertussis toxin and Ly294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—HUVECs were cultured as described previously (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). HUVECs were grown on 30 μg/ml Vitrogen-coated dishes in EGM-MV bullet kit (5% fetal bovine serum in EBM with 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 1 μg/ml GA-1000). HUVECs (passage 3 or 4) that were ∼80% confluent were used for most experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum in EBM for 24 h before testing. Construction and Overexpression of Chimeric Fusion Receptors— Chimeric receptor EGNP-1 and its mutant EGNP-1ΔSEA were constructed by fusing the extracellular domain of EGFR (N terminus) with the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NRP-1 (C terminus) and NRP-1ΔSEA (C terminus), respectively. PCR were carried out to generate the required fragments. For preparing the N-terminal portion of the EGF receptor, template EGDR (a chimeric receptor that consists of the extracellular domain of EGFR and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of KDR was constructed previously in our laboratory (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)) was cut from pMMP-EGDR with NcoI and NotI. 5′ primer (CCA TGG GTC GAC CAGC ATG GGA CCC TCC GGG) contains NcoI enzyme restriction sequence just before the translation start site (ATG). A ApaI enzyme restriction sequence was inserted in the 3′ primer (GGG CCC ATT CGT TCC TGT CGG AAG TTC) of EGFR, and the nucleotide sequence ending at amino acid 640 was fused to a sequence of NRP-1 beginning at amino acid 856. NRP-1 was used as a template to get the C-terminal portion of NRP-1 and NRP-1ΔSEA, respectively. The 5′ primer (GGG CCC ATC CTC ATC ACC ATC ATA GCC) began at amino acid 856 of NRP-1 with an insertion of ApaI enzyme restriction sequence. In the 3′ primer (GCG GCC GC TCA TGC CTC CGA ATA AGT ACT CTG) of NRP-1, a NotI site was created immediately after the stop code (TGA). As for the C-terminal portion of NRP-1ΔSEA, the 3′ mutagenesis primer was GCG GCC GCT CAA TAA GTA CTC TGT GTA TTC AGT TTG TC, in which a stop code (TGA) was inserted before the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH), and a NotI site was created immediately after the stop code. All the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. These fragments were then ligated, respectively, to obtain EGNP-1 (EGFR/NRP-1) and EGNP-1ΔSEA (EGFR/NRP-1ΔSEA) and further subcloned into retroviral vector pMMP to yield pMMP-EGNP-1 and pMMP-EGNP-1ΔSEA. For preparing the retrovirus, 293T cells were seeded at 3 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. After 24 h, DNA transfection was performed with the Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and with 2 μg of targeted gene (pMMP-EGNP-1, pMMP-EGNP-1ΔSEA, pMMP-LacZ, etc.), 1.5 μg of pMD.MLV gag.pol, and 0.5 μg of pMD.G (encoding the cDNAs of the proteins that are required for virus packing). The medium was changed after 16 h. The retrovirus was collected 48 h after transfection and used immediately for infection or frozen at –70 °C. For transducing the target gene into HUVECs, the cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/100-mm plate. Infection was carried out by adding 2.5 ml of retrovirus solution and 7.5 ml of fresh medium (∼2 × 107 plaqueforming units/ml) together with 10 μg/ml Polybrene to cells. The medium was changed after 16 h, and the cells were ready for experiment 48 h after infection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—48 h after infection, HUVECs were lysed with cold immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), which contains 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. 500 μg of lysate protein was incubated with 1 μg of antibody at 4 °C for 2 h and then with 50 μl of protein G-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 2–5 h. After washing the beads with the same buffer, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. All experiments were repeated at least three times. FACS Analysis—For detaching cells, serum-starved HUVECs were incubated with 4 ml of collagenase solution (0.2 mg/ml collagenase, 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell pellets were washed with cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 40 μl of the same buffer containing 4 μg of mouse anti-EGFR-N antibody or mouse IgG and incubated on ice for 1 h. The cells were washed again and resuspended in 40 μl of the same buffer with 2.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cells were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of the same buffer. FACS analysis was carried out in a Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences) with Cellquest software. Migration Assay—Serum-starved HUVECs (with or without retrovirus infection) were stained with calcein-AM (25 μg of calcein-AM was dissolved in 5 μl of Me2SO and then added into 4 ml of EBM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin/100-mm plate) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then detached from tissue culture plates as described in FACS analysis. Then cells were seeded as 1 × 105/well in 500 μl of EBM with 0.1% fetal bovine serum into the transwells coated with Vitrogen (30 μg/ml), and the transwells were inserted into a 24-well plate containing 750 μl of the same medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to allow them to attach. Afterward, VPF/VEGF or EGF was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml, and an additional 2-h incubation was performed. The migrated, stained cells were counted in a spectrofluorometer (Spectrafluor; TECAN) with Delta Soft 3 software. The standard curve was made under the same conditions with cells over a range of 3 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells/well. For migration inhibition experiments, various inhibitors were added at different times before VPF/VEGF or EGF stimulation as indicated. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate values. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Proliferation Assays—A proliferation assay was carried out as described previously (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). 2 × 103 cells were seeded into each well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were infected with 200 μl of retrovirus in 800 μl of fresh medium as described above. After 2 days, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or 10 ng/ml EGF for 20 h. The assay was carried out as previously described (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed with 100% cold methanol at 4 °C for 15 min, precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 15 min, washed with double distilled H2O 3 times, and lysed with 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH at room temperature for 30 min. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in scintillation solution. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate values. All experiments were repeated at least three times. RhoA Activation Assay—RhoA activation assay was carried out as described previously (23.Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46791-46798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rhotekin Rho binding domain (TRBD) fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz (Scripps Institute). In brief, pGST-TRBD bacteria were grown and induced with isopropylthiogalactoside. The bacterial suspensions were aliquoted per 50 ml and then harvested and frozen at –80 °C. To prepare the GST-TRBD beads, each aliquot of frozen bacteria was resuspended in 2 ml of cold PBS, and then 20 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol, 20 μl of 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 μl of 50 mg/ml lysozyme were added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Afterward, 225 μl of 10% Triton X-100, 22.5 μl of 1 m MgCl2, and 22.5 μl of 2000 kilounits/ml DNase were added, and the sample was incubated on ice for another 30 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 100 μl of glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were then washed with bead washing buffer (PBS with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in the same buffer to emit 50% bead slur. Meanwhile, 24 h serum-starved HUVECs with retroviral infection were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF at different times. Stimulation was stopped by adding cold PBS. Then the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% IGEPAL, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The supernatant was isolated and incubated with 50 μl of GST-TRBD beads at 4 °C for 45 min. Protein bound to beads was washed with AP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with antibody against RhoA. For inhibition experiments, inhibitors were added as indicated. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Construction, Transduction, and Recombinant Expression of EGNP-1 Chimeric Receptor—Previously, our laboratory developed EGLT and EGDR fusions with the extracellular domain of EGFR to the transmembrane/intracellular domains of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, respectively, and expressed them in HUVECs with a retrovirus expression vector (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23.Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At 80% confluence, HUVECs do not express EGFR, and therefore, the fusion receptor can be used to distinguish the signaling pathway that is mediated by VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. In this study, to investigate the biological activities and the specific signaling events mediated by NRP-1 in ECs, we developed a chimeric receptor, EGNP-1, by fusing the extracellular domain of EGFR to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NRP-1 (Fig. 1a). Using a retroviral expression vector pMMP, the chimeric receptor EGNP-1 was transduced into HUVECs. Cells transduced with LacZ were used as control. Western blot (IB) analysis was performed on these cell lysates with an antibody to the C terminus of NRP-1 (anti-NRP-1-C). The results showed the specific bands of endogenous NRP-1 in both cells, but the EGNP-1 band only in EGNP-1 transduced HUVECs (Fig. 1b, the left two lanes). Immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antibody against the EGFR N terminus (anti-EGFR-N) and then Western blot with anti-NRP-1-C were also carried out and further demonstrated that the clear specific band of EGNP-1 that expressed only in EGNP-1 transduced HUVECs (Fig. 1b, the two right lanes). Of importance, the expression of endogenous NRP-1 and recombinant EGNP-1 expression are almost at similar levels. To determine the expression of EGNP-1 on HUVEC surfaces, FACS analysis was preformed using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminus of EGFR and normal mouse IgG as control. HUVECs were transduced with LacZ (negative control), EGDR (positive control), and EGNP-1. The results showed that about 90% of transduced cells expressed EGDR and more than 70% of transduced cells expressed EGNP-1 (Fig. 1c). EGFR expression was not detected in LacZ-transduced HUVECs as previously shown (22.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). EGNP-1 Mediates HUVEC Migration but Not Proliferation— First, we examined whether EGNP-1 could mediate the migration and proliferation of HUVECs. Migration assays were carried out on HUVECs transduced with EGNP-1, EGDR, EGLT, and LacZ. As shown in Fig. 2a, I, EGF induced the migration to an almost equivalent level in HUVECs that had been transduced with either EGNP-1 or EGDR but not to that of native HUVECs and HUVECs transduced with EGLT or LacZ. All of the cells showed a similar response to VPF/VEGF stimulation, indicating that the cells had good responsiveness. The results from Western blot analysis demonstrated all the chimeric receptors were expressed at relatively comparable levels in HUVECs (Fig. 2a, III). These results indicated that EGNP-1 can mediate the ligand-dependent migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, proliferation assays were also performed on these HUVECs as above. As shown in Fig. 2a, II, VPF/VEGF treatment stimulated more than 3-fold in parental HUVECs, and EGF treatment promoted ∼4-fold in EGDR-transduced HUVECs in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [3H]thymidine incorporation. On the other hand, there was no response in EGF-stimulated EGNP-1- or LacZ-transduced HUVECs or parental HUVECs. The results suggest that EGNP-1 is not required for ligand-dependent HUVEC proliferation. To quantitatively characterize the medication function of EGNP-1 in HUVEC migration, we infected HUVECs by varying the number of retrovirus particles containing EGNP-1. Fig. 2b, II, illustrated that the transduced cells expressed progressively increased levels of EGNP-1. Stimulating the transduced cells with EGF indicated that there was"

https://openalex.org/W2011906296,"The rapid and efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells plays a critical role in preventing secondary necrosis, inflammation as well as in tissue remodeling and regulating immune responses. However, the molecular details of engulfment are just beginning to be elucidated. Among the Rho family GTPases, previous studies have implicated a role for Rac and Cdc42 in the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, yet the role of Rho has remained unclear. Here, we present evidence that Rho-GTP levels decrease during engulfment. RhoA seems to negatively affect basal engulfment, such that inhibition of Rho-mediated signaling in phagocytes enhanced the uptake of apoptotic targets. Activation of endogenous Rho or overexpression of constitutively active forms of Rho also inhibited engulfment. By testing mutants of RhoA that selectively activate downstream effectors, the Rho-kinase seemed to be primarily responsible for this inhibitory effect. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of Rho- and Rho-kinase-mediated signaling might be important during engulfment, which could have important implications for several clinical trials involving inhibition of the Rho kinase."

The functions of Phe228 and Gly230 were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The results of both in vivo and in vitro assays indicate that these conserved pore residues are important for FtsH function and that bulkier, uncharged/apolar residues are essential at position 228. None of the point mutants, F228A, F228E, F228K, or G230A, was able to degrade σ32, a physiological substrate. The F228A mutant was able to degrade casein, an unfolded substrate, although the other three mutants were not. Mutation of these two pore residues also affected the ATPase activity of FtsH. The F228K and G230A mutations markedly reduced ATPase activity, whereas the F228A mutation caused a more modest decrease in this activity. The F228E mutant was actually more active ATPase. The substrates, σ32 and casein, stimulated the ATPase activity of wild type FtsH. The ATPase activity of the mutants was no longer stimulated by casein, whereas that of the three Phe228 mutants, but not the G230A mutant, remained σ32-stimulatable. These results suggest that Phe228 and Gly230 in the predicted pore region of the FtsH hexamer have important roles in proteolysis and its coupling to ATP hydrolysis.

ATPase domains or subunits of these proteases have multiple roles in proteolysis including substrate recognition, unfolding, and translocation (5.Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T.

Cell. 2003; 11: 3-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about their molecular mechanisms. A common feature of ATP-dependent proteases is an oligomeric ring structure with a narrow central pore (8.De Mot R. Nagy I. Walz J. Baumeister W.

Biol. 2000; 10: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the central pore is a channel through which substrates are translocated into a proteolytic chamber (10.Ortega J. Singh S.K. Ishikawa T. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C.

Indeed, a capacity to unfold substrate proteins has been demonstrated for some of these ATPases (12.Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L.

All of the ATPase domains/subunits in ATP-dependent proteases that have been identified so far belong to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities plus) superfamily (18.Neuwald A.F.

Recently, it has been suggested that FtsH lacks a robust unfoldase activity and that degradation by FtsH occurs efficiently only when the substrate is a protein of low intrinsic thermodynamic stability (32.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). FtsH homologs have been found in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells (33.Langer T. Trends Biochem.

Oligomerization of FtsH depends on its N-terminal transmembrane segments, in particular the second of its two transmembrane segments (35.Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol.

Soluble derivatives of FtsH, lacking the transmembrane segments, behave as monomers and show no detectable ATPase or protease activities (36.Makino S. Makino T. Abe K. Hashimoto J. Tatsuta T.

We have determined the crystal structure of the ATPase domain of FtsH (39.Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Verma C. Karata K. Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A modeled hexamer of the FtsH ATPase is consistent with the roles of several conserved residues in the AAA ATPase in terms of an intersubunit catalysis model for ATP hydrolysis. More obvious evidence for a hexameric structure has been obtained from a crystal structure of the ATPase domain of Thermus thermophilus FtsH (40.Niwa H. Tsuchiya D. Makyio H. Yoshida M. Morikawa K. Structure. 2002; 10: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite reasonable to assume that, in common with other AAA proteins, functional FtsH is hexameric. In this paper, we used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the importance of the conserved pore sequence of E. coli FtsH and to gain further insights into its function. Our results suggest that the pore motif plays crucial roles in several steps of the proteolytic process.

Site-directed and Random Mutagenesis—All mutant ftsH plasmids were constructed by replacing a segment of ftsH on pIFH108 with a mutated fragment. The mutants constructed by site-directed mutagenesis are as follows: 1) F228A (TTC to GCC), 2) F228K (TTC to AAG), and 3) G230A (GGT to GCA); mutagenized ftsH fragments were produced by sequential PCR steps using synthetic primers. The KpnI-NcoI segment of pIFH108 was replaced with each mutated fragment. Random mutagenesis of Phe228 was carried out using pIFH108 (F228A) as a template by sequential PCR steps using degenerate primers (5′-AGAAATGNNNGTCGGTGTGGGTGCAT-3′ and (5′-CACCGACNNNCATTTCTACGAAGTC-3′). PCR-amplified segments were digested with KpnI and NcoI and inserted into KpnI- and NcoI-digested pIFH108. pGST-σ32(K276C) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (changing AAA to TGT) by sequential PCR steps using synthetic primers. The BamHI-XhoI segment of pGST-σ32 was replaced with a mutated fragment. All of the mutations have been confirmed by sequencing.

In this method, trichloroacetic acid-soluble fractions were measured for fluorescence (excitation, 550 nm; emission, 570 nm) after the reaction at 42 °C. Western Blotting—Western blotting was carried out as described by Karata et al. (41.Karata K. Inagawa T. Wilkinson A.J. Tatsuta T. Ogura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26225-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). 1 ml of culture (Klett unit = 50) was harvested by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were suspended in 100 μl of the SDS loading buffer. 5 μl of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-FtsH or anti-σ32 serum and detected by ECL. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Conserved Amino Acid Residues in the Pore Sequence—We recently determined the crystal structure of the ATPase domain of E. coli FtsH and modeled it as a hexameric structure (39.Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Verma C. Karata K. Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The hexamer possesses a central pore, which is lined by the conserved aromatic residue, Phe228 (pore 1) (Fig. 1). We probed the functional importance of two conserved residues, Phe228 and Gly230, in the pore 1 motif of FtsH by replacing each residue with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids expressing the resulting mutants, F228A and G230A, were introduced into the temperature-sensitive ftsH1 mutant, and growth of the transformants was examined at 42 °C. Neither F228A nor G230A was found to complement ftsH1 (data not shown), confirming that these conserved residues are essential for the in vivo function of FtsH. Random Mutagenesis of the Conserved Phe228 Residue—To further address the importance of an aromatic residue at position 228, random mutagenesis was carried out using primers with degenerate codons at position Phe228. A pooled DNA library was introduced into the ftsH1 mutant strain and temperature-resistant and -sensitive clones were selected. The mutated ftsH gene on the plasmids recovered from 65 temperature-resistant and 59 temperature-sensitive clones was sequenced and compared. As shown in Table I, all of the 20 amino acids were represented in the mutations at position 228 except for lysine. To complete the set, we constructed an F228K mutant by site-directed mutagenesis. Clones that were temperature-resistant and therefore complemented the ftsH1 mutation contained either an aromatic, an aliphatic, or a hydrophobic residue at position 228. This clearly indicates that bulkier uncharged/apolar residues at this position are essential for activity. Clones that contained charged, polar, or smaller residues at position 228 were not able to complement the ftsH1 mutation, suggesting that they were unable to sustain FtsH activity.Table IAmino acid residues at the first position of the @XG pore 1 motif of mutant FtsH proteins and their complementation activityAromaticAliphaticHydrophobicPolarBasicAcidicOthersYFWHLIVMCQNTSRKDEPAGNumber of clones6856205111341710101aObtained by site-directed mutagenesis.51786Complementation of ftsH1b+, large colonies; ±, small colonies; -, no colonies at 42 °C.+++±++++±-----------a Obtained by site-directed mutagenesis.b +, large colonies; ±, small colonies; -, no colonies at 42 °C. Open table in a new tab To correlate complementation with proteolytic activity, plasmids encoding the mutant FtsH forms were introduced into the ΔftsH mutant AR5088, and the levels of σ32, which is a specific substrate of FtsH, were analyzed by Western blotting. The accumulation of σ32 was suppressed in cells expressing wild type FtsH but not suppressed in cells harboring the vector pIFH100 (Fig. 2). Among the 20 clones expressing Phe228 mutants of FtsH, the accumulation of σ32 was completely suppressed in F228Y, F228F (wild type), F228W, F228L, F228I, F228V, and F228M; partially suppressed in F228H and F228C; and not suppressed at all in F228Q, F228N, F228T, F228S, F228R, F228K, F228D, F228E, F228P, F228A, and F228G. This correlates with the complementation activity of the mutants described above. The G230A mutant that was unable to complement the ftsH1 mutation also did not suppress the accumulation of σ32. Taken together, both the in vivo proteolytic activity and the complementation activity of the mutants suggest that Phe228 and Gly230 are critical for the biological activity of FtsH. In Vitro Proteolytic Activity of Mutant Proteins—A set of mutant FtsH proteins lacking proteolytic activity against σ32 were purified for in vitro characterization to obtain insights into the function of the conserved pore motif. FtsH from the ΔftsH hflKC+ strain was co-purified with the membrane proteins HflK and HflC (data not shown). It has been shown that HflKC associates with FtsH and that this association modulates FtsH activity (28.Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To focus our analysis and to exclude the possible effects of HflKC on the in vitro activity of purified FtsH, we used a ΔftsH ΔhflKC mutant as a host strain for preparation of wild type and mutant FtsH proteins. We introduced plasmids expressing wild type and the F228A, F228E, F228K, and G230A mutant FtsH proteins into the ΔftsH ΔhflKC mutant AR5771. Western blotting analysis indicated that the absence of HflKC did not alter the in vivo proteolytic activity of these mutants against σ32 (Fig. 3). HflKC-free FtsH proteins were purified from these strains. It should be noted that each of the mutant proteins behaved similarly to wild type FtsH during the purification steps including gel filtration using a Superose 6 size fractionation column, indicating that these mutations do not significantly affect the oligomeric state of FtsH. To examine the proteolytic activity of mutant FtsH proteins more precisely, we prepared Cy3-labeled σ32. As shown in Table II, wild type FtsH degraded Cy3-σ32 in the presence of ATP but not in the presence of ADP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS or in the absence of nucleotide, indicating that degradation of σ32 strictly requires ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, none of the mutants tested degraded Cy3-σ32 even in the presence of ATP, consistent with the in vivo results shown in Figs. 2 and 3.Table IIProteolytic activityNucleotideCy3-σ32BODIPY-caseinSuc-LLVY-AMCWild typeF228AF228EF228KG230AWild typeF228AF228EF228KG230AWild typeF228AF228EF228KG230ANo11010031123161137ADP31202411023191549ATPγS20000962323261763542ATP10000011002430910085593945 Open table in a new tab We also examined the proteolytic activity of wild type and mutant FtsH against unfolded proteins such as BODIPY-casein and short peptides such as Suc-LLVY-AMC. Wild type FtsH degraded casein in an ATP-dependent manner. Cleavage of the tetrapeptide LLVY occurred in the presence of ATPγS, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is not strictly required, although ATP hydrolysis significantly stimulates cleavage of the tetrapeptide. These observations are fully consistent with our previous results (43.Karata K. Verma C.S. Wilkinson A.J. Ogura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 890-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The F228A mutant showed a significant level of casein proteolysis (24% of wild type), whereas the other three mutants, F228E, F228K, and G230A, were inactive (less than 10%). Thus, there was a striking difference between casein degradation and σ32 degradation by the F228A mutant. Because σ32 is a folded substrate and casein is a largely unfolded substrate, it is reasonable to assume that the observed distinction between casein (24%) and σ32 (0%) degradation is related to their different folding states. None of the mutations tested significantly affected the peptidase activity in the presence of ATPγS. In contrast to wild type FtsH, however, stimulation of the peptidase activity by ATP hydrolysis was not observed for these mutants. It is also noted that two Phe228 mutants, F228A and F228E, exhibited significant nucleotide-independent peptidase activities, suggesting that the pore structure is somehow affected by these mutations, perhaps facilitating access of the small peptide. These results indicate that the conserved pore 1 residues may function at multiple steps in the FtsH reaction cycle as discussed below. In Vitro ATPase Activity and Its Stimulation by Substrates— The pore 1 sequence is a part of the central structure of the predicted FtsH ring, and in the sequence it is adjacent to the Walker A motif that binds the β-phosphate of the nucleotide. It has been speculated that the pore 1 loop undergoes conformational changes during the cycle of ATP hydrolysis (24.Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, we would predict that mutations in this region may affect the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. We examined the ATPase activities of purified mutant FtsH proteins in vitro and found that two mutations, F228K and G230A, markedly reduced ATPase activity (Table III). The F228A mutation also reduced ATPase activity but to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the F228E mutation increased ATPase activity by almost 40%.Table IIIATPase activity and its stimulation by substratesSpecific activity at 42 °CFactor of stimulationaThe factors of ATPase stimulation in the presence of each substrate (molar ratio of substrate:FtsH (hexamer) = 300:1) are indicated.σ32α-Caseinnmol/mg/minWild type7352.01.8F228A3491.41.1F228E10101.61.1F228K1222.41.1G230A1131.21.2a The factors of ATPase stimulation in the presence of each substrate (molar ratio of substrate:FtsH (hexamer) = 300:1) are indicated. Open table in a new tab In general, proteolytic substrates stimulate the ATPase activity of ATP-dependent proteases. It has been demonstrated that casein stimulates ATPase activity of T. thermophilus FtsH (44.Makyio H. Niwa H. Motohashi K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of two substrates on the stimulation of the ATPase activity of E. coli FtsH. σ32 and casein both stimulated the ATPase activity of FtsH in a dose-dependent manner to similar extents (Fig. 4). We also examined the effects of the addition of a tetrapeptide, LLVY, on the ATPase activity and found that the peptide also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, but a higher concentration (∼20-fold higher) of LLVY than that of σ32 or casein was required to achieve similar extents of stimulation (data not shown). Then we examined the ATPase activity of the pore mutants to determine the effect of substrates. As indicated in Table III, σ32 stimulated the ATPase activity of the Phe228 mutants but not the G230A mutant. Interestingly, casein did not stimulate the ATPase activity of any of these mutants. Taken together, the conserved pore residues appear to be important for regulated ATP hydrolysis by FtsH. Conservation of the Pore 1 Motif in AAA Proteins—Wang et al. (24.Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed that the pore 1 motif is conserved in all protease-associated ATPases and ClpB/Hsp104 chaperones. The protease-associated ATPases identified so far are ClpA, ClpC, ClpX, HslU, Lon, FtsH, and the proteasomal ATPases (19.Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Among these, ClpB/Hsp104, ClpA, ClpC, ClpX, HslU, and Lon are collectively referred to as the Clp/Hsp100 family of the AAA+ superfamily (45.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FtsH and its eukaryotic homologs, which are collectively referred to as AAA proteases, together with the regulatory ATPases of the 26 S proteasome, all contain a unique motif in the ATPase domain, called the second region of homology, and thus belong to the AAA family of the AAA+ superfamily (19.Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). All of these proteins share the conserved pore 1 motif, @XG, although the first residue of the motif is often substituted by an aliphatic or hydrophobic residue in some members (Table IV). In addition to these protease-associated ATPases, the AAA family also includes other members such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), p97 (also called valosin-containing protein, VCP), Pex1p, Pex6p, and katanin, which are not associated with proteases. As shown in Table IV, it is evident that all subfamily members of the AAA family share this pore 1 motif. This strongly suggests that the pore 1 motif is functionally important in other AAA family members, and thus it is possible that it is associated with a common mechanistic feature in their functions.Table IVDistribution of amino acid residues at the first position of the @XG pore 1 motifAromaticAliphaticHydrophobicPolarBasicAcidicOthersYFWHLIVMCQNTSRKDEPAGClp/Hsp10057535161710102AAA family 26 S1235021311211 proteasome AAA1547710 proteasesaEubacterial FtsH and its homologs in mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes.

Open table in a new tab The results presented in this paper show that residues Phe228 and Gly230 in the pore 1 sequence of FtsH are crucial for function, although Phe228 can be replaced by other bulkier uncharged/apolar residues without loss of function (Table I). The F228A, F228E, F228K, and G230A mutants are totally defective in the complementation of the ftsH1 mutation (Table I) and in proteolytic activity against σ32 both in vivo (Fig. 2) and in vitro (Table II). On the other hand, all of these mutants showed peptidase activities similar to that of wild type FtsH against a tetrapeptide in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS (Table II). The mutants all behaved similarly to wild type FtsH during the purification steps, implying that these mutations do not significantly alter the oligomeric state of the protein. A marked decrease in the proteolytic activity against casein, an unfolded substrate, was observed with the F228E, F228K, and G230A mutants (Table II), indicating that the pore region is important for substrate binding and perhaps for its translocation into the protease chamber. Interestingly, the F228A mutant showed a weak but significant proteolytic activity against casein but not against σ32 (Table II). This indicates that Phe228 may also be important in the unfolding of folded protein substrates. Based on these findings, it seems possible that the F228A mutant does have weak translocation activity, as evidenced by its proteolytic activity against casein, but that this activity is insufficient to unfold or to translocate σ32 (24.Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also possible that Phe228 is involved in a translocation-independent unfolding reaction as has been shown for the archaeal AAA ATPase, PAN (15.Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further analysis is required to conclude which is the case. The peptidase activity of wild type FtsH is dependent on ATP binding but not ATP hydrolysis (Table II). Interestingly, two Phe228 mutants, F228A and F228E, showed significant nucleotide-independent peptidase activity. These mutations may widen the pore in the absence of ATP. Six alanines will occupy a significantly smaller volume than six phenylalanines. In the case of the F228E mutant, the six negatively charged side chains may be more dispersed because of electrostatic repulsion. Structural analysis of the mutant FtsH proteins described here may provide useful information about the substrate entry site of this protease. The mutations at positions 228 and 230 variably affected ATPase activity (Table III). The F228K and G230A mutations decreased ATPase activity severely, whereas the F228E mutation increased it to some extent. The local structure and/or dynamics of the pore 1 region may affect the ATPase activity through a bidirectional coupling mechanism. This possibility is further supported by the fact that, unlike in wild type FtsH, the ATPase activity of these mutants was not stimulated by casein (Table III). Defective degradation of casein by these mutants could be due to a defect in ATPase stimulation. Although this possibility cannot be fully excluded, the F228A mutant showed some proteolytic activity against casein without significant stimulation of ATPase activity. To our surprise, however, the ATPase activity of these mutants was stimulated by σ32 (Table III) despite the absence of any detectable proteolytic activity against this substrate (Table II). In particular, the F228E mutant exhibited a slightly higher ATPase activity than wild type FtsH, and its ATPase activity was stimulated by σ32 to a similar extent, implying that σ32 can interact with the F228E mutant. This suggests that FtsH contains two distinct substrate-binding sites, one at the pore 1 region for unfolded substrates and another somewhere else for folded substrates. Although the latter binding site has not yet been identified, the region corresponding to the SSD (sensor and substrate discrimination) domain identified in AAA+ proteases (46.Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) might be a candidate. The SSD domain corresponds to the C-terminal α helical domain located on the outer rim of the hexameric ring. Recently, Makyio et al. (44.Makyio H. Niwa H. Motohashi K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that the ATPase activity of an E419C mutant of T. thermophilus FtsH, which is mutated at the protease catalytic site and is unable to digest casein, was not stimulated by casein at all and proposed that this mutant is defective in the proteolysis-coupled ATPase activity. Interestingly, the E419C mutant can form a stable complex with casein in the presence of ATPγS, whereas the wild type does not. We have examined an equivalent E. coli FtsH mutant, E418Q, for stimulation of the ATPase activity by casein and found that it was not stimulated as in the case of the E419C mutant of T. thermophilus FtsH. 3T. Okuno, manuscript in preparation. These data suggest that binding of casein is insufficient to stimulate the ATPase activity of FtsH and that subsequent translocation of casein coupled with proteolysis, probably involving movements of the pore region, is necessary for stimulation of the ATPase activity. Residues Phe228 and Gly230 in FtsH correspond to Tyr91 and Gly93 in HslU, respectively. Song et al. (25.Song H.K. Hartmann C. Ramachandran R. Bochtler M. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14103-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) constructed Y91G and G93A mutants of HslU and characterized them. The Y91G mutant exhibited similar peptidase, caseinolytic, and ATPase activities to wild type HslVU but did not degrade MBP-SulA, whereas the G93A mutant exhibited greatly reduced activities in all assays including ATPase activity. The results with the G93A mutant of HslU are fully consistent with those with the G230A mutant of FtsH. On the other hand, the results with the Y91G mutant of HslU appear significantly different from those with the Phe228 mutants of FtsH, in particular, in the proteolytic activity against casein. It should be noted, however, that degradation of casein by HslVU does not require ATP hydrolysis (47.Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 48.Huang H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21364-21372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that degradation of casein by these pore mutants was carried out in the presence of ATPγS (25.Song H.K. Hartmann C. Ramachandran R. Bochtler M. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14103-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed differences in casein degradation between HslVU and FtsH may result from differences in the intrinsic properties of these proteases, although the molecular basis of this difference remains unknown. Stimulation of the ATPase activity by substrates has not been examined for the HslU mutants. In conclusion, cycles of ATP hydrolysis induce conformational changes in the pore 1 region, which facilitate translocation of unfolded substrates. The pore 1 region may also be involved in unfolding of folded substrates. Although the mechanism by which substrates stimulate the ATPase activity remains unknown, it is most likely that there is bidirectional coupling between ATP hydrolysis at the ATP-binding pocket and conformational changes in the pore 1 region. Gly230 could be a key residue in this mechanism, because the G230A mutation reduces the ATPase activity dramatically and uncouples it from stimulation by substrates. Finally, a data base search revealed that the pore 1 motif is conserved in all subfamilies of the AAA family (Table IV). It is believed that AAA family members adopt several distinct modes of action (19.Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 49.Vale R.D. J.

Apparent conservation of the pore 1 motif suggests a common molecular mechanism for all AAA family members with minor exceptions. This prediction is rather attractive in consideration of the disassembling activity of the soluble NSF attachment protein-receptor (SNARE) complex of NSF and the microtubule-severing activity of katanin. Future studies will reveal the functions of the pore 1 motifs of these AAA proteins. We thank A. Kihara for a strain and A. J. Wilkinson, S. W. Whiteheart, E. Matveeva, and K.

Structural studies have revealed that the members of this family have two subdomains, a core ATPase domain with mixed α/β structures containing nucleotide binding loop and a C-terminal α-helical domain containing a sensor motif (5.Oruga T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Sometimes, another extra domain is found in the N-terminal region. heat shock locus ATPases associated with various cellular activities plus sensor and substrate discrimination H. pylori ClpX containing ATPase and SSD domains root mean square deviation adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Like other proteins in the AAA+ family, each subunit of ClpX is composed of an ATPase core domain in the N terminus and a SSD (sensor and substrate discrimination) domain of the C terminus (5.Oruga T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 12.Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is an additional small Cys cluster domain at the N terminus. The ATPase core domain of ClpX contains a tripeptide (LIV)-G-(FL) that is responsible for ClpP recognition and unique to ClpA and ClpX (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The C-terminal SSD domain is known to be involved in substrate binding specificity (14.Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Cys cluster domain was proposed to contribute to the initial substrate binding, or perform a gating function, to allow the access of the substrate to other binding sites (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it is considered that the Cys cluster domain is not necessary for the proteolytic activity of ClpXP protease, or for hexameric assembly, since Escherichia coli ClpX, devoid of the Cys cluster domain, can assemble into a hexamer, form a stable complex with ClpP and show protease and ATPase activities (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unlike ClpX, ClpA has two ATPase domains, which play different roles. The first ATPase domain (D1) is involved in hexameric assembly and the second (D2) is essential for ATPase activity (15.Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang S.H. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Their functional difference was explained by the different nucleotide binding environments in the crystal structure of E. coli ClpA (17.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 48: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, in the current crystal structure of E. coli ClpA, the tripeptide responsible for ClpP binding, and its surrounding loop, are not visible (17.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 48: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of HslU(ClpY) complexed with HslV(ClpQ) revealed that it contains one ATPase domain with similar structural architecture to ClpA D2 (18.Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. Mckay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Despite the structural resemblance of the ATPase domains, it is expected that HslU has a different structural feature, as it binds to HslV hexamer through the C-terminal loop, while ClpA or ClpX binds to the ClpP heptamer through the ClpP binding loop (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although plenty of structural evidence has been obtained from studies of ClpA and HslU that explains the function of the regulatory component of ATP-dependent protease, several questions still remain; how does the ClpA or ClpX hexamer bind to the ClpP heptamer, or what are their structural differences? To provide a structural basis for a better understanding of the function of the Clp ATPase family, the crystal structure of Helicobacter pylori ClpX, lacking the N-terminal Cys cluster domain (ClpX-ASD, ClpX containing ATPase and SSD domains), was solved. Although attempts were made to express and crystallize ClpX proteins from several bacteria, only the H. pylori (Hp) ClpX-ASD was crystallized and diffracted sufficiently to solve the structure. Since Hp ClpX shares a 54.3% sequence identity with E. coli ClpX (Fig. 1), the biochemical data of E. coli ClpX can be useful in the interpretation of the structural implication of Hp ClpX. The crystal structure newly reveals the tripeptide in ClpP binding loop that could mediate the asymmetric binding of the ClpX hexamer to the ClpP heptamer. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Hp ClpX (gene number HP1374), lacking the N-terminal Cys cluster domain (ClpX-ASD, corresponding to residues 71–446), was cloned, purified, and crystallized, as described previously (19.Kim D.Y. Wu C.A. Kim D.R. Ha S.C. Han Y.H. Kim K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Cys cluster domain was removed to facilitate the crystallization of the remaining ATPase and SSD domains of the ClpX. Briefly, the protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (>95% pure by SDS-PAGE) by ion exchange (Q-Sepharose) and gel filtration (Superdex-200) chromatographies. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed in the E. coli strain B834(DE3) and prepared in the same way. The Hp ClpXASD was crystallized in the hexagonal space group P65, with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 78.52 Å and c = 131.51 Å, by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C, from a reservoir solution containing 100 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1.0 m (NH4)2HPO4, and 0.2 m NaCl. To obtain the crystal of ClpX-ASD complexed with nucleotides, 5 mm ADP or ATPγS and MgCl2 were added to the protein solution and incubated before crystallization. One molecule of Hp ClpX-ASD exists in an asymmetric unit. The Size Measurement of Hp ClpX-ASD—The size of the Hp ClpXASD was estimated using a TSK-4000 gel filtration column under two different buffer conditions, buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0) and buffer B (50 mm imidazole and 0.5 m ammonium phosphate at pH 8.0). One-hundred microliters of ClpX (1.0 μg/μl) was injected into the preequilibrated column. The eluted proteins were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (233 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) were used as size markers (Amersham Biosciences and Sigma). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected for the native, ADP-bound, and ATPγS-bound crystals of ClpX-ASD at the beamlin 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory with a Mac-Science 2030b area detector, at a resolution of 2.6, 3.0, and at 2.8 Å, respectively. Data were processed and integrated by DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK, using the HKL program suite (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected from a frozen crystal of selenium substituted ClpX-ASD at a beamline 41XU of the Spring-8, with a MAR USA marCCD165 detector. The data collected at three wavelengths (inflection, peak, and remote) were processed using the HKL program suite (Table I). Five selenium sites were found and used for phase calculation in the SOLVE program (21.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar).Table IData collection and refinement statistics of Hp ClpX-ASD Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.NativeSeMetpeakSeMetinflectionSeMetremoteData collection and phasing Wavelength (Å)1.12710.97960.97980.9754 Resolution (Å)30.0—2.630.0—3.030.0—3.030.0—3.0 Unique reflections13273 (1369)9272 (924)9275 (923)9209 (926) Completeness (%)93.7 (96.3)99.4 (99.6)99.3 (99.6)98.7 (99.6) Redundancy3.1211.3611.3911.37 RmergeaRmerge = Σ|I — 〈I〉| ΣI × 100 (%)5.9 (32.6)7.9 (29.8)7.2 (30.2)6.7 (25.1) 〈I/σ(I)〉22.5 (2.6)33.1 (5.4)32.8 (5.1)35.3 (6.5)Overall figure of merit Before density modification0.62 After density modification0.70Refinement Resolution (Å)30.0—2.6 Number of reflections, working/free12334/667 RworkbRwork = Σ|Fobs — Fcalc|/ ΣFobs × 100/Rfree (%)21.9/25.8 r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.007 r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.185a Rmerge = Σ|I — 〈I〉| ΣI × 100b Rwork = Σ|Fobs — Fcalc|/ ΣFobs × 100 Open table in a new tab The density modification, using RESOLVE (22.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 55: 965-972Crossref Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), resulted in a high quality electron density map, which was suitable for model building. Amino acids were assigned using the O program (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Several cycles of rigid body refinement, positional refinement, simulated annealing, and B-factor refinement were performed at 3.0 Å resolution, using CNS (24.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilgen M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The refinement was continued at 2.6-Å resolution using the data collected from the Hp ClpX-ASD. Although a nucleotide was not added during the crystallization of Hp ClpX-ASD, the electron density corresponding to ADP was found, and the nucleotide was modeled at this stage. Successive refinement with temperature factors and the addition of solvents resulted in R- and Rfree values of 22.4 and 25.7%, respectively, with bulk solvent correction and overall anisotropic thermal factor refinement. The Rfree value was calculated from 5% of the reflections. The final model includes residues 75–179, 188–219, 234–251, and 267–438; 88 water molecules; and an ADP molecule (Table I). The structures of ClpX-ASDs complexed with ADP, or ATPγS, plus magnesium were refined at 3.0 and 2.8 Å, respectively. However, since both were identical with the structure of Hp ClpX-ASD refined at 2.6 Å, and the γ-phosphate of the ATPγS was not shown, no further studies of these structures were continued. The structural evaluation of the refined model, using PROCHECK (25.Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), revealed that the structure had good geometric parameters, with no residue falling in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The figures in this article were drawn using the MOLSCRIPT (26.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and GRASP (27.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) programs. The final coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank accession number 1UM8). Modeling of Hexameric ClpX-ASD—To model the ClpX subunit into a hexameric ring, the hexameric structure of E. coli HslU (Protein Data Bank accession number 1DO0) was used as a template. The Hp ClpXASD subunit overlapped onto each subunit of the HslU hexamer, with the resulting hexameric model of ClpX being energy-minimized. Size Determination of Hp ClpX-ASD in Solution—The ClpXASD was crystallized in the P65 space group, with only one ClpX-ASD molecule in an asymmetric unit, instead of the hexameric ring found in an electron microscopy study (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate the oligomerization state of Hp ClpX-ASD in solution, the molecular size of Hp ClpX-ASD was measured by gel filtration under different buffer conditions. The Hp ClpX-ASD was eluted as a hexamer in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0), but it was eluted as a monomer in the initial crystallization solution (50 mm imidazole and 0.5 m ammonium phosphate at pH 8.0). These results suggest that Hp ClpX-ASD exists as a hexamer in low salt concentrations, but while under the crystallization conditions, it dissociates into a monomer. Overall Structure of Hp ClpX-ASD—The crystal structure of Hp ClpX-ASD has been solved by selenium-multiple anomalous dispersion and refined at resolutions of 3.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively (Table I and Fig. 1). The experimental electron density map, calculated from multiple anomalous dispersion phases and improved by solvent flattening, has sufficient quality to find the correct position of most of the main chains and of the some side chains. Interestingly, a clear electron density was observed near the nucleotide binding region in the experimental map, and modeled into ADP, although ADP was not added during the protein preparation and crystallization. Hp ClpXASD shows the general structural architecture found in the AAA+ superfamily (5.Oruga T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), with two structural domains: the ATPase core domain at the N terminus and the SSD domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The ATPase core domain is composed of a β-sheet of five parallel strands (β1, β2, β3, β6, and β7) surrounded by α-helices (α1–α7 and α10–α11). A conserved tripeptide (LGF), which is responsible for ClpP recognition, is located in the center of the loop (ClpP binding loop) between the α8 and α9 helices of the ATPase domain (Fig. 1, A and D). The SSD domain contains a helical bundle, with three parallel helices (α12, α12′, α13, and α14) and a β-sheet (β8–β10) at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). Four residues at the N terminus and eight residues at the C terminus are disordered. The ATPase and SSD domains are connected by a box VII′ motif (according to the motif designation in Ref. 12.Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a hinge, with relatively loose connections (binding surface area of 488 Å2). The average temperature factor of the residues in the ClpP binding loop is relatively higher than that of the entire molecule, suggesting the flexibility of this loop. There are three disordered regions (residues 180–187, 220–233, and 252–266), mostly in the loops near the center of the hexameric ClpX. Structural Comparison with Homologous Proteins—The structural comparison, using the DALI server (29.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar), reveals that the Hp ClpX has a similar topology to the ATPases of the AAA+ family, such as HslU (18.Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. Mckay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Hauber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), ClpA (17.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 48: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar), NSF (31.Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and FtsH (32.Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Verma C. Karata K. Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33.Niwa H. Tsuchiya D. Makyio H. Yoshida M. Morikawa K. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of these, the E. coli HslU (30.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Hauber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) could be superimposed on the Hp ClpX-ASD, with the lowest r.m.s.d., 1.8 Å, for 263 Cα atoms (Fig. 1B). For the crystal structure of ClpA, which contains two AAA+ domains, the second AAA+ domain (D2) is more similar to ClpX, and can be superposed on Hp ClpX-ASD, with a r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å for 250 Cα atoms (Fig. 1C). A structurebased sequence alignment reveals that the Hp ClpX-ASD and E. coli HslU share a 32.4% sequence identity (Fig. 1D). Therefore, ClpX is most homologous to HslU in its amino acid sequence, as well as in the three-dimensional structure. On the contrary, despite the structural similarity, Hp ClpX-ASD has only a 19.3% sequence identity with ClpA D2. The main differences between Hp ClpX-ASD and E. coli HslU are the presence of a ClpP-binding loop in the ClpX and the structural features in the C-terminal β-sheet. E. coli HslU has two β-strands and an α-helix at the C terminus, whereas there are three β-strands (β8, β9, β10) at the C terminus of Hp ClpX-ASD (Fig. 1A). The last β-strand (β10) of the Hp ClpXASD forms a β-sheet with β8 and β9, which composes the outside wall of the ClpX hexamer (Fig. 2), while the last helix of HslU points toward the protease interface (Fig. 1B). Considering that 8 amino acids in the C terminus of Hp ClpX are invisible in the current structure, the C-terminal end could be extending from the core of SSD domain toward the substrate interface. Unlike HslU, the Clp family is expected to have a ClpP binding loop, with the conserved tripeptide (LIV)-G-(FL) in the loop suggested to be a candidate for the ClpP recognition motif (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Hp ClpX contains the ClpP binding loop, with additional surrounding helices (α8, α9, and α10), which are absent in E. coli HslU (Fig. 1). In the crystal structure of Hp ClpXASD, the LGF peptide is located on the tip of ClpP binding loop, which protrudes from the protease interface surface. The LGF peptide composes a rather straight loop, with no side chain interaction. Interestingly, the loop and surrounding helices (α8–α10) are completely disordered and missing in the ClpA-D2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting flexible movement of this region. As the amino acid sequence of the tripeptide is relatively well conserved among the ClpP binding loops and neighboring helices located between the two conserved motifs, sensor I and box VII (12.Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the LGF peptide might be critical for the initial recognition of ClpP, and the other loops and helices (α8–α10) could act as linkers or be involved in nonspecific binding to the ClpP. These structural interpretations are in agreement with proteolytic (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and mutation experiments (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which proposed that the tripeptide is open to the protease interface surface, and involved in ClpP recognition. The C-terminal residues of HslU, which are missing in ClpX, are thought to take part in protease recognition. Therefore, it can be concluded that HslU and ClpX employ different structural motives for protease recognition and complex formation with the protease core, although they show similar structural architectures. The structural differences described above may partially explain how HslU and ClpX recognize and bind the specific protease cores, HslV and ClpP, respectively. The other structural difference between ClpX and HslU is the presence of an I-domain in the HslU, which might account for their differential substrate recognition (34.Ramachandran R. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Huber R. Bochtler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7396-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In HslU, an I-domain emerges from the ATPase domain to the substrate interface (Fig. 1B). Instead of an I-domain in the HslU, there is a N-terminal Cys cluster domain in the ClpX, although it is missing in this model. Considering the position of the N-terminal residue (Leu75) in the crystal structure of Hp ClpX-ASD, it is possible that an N-terminal Cys cluster domain might be located near the substrate interface surface and involved in substrate recognition (Fig. 1, A and B), as suggested in the proteolysis experiment of ClpX (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Overall, the structure of Hp ClpX-ASD is also similar to E. coli ClpA-D2. While, α12 is connected to α12′ by a large bulge at residues, Gln353–Leu359, in the Hp ClpX-ASD, the corresponding helix is straight in ClpA (Fig. 1, A and C). This bulge in ClpX is involved in additional subdomain contact between the SSD and ATPase domains. Pro355 in the bulge composes the hydrophobic patch with Ile94 and Ile351, which is packed against the adenine ring of the ADP. Lys356 and Asn357 of the bulge in the SSD domain form hydrogen bonds with Asn91 and the carbonyl group of Tyr92 via the water molecules. Interestingly, these features, the bulge between the helices and the inter-residue interaction, are also found in HslU, but not ClpA, suggesting that the subdomain interaction of ClpX is only conserved in HslU. Hp ClpX also contains relatively long helices, α2 and α3, compared with those in HslU and ClpA, which extend toward the substrate interface surface and near the N terminus. Hexameric Assembly of Hp ClpX-ASD—Since E. coli ClpX and E. coli ClpX-ASD were observed as six-membered ring structures, by electron microscopy (7.Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35.Ortega J. Lee H.S. Maurizi M.R. Steven C. A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4938-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the Hp ClpXASD also confirmed to form a hexameric structure in solution, it is appropriate to construct a hexameric model of Hp ClpXASD to explain its biological implication. The hexameric structure of E. coli HslU (Protein Data Bank accession number 1DO0) was used as a template for the modeling of the ClpX hexamer, because ClpX shows high sequence and structural homology with E. coli HslU (Fig. 1). The model was easily constructed by overlapping the ClpX monomer into each subunit of the HslU hexamer, followed by energy minimization. The overall shape and size of the hexameric model of Hp ClpX-ASD (140 Å wide and 70 Å thick) are similar to those of the E. coli ClpX lacking the N-terminal Cys cluster domain, as shown by electron microscopy (150 Å wide and 75 Å thick; compare Fig. 2 in this manuscript and Fig. 5 in Ref. 10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which supports the validation of our resulting model. Viewed along the 6-fold axis, the Hp ClpX ASD is shaped like a toothed wheel, with an empty space inside of the hexamer located between the subunits (Fig. 2A). Because of the disordered loops (180–187 and 220–233) near the center, the hole in the center of the hexameric model of ClpX appears to be a little wider than that observed in HslU (18.Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. Mckay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Hauber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) or ClpA (17.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 48: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A large area of the surface of ClpX is involved in hexamerization: on one face, α4, α5, α12′, α14, and β2, and on the other face, the N-terminal region of α3, α7, α11, β1, and β7 (Figs. 1 and 2). The amino acids in these regions are well conserved in the ClpX family and HslU (Fig. 1D), implying that the hexameric interactions are conserved and supporting the validity of a hexameric model. The SSD domain is mostly involved in a hexameric interaction outside of the ring, while the ATPase domain composes the inside of the ring and contacts the SSD domain of a neighboring subunit (Fig. 2, A and B). The nucleotides near the subunit interface, as well as the subdomain interface, seem to facilitate a hexameric assembly (Fig. 2A). Considering the relative orientation of the ATPase domain and the position of the N-terminal residues, the Cys cluster domain could be located near the apical part of the hexamer, where the I-domain of the HslU is located (Fig. 2, A and B; Ref. 30.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Hauber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), suggesting the Cys cluster might have a functional similarity to the I-domain of HslU in recognizing specific substrates. However, in ClpX, an additional regulating factor, such as SspB, is thought to contribute to the substrate binding with the Cys cluster domain (36.Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 37.Wah D.A. Levchenko I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 14 residues of HslU are known to form a short and well ordered loop and helix for the formation of a HslUV complex and they bind between the subunits of the HslV to induce conformational changes (18.Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. Mckay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, ClpX is considered to have a different mechanism for ClpP recognition. Instead of the C-terminal residues in HslU, the ClpP binding loop of the ClpX, containing the LGF peptide, is responsible for the binding and activation of the ClpP proteolytic subunit (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The ClpP binding loop is exposed on the protease interface surface of the hexamer, with the LGF peptide located on top of the loop, possibly for binding with the ClpP (Fig. 2, A–C). The LGF peptide is located 36 Å from the center of hexamer and 25 Å from the bottom of the protease interface surface. The non-perfect symmetry of the heptameric ClpP structure (8.Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and the presence of hydrophobic clefts on its surface, suggest that the complex formation of ClpXP is possible by the docking of the ClpX to the ClpP through the hydrophobic interaction of the LGF peptide with a hydrophobic cleft on the ClpP (Fig. 2D). High sequence conservations in both the LGF of the ClpX (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the hydrophobic residues in the cleft of ClpP (8.Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) strongly demonstrate that a hydrophobic interaction is important for their interaction. This hypothesis is also strengthened by the fact the hydrophobic cleft on the ClpP is located ∼34 Å (8.Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) from the center, while the LGF peptide is located at 36 Å (Fig. 2). The flexible nature and rather extended shape of the ClpP binding loop, which is ∼25 Å long from the protease interface surface, suggests that this loop spreads over and easily fits into any hydrophobic clefts of the ClpP heptamer rather nonspecifically, making asymmetric binding between the ClpX and ClpP possible. A broad striation shown between the ClpP and ClpX by the electron microscopic image of E. coli ClpXP (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) also indicates that the ClpX and ClpP are connected with a long loop. This type of asymmetric docking was also proposed by a mutation experiment of E. coli ClpX (13.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Binding Site—The nucleotide binding in Clp protease is associated with a multimeric assembly and with hydrolysis inducing conformational change. In ClpA, nucleotide binding of the D1 and D2 domains plays different roles: hexameric assemble in D1 and ATP hydrolysis in D2 (15.Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ClpX contains only one nucleotide binding site, which could play both roles. In the crystal structure and hexameric model it is clear that nucleotide binding promotes the oligomeric assembly, as several residues (Glu139, Glu246, Glu329, and Arg333) of the neighboring symmetry-related subunit are close enough to directly interact with the nucleotide or through water hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3). The residues involved in the interaction with the nucleotide bound to the neighboring subunit are well conserved (Fig. 1D), and the oligomeric assembly facilitated by nucleotide binding seems to be a common feature of ClpX and HslU. In addition to the nucleotide-mediated interaction, many residues are directly involved in the interaction between subunits, suggesting that ClpX should make a hexamer, even in the absence of a nucleotide, as shown in biochemical experiments (10.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of ATP on multimerization can be explained by the extra interaction between the subunits, which is mediated by the nucleotide binding. Conversely, no such interaction is found in ClpA D2. The molecular surface areas of ADP exposed to the surface of the subunit, which could be proportional to the possible interaction with neighboring subunit, are 210.7, 96.0, and 188.9 Å2 for ClpA D1, ClpA D2, and ClpX, respectively, indicating that the contribution of the ADP to the subunit interaction is comparable in ClpA D1 and ClpX. The modulation of ATP hydrolysis in ClpX by substrate or ClpP binding can also be explained by the crystal structure of Hp ClpX-ASD. Arg396 in the sensor-2 motif of the SSD domain, which is proposed to be a substrate binding domain (14.Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), is close to the nucleotide in ATPase domain (Fig. 3). As a result, it is predicted that substrate binding to the SSD domain causes the conformational change of the sensor-2 motif, affecting the ATPase activity through Arg396. This is also true for HslU and ClpA D2, but not for ClpA D1 (17.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 48: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18.Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. Mckay D.

Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). A recent experiment also supports that substrate binding to the SSD domain could modulate the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding activity by demonstrating that the mutations in the SSD domain uncouple the substrate binding from ATP hydrolysis required for unfolding (38.Joshi S.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hp ClpX-ASD also reveals that the sensor I (β6; Fig. 1, A and D) motif, which senses nucleotide binding or hydrolysis (12.Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is located near the nucleotide and directly connected to the ClpP binding loop (Figs. 1A and 3). As a result, it is possible that conformational change of the ClpP binding loop, caused by the binding of ClpP protease, modulates the ATPase activity of ClpX through the sensor I motif. ClpX and HslU show similarities in their sequences, structures, and hexameric assemblies, although their binding partner and binding mode, to the protease or substrate, are considerably different. Conversely, ClpX shows several structural differences from ClpA, which could be primarily due to the presence of two AAA+ domains in the ClpA. A structural difference between the ClpA and ClpX is also manifested in that human mitochondrial ClpP can only bind to E. coli ClpX, but not to ClpA (4.Kang S.G. Ortega J. Singh S.K. Wang N. Huang N. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21095-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, ClpA and ClpX have common ClpP binding loops and an additional N-terminal domain, which might be involved in substrate recognition. The detailed mechanism of ClpXP docking, and the role of ATP hydrolysis, in the conformational change have not been fully elucidated in this report. However, the crystal structure of ClpP-ASD was first described, and the importance of the ClpP binding loop and conserved tripeptide in ClpP recognition was identified, which will contribute to the understanding of the role of ClpX as a modulator of ClpP and their asymmetric interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2004313280,"The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) that is increased in airways of asthmatic subjects markedly induced contraction of human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells embedded in collagen matrices in a Gi-independent manner. Dihydro-S1P, which binds to S1P receptors, also stimulated contractility. S1P induced formation of stress fibers, contraction of individual HASM cells, and stimulated myosin light chain phosphorylation, which was inhibited by the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632. S1P-stimulated HASM cell contractility was independent of the ERK1/2 and PKC signaling pathways, important regulators of airway smooth muscle contraction. However, removal of extracellular calcium completely blocked S1P-mediated contraction and Y-27632 reduced it. S1P also induced calcium mobilization that was not desensitized by repeated additions. Pretreatment with thapsigargin to deplete InsP3-sensitive calcium stores partially blocked increases in [Ca2+]i induced by S1P, yet did not inhibit S1P-stimulated contraction. In sharp contrast, the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil markedly decreased S1P-induced HASM cell contraction, supporting a role for calcium influx from extracellular sources. Collectively, our results suggest that S1P may regulate HASM contractility, important in the pathobiology of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2002898689,"Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation play important roles in the regulation of Smad-mediated functions. Here, we demonstrate that Smad4 is covalently modified by SUMO-1, which was characterized recently as a key modulator of many transcription factors. Sumoylation of Smad4 mainly occurs at lysine 159, located in the linker region, and facilitates Smad-dependent transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we show that the PIAS family proteins, PIAS1 and PIASxβ, function as E3 ligase factors for Smad4. Intriguingly, sumoylation of Smad4 was strongly enhanced by TGF-β-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway but not the Smad pathway. Activation of p38 not only stabilized PIASxβ protein but also enhanced PIASxβ gene expression, suggesting that PIAS-mediated sumoylation of Smad4 is regulated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway. These findings illustrate a novel regulatory mechanism by which Smad-dependent transcriptional activation cooperatively modulates Smad proteins through receptor-mediated phosphorylation and sumoylation.

The cellular effects of TGF-β are mediated by binding type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding and activation, the type II receptor kinase phosphorylates the type I receptor kinase. The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad), Smad2 and Smad3, in the TGF-β/activin pathways. Smads, the central molecules in TGF-β signaling, act as transcription factors or coactivators for regulating target gene expression (4Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of R-Smad additionally creates a complex with the common-mediator Smad (Co-Smad; Smad4). These complexes translocate and accumulate in the nucleus where they are directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of various target genes (5Chen C.R. Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Massague J.

TGF-β also activates members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, including TGF-β-activated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (7Hu P.P.

TGF-β-activated kinase then activates the stress-activated kinase p38, which plays an important role in regulating cellular processes such as inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (11Ichijo H.

Leukemia. 2002; 16: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A recent study (15Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) using a mutant type I receptor, which was incapable of activating the Smad pathway but still retained signaling via the MAP kinase pathway, showed that TGF-β receptor-activated p38 is involved in TGF-β-induced apoptosis but not growth arrest in mouse mammary gland epithelial (NmuMG) cells (15Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Thus, the p38 pathway seems to be sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells, whereas a fully epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition response requires additional TGF-β signaling and possibly requires Smad-mediated transcriptional activation (16Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112 (Pt 24): 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that diverse biological responses regulated by TGF-β are mediated by different downstream signaling pathways, dependent on either Smad or MAP kinase or both. Post-translational modifications regulate the function of many proteins. In the case of Smads, hetero-oligomeric formation by Smads is dependent on phosphorylation of R-Smads. Furthermore, recent findings have underscored critical functions of ubiquitination and acetylation in the control of Smad-dependent gene regulation. Ubiquitination plays a role in regulating Smad function as Smads are rapidly targeted for degradation by the proteasome (17Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 18Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The ultimate degradation of Smads after ligand stimulation has been firmly established as a mechanism to terminate Smad signaling. However, acetylation of Smad7 by coactivator p300, one of the inhibitory Smads (I-Smad), occurs on two lysine residues that are also targeted by ubiquitination and thereby prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation (19Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) have been found, which become covalently linked to lysine residues in target proteins (20Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 21Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). One Ubl, SUMO-1, also known as PIC1, UBL1, sentrin, GMP1, and SMT3, is an 11-kDa protein that is structurally homologous to ubiquitin and is highly conserved from yeast to humans (22Melchior F. Annu.

SUMO-1 modification of protein plays an important role in modulation of transcriptional activity, mediation of nuclear import, recruitment of transcriptional regulators in nuclear domains, protection from ubiquitination, and regulation of mitosis (33Pinsky B.A. Biggins S.

One type of E3 ligases, the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription) family, which is homologous to the yeast Siz family, have a conserved RING finger domain that regulates transactivation by conjugating SUMO-1 in molecules including p53 (30Gostissa M.

Another type of E3 ligase, structurally unrelated to the PIAS/Siz family, is the nucleoporin RanBP2, which sumoylates SP100 (40Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of Smad transcriptional function, we explored the possible modification of Smads by SUMO-1 through post-translational modifications and attempted to define the biological significance of cross-talk between Smad activation and TGF-β signaling. Here, we report that Smad4 is a target for SUMO-1 modification both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we identified PIAS proteins as E3 ligases for sumoylation, which activate Smad4-dependent transcriptional function. Furthermore, the TGF-β-mediated p38 MAP kinase pathway regulates PIAS gene expression and protein stabilization, which thereby enhances Smad4 sumoylation.

Plasmid Construction—pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)-based plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged human Smad2, Smad4, HA-tagged constitutively active TGF-β-type I receptor (TβR-I(T/D)), and p3TP-Luc have been described elsewhere (42Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid of Myc-tagged Smad2 was generated by inserting the Smad2 gene into pcDNA3-Myc. cDNAs encoding human SUMO-1, human UBC9, mouse PIASxβ, and mouse PIAS1 were isolated by RT-PCR with total RNA from HeLa cells or mouse testis. Primer sequences used were as follows: human SUMO-1, 5′-AAAGGATCCCCATGTCTGACCAGGAGGCAAAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGGATCCCTAAACTGTTGAATGACCCCCCG-3′ (reverse); human UBC9, 5′-AAAGGATCCCCATGTCGGGGATCGCCCTCAGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGGATCCTTATGAGGGCGCAAACTTCTTGG-3′ (reverse); mouse PIASxβ, 5′-AAAGAATTCATGGTTTCTAGTTTTAGGGTTTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGAATTCTCACTGTTGCACAGTATCAGAAGAT-3′ (reverse); mouse PIAS1, 5′-AAAGAATTCATGGCGGACAGTGCGGAACTAAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACTCGAGTCAGTCCAATGAGATAATGTCTGG-3′ (reverse). Bold letters in the primers denote restriction sites. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and subcloned into epitope-tagged pcDNA3, pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), or pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to generate pcDNA3-FLAG-PIASxβ, pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-1, pcDNA3-Myc-Ubc9, pGEX-6P-1-Ubc9, -PIASxβ, -pEGFP-PIASxβ, and -PIAS1. The cDNAs for mutant Smad4 with substitution of Lys-159 to Arg, Smad4(K/R), and the PIASxβ RING mutant with substitution of Cys-353 to Ser, PIASxβ(C/S), were created using site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into expression vectors to obtain pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad4(K/R) and pcDNA3-FLAG-PIASxβ(C/S), or pEGFP-PIASxβ(C/S) and pGEX-6P-1-PIASxβ(C/S). Expression plasmids of Smad4-Gal4 DNA binding fusion proteins were generated by inserting these genes into pM (Clontech). MKK6(DE), a constitutively active form of MKK6, and p38-HA expression plasmids have been described elsewhere (43Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The combined mutant type I receptor, TβR-ImL45(T/D), which has a constitutively active kinase domain but lacks the ability to phosphorylate Smads, was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously (15Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). For in vitro sumoylation assays, expression plasmids expressing GST-Myc-Smad4 fusion proteins were generated by inserting these genes into pGEX-6P-1-Myc. The pGEX-6P-1-SUMO(GG), which expresses a form of SUMO-1 with the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids (HSTV) deleted to facilitate conjugation, was generated by using a PCR-based approach as described previously (44Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). pGEX-6P-1-GFP-SUMO(GG) was constructed by inserting the PCR product of a GFP-encoding fragment from pEGFP-C2 into pGEX-6P-1-SUMO(GG). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST-Sua1 and His-Uba2 fusion proteins have been described elsewhere (36Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and in Vitro Sumoylation Analysis—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and affinity purified with glutathione S-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and purification of GST-Sua1 and His-Uba2 in the baculovirus system were performed as described previously (44Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For in vitro sumoylation assays, GST-fused Smad protein substrates were incubated with E1 (GST-Sua1/His-Uba2) and E2 (GST-Ubc9) enzymes and recombinant SUMO(GG) in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. For Western blot analysis, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blot was incubated sequentially with mouse anti-Myc antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations—COS7 cells (1 × 105 per 6-cm-diameter dish) were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 200 μm indole-3-acetic acid, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min. Lysates were first cleared with protein G beads for 30 min, followed by incubation with antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the antibody complexes were captured with protein G beads for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with the same buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted and analyzed by Western blot. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using 2.5 μg of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer in a 20-μl reaction volume. PCR was performed using 1 μl of the reaction mixture for cDNA synthesis in a 10-μl reaction volume of PCR buffer containing 200 μm of each dNTP, 2 μm of each set of primer, and 0.2 units of AmpliTaq at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The sequences of the primers used are mouse PIASxβ, 5′-AGAGAGCTCTTCTGATGAAGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTCACTCCTGCTGCTGGATGAAC-3′ (reverse); SP6, 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAG-3′ (reverse); human GAPDH, 5′-ATG GGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGG-3′ (reverse). An aliquot of PCR products was electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and quantitated by UV-illumination. Pulse-Chase Analysis—COS7 cells were plated to 50% confluency in 6-well dishes, 1 day before transfection. Approximately 24-30 h post-transfection, cells were cultured with methionine/cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) for 30 min and then metabolically labeled with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were chased for the indicated time intervals in complete medium. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer as described above, and soluble extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography, and the relative intensity of each band was quantitated by scanning densitometry. SUMO-1 Modification of Smad4 at Lys-159 in Vivo and in Vitro—SUMO-1 modification of certain transcriptional regulators is stimulated by extracellular environmental insults including cytokines, hormones, heat shock, and irradiation (31Rodriguez M.S.

We investigated whether the SUMO-1 modification system acts on the TGF-β signaling pathway. We first examined whether the transcription factors Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, which are elements of the TGF-β-dependent pathway, are modified by SUMO-1 in TGF-β-treated NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing FLAG-Smads and HA-SUMO-1. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody revealed production of every Smad form in the cell lysates. However, in cells producing ectopic Smad4, an additional more slowly migrating band was observed when cells coexpressed HA-SUMO-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 6). This more slowly migrating band was not detected in cells producing ectopic Smad2 and Smad3 (lanes 1-4), suggesting that Smad4 may be specifically targeted for SUMO-1 modification. To further examine whether Smad4 is indeed a substrate for SUMO-1 modification, we performed an in vitro sumoylation assay using recombinant Smad4 as a substrate. Smad4 has a consensus sumoylation sequence, VKDE, which is conserved among other species (Fig. 1B). We speculated that the Lys-159 in human Smad4 is a likely target for sumoylation. To assess this hypothesis, mutant Smad4, in which lysine 159 was converted to Arg, and wild-type Smad4 were prepared as GST-Myc-Smad4(K/R) and GST-Myc-Smad4 fusion proteins, respectively. These Smad4 proteins were incubated with various combinations of recombinant E1 and E2, together with GST-SUMO(GG) or GFP-SUMO(GG), as shown in Fig. 1B. Analysis of the reaction products by Western blot with anti-Myc antibody revealed a more slowly migrating Smad4 band only when E1 and E2, as well as GST-SUMO(GG), were present. However, the reaction containing Smad4(K/R) did not give rise to the slower migrating form (lane 5), indicating that Lys-159 is a target for modification. To confirm that this slower migrating band was indeed sumoylated Smad4, GFP-SUMO(GG) was substituted for GST-SUMO(GG) in the reaction. As expected, a slightly higher molecular weight form of Smad4 was detected, reflecting the difference in molecular weight of GFP-SUMO(GG) and GST-SUMO(GG) (lanes 6 and 7). These data strongly suggest that Smad4 is a substrate for SUMO-1 and that Lys-159 is a major SUMO-1 conjugation site. To evaluate the state of Smad4 sumoylation in response to TGF-β signaling, expression plasmids containing FLAG-Smad4, FLAG-Smad4(K/R), Myc-Smad2, HA-SUMO-1, and the constitutively active form of the TGF-β type-I receptor, TβR-I(T/D), were cotransfected in various combinations into COS7 cells, as shown in Fig. 1C. Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody revealed the presence of Smad4 in all cells transfected with plasmid expressing FLAG-Smad4 (Fig. 1C, top panel). When SUMO-1 was also expressed, a higher molecular weight form of Smad4 was detected, along with a substantial amount of unmodified Smad4 (Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 4-7, white arrowhead). This form was not present in cells expressing Smad4(K/R) (lanes 8 and 9). Moreover, to determine whether this higher molecular weight form representing Smad4 was conjugated to SUMO-1, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by Western blot using either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The slower migrating form of Smad4 (about 90 kDa) was detected when SUMO-1 was coproduced (Fig. 1C, second panel from top, lanes 4-7, white arrowhead). The filter was then reprobed with anti-HA antibody, demonstrating that the slower migrating form of Smad4 (about 90 kDa) was indeed the sumoylated form (Fig. 1C, third panel from top, white arrowhead). Several SUMO-1-reactive bands migrating slower than SUMO-1-conjugated Smad4 were observed in cells producing Smad4 but not in cells producing Smad4(K/R) (Fig. 1C, third panel from top, lanes 4-7). These bands were not likely to be sumoylated forms of Smad4, because the anti-FLAG antibody did not recognize them (Fig. 1C, second panel from top). Intriguingly, the amount of sumoylated Smad4 was increased when a TβR-I(T/D) expression plasmid was cotransfected, and this was not changed by expressing ectopic Smad2 (Fig. 1C, top three panels, lanes 5 and 7), suggesting that TGF-β signaling plays a role in controlling Smad4 sumoylation, possibly through a pathway independent of TGF-β-mediated Smad activation. Smad4 is a common mediator for members of the TGF-β superfamily, including TGF-β, activins, and BMPs (3Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether SUMO-1 modification of Smad4 has any effect on the TGF-β superfamily-mediated Smad pathway, we examined the effects of wild-type and mutant Smad4(K/R) on expression of a p3TP-Luc reporter gene, which contains a Smad-responsive element in its promoter. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid, together with wild-type or Smad4(K/R) expression plasmids, and then treated with TGF-β or BMP-4. Reporter activity was enhanced by treatment with TGF-β or BMP-4, even in cells not expressing ectopic Smad4 (Fig. 1D). Cells ectopically expressing wild-type Smad4 showed higher reporter gene activity than those expressing Smad4(K/R). This suggests that SUMO-1 modification of Smad4 plays a role in activation of the transcriptional response by the TGF-β superfamily. PIAS Family Proteins Act as E3 Ligases for Smad4 Sumoylation—Recently, two distinct SUMO-1 E3 ligases, PIAS family proteins and RanBP2, have been identified (35Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

The results of a pull-down assay demonstrated that the alignment of amino acids 798-809 of TRPV4 was important in this interaction. TRPV4 and MAP7 colocalized in the lung and kidney. The coexpression of these two molecules resulted in the redistribution of TRPV4 toward the membrane and increased its functional expression. The alignment of amino acids 798-809 of TRPV4 was also important in the functional expression. The activated current was abolished by actin-freezing but not by microtubule-freezing reagents.

The molecular structure that transmits cell surface deformities to ion channels (the mechanosensitive ion channel) has been shown by a number of findings to be in bacterial MscL (1Martinec B.

These channels are monovalent cation channels that are permeable to sodium or potassium. However, the molecular structure of the mammalian calcium-permeable mechanosensitive channel remains obscure. One of characteristics of this channel is its relation to the cytoskeleton. The current of MscL and TREK are increased or unaffected by the disruption of actin microfilaments (5Hamill O.P.

On the other hand, the molecular structure of calcium-permeable mechanosensitive ion channels was not clarified. Great progress in understanding the molecular candidate was made with the cloning and identification of the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1), 1The abbreviations used are: TRPVtransient receptor potential vanilloidCHOChinese hamster ovaryGABACγ-aminobutyric acid (variant C)HEK293human embryonic kidney 203MAP7microfilament-associated protein 7RTreverse transcriptaseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. an ion channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, which has been proposed to function at the transduction step in the nociceptive pathway (14Caterina M.J.

We had expressed TRPV4 in CHO cells but found a poor activity by swelling. We also found that TRPV4 was significantly activated by an inflation of the cell (22Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We next expressed an N-terminal ankyrin or a C-terminal hydrophilic deletion mutant of TRPV4, resulting in a lack of activation. These findings brought us to a hypothesis that more proteins are needed for TRPV4 to be expressed on membrane and to be sensitive to cell deformity only when transfected in these cells. We, therefore, performed a binding study to search for a protein to reconstitute better mechanosensitive expression of TRPV4. Yeast Two-hybrid Screens—Approximately two million clones were screened from a mouse kidney cDNA library constructed in the Gal4 activation domain carrying vector pACTII (Clontech). The library was screened with bait that encoded the predicted intracellular domain of the mouse TRPV4 cloned in the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pAS2-1 (Clontech). The plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Y190, and transformants were selected on triple dropout media (Leu/His/Trp that contained 30 mm 3-amino-triazole) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Positive clones were cotransformed into yeast with either the bait vector or the pACTII vector backbone to confirm interactions. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured using the chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). pACTII vectors with higher activity were recloned into DH5α and amplified for identification. Antibodies—A TRPV4-specific antibody (anti-TRPV4) was raised in a rabbit against a C terminus, as reported elsewhere (21Suzuki M. Ohki G. Mochizuki T. Somlo S. Ishibashi K. Imai M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol.

A MAP7-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to eight C- or N-terminal amino acids (C-terminal TQQTAEVI and N-terminal MDQAKSAE). For coprecipitation and localization, an N-terminal antibody was used. In Vitro Cell-free Binding Assay—The STP3™ (Novagen) was used to generate [35S]methionine-labeled MAP7 protein. TRPV4-His5 fusion proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells and recovered on Ni-NTA beads. The beads were incubated with lysate that contained a 35S-labeled MAP7 protein for 1 h at 45 °C and then washed three times with a buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole). The elution was boiled in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 62 mm Tris (pH 6.8)), and bound proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation and Affinity Purification (Pull-down Assay)— Renal extracts were produced by homogenization in 300 mm sucrose, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. TRPV4/MAP7 complexes were immunoprecipitated by using anti-TRPV4 coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The precipitate and the remaining supernatant were detected by Western blotting that used anti-MAP7 antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+; Amersham Biosciences). To detect the interaction, TRPV4, its deletions, and mouse MAP7 cDNA were recloned to pCDNA3.1/V5-His (Intyle) or pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene), which fused them with penta-histidine (His5) at the C-terminal end or with FLAG at the N-terminal end. For the pull-down assay, extracts of subconfluent HEK293 cells (in a 60-mm dish) were lysed by gentle sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitors. Ni-NTA magnetic beads (Qiagen) were used to pull the complex, which was washed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and eluted in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0). Precipitates and supernatants were detected using the anti-FLAG antibody (anti-FLAG M2; Stratagene). The membrane protein of the cultured cells was collected as follows. Dishes of transfected CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0), and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Surface proteins were then biotinylated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 30 min according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were washed three times in PBS and then lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS (pH 8.0) that contained 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Cell extracts were incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CD4 (Dako) or anti-His5 antibody. Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were removed from a C57BL/6 male and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 15 min. Staining was done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Histomouse-Plus; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). MAP7 was detected using a MAP7 N-terminal specific antibody and visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Histfine; Nichirei). TRPV4 was detected in an adjacent section and visualized using amino ethylcarbazole. Immunofluorescence analysis was done using a kit (Zenon; Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alexa Fluor 488 (green) and Alexa Fluor 555 (red) were viewed through confocal microscopy, and a merge image was constructed (Fluoview; Olympus). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNA-PCR; Takara) with 0.3 μg of RNA as a template. The amplification conditions consisted of 30 cycles of incubation at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primers were designed to detect MAP7 mRNA from the 80th to the 520th nucleotide of the open reading frame. 2The GenBank™ accession number of MAP7 is AB098611, which is identical to NM008635 or AJ242501. Mouse TRPV4 has been reported as SAC1 (accession number AB021875). Electrophysiology—TRPV4 and MAP7 were ligated to pCMV-SPORT1 and transfected to CHO cells with pEGFPN1 (Clontech) as the marker of the expression. Patch clamp recordings were carried out after 2 days according to methods described elsewhere (25Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded at room temperature with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA). To compensate for cell volume, the current was normalized by capacitance of the individual cell (density). The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm HEPES (300 mosmol). The hypo-osmotic solution (200 mosmol) was produced by the addition of water. The whole-cell patch pipette contained a filtered solution of 150 mm CsCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP (pH 7.2; pCa 7.6). Cloning of Binding Protein to TRPV4—Using the C- or N-terminal intracellular domain of TRPV4 (the first 280 and the last 89 amino acids) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult mouse kidney cDNA library, we isolated one clone to the N terminus and 48 clones to the C terminus displaying β-galactosidase activity. Restriction and sequencing analyses revealed that eight of the clones binding to the C terminus, which had stronger β-galactosidase activity, were identical. These included the chaperon, heat-shock, and membrane proteins. Another clone was completely sequenced and was found to be MAP7 (equal to E-MAP-115). Interaction of TRPV4 and MAP7—To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, we examined the interaction of TRPV4 with MAP7 using in vitro and in vivo methods. For in vitro cell-free binding, TRPV4 was expressed as a fusion protein with His5, and MAP7 was produced and labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription and translation. TRPV4-His5 fusion proteins immobilized on beads were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled MAP7 protein. MAP7 bound specifically to immobilized TRPV4-His5 (Fig. 1a) but not to His5 alone, which indicates that they interacted in vitro. We carried out an immunoprecipitation experiment to test whether TRPV4 and MAP7 interact in vivo. Anti-MAP7 and anti-TRPV4 recognized major bands of 85 and 98 kDa, respectively, in the kidney. Renal extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-TRPV4 and then probed with anti-MAP7. The MAP7 was precipitated with anti-TRPV4 but not with control sera or with an excess of antigen (Fig. 1b). Thus, the anti-MAP7 antibody specifically detected the endogenous MAP7. MAP7 and TRPV4 interacted in vitro and in vivo. Interaction was also analyzed by affinity purification using a pull-down assay in which MAP7 was fused with the FLAG protein and expressed in HEK293 cells. The binding site of TRPV4 on MAP7 was also analyzed using deletion mutants. Amino acids downstream of amino acid 809 of TRPV4 were required for the pull-down. Thus, amino acids 785-808 were found to be critical for the binding of MAP7 (Fig. 1c). The amino acid alignment appeared well conserved among TRPV1-6 family members. Localization of MAP7—The expression of MAP7 mRNA was examined using RT-PCR (Fig. 2a). The distribution of MAP7 mRNA in tissue was similar to that of TRPV4, i.e. it occurred in the lung, kidney, brain, and fat, but it was also detected in the liver and the heart, where TRVP4 is absent (data not shown). This distribution of TRPV4 is similar to that reported by others (17Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 18Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 19Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S.

Woolf C.J. Crowther D. Sanseau P. Tate S.N. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We next compared the distribution of MAP7 and TRPV4 in sections of mouse tissues. Colocalization was suggested by results in continuous sections in ependymal cells in the choroid plexus, the luminal membrane of renal tubule, and the basolateral membrane of alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 2b). Colocalization was evident in bronchial (Fig. 2b, yellow) and renal cortical tubular cells (Fig. 2c). The bright staining in glomeruli in the renal cortex was an artifact caused by our method. Colocalization was less marked in the other cells, such as some neurons, which may be a reflection that MAP7 does not bind to TRPV4 or, alternatively, that MAP7 may perform a different function in this region. Subcellular Localization of TRPV4 by MAP7—Before the coexpression study, we searched cultured cells without the endogenous interactive molecules. MAP7 mRNA was widely detected in excitable neuronal or vascular cells as well as in epithelial cells, including HEK293, but not in CHO cells (Fig. 3a). To investigate the possibility that MAP7 controls the subcellular localization of TRPV4, we expressed TRPV4 and MAP7 in CHO cells. Representative cells with the TRPV4 antibody (Fig. 3b, left panel, green) or MAP7 (Fig. 3b, center panel, red) are shown along with the merge image (Fig. 3b, right panel). There are two cells in each panel of Fig. 3b. TRPV4 alone was expressed in the cell on the right in each panel of Fig. 3b, whereas TRPV4 and MAP7 were coexpressed in the cell shown on the left in each panel of Fig. 3b. The expression the TRPV4 by itself produced diffuse surface staining (Fig. 3b, green, cell on the right in each panel). Coexpression of TRPV4 with MAP7 (Fig. 3b, red, cell on the left in each panel) resulted in a remarkable change in the distribution of TRPV4. TRPV4, co-localized with MAP7, was brought toward the membrane surface (white in the merged image, Fig. 3b). To clarify surface expression, we collected membrane protein by biotinylation. Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate is a molecule that binds to membrane surface amino acids and was collected as a streptavidin conjugate. Compared with membrane protein CD4, TRPV4 is poorly expressed on the membrane when it is transfected alone. TRPV4 colocalized with MAP7 revealed an increase in the TRPV4 signal of the membrane fraction. Thus, MAP7 bound to TRPV4 and regulated TRPV4 surface expression (Fig. 3c). Electrophysiological Analysis of TRPV4 with MAP7—In addition to the expression of TRPV4 toward the membrane surface, we speculated that MAP7 contributed mechanical transmission through actin microfilaments. The electrophysiological measurement of the activity of TRPV4 was designed to investigate its functional consequence and relevance to actin by coexpression. The osmolality of the bath solution was changed from 300 to 200 and then to 400 mosmol. The basal currents of TRPV4 with MAP7 and TRPV4 alone were not much different. However, the current evoked by hypo-osmolality (from 300 to 200 mosmol) was altered dramatically (Fig. 4a). The current produced by TRPV4 with MAP7 became steeply sensitive to the hypo-osmolality. A state of hyper-osmolality (to 400 mosmol) diminished the activated current, but no less than did basal current. Currents evoked by hypo-osmolality in TRPV4 alone or TRPV4 with MAP7 showed that the two molecules induced a remarkable outward rectified conductance (Fig. 4b). The activated current was blocked by 0.1 μm ruthenium red (26Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The ruthenium red-responsive current of TRPV4 deletion mutants with MAP7 met the results of protein binding study by swelling (Fig. 4c). To elucidate the interaction of cytoskeletal fibers, the evoked current of TRPV4 with MAP7 was examined with reagents in pipette fill. The actin-modifying reagents cytochalasin B (10-6m), taxol (10-5m), and phalloidine (10-6m) abolished the activation, whereas the microtubule-freezing reagents colchicine (10-5m) and vincristin (10-6m) did not influence it. Therefore, the activation of TRPV4 with MAP7 by swelling requires actin microfilaments but not microtubules (Fig. 4c). We examined the swelling-activated current in TRPV4- or vehicle-transfected CHO and HEK293 cells in the same settings. The entire cellular current was measured in a bath solution from 300 to 200 mosmol, through 240 mosmol, and then returning to 320 mosmol. The current density of TRPV4 in HEK293 was significantly activated by 200 mosmol and decreased by 320 mosmol. In contrast, the density was not significantly altered in CHO cells (Fig. 4d). Biochemical Interaction of MAP7 and TRPV4—Although the MAP family was first cloned as a protein associated with microtubules (27Kuznetsov S.A. Rodionov V.I. Gilfand V.I. Rosenblat V.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a subsequent study suggested its ability to interact with actin microfilaments (28Arakawa T. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11730-11734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAP7, which is identical to E-MAP-115 (29Masson D. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 123: 357-371Google Scholar), is a novel member that is widely expressed in differentiated epithelial cells. MAP7 may play a role in mature rather than immature epithelial cells and may contribute to epithelial polarity (30Fabre-Jonca N. Allaman J.M. Radlgruber G. Meda P. Kiss J.Z. French L.E Masson D. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The MAP family has been linked to microfilament channels as well. MAP1-B is an example of this, because it promotes GABAC receptors in the cytoskeleton in retinal synapse (31Jonathan G.H. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Fiona K. Bedford N. Brandon J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Although the colocalization of MAP7 and TRPV4 in the same cell was suggested by our results (Fig. 3b), we did not detect any intracellular colocalization of the two molecules in situ. Because MAP7 is rich in microtubules (27Kuznetsov S.A. Rodionov V.I. Gilfand V.I. Rosenblat V.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the detection of cell surface interaction required monoclonal or equivalent antibodies. Thus, the visualization of both molecules in the same section awaits further study. The results of our series of immunoprecipitation, pull-down assay, and histological findings indicated that MAP7 is an associated protein of TRPV4. But MAP7 occurred in the liver (Fig. 2), whereas TRPV4 did not. Thus, MA7 is considered to be distributed more widely than TRPV4 and to play other roles. This is the case with MAP1-B, which is distributed more widely than GABAC (31Jonathan G.H. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Fiona K. Bedford N. Brandon J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The coexpression of MAP7 and TRPV4 resulted in the surface expression of TRPV4 (Fig. 3). This is also the case with MAP1-B. The coexpression of GABAC and MAP1-B promoted their appearance at the cell surface (31Jonathan G.H. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Fiona K. Bedford N. Brandon J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The surface expression that we saw was suggested by fluorescence images. However, these results did not fully indicate the colocalization of two molecules. On the other hand, membrane expression was enhanced by cotransfection of MAP7 and TRPV4 and collecting the membrane fraction using biotinylation. This method is more reliable than ultracentrifugation, as has been suggested in an experiment with channel trafficking (33Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44278-44284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MAP7 interacts with the C terminus of TRPV4. Our pull-down assay and functional study suggested the importance of amino acids 789-809. However, the motif of the binding domain was not predicted by the BLOCK program and is still unknown. We hope to search for the motif by using mutants in a future study. Functional Interaction of MAP7 and TRPV4—The MAP family is phosphorylated on various sites (34Mayer H.E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MAP7 was involved in the activation of TRPV4 by swelling, because the current density was significantly reduced when there was no ATP in the pipette (data not shown). However, the current of TRPV4 in HEK293 (18Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) or CHO (19Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) cells was not significantly changed by the removal of ATP from the pipette. Nonetheless, TRPV4 was also activated by a reaction using tyrosine phosphorylation (34Mayer H.E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which is a protein kinase C analogue in HEK293 cells (26Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Thus, the direct phosphorylation of MAP7 or its indirect modification by another kinase is involved in the mechanism of mechanogating, although the process remains unclear. This mechanism may underlie the differing TRPV4 response of expressed cells to hypo-osmolality. TRPV4 was more highly activated in HEK293 cells than in CHO cells, possibly because HEK293 cells contain endogenous MAP7 (Fig. 4d). The difference observed in the present study is not opposed to the findings of Liedtke et al. (19Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), who used CHO cells and saw an activated current of 400 pA, which corresponds to a density of ∼10 pA/pF. However, number of recent studies have used HEK293 cells, which exhibit a larger current. The discrepancy of the activation by hypo-osmolality is explained by the endogenous MAP7 in HEK293 cells. The dependence of functional expression in the cells is also observed in the heat activation study. Neither we nor Liedtke et al. (19Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) observed any heat activation of rodent TRPV4, although it was observed in HEK293 cells (18Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). HEK293 is an epithelial cell line that was isolated from the kidney, where TRPV4 mRNA is abundant. It is therefore possible that HEK293 cells contain a larger volume of the components necessary to support TRPV4 expression. In contrast, CHO cells are cells derived from ovary cells, which exhibit small channel currents. This hypothesis also support results regarding the reconstitution of the molecules. Endothelial cells, which showed a swelling-activated cation current (36Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 18: 1415-1459Crossref Scopus (763) Google Scholar), contained TRPV4 but not MAP7 mRNA (Fig. 3). Given that a difference in mechanosensitivity was indicated in different cells, the combination of TRPVs with molecules of the MAP subfamily may contribute the mechanosensitive calcium-permeable cation channel complex. The mechanosensitive molecular complex could be compared with the known channel complex, MEC/DEG/ENaC. MEC-4 and MEC-10 produce an amiloride-sensitive stretch-activated ion channel, which is connected to microtubules via MEC-2. In the presence of MEC-2, the activity of the MEC-4/MEC-10 channel increases 40-fold (37Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagen R. Yao A.A. Chalffe M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Likewise, MAP7 links TRPV4 to microfilaments, resulting in an increase in activity by, at the least, lowering the threshold of mechanosensation to membrane surface deflection. Thus, the mechanosensitive complex may generally require both the channel and the linking molecule to play a physiological role. However, TRPV4 with MAP7 did not appear in the stretch-activated channel. We obtained a single channel recording on TRPV4 and MAP7-transfected CHO cells. Although we were able to find a susceptible cation channel, it was not similar to the stretch-activated channels is situ. This result is compatible with that observed in HEK cells (18Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The mechanosensitiveness of TRPV4 has been suggested in vivo (22Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 23Alessandri-Haber N. Yeh J.J. Boyd A.E. Parada C.A. Chen X. Reichling D.B. Levine J.D. Neuron. 2003; 31: 497-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and in vitro. Recently, investigations of the mechanism under the swelling-induced activation of TRPV4 were developed that explain how swelling of the cell-activated tyrosine kinase (35Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11520-11527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or prostaglandin (26Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H.

Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 242: 434-438Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar) cascade results in the direct activation of the TRPV4 channel. There can be variable mechanisms under the signal transduction of cell swelling in variable tissues (39Sarkadi B. Parker J.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1991; 1071: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, deformity in the cell may transmit the signal to actin and then activate TRPV4 through MAP7 in certain cells. This possibility should be clarified in future studies. Ours is the first article to report an associated protein of TRPV4. By linkage with MAP7, TRPV4 becomes functionally active by an increase in the membrane expression. Because MAP7 is a protein that is associated with cytoskeletal filaments, this linkage may underlie the mechanism of mechanosensitiveness to cell deformity.

https://openalex.org/W2084701475,"Cannabinoids activate several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily including p44 and p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We used N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) to examine the signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of ERK. ERK phosphorylation (activation) was measured by Western blot. The EC50 for stimulation of ERK phosphorylation was 10 nm, and this effect was blocked by pertussis toxin and the CB1 (cannabinoid) receptor antagonist SR141716A. The MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U0126 blocked ERK phosphorylation, as did the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 and the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 partially occluded the response but also decreased basal levels of phospho-ERK. The PI 3-kinase and Src pathways are known to promote cell survival in many systems; therefore, MTT (1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan) conversion was used to examine the effects of these inhibitors on cellular viability. LY 294002 decreased the number of viable cells after 18 h of treatment; therefore, the inhibition of ERK by this inhibitor is probably because of cytotoxicity. Forskolin blocked ERK phosphorylation with an EC50 of <3 μm, and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 enhanced ERK phosphorylation. c-Raf phosphorylation at an inhibitory PKA-regulated site (Ser259) was also reduced by WIN. This is probably due to constitutive phosphatase activity because WIN did not directly stimulate PP1 or PP2A activity when measured using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate as a fluorogenic substrate. These data implicate the inhibition of PKA as the predominant pathway for ERK activation by CB1 receptors in N1E-115 cells. PI 3-kinase and Src appear to contribute to ERK activation by maintaining activation of kinases, which prime the pathway and maintain cellular viability.

Although cannabinoids have been used both medicinally and recreationally for thousands of years, only recently have the receptors and signaling cascades responsible for the physiological effects of these drugs and the endogenous brain cannabinoids been elucidated. This is primarily because the receptors were only identified recently and selective potent agonists and antagonists have only been available for a short time. Three endogenous lipid-derived ligands (endocannabinoids) have been characterized to date. These include anandamide (1.Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D.

Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar), whereas a third subtype has been characterized in the vasculature and in the brains of CB1 receptor knock-out mice (6.Jarai Z. Wagner J.A. Varga K. Lake K.D. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Zimmer A.M. Bonner T.I. Buckley N.E. Mezey E. Razdan R.K. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both CB1 and CB2 couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (8.Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar), although non-receptor-mediated forms of cannabinoid signaling have been reported previously (9.Felder C.C. Veluz J.S. Williams H.L. Briley E.M. Matsuda L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 838-845PubMed Google Scholar). Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids regulate synaptic transmission at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and participate in long term plasticity (reviewed in Ref. 10.Gerdeman G.L. Lovinger D.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptor antagonists may also have therapeutic potential in disorders including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and stroke (reviewed in Ref. 11.Croxford L.J. CNS Drugs. 2003; 17: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). cannabinoid receptor 1 adenylate cyclase [d-Ala(2)]deltorphin II and [d-Pen(2,5)]enkephalin extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan protein phosphatase 1 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine protein phosphatase 2A 4,5-phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate-activated protein kinase/protein kinase A protein kinase C WIN 55,212-2 analysis of variance. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC) through Gi coupling was the first intracellular signal transduction pathway implicated in CB1 receptor signaling (8.Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of AC can occur through both α and βγ subunits depending on the isoforms of AC expressed by the cells (12.Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 13.Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Cannabinoids increase cAMP production in CHO cells expressing AC II, IV, or VII through βγ subunits but decrease activity in cells expressing AC I, V, VI, and VIII (14.Rhee M.H. Bayewitch M. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Vogel Z. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, cannabinoids have been linked to sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation in glial and glioma cells (15.Guzman M. Galve-Roperh I. Sanchez C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cannabinoids also inhibit calcium channel function (16.Pan X. Ikeda S.R. Lewis D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 707-714PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Twitchell W. Brown S. Mackie K. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and increase K+ conductance (18.Deadwyler S.A. Hampson R.E. Bennett B.A. Edwards T.A. Mu J. Pacheco M.A. Ward S.J. Childers S.R. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 121-134PubMed Google Scholar), which can decrease neuronal excitability and may contribute to synaptic plasticity. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is also activated by cannabinoids (19.Wartmann M. Campbell D. Subramanian A. Burstein S.H. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ERK regulates proliferation, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity and is activated through a myriad of diverse signals. Growth factors frequently use tyrosine kinases to signal, resulting in Ras-dependent activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Raf (20.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptors can “hijack” this tyrosine kinase pathway by protease-mediated transactivation (21.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 22.Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or may employ G-protein-stimulated protein kinases to directly phosphorylate signaling intermediates, including Shc and Raf. G-protein βγ-subunits can also regulate ERK through arrestin and Src-dependent pathways (23.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In addition, βγ subunits may activate ERK through PI 3-kinase as a signaling intermediate. This Src-independent pathway was recently described in human astrocytoma cells stimulated with CB1 receptor agonists (24.Galve-Roperh I. Rueda D. Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Raf represents a point of convergence for multiple signaling pathways that activate ERK. Raf phosphorylates the dualspecificity kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates ERK at tyrosine and threonine residues in the activation domain (25.Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these effects appear to be cell type-specific. cAMP activates ERK in cells expressing B-Raf (26.Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) while inhibiting ERK activation in cells expressing c-Raf/Raf-1 (27.Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 28.Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In addition to PKA, PKC, Src, AKT, casein kinase I, and p21-activated kinase are also capable of phosphorylating Raf (29.Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of each of the multiple phosphorylations is not completely understood, dephosphorylation of the PKA site Ser259 appears to be absolutely required for c-Raf activation (30.Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol.

CB1 receptors couple negatively to AC, which may mediate ERK activation in cells expressing c-Raf (e.g. relief of tonic inhibition produced by basal PKA activity). The present experiments were performed to determine the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for ERK activation by cannabinoids in N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells. Pharmacological and biochemical approaches were used to examine the role of PKA, PI 3-kinase, Src, and PKC in CB1-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. These data indicate that multiple signals generated by constitutively activated kinases and phosphatases contribute to CB1-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Basal activation of Src and PI 3-kinase contribute to ERK activation, but adenylate cyclase activation completely abolishes CB1 signaling to ERK. These data implicate inhibition of adenylate cyclase and dephosphorylation of c-Raf in ERK activation by cannabinoids in cells of neural origin. Reagents—Anti-phospho ERK, anti-phospho AKT, and anti-phospho-c-Raf Ser259 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-ERK and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit were purchased from Sigma. WIN 55,212-2, DPDPE, PP2, and GF 109203X were purchased from Tocris (Avonmouth, Bristol, United Kingdom). SR141716A was from the National Institute of Mental Health chemical synthesis program. Protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, MTT, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were obtained from Sigma. Forskolin, PD 98059, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—N1E-115 cells (ATCC CRL-2263) were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose with pyridoxine-HCl and sodium pyruvate, Invitrogen catalogue 10313) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were subcultured at weekly intervals. Kinase Activation Assays—Cells (105) were plated in 24-well cell culture dishes, incubated for 24–48 h, and serum-starved for 12–24 h prior to assay. Cells were treated with WIN in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin as a carrier and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5–60 min. In experiments where antagonists were used, cells were pretreated with the antagonist for 5 min prior to stimulation. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with LY 294002, PP2, U0126, PD 98059, forskolin, and GF 109203X. For experiments with pertussis toxin inactivation of Gi/o, cells were treated for 12 h with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin in complete medium. Cells were then serumstarved in the presence of pertussis toxin for an additional 12 h. All of the stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO, and dilutions were prepared with Me2SO concentrations kept constant (0.1–0.2%). The assay was terminated by aspirating the medium, by placing the cells on dry ice, and with the addition of lysis buffer (phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8). Cells were lysed by freezethawing and briefly sonicated to shear the DNA. Protein levels were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were diluted with 2× sample buffer (0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 2.5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8) (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min before loading. Protein (10 μg) was fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using either Daiichi precast gels or a triple-wide electrophoresis apparatus (CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA). Samples from replicate experiments (Figs. 4 and 5) were analyzed on the same Western blot to reduce variability. Parallel gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify loading, sample integrity, and protein separation (data not shown). Proteins were transferred overnight (50 mA) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection (35.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.3 and probed at 4 °C overnight (phospho-ERK, 1:1000, total ERK, 1:40,000, c-Raf Ser259, 1:1000, phospho-AKT, 1:1000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used for detection at a dilution of 1:2000. Secondary antibody incubations were for 2 h, and membranes were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, between antibody incubations. Peroxidase activity was detected using chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chemiluminescence was imaged using a Kodak Image Station 1000, and net intensity values were plotted using Origin (Microcal).Fig. 5Expanded concentration-response analysis of WIN-stimulated p42 ERK phosphorylation in the presence of PP2.A, PP2 decreased basal ERK phosphorylation and decreased WIN-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Cells were pretreated with PP2 for 30 min and stimulated with WIN (1–100 nm) for 10 min. Quantification of p42 intensity and sigmoidal fit of three replicate experiments is shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MTT Conversion Assay—Viability was assayed by MTT conversion (36.Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well Costar plates (3000/well for log-phase experiments, 6000/well for experiments performed on confluent cultures) and allowed to adhere overnight or grown to confluence where indicated. Cells were treated with inhibitors, forskolin, or Me2SO in serum-free medium. After 30 min (to simulate pretreatment conditions used for activation assays) or 18 h of incubation, MTT was added to each well (0.5 mg/ml, final concentration) and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was aspirated with a beveled needle, and formazan product was solubilized in 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol. MTT conversion (A550–A690) was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX Plus, Molecular Devices). Phosphatase Activity—PP1 and PP2A activity were measured using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were treated as described above and lysed on ice with protease inhibitors, 0.1% Tween 20, and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Membrane proteins were prepared by homogenization on ice with a Dounce homogenizer in 250 mm sucrose in the presence of protease inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Membrane proteins were resuspended in protease inhibitors, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0. 10 μg of protein was added to equal volumes of 2× reaction buffer and requisite cofactors (2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm MgCl2 for PP1 or 1 mm NiCl2 for PP2A) in the substrate-coated assay wells. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphatase activity was determined fluorometrically using excitation/emission wavelengths of 358/452 nm, respectively, with a SpectraMAX Gemini microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Preliminary experiments were performed with PP1- and PP2A-selective inhibitors to validate the assay, and the inhibitors blocked phosphatase activity (data not shown). Data Analysis—Data were normalized to the control samples from the same cell culture plate for presentation; however, statistics were performed on the net intensity or raw absorbance values. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using Origin (Microcal) and considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05. Concentration-response data were fit to a logistic equation, and EC50 values were calculated using Origin. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 is a potent activator of ERK in N1E-115 cells. Serum-starved cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of WIN, and ERK phosphorylation was measured by Western blot using a phospho-specific antibody. ERK was weakly stimulated at 5 min and showed signs of desensitization after 60 min (Fig. 1A). A 20-min treatment with WIN produced robust ERK activation but was not linear with respect to WIN concentration. ERK phosphorylation was linear with respect to WIN concentration after 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 1A); therefore, all of the subsequent experiments were performed at this time point. The rising portion of the concentration-response curve (up to 100 nm) was fit to a logistic equation, and the EC50 for ERK activation was ∼10 nm with a steep slope for activation that is characteristic of activation by a G-protein-coupled receptor (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylated ERK could also be detected by gel shift in the same samples run on parallel gels run under continuous acrylamide and pH conditions (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The amount of hyperphosphorylated (gel-shifted) ERK was in agreement with that detected using the phospho-specific antibody. The linear response occurred between 1 and 100 nm and decreased at concentrations above 1 μm, suggesting desensitization. ERK activation by WIN was abolished by preincubation with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (Fig. 2A), implicating the CB1 receptor in the response. SR141716A also reduced basal levels of active ERK (Fig. 2A). N1E-115 cells produce the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (data not shown); therefore this inhibition by SR141716A is probably because of autocrine activation of the ERK pathway by endocannabinoids. Pretreatment (18 h) with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin also blocked ERK activation by WIN, indicating that a G-protein of the Gi/o class is responsible for signaling to ERK (Fig. 1B). Consistent with recent observations (24.Galve-Roperh I. Rueda D. Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), ERK activation by 10 nm WIN is partially abolished by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 (50 μm, Fig. 3A). However, this inhibitor also reduced basal levels of active ERK in serumstarved cells (control versus LY 294002 alone, p < 0.05 by ANOVA), resulting in a 1.7-fold ERK activation by WIN in the presence of LY 294002. Inhibitors of MEK (U0126 and PD 98059, 1 and 50 μm, respectively) completely blocked WIN-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C), which suggests that ERK activation occurs through a traditional Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and not through inhibition of an ERK phosphatase. The Src inhibitor PP2 also partially inhibited ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3D); however, the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X did not block WIN-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). ERK activation was completely abolished by pretreatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and enhanced in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 3, F and G). Inhibition by LY 294002 and PP2 was incomplete when cells were treated with 10 nm WIN, and these inhibitors alone reduced basal ERK phosphorylation. We therefore reasoned that the effect of these inhibitors may be on basal ERK phosphorylation, which would produce a rightward shift in the doseresponse curve in the linear portion. We tested both PP2 and LY 294002 at 10 and 50 μm, respectively, against concentrations of WIN up to 100 nm. ERK activation was not completely abolished by either inhibitor (Figs. 4 and 5, A and B), and the data suggest that the dose-response curve is shifted because basal activity is decreased. Cannabinoids are known to activate the PI 3-kinase-dependent AKT pathway (37.Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We did not observe CB1-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT Thr308 in N1E-115 cells (data not shown); however, AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was completely blocked by LY 294002 pretreatment (Fig. 4C), indicating that the concentration of inhibitor used was sufficient to block PI 3-kinase activity. Therefore, PI 3-kinase and Src activities seem to be required for basal priming of the signaling pathway but full activation requires a second signal. Initial experiments with pharmacological inhibitors indicated that forskolin can inhibit and H-89 can enhance CB1-stimulated ERK activation. We examined this effect on the initial linear portion of the WIN concentration-response curve. Forskolin (10 μm) completely abolished ERK activation at all of the concentrations of WIN tested while H-89 (10 μm) enhanced ERK activation at 10, 30, and 100 nm (Fig. 6A). Dideoxy forskolin did not change WIN-stimulated ERK activation (data not shown). Forskolin also abolished activation of ERK by the Gi/o-coupled δ-opioid receptor agonist DPDPE (Fig. 6B). We determined the EC50 for forskolin inhibition of WIN-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 6C). Concentrations of <3 μm were sufficient to inhibit WIN-stimulated ERK activation with near-maximal inhibition at 10 μm. We then examined the ability of H-89 to block forskolin-induced inhibition of WIN-stimulated ERK activation. H-89 was able to reverse the effect of forskolin (Fig. 6D), suggesting that PKA is responsible for inhibition of ERK activation. Because c-Raf is a PKA substrate and phosphorylation of c-Raf by PKA negatively regulates activity, we used a phospho-specific antibody to probe for dephosphorylation of Ser259. Dephosphorylation at this site is required for c-Raf activation (30.Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we observed a concentration-dependent decrease in Ser259 phosphorylation with WIN stimulation that was inversely related to ERK activation (Fig. 6E). Cannabinoids are known to inhibit cAMP production in N1E-115 cells (38.Zhou D. Song Z.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in the closely related NG108–15 cell line (8.Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar), but the effect of cannabinoids on the activity of phosphatases that remove the Ser259 phosphate have not been described. We examined PP1 and PP2A activity using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate as a substrate. Activity was measured in total protein preparations (Fig. 7A) and in membrane preparations (Fig. 7B). Treatment with WIN (100 nm) did not change either PP1 or PP2A activity. These data indicate that CB1 receptor stimulation does not directly activate PP1 or PP2A but may perturb the balance between constitutively active PKA and PP1 or PP2A. We next examined the effects of the pharmacological agents used in ERK activation experiments on cellular viability because the decrease in basal ERK activation observed with LY 294002 and PP2 could induce cell death or cause cell cycle arrest. Whereas the cells used in the ERK assays were only treated for 30 min with the inhibitors, it is probable that the initial signal that would subsequently lead to cell death would be generated in that time. Cells were treated for either 30 min or 18 h with LY 294002, U0126, PD 98059, forskolin, and PP2. Viability was modestly enhanced (5%) by forskolin and significantly reduced by LY 294002 (Fig. 8B) at 18 h, but there was no acute change in metabolic activity after 30 min of inhibitor treatment (Fig. 8A). PP2 (10 μm) and the MEK inhibitor U0126 (1 μm) also reduced viability at 18 h, but this is probably the result of decreased proliferation and not cell death because the viability of confluent cells was not affected by PP2 or U0126 treatment (Fig. 8C). LY 294002 was also toxic to confluent cells (Fig. 8C). Because LY 294002 showed significant toxicity at the 50 μm concentration, we performed the experiment again with lower drug concentrations (Fig. 8D). Concentrations as low as 5 μm significantly reduced cell viability, indicating that N1E-115 cells are dependent on PI 3-kinase for survival. ERK activation by the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55212-2 is mediated by CB1 receptor signaling through Gi/o proteins in N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells. A schematic diagram of this pathway is shown in Fig. 9. Multiple basally activated pathways contribute to ERK activation including PI 3-kinase, Src, and protein phosphatases, but receptor-stimulated inhibition of adenylate cyclase/PKA is absolutely required for ERK activation. Basal PI 3-kinase activity is a prerequisite for ERK activation by WIN. Although WIN-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was occluded by LY 294002 at lower WIN concentrations, levels were near control at the 100 nm concentration. PI 3-kinase activates the pro-survival AKT pathway (39.Dudek H. Datta S.R Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar), and N1E-115 cells are dependent on PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling for viability (Fig. 8). The concentration of LY 294002 used was sufficient to completely block WIN-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and induce cell death within 18 h. Therefore, PI 3-kinase appears to be required for WIN stimulation of ERK in N1E-115 cells in as much as the pathway provides a priming activity present in healthy viable cells. Inhibition of Src activity decreased basal ERK phosphorylation, and WIN stimulation increased this over basal levels. However, unlike cells treated with LY 294002, the amount of activation never reached the level observed with WIN alone at the same concentration. This suggests that Src activity may be required to maximally activate ERK. We did not find any evidence for WIN-stimulated Src activity when assayed using phospho-specific antibodies against both the stimulatory and inhibitory Src phosphorylation sites (data not shown). Galve-Roperh et al. (24.Galve-Roperh I. Rueda D. Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) described a similar effect of Src inhibition on ERK activation, and they concluded that Src was not required for ERK activation by cannabinoids. Using hippocampal slices, Derkinderen et al. (40.Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) arrived at a similar conclusion, suggesting a scaffolding, non-catalytic role for the Src family kinase Fyn in CB1-stimulated ERK activation in hippocampal slices. Src regulates multiple basal cellular functions including proliferation and adhesion. Transformed cells are frequently mutated in pathways that control proliferation and differentiation, and this may be the source of high basal Src activity. Src appears to be required for cell cycle progression in N1E-115 cells, because Src inhibition decreased MTT conversion in log-phase cells but not in confluent cultures. Adhesion and focal adhesion kinase activation are another source of active Src (41.Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase can converge with G-protein-coupled receptors (42.Miranti C.K. Ohno S. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10571-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, adherent, transformed cells have basal Src activity that may augment or cooperate with CB1 receptors in ERK activation. This activity may be required for maximal ERK activation by CB1 receptors. Although all of these pathways provide basal or priming activity of the pathway, receptor-stimulated inhibition of the cAMP/PKA is required for ERK activation. Inhibition of PKA has been implicated in CB1-mediated retraction of neurites (38.Zhou D. Song Z.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in N1E-115 cells and in ERK activation in hippocampal slices (40.Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PKA pathway is known to antagonize growth factor-stimulated ERK activation in several systems, whereas increasing adenylate cyclase activity activates ERK in cells of neural origin (26.Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 43.Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3722-3728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This is because of a high level of expression of B-Raf in neurons. However, the involvement of PKA in negative regulation of ERK activation by cannabinoids may not apply only to cells expressing c-Raf. ERK activation by cannabinoids is also antagonized by cAMP analogues in neurons (40.Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where forskolin is known to activate ERK (29.Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 43.Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3722-3728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) through B-Raf. ERK activation was also increased basally by H-89 and adenosine 3′,5′ cyclic phosphothioate-Rp in hippocampal slices (40.Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this study did not examine the additive effects of inhibition of PKA and cannabinoid receptor stimulation. Activation of ERK by cannabinoids may therefore occur through inhibition of adenylate cyclase in neuronal and non-neuronal cells regardless of the predominant Raf isoform expressed. Raf represents an attractive target for signal integration. c-Raf is phosphorylated by PKA at three residues: Ser43, Ser259, and Ser621. Phosphorylation of these residues inhibits enzyme activity (27.Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 28.Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A.

Ser338 is phosphorylated by p21-activated kinase, and the p21-activated kinase/PKC/Src-phosphorylated 338SSYY341 region of c-Raf regulates its association with MEK (29.Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Inhibition of basal tyrosine phosphorylation at this site by treating cells with PP2 may be partially responsible for the decrease we observed in WIN-stimulated ERK activation in the presence of PP2. We examined Ser259 because multiple studies implicate dephosphorylation of this site as an absolute requirement for c-Raf activation (30.Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N.

Decreased phosphorylation of this site, combined with high basal phosphatase activity, appears to be essential for ERK activation by WIN. These data are in contrast to observations in human astrocytoma cells (24.Galve-Roperh I. Rueda D. Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) where a Src-, epidermal growth factor receptor-, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-independent but PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway leading to ERK activation was described. Cannabinoids are less potent inhibitors of adenylate cyclase isoforms expressed by C6 glioma cells than those expressed by NG108–15 neuroblastoma cells or N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells (8.Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Rhee M.H. Bayewitch M. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Vogel Z. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibition of AC by the CB1 receptor may not be the predominant pathway for ERK activation in cells of glial origin. Galve-Roperh et al. (24.Galve-Roperh I. Rueda D. Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) also used the synthetic agonist HU-210, which may activate different G-protein coupled pathways than those activated by WIN (44.Glass M. Northup J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ERK can modulate transcription, translation, synaptic vesicle fusion, and cytoskeletal dynamics, suggesting a role for cannabinoid-stimulated ERK in transcription-dependent and independent forms of plasticity. CB1 receptor stimulation in striatum and hippocampus activates ERK and leads to the phosphorylation of downstream transcription factors (40.Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Valjent E. Pages C. Rogard M. Besson M.J. Maldonado R. Caboche J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 342-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ERK activation by cannabinoids may regulate transcription-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. A complete understanding of the cellular signal transduction pathways used by cannabinoids and endocannabinoids will lead to a more thorough understanding of how retrograde messengers regulate neurotransmission.

We have studied the function of the FhuD2 protein in greater detail, and demonstrate here that the protein binds several iron(III)-hydroxamates. Mutagenesis of FhuD2 identified several residues that were important for the ability of the protein to function in iron(III)-hydroxamate transport. Several residues, notably Tyr-191, Trp-197, and Glu-202, were found to be critical for ligand binding. Moreover, mutation of two highly conserved glutamate residues, Glu-97 and Glu-231, had no affect on ligand binding, but did impair iron(III)-hydroxamate transport. Interestingly, the transport defect was not equivalent for all iron(III)-hydroxamates. We modeled FhuD2 against the high resolution structures of Escherichia coli FhuD and BtuF, two structurally related proteins, and showed that the three proteins share a similar overall structure. FhuD2 Glu-97 and Glu-231 were positioned on the surface of the N and C domains, respectively. Characterization of E97A, E231A, or E97A/E231A mutants suggests that these residues, along with the ligand itself, play a cumulative role in recognition by the ABC transporter FhuBGC2. In addition, small angle x-ray scattering was used to demonstrate that, in solution, FhuD2 does not undergo a detectable change in conformation upon binding iron(III)-hydroxamates.

Iron, the fourth most abundant element on the earth's crust, is one of the most important micronutrients for almost all forms of life. The majority of that iron, however, exists in a biologically unavailable form as a result of the fact that ferric iron is highly insoluble at a physiological pH. To overcome this iron shortage, bacteria have developed a variety of mechanisms to sequester what little available iron may exist within their environment. In particular, one important iron acquisition strategy is through the production of small molecules, termed siderophores, which have an extremely high affinity for Fe(III) and which can interact with cognate transporters that effectively move Fe(III)-siderophore complexes across the bacterial envelope.ABC transporters are protein conduits that use energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to move solutes across the cell membrane. Typically, the basic unit of an ABC transporter is (i) two transmembrane domains that span the membrane usually 6 times each for a total of 12 membrane-spanning domains, (ii) two cytoplasmic ATP-binding proteins that serve to energize the system, and (iii) a binding protein that interacts with the transmembrane domains (1.Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding proteins in Gram-negative bacteria are present within the periplasm, whereas those in Gram-positive bacteria are tethered to the cell membrane via the acylation of a cysteine residue that is an integral component of a lipoprotein signal sequence.Solute binding proteins typically exhibit a common structural design in that they contain a cleft or groove region that serves as the ligand binding site, and this ligand binding site is surrounded by two globular domains typically consisting of a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helixes (2.Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar).

Indeed, the closure of the two domains around the ligand has been likened to the active motion of a Venus flytrap. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies have defined a new class of binding proteins that include Escherichia coli FhuD (3.Clarke T.E. Braun V. Winkelmann G. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13966-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct.

Hasemann C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a zinc-binding protein. These proteins possess an architecture that differs from the sugar- and amino acid-binding proteins (represented by MBP) in that they have adopted a single, more inflexible backbone α-helix that connects two globular domains. This topology is not found within the interdomain connections of group I or group II binding proteins (2.Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and, as such, this class of proteins can be placed into a new group. Structural constraints imposed by the backbone α-helix have led to the suggestion that this new class of binding protein does not undergo a significant change in conformation upon ligand binding. Indeed, crystal structures of apo and holo forms of BtuF indicate a relatively minor conformational change upon ligand binding (5.Karpowich N.K. Huang H.H. Smith P.C. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8429-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High resolution structures of E. coli FhuD bound to different hydroxamate siderophores have been determined (3.Clarke T.E. Braun V. Winkelmann G. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13966-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These structures identify a shallow binding pocket that exists between the two protein domains; siderophores are recognized by the side chains of a few key residues lining the binding pocket. The structures of different hydroxamate siderophores are accommodated in the binding pocket by subtle rearrangements in the positions of the side chains. In a recent study of the high resolution structure of BtuF, Borths et al. (6.Borths E.L. Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16642-16647Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) highlight two highly conserved glutamate residues that are located on the surface of each of the two lobes of the protein. When they aligned the BtuF structure above the structure of BtuCD, the ABC transporter, it was found that the BtuF glutamates align with the position of positively charged pockets of arginines present on the periplasmic surface of BtuCD. This has led to the suggestion that interprotein Glu-Arg salt bridges might form important docking contacts between the binding protein and the ABC transporter. Notably, both the glutamates and the arginines are conserved in a number of iron(III)-siderophore transport systems in different bacteria (6.Borths E.L. Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16642-16647Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive human pathogen that possesses an ABC transporter (FhuCBG, FhuD1, FhuD2) for the import of iron(III)-hydroxamates (8.Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9.Sebulsky M.T. Hohnstein D. Hunter M.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4394-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). FhuB and FhuG constitute the membrane-spanning components, whereas FhuC is the ATP-binding protein and two acylated proteins, FhuD1 and FhuD2, are thought to serve as the binding proteins for the system. FhuD2 participates in the transport of a wider range of substrates than FhuD1 (8.Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and is the subject of the investigations presented herein. FhuD2, representative of a large family of putative iron-binding proteins in Gram-positive bacteria (10.Clarke T.E. Rohrbach M.R. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. Koster W. Biometals. 2002; 15: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was used as a model protein to characterize the role of several conserved amino acid residues in iron(III)-hydroxamate transport. We have shown that FhuD2 binds a variety of iron(III)-hydroxamates with differing affinities, possessing significantly higher affinity for iron(III)-ferrichrome and iron(III)-desferrioxamine (used in this study as Desferal™) than the E. coli FhuD protein. Moreover, solution x-ray scattering experiments, which are sensitive to protein conformation, indicated that, in solution, little or no conformational change is associated with ligand binding, the first such demonstration for this class of ligand-binding proteins. This result, in combination with mutations affecting ligand binding and transport, suggests a novel mode of recognition between the binding protein-ligand complex and the ABC transporter (FhuBGC2).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidDescriptionSource or referenceS. aureus RN2564(80α) ω25[Tn551] pig-131J.

Solid media were obtained by the addition of 1.5% (w/v) Bacto-agar (Difco). Tris-minimal succinate was the iron-deficient medium used throughout (9.Sebulsky M.T. Hohnstein D.

Where appropriate, tetracycline (2 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were incorporated into media for the cultivation of S. aureus, whereas tetracycline (10 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were incorporated into media for the growth of E. coli. Growth of bacterial cultures was performed at 37 °C. Iron-free water was used for all experiments and was obtained by passage through a Milli-Q water filtration system (Millipore Corp.).Siderophores—Ferrichrome and rhodotorulic acid were purchased from Sigma (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), aerobactin and coprogen were purchased from EMC Microcollections GmbH (Tübingen, Germany), and desferrioxamine, used as Desferal™ (Novartis), was obtained from the London Health Sciences Centre.

Once automated DNA sequencing confirmed the mutations, the mutated plasmids were introduced into S. aureus RN4220 by electroporation before being mobilized into S. aureus H431 via transduction. Random mutations were introduced into the fhuD2 gene by treating plasmid pMTS37 (5 μg) with 400 mm hydroxylamine at 72 °C for 2 h, and introducing plasmid thus treated into H431. Plasmids not allowing growth in the presence of 2.5 mm Desferal™ (H431 will not grow on media containing 2.5 mm Desferal™ whereas H431 carrying pMTS37 will grow well under these conditions) were selected for further study.Table IIPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesis of fhuD2Mutation constructedMutagenic primeraSense primer is shown, antisense primer (not shown) is exactly complementary.

Open table in a new tab Siderophore Plate Bioassays—Siderophore plate bioassays were performed essentially as previously described (9.Sebulsky M.T. Hohnstein D. Hunter M.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4394-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Siderophores were used at concentrations of 50 μm except for aerobactin (100 μm) and rhodotorulic acid (14 mm). For assessment of mutations, the wild type fhuD2 gene (including its own iron-regulated promoter) and mutated derivatives were expressed from the low copy E. coli/S. aureus shuttle vector pLI50. The recombinant vectors were then introduced into S. aureus H431 (RN6390 fhuD1 fhuD2). Under the conditions of the bioassay, H431 alone does not grow in the presence of the iron(III)-hydroxamates.Expression and Purification of FhuD2 and Derivatives—The fhuD2 gene was PCR-amplified as a 1.1-kb fragment that was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T-TEV. The resulting vector, pMTS57, which encodes a glutathione S-transferase-FhuD2 fusion protein (the first 24 amino acid residues of the FhuD2 are not included in the construct), was introduced into E. coli strain DH5α for protein overexpression. Similarly, the fhuD2 gene containing the E97A, E231A, or E97A/E231A mutations was PCR-amplified and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T-TEV. Strains expressing fusion proteins were grown to an approximate A600 of 0.8. Following the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm), growth was allowed to continue another 3 h before the cells were lysed. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 × g to remove insolubles and then passed across a 5-ml GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) for purification. Fusion proteins were eluted from GSTrap columns and treated with TEV protease (4 h at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm reduced glutathione). FhuD2 and derivatives were purified by ion-exchange chromatography across an 8-ml Mono-S column (Amersham Biosciences), using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE.Expression and Purification of E. coli fhuD—The E. coli fhuD gene was PCR-amplified on a 850-bp fragment that was cloned into BamHI/ SmaI-digested pGEX-2T-TEV. E. coli fhuD was then removed as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment and cloned into pET28A(+), to produce pMTS90. This construct encodes E. coli FhuD tagged at the N terminus with His6. The recombinant pET28A(+) vector was introduced into E. coli BL21(λ DE3) for protein overexpression. BL21(λ DE3) (pMTS90) cells were grown to an approximate A600 of 0.8. before isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm) was added and growth allowed to continue for another 3 h before the cells were lysed. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g to remove insoluble material and then passed across a 5-ml HiTrap™ chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) for purification. His6 FhuD was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of imidazole (10–500 mm). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE.Fluorescence Titrations—Fluorescence titration experiments were performed using protein concentrations of 8–16 nm, in 2 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, using a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (ISA Instruments). All reactions were performed at 23 °C. The excitation and emission slits were set at 1 and 10 nm, respectively, with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 283 and 348 nm, respectively. Experiments involving the E. coli His6-tagged FhuD were performed as previously described (13.Rohrbach M.R. Braun V. Köster W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7186-7193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The value for relative minimum fluorescence (Fmin) was obtained using Equation 1.F0-FF0=Fmin[ligand][ligand]+c(Eq. 1) F0 is the starting fluorescence, F is the fluorescence after addition(s) of Fe(III)-siderophores, and c is a constant. The KD was then calculated using the following equation (14.Miller 3rd, D.M. Olson J.S. Pflugrath J.W. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13665-13672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the KD as the single variable.F0-FF0-Fmin=KD+[ligand]+[FhuD2]-(KD+[ligand]+[FhuD2])2-4[ligand][FhuD2]2[FhuD2](Eq. 2) The solver function in Microsoft Excel was used to fit the data to the equations and obtain values for the relevant parameters. All titration experiments were done in triplicate for each ligand.Proteinase K Digests—Samples of FhuD2 (2 μg) were incubated with proteinase K (2 μg added to each reaction) in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 30 min in the presence or absence of ferric siderophores at 55 °C. The resulting proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide as previously described (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Computer Analysis—DNA sequence analysis, oligonucleotide primer design, and sequence alignments were performed using the Vector NTI Suite software package (Informax, Inc., Bethesda, MD).Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Initial low angle measurements and some high angle measurements were made at BioCAT (beamline 18ID) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). A second round of experiments was conducted at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany), beamline X33 (16.Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instr. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Note that Q = 2π sinθ/λ and S = sinθ/λ.To ensure that the protein preparations were free of aggregates, they were subjected to gel filtration chromatography several days prior to small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. Protein samples (0.5 ml, 20–25 mg/ml) were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and developed with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. Samples were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. The dialysis buffers were reserved for background measurements. For measurements at APS, FhuD2 in complex with iron-loaded siderophores was obtained by adding iron-loaded siderophores directly to the protein solutions, which resulted in a 1.5:1 ratio of ligand:protein. For experiments at DESY, the samples (0.5 ml) were dialyzed against a 50-ml solution containing 20 μm iron-loaded Desferal™.Measurements at BioCAT (beamline 18ID) at APS were made as follows. The sample temperature was 20 °C, and the protein solution was moved continuously through a 1-mm quartz capillary during the course of the measurement to minimize the effects of radiation damage. For each sample, five 10-s exposures were recorded, consisting of three measurements from the protein solution bracketed by two measurements of the buffer solution. Data were integrated using Fit2D (17.Hammersley A.P. Svensson S.O. Hanfland M. Fitch A.N. Häusermann D. High Pressure Res. 1996; 14: 235-248Crossref Google Scholar), and exported into a spreadsheet. The three protein solution curves and two background buffer curves were inspected and averaged, and the background buffer curve was subtracted, with no correction, from the protein solution curve to yield scattering from the hydrated protein. Data were collected at 2779 and 335 mm using a CCD detector, with x-rays at a wavelength of 1.03 Å, to cover the momentum transfer ranges 0.08 < Q < 1.87 nm–1 and 0.7 < Q < 10.5 nm–1, respectively. The overlapping region in the data sets (0.85 < Q < 1.85 nm–1) was used to scale the two curves to produce a composite curve covering the momentum transfer range 0.08 < Q < 10.5 nm–1.SAXS measurements at DESY beamline X33 were carried out as follows. The wavelength of the radiation was 1.5 Å, the path length was 1 mm, and the sample was maintained at a temperature of 14 °C. Low angle measurements were made using a protein concentration of ∼5 mg/ml, and a sample-detector distance of 2650 mm to cover the momentum transfer range 0.03 < S < 0.55 nm–1. Mid- and high angle x-ray scattering measurements were made, simultaneously, using a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml, with a detector at 2650 mm and a second detector (offset) at a distance of 1.2 m, to cover the momentum transfer range from 0.3 < S < 1.5 nm–1. Data were processed and analyzed using Sapoko and Otoko (18.Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S. Nucl. Instr. Methods. 1986; A249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and Gnom (19.Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar) programs. The three scattering curves were scaled and merged using a spreadsheet.Molecular Modeling of S. aureus FhuD2—To model the structure of FhuD2, we began with a structural alignment between E. coli FhuD (4.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and BtuF (5.Karpowich N.K. Huang H.H. Smith P.C. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8429-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6.Borths E.L. Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16642-16647Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The structural alignment was carried out with the program O (20.Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C.F. Ealick S.E. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Google Scholar); an initial superposition of residues 130–166 of FhuD and 111–147 of BtuF (the two long α-helices on the underside of the proteins) was refined using the lsq_improve function in O, matching CA atoms with a cutoff of 3 Å. The final alignment yielded matches for 148 CA atoms throughout the FhuD and BtuF polypeptides, with a root mean square fit of 2.2 Å. The structures diverged mainly in loop regions between secondary structure elements. We aligned the sequences of six iron-siderophore-binding proteins from Gram-positive bacteria (FhuD1 and FhuD2 from S. aureus, and FhuD proteins from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus halodurans, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis) as well as FhuD and BtuF from E. coli. This multiple sequence alignment was manually adjusted using the three-dimensional structural alignment between E. coli FhuD and BtuF proteins as a guide. We reasoned that the FhuD structures from Gram-positive organisms would diverge in the same regions as the E. coli FhuD and BtuF structures, and therefore gaps that had been inserted into structurally conserved regions of E. coli BtuF and FhuD were moved into regions where the two structures diverged. The final alignment is shown in Fig. 1.The folds of E. coli BtuF and FhuD are similar, but we found that SAXS data from FhuD2 showed a better agreement with E. coli FhuD than with BtuF. Therefore, we used the coordinates of E. coli FhuD (4.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to model the structure of FhuD2. Based on the alignment in Fig. 1, the sequence of FhuD2 was threaded through the coordinates of E. coli FhuD. This initial model was submitted to Swiss-Model (21.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar) for optimization. Manual adjustments were made to the model using the program O (20.Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C.F. Ealick S.E. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Google Scholar), and it was subjected to one round of conjugant gradient minimization in CNS (22.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), with harmonically restrained CA positions. The final model has good stereochemistry, with only one residue falling just outside of allowed Ramachandran regions.RESULTSFunctional Characterization of Conserved Residues in FhuD2—Our previous molecular genetic studies showed that the fhuD2 gene product participates in the transport of a variety of iron(III)-hydroxamate complexes in S. aureus (8.Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Searches of the data bases, which now include many completed genome sequences, indicate that FhuD2 is representative of a large family of conserved proteins that are present in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2002244635,"The ryanodine receptor of cardiac muscle performs a central role in excitation-contraction coupling. Phosphorylation of the channel on serine 2809 (in rabbit or the corresponding serine 2808 in man) alters function in vitro, although the impact of this in vivo has not been established. We have produced a pair of antisera to the serine 2809 phosphorylation site to aid description of the incidence and consequence of phosphorylation of this receptor. One of these antisera is specific for the serine 2809 phosphorylated form of the cardiac ryanodine receptor; the other antiserum is specific for the serine 2809 dephosphorylated receptor. These antibodies have been used to demonstrate that both protein kinase A and calmodulin-dependent kinase II are capable of phosphorylating serine 2809 in vitro. Both kinases phosphorylate serine 2809 to full stoichiometry, but this is accompanied by the incorporation of more (radioactive) phosphate into the receptor by calmodulin-dependent kinase II than by protein kinase A. These data suggest that calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylates at least four sites in addition to serine 2809 in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2081418938,"Depletion of the cellular pool of glutathione is detrimental to eukaryotic cells and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to sensitivity to oxidants and xenobiotics and an eventual cell cycle arrest. Here, we show that the Yap1 and Met4 transcription factors regulate the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH1), encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis to prevent the damaging effects of glutathione depletion. Transcriptional profiling of a gsh1 mutant indicates that glutathione depletion leads to a general activation of Yap1 target genes, but the expression of Met4-regulated genes remains unaltered. Glutathione depletion appears to result in Yap1 activation via oxidation of thioredoxins, which normally act to down-regulate the Yap1-mediated response. The requirement for Met4 in regulating GSH1 expression is lost in the absence of the centromere-binding protein Cbf1. In contrast, the Yap1-mediated effect is unaffected, indicating that Met4 acts via Cbf1 to regulate the Yap1-mediated induction of GSH1 expression in response to glutathione depletion. Furthermore, yeast cells exposed to the xenobiotic 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene are rapidly depleted of glutathione, accumulate oxidized thioredoxins, and elicit the Yap1/Met4-dependent transcriptional response of GSH1. The addition of methionine, which promotes Met4 ubiquitination and inactivation, specifically represses GSH1 expression after 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene exposure but does not affect Yap1 activation. These results indicate that the Yap1-dependant activation of GSH1 expression in response to glutathione depletion is regulated by the sulfur status of the cell through a specific Met4-dependant mechanism. Depletion of the cellular pool of glutathione is detrimental to eukaryotic cells and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to sensitivity to oxidants and xenobiotics and an eventual cell cycle arrest. Here, we show that the Yap1 and Met4 transcription factors regulate the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH1), encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis to prevent the damaging effects of glutathione depletion. Transcriptional profiling of a gsh1 mutant indicates that glutathione depletion leads to a general activation of Yap1 target genes, but the expression of Met4-regulated genes remains unaltered. Glutathione depletion appears to result in Yap1 activation via oxidation of thioredoxins, which normally act to down-regulate the Yap1-mediated response.

These results indicate that the Yap1-dependant activation of GSH1 expression in response to glutathione depletion is regulated by the sulfur status of the cell through a specific Met4-dependant mechanism. The ability to regulate biosynthetic pathways is a fundamental aspect of adaptation to life in a changing environment. In response to a stress, cells must be able to prioritize the allocation of resources to support the increased demand for defensive mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate stress-induced changes is important in determining how a cell co-ordinates different areas of metabolism. An inducible stress response has been described for the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GSH is a tripeptide (γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) that plays an important role in protecting yeast cells against damage induced by oxidative stress (1.Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2.Stephan D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). GSH counters the potentially damaging effect of reactive oxygen species through direct scavenging of free radicals and through the action of antioxidant enzymes such as the glutathione peroxidases (4.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar). In addition GSH has other protective roles within the cell, such as the detoxification of xenobiotics and heavy metals through the formation of GSH conjugates and their subsequent export into the vacuole (5.Li Z.-S. Lu Y.-P. Zhen R.-G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The reversible binding of GSH to protein sulfhydryl groups can protect them from irreversible oxidative damage (6.Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 7.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). There are also requirements for GSH in methylglyoxal detoxification, as a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, in protein folding, and in amino acid transport (4.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar, 8.Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first step in the synthesis of GSH is the conjugation of glutamate and cysteine by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, encoded by GSH1 (9.Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10.Lisowsky T. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This produces γ-glutamylcysteine, to which glycine is added by glutathione synthetase, encoded by GSH2 (11.Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12.Inoue Y. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutant strains lacking GSH1 are unable to grow in the absence of GSH, indicating that this metabolite is essential in S. cerevisiae (1.Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13.Lee J.-C. Straffon M.J. Jang T.-Y. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. FEMS Yeast Res. 2000; 1: 57-65Google Scholar, 14.Spector D. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7011-7016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway is Gsh1, which is feedback-inhibited at the enzyme level by GSH (4.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar). The rate of GSH1 expression is, therefore, very important in regulating the abundance of Gsh1 and determining the rate of GSH biosynthesis. In response to oxidative stress, GSH1 expression is increased in a Yap1-dependant manner (15.Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17.Dormer U.H. Westwater J. Stephen D.W. Jamieson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Yap1 is a redox-sensitive bZip-transcription factor that regulates the expression of many antioxidant genes (18.Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to H2O2, Yap1 accumulates in the nucleus due to the masking of a C-terminal nuclear export signal by an intramolecular disulfide bond (21.Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22.Delaunay A. Isnard A.-D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the glutathione peroxidase like-enzyme, Gpx3, is required for the H2O2-dependent formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond (23.Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The pathway is turned off by thioredoxin, which reduces both Gpx3 and Yap1. There is a requirement for Yap1 in the response of GSH1 to oxidants such as H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and menadione and also to other stresses such as heat shock and cadmium (16.Stephen D.W.S.

Yap1-responsive element 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene. Cadmium-inducible expression of GSH1 also requires the presence of the Met4 transcription factor (26.Dormer U.H. Westwater J. McLaren N.F.

Met4 is a bZip-transcriptional activator that regulates the assimilation of extracellular sulfate into the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine (27.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Met4 will, therefore, have an indirect effect on GSH biosynthesis by regulating the supply of cysteine. Met4 lacks a DNA binding domain and is tethered to DNA in the form of a heteromeric complex involving the bZip protein, Met28, and the basic helix-loop-helix protein, Cbf1 (28.Kuras L. Barbey R.

Met4 may also be recruited to DNA in an alternative complex involving Met28 and one of the zinc finger proteins, Met31 or Met32 (30.Blaiseau P.L. Isnard A.D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31.Blaiseau P.L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Met4-regulated genes of the sulfate assimilation pathway have differing requirements for one or both of these complexes. The GSH1 promoter contains binding motifs for both Cbf1 and Met31/32 (26.Dormer U.H. Westwater J. McLaren N.F. Kent N.A. Mellor J. Jamieson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32611-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The sulfate assimilation pathway is turned off upon exposure to methionine, which triggers the ubiquination of Met4 (32.Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Cell. 2000; 102: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 33.Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The nature of this regulation is complex because ubiquitination inhibits Met4 transcriptional activity through altered promoter recruitment or through Met4 degradation depending upon the media composition and environment of the individual promoters (34.Kuras L. Rouillon A. Lee T. Barbey R. Tyers M. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated how GSH biosynthesis is regulated in response to depletion of the GSH pool. We have previously determined that there is Met4-dependant induction of GSH1 expression after GSH depletion (35.Wheeler G.L. Quinn K.A. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a role for the stress-responsive transcription factor Yap1 in this response and propose a mechanism in which these two transcription factors combine to regulate GSH1 expression. In addition, we demonstrate that the regulation of GSH1 expression by this mechanism is important in defense against xenobiotics, which deplete cellular GSH concentrations. Yeast Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of CY4 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1–1 his3–11 can1–100) (1.Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Strain CY197, which is deleted for GSH1, has been described previously (13.Lee J.-C. Straffon M.J. Jang T.-Y. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. FEMS Yeast Res. 2000; 1: 57-65Google Scholar) as have the yap1 mutant (36.Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Molec. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the met4 and gsh1 met4 mutants (35.Wheeler G.L. Quinn K.A. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strain CY813, which is deleted for CBF1, was made by back-crossing CY4 with EUROSCARF strain Y16858 (MATα his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0 cbf1::kanMX4). These strains were used to construct the gsh1 yap1, gsh1 cbf1, met4 cbf1, yap1 cbf1, gsh1 met4 cbf1, and gsh1 yap1 cbf1 mutants using standard yeast genetic methods. Strains were grown in rich YEPD medium (2% w/v glucose, 2% w/v Bacto-peptone, 1% w/v yeast extract) or minimal SD media (0.17% w/v yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5% w/v ammonium sulfate, 2% w/v glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases (2 mm leucine, 0.3 mm histidine, 0.4 mm tryptophan, 1 mm lysine, 0.15 mm adenine, and 0.2 mm uracil). Media were solidified by the addition of 2% (w/v) agar. Where appropriate, media were further supplemented by a non-repressive concentration of methionine (0.05 mm) to overcome the methionine auxotrophy of cbf1 and/or met4 mutants. Sensitivity to 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene (CDNB) was determined by growing cells to stationary phase (48 h growth) and spotting onto agar plates. The plasmids used in this study containing the GSH1::lacZ (pyDJ73 and pyDJ76 (26.Dormer U.H. Westwater J. McLaren N.F. Kent N.A. Mellor J. Jamieson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32611-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) and YRE::lacZ (15.Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reporter constructs have been described previously. Determination of Glutathione and Thioredoxin Redox States—Concentrations of free (GSH and GSSG) and protein-bound (GSSP) glutathione were determined as described previously (37.Grant C.M. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The redox state of thioredoxins was measured by covalent modification with the thiolreactive probe 4-acetamido-4′maleimidyldystilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes) as described previously (38.Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on 18% SDS-PAGE minigels and electroblotted onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated in anti-thioredoxin antibody (1:1000 dilution) as described previously (39.Trotter E.W. Grant C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) after incubation of the blot in donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz, CA). β-Galactosidase Assays—For the determination of β-galactosidase activity, transformants were assayed essentially as described previously (40.Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as nmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galacto-pyranoside hydrolyzed/min/μg of total protein (units). All β-galactosidase experiments were repeated at least twice, and a representative plot is shown. Values shown are the means of at least two independent determinations. Error bars denote S.E. Northern Blot Analysis—Yeast cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.6–0.7) in minimal media in the presence of 1 mm methionine or 1 mm GSH where appropriate. Total RNA was prepared by Trizol extraction according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). RNA (50 μg) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted overnight onto a Nylon+ membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA specific probes. DNA probes were synthesized by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: MET3 (MET3–1, 5′-GGGTCTCTCTCTGTCGTAACAGTTG-3′; MET3–2, 5′-TTGAGATGGGAGCATTTTATGACGA-3′); MET16 (MET16–1, 5′-CAAAGGTATCAACCCATAGCAACTC-3′; MET16–2, 5′-CGTACAGCGCGA ATTCTCCGCCAGC-3′); MET25 (MET25–1, 5′-CAATTCTATTACCCCCATCCATACA-3′; MET25–2, 5′-TAATTTTACAAC CATTACGCACAC-3′). Probes were labeled with the Megaprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). ACT1 was used as a control for RNA loading. Microarray Hybridizations and Data Analysis—Yeast cells were grown in triplicate to mid-exponential phase in minimal SD media. Growth conditions for the gsh1 mutant were predetermined to allow maximal GSH depletion in mid-exponential phase without a decrease in growth rate. Total depletion of the GSH pool in the gsh1 mutant leads to a cell cycle arrest. To examine the transcriptome in GSH-depleted cells that were still growing normally, cultures of the gsh1 mutant were inoculated with the lowest volume of a GSH-containing stationary phase culture that still allowed a normal growth rate to an A600 of 0.5–0.6. Preparation of RNA, probes, and hybridization to whole yeast genome microarrays (YG-S98, Affymetrix) was performed as described on the Consortium for Functional Genomics of Microbial Eukaryotes (COGEME) web site (www.cogeme.man.ac.uk). Data acquisition was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0 software and analyzed using dChip v1.1 software (41.Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). The mean expression values from three independently grown yeast cultures were used for comparative analysis. Gene expression was deemed to be significantly different between strains if it fulfilled the following criteria; 1) the fold change of gene expression was greater than 2 at the 90% confidence level, 2) the mean expression values are significantly different using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05), 3) the mean expression values differ by greater than 50, 4) the gene is called present in greater than 60% of the arrays. For the comparison to other microarray data sets, data from the YAP1 overexpression and trr1 mutant analyses were downloaded from Stanford Genomic Resources web site (genome-www.stanford.edu/yeast_stress and genome-www.stanford.edu/trr1, respectively) (19.Carmel-Hare O. Stearman R. Gasch A.P. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20.Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Genes exhibiting a log2 expression ratio higher than 1.0 were compared with the data set obtained in the gsh1 mutant. The identification of prospective regulatory sequences within promoters was performed by RSAT (Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools, rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat). The Regulation of the Sulfate Assimilation Pathway Is Not Affected by Cellular GSH Concentrations—The regulation of metabolic pathways is essential for cell adaptation to differing environmental conditions. In this paper we have investigated the mechanisms regulating the biosynthesis of the key antioxidant, GSH. Our previous work indicated that expression of GSH1 is strongly induced in response to GSH depletion and that this response is dependent on the presence of the Met4 transcription factor (35.Wheeler G.L. Quinn K.A. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms regulating GSH1 expression, we were particularly interested in the transcriptional responses of other Met4-dependent genes in response to GSH depletion. We, therefore, analyzed the global transcriptional response to GSH depletion in a gsh1 mutant. Microarray analysis revealed that there is a significant effect on the transcriptome, with 151 open reading frames significantly up-regulated and 38 down-regulated. Here we will only refer to the findings that are relevant to the regulation of GSH1 expression, since a detailed analysis of these data is beyond the scope of this paper and will be described elsewhere. 2G. L. Wheeler and C. M. Grant, manuscript in preparation. The microarray analysis of the gsh1 mutant indicates that lower cellular GSH concentrations do not lead to a general induction of the sulfate assimilation pathway. There is no significant effect on the expression of genes involved in sulfur metabolism other than a 3.3-fold increase in STR3 transcripts. The STR3 gene encodes cystathionine β-lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to cystathionine and would, thus, prevent a toxic accumulation of cysteine in the gsh1 mutant (42.Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of GSH depletion on the regulation of the sulfate assimilation pathway, we analyzed the transcriptional response of MET3, MET16, and MET25 using Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A). These genes have previously been shown to be controlled by the Met4 transcriptional activator protein (27.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, none of these genes was induced by GSH depletion in the gsh1 mutant nor were they repressed by the exogenous addition of 1 mm GSH. This is in strong contrast with the induction of GSH1 expression observed after GSH depletion (Fig. 1B). The addition of 1 mm methionine severely repressed the expression of all three sulfate assimilation genes and also repressed the GSH1 induction observed in the gsh1 mutant. Thus, although the expression of the GSH1 gene is regulated in response to GSH availability, the expression of other known Met4 target genes is unaffected under these conditions. This indicates that Met4 acts to specifically up-regulate GSH biosynthesis in response to GSH depletion. We, therefore, examined the microarray data generated from the gsh1 mutant for evidence that other transcription factors may contribute to this specificity. GSH Depletion Activates Yap1-regulated Genes—Examination of the microarray data revealed that a number of genes that are regulated by the Yap1 transcriptional activator protein are up-regulated in the gsh1 mutant (Table I). For example, mutant strains of yeast lacking thioredoxin reductase (trr1) exhibit a constitutive Yap1 response, indicating that the thioredoxin system is integral for the redox regulation of this transcription factor (19.Carmel-Hare O. Stearman R. Gasch A.P. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Comparison of the whole-genome expression data identified 16 genes in the gsh1 mutant from a set of 35 genes in the trr1 mutant that are strongly induced (greater than 2-fold) in both mutants. The group of genes up-regulated in a gsh1 mutant also contains 25 genes that have previously been shown to be up-regulated (from a set of 118 genes) after the overexpression of plasmid-borne YAP1 in wild-type cells (20.Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the promoter regions of the genes up-regulated in the gsh1 mutant indicates that a significant proportion (43 of 151) contain a putative Yap1 binding site (TTAC/GTAA or TGACTAA).Table IComparison of gene expression profiles in a wild-type and gsh1 mutant identifies many genes that are regulated by Yap1Gene nameAccession no.FunctionFold change2-μm YAP1aElevated expression in cells containing YAP1 on a 2 μm plasmid (20).trr1bElevated expression in a trr1 mutant (19).YREcContain a putative YRE in their promoter, either the TTAG/CTAA motifidentified in TRX2 (21) or the TTAGTCA motif from GSH1 (15).ARN1YHL040CSiderophore transporter27.52+HSP26YBR072WHeat shock protein 2625.42+YOL153C17.62+YGR043C14.05+AAD6YFL056CPutative aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase12.05+++OYE3YPL171CNAD(P)H dehydrogenase11.99++GTT2YLL060CGlutathione transferase10.84+++ECM4YKR076WExtracellular mutant9.91+++DCS2YOR173W7.11+GPM2YDL021WPhosphoglycerate mutase6.62+MRS4YKR052CMitochondrial carrier protein6.5+YLL055W6.42+HXK1YFR053CHexokinase I6.4+RTN2YDL204WMember of the RTNLA subfamily6.28+YBR116C6.28+YBR116C6.28+AAD16YFL057CPutative aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase5.89+YKL071W5.77+++NMA2YGR010WNicotinamide adenylyltransferase5.68+YML131W5.52+++YHR087W5.43+LAP4YKL103CVacuolar aminopeptidase5.2+TMT1YER175CTrans-aconitate methyltransferase 14.94+ALD4YOR374WAldehyde dehydrogenase4.55+YOL048C4.53+YIL167W4.47+YMR090W4.43++YOL164W4.06+YLR108C3.98++ATR1YML116WAminotriazole resistance3.9++ISU2YOR226CIron-sulfur cluster assembly3.84+++FRE1YLR214WFerric reductase3.57++YLR046C3.47+YDL146W3.46+AAD4YDL243CPutative aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase3.43++VHT1YGR065CVitamin H transporter3.3+GPH1YPR160WGlycogen phosphorylase3.23+GRE2YOL151WInduced by osmotic stress3.12++COT1YOR316CInvolved in cobalt accumulation3.07+DIT1YDR403WFirst enzyme in dityrosine synthesis3.07+YDL124W3.05++YLR460C2.97+++SDL1YIL168Wl-Serine dehydratase2.89++TSL1YML100WTrehalose-6-phosphate synthase2.85+YCR102C2.76++HAL1YPR005CInvolved in halotolerance2.74+YNL134C2.71+++GCY1YOR120WGalactose-induced transcript2.7+MRL1YPR079WMannose 6-phosphate receptor-like2.64+YGR154C2.62+YHR199C2.6+YDR533C2.59+AMS1YGL156WVacuolar α-mannosidase2.54+YDL199C2.52+CVT19YOL082WRequired for protein-vacuolar largeting2.49+FLR1YBR008CMajor facilitator transporter2.41++PRX1YBL064CMitochondrial thioredoxin peroxidase2.26+a Elevated expression in cells containing YAP1 on a 2 μm plasmid (20.Gasch A.P.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether Yap1 oxidation in response to GSH depletion was due to an altered redox status, we performed microarray analysis on the glr1 mutant. Mutant strains lacking GLR1, encoding glutathione reductase, are unable to recycle oxidized GSSG back to GSH, and consequently, the redox status of the GSH pool is much more oxidized (36.Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Molec. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, oxidation of the GSH pool does not result in Yap1 activation because no target genes were up-regulated in the glr1 mutant (data not shown). Given the elevated expression of Yap1 targets genes in the gsh1 mutant, we confirmed that Yap1 is activated in a gsh1 mutant using a YRE::lacZ reporter construct. This construct contains three YRE from the promoter of GSH1 fused upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene (15.Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gsh1 mutant strain exhibited a 5-fold increase in YRE::lacZ expression compared with the wild-type control (data not shown). These data indicate that GSH depletion leads to an activation of the Yap1 transcription factor, which has previously been shown to regulate GSH1 expression in response to oxidative stress (43.Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol."
https://openalex.org/W2093985668,"Heme attachment to the apoforms of fungal mitochondrial cytochrome c and c1 requires the activity of cytochrome c and c1 heme lyases (CCHL and CC1HL), which are enzymes with distinct substrate specificity. However, the presence of a single heme lyase in higher eukaryotes is suggestive of broader substrate specificity. Here, we demonstrate that yeast CCHL is active toward the non-cognate substrate apocytochrome c1, i.e. CCHL promotes low levels of apocytochrome c1 conversion to its holoform in the absence of CC1HL. Moreover, that the single human heme lyase also displays a broader cytochrome specificity is evident from its ability to substitute for both yeast CCHL and CC1HL. Multicopy and genetic suppressors of the absence of CC1HL were isolated and their analysis revealed that the activity of CCHL toward cytochrome c1 can be enhanced by: 1) reducing the abundance of the cognate substrate apocytochrome c, 2) increasing the accumulation of CCHL, 3) modifying the substrate-enzyme interaction through point mutations in CCHL or cytochrome c1, or 4) overexpressing Cyc2p, a protein known previously only as a mitochondrial biogenesis factor. Based on the functional interaction of Cyc2p with CCHL and the presence of a putative FAD-binding site in the protein, we hypothesize that Cyc2p controls the redox chemistry of the heme lyase reaction.

The c-type cytochromes are a widespread class of essential metalloproteins that are located on the positive side of energy-transducing membrane systems. They function in electron transfer (1.Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) but are also involved in the cellular death pathways in vertebrates by signaling mitochondrial status (2.Lim M.L. Lum M.G. Hansen T.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 488-506PubMed Google Scholar). Their distinctive feature is the covalent attachment of the prosthetic group via thioether linkages between the vinyl chains of heme and the cysteines of the CXXCH motif on the apocytochrome. If cytochromes c are among the best characterized molecules at the structural level (3.Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J.

Key questions in defining the steps and the biochemical requirement to complete holocytochrome c maturation have been addressed and the general conclusion is that heme and apocytochromes need to be transported to the positive side of the energy-tranducing membrane and maintained in a reduced form prior to catalysis of heme attachment, the terminal step of the maturation process (1.Thöny-Meyer L.

System III was discovered through studies in Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and seems to be restricted to mitochondria of vertebrates, invertebrates, apicomplexan parasites, and green algae as gauged from genome analysis (see Fig. 1 of Supplemental Materials and Ref. 8.Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast to systems I and II, system III appears surprisingly less complex as extensive genetic screens led to the discovery of only two assembly factors, the cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL) 1The abbreviations used are: CCHLcytochrome c heme lyaseCC1HLcytochrome c1 heme lyaseHCCSholocytochrome c synthetaseLDSlithium dodecyl sulfateORFopen reading frameBLASTbasic local alignment search toolDTTdithiothreitol. and the cytochrome c1 heme lyase (CC1HL), for the two c-type cytochromes found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, cytochrome c and cytochrome c1, respectively (27.Lang B.F.

The specificity of each lyase for its respective substrate was established through genetics in the yeast system (28.Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F.

The relevance of the study of the system III assembly pathway to human health has now become obvious with the finding that loss of CCHL causes a neurodevelopmental disorder with cardiomyopathic manifestations (33.Prakash S.K. Cormier T.A. McCall A.E. Garcia J.J. Sierra R. Haupt B. Zoghbi H.Y. Van Den Veyver I.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The CCHL and CC1HL are related in sequence (35% amino acid identity) and display, with the notable exception of Plasmodium falciparum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC1HL, one to four typical heme regulatory motifs (see Fig. 1 of Supplemental Materials) that are present also in several other heme-binding proteins such as the transcription factor HapI (34.Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and heme oxygenase (35.Wilks A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The interaction of CCHLs with heme via the heme regulatory motif (36.Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32605-32611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and apocytochrome (37.Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to the proposal that these assembly factors participate in the biogenesis of cytochromes c by catalyzing thioether bond formation. Despite the considerable body of work from the groups of Neupert and Sherman on the mechanism of the heme lyase reaction, including the in organello reconstitution of heme linkage to apocytochrome c (reviewed in Refs. 39.Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 40.Dumont M.E. Hart F.-U. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. JAI Press, Greenwich, United Kingdom1996: 103-126Google Scholar), the function of the CCHLs has not been thoroughly detailed. Ultimate biochemical proof of their function awaits a direct enzymatic assay of cytochrome heme lyase activity of the purified proteins (28.Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41.Nargang F.E. Drygas M.E. Kwong P.L. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25695-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is also not known whether other accessory factors assist the heme lyases in the formation of holocytochromes c. One such factor was suspected to be Cyc2p, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein identified through a genetic screen for mutants deficient in holocytochrome c. The function of Cyc2p in the CCHL pathway remains undeciphered (31.Matner R.R. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9811-9821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Dumont M.E. Schlichter J.B. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Bethlendy G. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6442-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, on the basis that cyc2 mutations display a pleiotropic phenotype, it was concluded that Cyc2p controls some general aspect of mitochondrial biogenesis and influences holocytochrome c synthesis only indirectly (44.Pearce D.A. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 45.Sanchez N.S. Pearce D.A. Cardillo T.S. Uribe S. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have addressed the question of heme lyase specificities in yeast. We show that whereas CC1HL is only active in the assembly of cytochrome c1, CCHL in addition to its well established function in the biogenesis of holocytochrome c is also able to participate in the conversion of apocytochrome c1 to its holoform. We also demonstrate by functional complementation of the yeast cchl and cc1hl mutants that the single heme lyase in human and mouse exhibits both the CCHL and CC1HL activities. Through multicopy and genetic suppressor analyses, we revealed different mechanisms by which CCHL specificity is modified in favor of its non-cognate substrate apocytochrome c1. We also provide evidence that Cyc2p interacts functionally with CCHL in the assembly of holocytochrome c1 and have identified a putative FAD-binding site in a domain predicted to be exposed to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The cytochrome specificity of the heme lyases and the putative function of Cyc2p in the CCHL pathway are discussed. Construction, Manipulation, and Growth of Yeast Strains—All the yeast strains used in the course of this study are listed in Table I. S. cerevisiae wild type strains W303-1A and W303-1B are labeled WT in the figures. Strains carrying null alleles in the CYC1, CYC2, CYC3, CYC7, CYT1, CYT2, or IMP2 genes are, respectively, labeled Δcyc1, Δcyc2, Δcchl, Δcyc7, Δcyt1, Δcc1hl, or Δimp2 in the figures. The suppressed strains obtained spontaneously (Rx) or after UV-induced mutagenesis (UVx) are designated Δcc1hl sux when the suppressor allele is recessive and Δcc1hl SUx when the suppressor allele is dominant. Null alleles of yeast genes in the W303 background were constructed using a PCR-based method. The hphMX4 (46.Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H.

Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) modules were chosen to inactivate the wild type copy of the CYC2, CYC3, and CYT2 genes, respectively. Cells were transformed by the lithium acetate procedure of Schiestl and Gietz (49.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) or the one-step technique (50.Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The multicopy wild type genomic library constructed in the URA3-based pFL44L vector (a generous gift from F. Lacroute) was used to search for suppressor genes able to alleviate the respiratory deficiency of the Δcchl and Δcc1hl mutants. Transformants were plated on medium lacking uracil and replicated on glycerol medium to select for respiratory proficiency. Plasmids retrieved through the multicopy suppressor screen were extracted from yeast transformants and propagated in Escherichia coli strains (51.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Media used for S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere (52.Dujardin G. Pajot P. Groudinsky O. Slonimski P.P. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Genetic Methods—Spontaneous or UV-induced respiratory-competent revertants were selected from the SMY1 strain (Δcc1hl). Spontaneous revertants were isolated from cells grown to stationary phase, which were plated on lactate medium and incubated at 28 °C for 15 days. UV mutagenesis was performed using a UV source (254 nm) placed at a distance of 12 cm from yeast cells. Cells were collected at a late logarithmic phase and plated on glucose medium before mutagenesis. Plates were then irradiated in the dark for 10 s, incubated for 3 days at 28 °C, and replica-plated on glycerol medium. Under these conditions, 38% lethality was observed and ∼103 revertants were recovered from 2 × 109 irradiated cells. No spontaneous (<10–10) or UV-induced revertants (<2 × 10–9) could be isolated from the SMY4 strain (Δcchl). All the methods employed for the genetic analysis of the suppressor strains have been published elsewhere (52.Dujardin G. Pajot P. Groudinsky O. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 179: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Molecular identification of the mutations in the mapped suppressor genes was achieved by PCR amplification of the candidate ORF from genomic DNAs of the suppressed strains. Sequencing of the PCR product on both strands confirmed the presence of the suppressor mutation. Plasmids Construction—DNA manipulations were carried out following published procedures (55.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan, C. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strains XL1-blue, MR32 (a recA– derivative of MC1061, a generous gift from Dr E. Petrochilo) and DH5α were used as hosts for recombinant DNA techniques. The heterologous expression of human and mouse HCCS cDNAs was achieved by using the multicopy yeast expression vector pFL61 (56.Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). Human and mouse HCCS ORFs were amplified using NotI-engineered oligonucleotides as primers and plasmids harboring the cloned cDNAs as templates (57.Schaefer L. Ballabio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Genomics. 1996; 34: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NotI-digested PCR products were cloned at the NotI site of pFL61 and recombinant plasmids expressing the human (pFL61-HCCS Hs) and mouse HCCS (pFL61-HCCS Mm) in the sense orientation with respect to the PGK promoter in pFL61 were chosen for this study. The plasmids pFL61-CCHL Sc and pFL61-CC1HL Sc were constructed in a similar way by cloning the ORFs of the yeast CYC3 and CYT2 genes, respectively, in pFL61. The plasmids pFL44L-CCHL, pFL44L-CC1HL, and pFL44L-CYC2 were generated as follows: a 1.3-kb SspI-SalI genomic fragment containing the entire CCHL-encoding gene was cut from plasmid pRS316-CYC3 (a gift from R. Lill) and cloned into the PvuII-SalI sites of pFL44L; the CC1HL encoding gene was cloned into pFL44L as a 1-kb SacI-SphI fragment from plasmid pGEM4-CYT2 (58.Steiner H. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22842-22849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CYC2 was cloned into pFL44L as a 1.7-kb PCR fragment using primers with engineered SacI and SalI sites and the CYC2-harboring plasmid retrieved from the multicopy suppressor screen as a template. RNA Analysis—RNAs were extracted from cells grown in complete galactose medium (59.Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNAs was prepared as in Chanfreau et al. (59.Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose denaturing gel. RNAs were immobilized by transfer to nylon membranes (N+ Amersham Biosciences) followed by UV cross-linking. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer labeling of PCR amplified DNA using the “Ready-to-go DNA labeling beads” kit (Amersham Biosciences). The abundance of CYC1 and CYC7 mRNAs was monitored using a 354-bp PCR product amplified with CYC1-specific oligonucleotides (5′-GACTGAATTCAAGGCCGGTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GATATCGACAAAGGAAAAGGGG-3′) and a 355-bp PCR product amplified with CYC7-specific oligonucleotides (5′-CAAGAAGATCACATACAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAACGCCATCTTGGTACCAGG-3′) as probes. Membranes were pre-hybridized for 30 min in 15 ml of Rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized for 1 h at 65 °C (∼2.5 × 105 cpm/ml). Stringent washes were performed as described in Laz et al. (60.Laz T.M. Pietras D.F. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no significant crosshybridization was observed between the CYC1 probe and CYC7 mRNA and between the CYC7 probe and CYC1 mRNA. For quantification of transcripts, signals were normalized to that for RPL18A mRNA, which encodes the cytosolic ribosomal protein L18A (61.Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation and Analysis—Mitochondria were purified from yeast grown in galactose medium as described earlier (62.Kermorgant M. Bonnefoy N. Dujardin G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma) or the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Soluble cytochrome c and membrane-bound cytochrome c1 were fractionated by sodium carbonate treatment of mitochondrial proteins according to Kermorgant et al. (62.Kermorgant M. Bonnefoy N. Dujardin G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Extraction of proteins from whole cells was performed as detailed in Yaffe (63.Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the protein concentration was assayed using Folin-Ciocalteu's phenol reagent (Merck). Protein samples were analyzed through LDS-PAGE (4 °C) or SDS-PAGE (room temperature) and subsequently immobilized by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm). The different intermediates of cytochrome c1 maturation were resolved by overnight electrophoresis (18 mA) using a 1.5 mm × 14 cm resolving gel. For heme stain of mitochondrial cytochromes c, samples were reduced with DTT on ice prior to electrophoresis. Carbonate-treated pellet and supernatant fractions (5 mm final concentration of DTT in the extraction buffer) or DTT-treated mitochondrial proteins (50 mm DTT) were separated by LDS-PAGE (64.Dutta C. Henry H.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The heme-associated peroxidase activity was revealed directly on membrane-transferred c-type cytochromes by the enhanced chemiluminescence method from Pierce (Super Signal West Dura or West Pico). Polyclonal antibodies raised against CCHL (R. Lill, University of Marburg, Marburg), cytochrome c and Tim54 (C. Koehler, UCLA, Los Angeles), cytochrome c1 (A. Tzagoloff, Columbia University, New York), and monoclonal antibody against porin (Molecular Probes) were used for immunodetection of immobilized proteins. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies or 125I-protein A, as indicated in the legends. Conversion of Apo to Holocytochrome c1 by the Non-cognate Lyase CCHL—To re-investigate the question of the substrate specificities of the heme lyases, we constructed null mutations in the yeast CCHL 2For simplification, the CYC3 gene specifying CCHL and the CYT2 gene encoding CC1HL will be referred to as CCHL and CC1HL genes, respectively, throughout the manuscript. and CC1HL genes and analyzed the phenotypes associated with those mutations at the level of respiratory growth and c-type cytochromes assembly. Because cytochrome c and cytochrome c1 are both essential for electron transfer, the absence of either heme lyase was predicted to result in complete loss of respiratory growth. Surprisingly, we found that whereas the absence of CCHL leads to a tight respiratory deficiency, the absence of CC1HL does not completely abolish the respiratory growth and results in a leaky phenotype on all the respiratory substrates we tested (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The slow respiratory growth phenotype 3We also observed a slow respiratory growth phenotyp"
https://openalex.org/W2157813682,"Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis is associated with activation of E2F transcription factors and p53 stabilization through Mdm-2, thus potentially modulating a number of target genes. In previous studies, we have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevents TGF-β1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial pathway of cell death. In this study we examined the role of p53 in the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1, and identified additional antiapoptosis targets for UDCA. Our data show a significant transcriptional activation of E2F-1 in primary rat hepatocytes incubated with TGF-β1, as well as a 5-fold increase in p53 and a 2-fold decrease in its inhibitor, Mdm-2 (p < 0.05). In addition, bax mRNA expression was significantly induced at 36 h (p < 0.01), resulting in increased levels of Bax protein. In contrast, Bcl-2 transcript and protein levels were decreased at all time points (p < 0.01). Notably, UDCA inhibited E2F-1 transcriptional activation, p53 stabilization and Bcl-2 family expression (p < 0.05), in part, through a caspase-independent mechanism. Moreover, in the absence of TGF-β1, UDCA prevented induction of p53 and Bax by overexpression of E2F-1 and p53, respectively (p < 0.05). In addition, UDCA inhibited TGF-β1-induced degradation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its inhibitor IκB (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that UDCA inhibits E2F-1 transcriptional activation of hepatocyte apoptosis, thus modulating p53 stabilization, NF-κB degradation, and expression of Bcl-2 family members. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis is associated with activation of E2F transcription factors and p53 stabilization through Mdm-2, thus potentially modulating a number of target genes. In previous studies, we have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevents TGF-β1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial pathway of cell death. In this study we examined the role of p53 in the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1, and identified additional antiapoptosis targets for UDCA. Our data show a significant transcriptional activation of E2F-1 in primary rat hepatocytes incubated with TGF-β1, as well as a 5-fold increase in p53 and a 2-fold decrease in its inhibitor, Mdm-2 (p < 0.05). In addition, bax mRNA expression was significantly induced at 36 h (p < 0.01), resulting in increased levels of Bax protein. In contrast, Bcl-2 transcript and protein levels were decreased at all time points (p < 0.01). Notably, UDCA inhibited E2F-1 transcriptional activation, p53 stabilization and Bcl-2 family expression (p < 0.05), in part, through a caspase-independent mechanism. Moreover, in the absence of TGF-β1, UDCA prevented induction of p53 and Bax by overexpression of E2F-1 and p53, respectively (p < 0.05). In addition, UDCA inhibited TGF-β1-induced degradation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its inhibitor IκB (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that UDCA inhibits E2F-1 transcriptional activation of hepatocyte apoptosis, thus modulating p53 stabilization, NF-κB degradation, and expression of Bcl-2 family members.

In particular, it has significantly improved both the clinical and biochemical indices of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (1.Heathcote E.J. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2.Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The therapeutic effects of UDCA have been attributed to three major mechanisms of action, including protection of cholangiocytes against the cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids, stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion, and inhibition of liver cell apoptosis. It has been recently demonstrated that this hydrophilic bile acid plays a unique role in modulating the apoptotic threshold in both hepatic and nonhepatic cells by preventing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathways (3.Botla R. Spivey J.R. Aguilar H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 930-938PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rodrigues C.M.P. Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism(s) by which UDCA prevents cell death remains speculative, and may involve molecular targets other than mitochondria. ursodeoxycholic acid apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase inhibitor of nuclear factor κB nuclear factor κB reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tauroursodeoxycholic acid transforming growth factor β1 phosphate-buffered saline benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethylketone. ursodeoxycholic acid apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase inhibitor of nuclear factor κB nuclear factor κB reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tauroursodeoxycholic acid transforming growth factor β1 phosphate-buffered saline benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethylketone. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine, whose activities include cell cycle control, regulation of early development, differentiation, and induction of apoptosis, among others (6.Lawrence D.A. Eur. Cytokine Net. 1996; 7: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Schuster N. Krieglstein K. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has been shown to induce rapid growth arrest and apoptosis in hepatic cells by suppressing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as well as inhibiting its expression (8.Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, TGF-β1 may act through pRb to negatively regulate c-fos and c-myc gene expression (9.Moses H.L. Yang E.Y. Pietenpol J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 245-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). pRb, in turn, is extensively regulated by its phosphorylation state, which is modified by the activities of various cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and by protein phosphatases (10.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated pRb is a growth inhibitory form of the protein, while hyperphosphorylated pRb mediates progression through G1 into S phase (11.Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 12.Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Inactivation of pRb either by phosphorylation, mutation, degradation, or binding to an oncoprotein reduces its ability to sequester E2F-1, thereby increasing levels of free E2F-1 (13.Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14.Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3181-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E2F-1 is the best-characterized member of the E2F family of transcription factors that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, proliferation (15.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and apoptosis (16.Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is typically bound to unphosphorylated pRb (17.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Under certain stress conditions and during the cell cycle, pRb is inactivated and/or degraded (18.Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), thus releasing E2F-1 to transactivate its target genes. Interestingly, the dramatic increase in E2F-1 binding activity coupled with significantly decreased pRb levels in TGF-β1-treated cells suggests that the unique complexes identified in preapoptotic cells may also promote apoptosis via E2F-1 transcriptional activation (8.Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of E2F-1 induces cells to undergo apoptosis, and may occur through both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (19.Holmberg C. Helin K. Sehested M. Karlstrom O. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These include stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53 via the transcription of p14ARF, transcriptional activation of the p53 homologue p73, and inhibition of the anti-apoptotic signaling of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The ability of E2F-1 to induce apoptosis was thought to be a unique feature of this family member compared with other E2F transcription factors (20.DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that E2F-3 makes a major contribution to apoptotic pathways (21.Ziebold U. Reza T. Caron A. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). E2F-1 can also interfere with additional signaling pathways such as those mediated by NF-κB (22.Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Scopus (212) Google Scholar), an inducible transcription factor that regulates expression of various proinflammatory and immune response genes (23.Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 25.Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is typically a heterodimer of p65/RelA and p50 subunits, and is usually retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive form through association with the inhibitor protein IκB. For NF-κB activation, it is necessary that IκB undergoes phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation, thereby permitting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. NF-κB binds to specific response elements of target genes, including proinflammatory cytokines and antiapoptotic proteins. Although the role of p53 in suppressing cell cycle progression has been extensively described (26.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar, 27.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar), much less is known about the mechanism by which p53 induces apoptosis. Nevertheless, p53 has been shown to regulate several apoptotic genes, including members of the Bcl-2 family, such as proapoptotic Bax or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (28.Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15598-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, cytosolic Bax is translocated to the mitochondrial membrane where it induces cytochrome c release (31.Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 32.Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This acts as a coactivator of the apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) in the cleavage of pro-caspase-9 and execution of programmed cell death (33.Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Unlike Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL exert antiapoptotic effects by heterodimerizing with Bax in the mitochondria, and preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol (34.Kim C.N. Wang X. Huang Y. Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3115-3120PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family can determine the ultimate fate of the cell. Finally, it has recently been reported that the gene Apaf-1 is a transcriptional target for both E2F and p53 (36.Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Muller H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 528-552Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that UDCA and its taurine-conjugated derivative (TUDCA) stabilize the mitochondrial membrane and prevent TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. They act by inhibiting mitochondrial membrane depolarization and channel formation, production of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, and cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (4.Rodrigues C.M.P. Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 5.Rodrigues C.M.P. Ma X. Linehan-Stieers C. Fan G. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigated the mechanism(s) by which UDCA exerts its antiapoptotic effect. Our results indicate that the bile acid specifically inhibits the E2F-1/p53 apoptotic pathway, in part, through a caspase-independent mechanism and reduces NF-κB degradation induced by TGF-β1, thus modulating the expression of Bcl-2 family elements. Hepatocyte Isolation and Cell Culture—Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) by collagenase perfusion as described previously (37.Mariash C.N. Seelig S. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, rats were anesthetized with phenobarbitol and the livers perfused with 0.05% collagenase. Hepatocyte suspensions were obtained by passing digested livers though 125 μm gauze and washing cells in William's E medium (Invitrogen Corp., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 units/ml insulin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 nm dexamethasone, 5.5 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 20% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Norcross, GA). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was typically 85–90%. After isolation, hepatocytes were resuspended in complete William's E medium and plated on Primaria™ tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at either 2.1 × 104 cells/cm2 for transfection assays, or 6.4 × 104 cells/cm2 for all other experiments. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 6 h. Plates were then washed with medium to remove dead cells, and then incubated in William's E medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Induction of Apoptosis—Freshly isolated hepatocytes were cultured for 6 h as described above, washed and then incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum William's E medium supplemented with either 100 μm UDCA or TUDCA (Sigma), or no addition (control) for 12 h. Cells were then exposed to 1 nm recombinant human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for 6, 12, 24, 36, or 48 h. In parallel studies, hepatocytes were incubated with 50 μm of either caspase-3 (z-DEVD.fmk), caspase-9 (z-LEHD.fmk), or caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD.fmk) (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 1 h prior to TGF-β1 incubation. Attached and floating cells were combined and total, cytosolic and nuclear proteins extracted for immunoblotting and caspase activity assays; and total RNA for RT-PCR. Attached cells were fixed for Hoechst staining and immunocytochemical analysis. Morphologic Evaluation of Apoptosis and Caspase Activation— Hoechst labeling of cells was used to detect apoptotic nuclei. In brief, the medium was gently removed at the indicated times to prevent detachment of cells. Attached hepatocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) at 5 mg/ml in PBS for 5 min, washed with PBS and mounted using PBS:glycerol (3:1, v/v). Fluorescent nuclei were scored blindly by laboratory personnel and categorized according to the condensation and staining characteristics of chromatin. Normal nuclei showed non-condensed chromatin dispersed over the entire nucleus. Apoptotic nuclei were identified by condensed chromatin, contiguous to the nuclear membrane, as well as nuclear fragmentation of condensed chromatin. Three random microscopic fields per sample of ∼250 nuclei were counted and mean values expressed as the percentage of apoptotic nuclei. In addition, caspase activation was determined in cytosolic protein extracts after harvesting and homogenization of cells in isolation buffer, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). General caspase-3-like activity was determined by enzymatic cleavage of chromophore p-nitroanilide (pNA) from the substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNA (DEVD-pNA; Sigma Chemical Co.). The proteolytic reaction was carried out in isolation buffer containing 50 μg cytosolic protein and 50 μm DEVD-pNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the formation of pNA was measured at 405 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Transfections and CAT Assays—Transfections were performed using reporter constructs E2F-1CAT and 4xE2FCAT, and four expression constructs, pCMVE2F-1, pCMVE2F-1Δ53, pCMVp53, and pCMVp53-(143Ala). E2F-1CAT consisted of the entire human E2F-1 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (38.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar); 4xE2FCAT was generated by insertion of a synthetic promoter containing four E2F consensus binding sites (39.Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) upstream of the CAT reporter gene. Overexpression plasmids were generated by cloning either wild-type E2F-1 (pCMVE2F-1) and p53 (pCMVp53) or mutant E2F-1 (pCMVE2F-1Δ53) and p53 (pCMVp53(143Ala)), all under CMV enhancer/promoter control (40.Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Twelve hours after plating, hepatocytes at 40% confluence were transfected with 4 μg of each plasmid using conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI) as previously described (41.Kren B.T. Cole-Strauss A. Kmiec E.B. Steer C.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To assess transfection efficiency, hepatocytes were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter construct, PGL3-Control vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Based on this control, transfection efficiencies were ∼70% and did not differ between wild-type and dominant negative plasmids. Twelve hours after E2F-1CAT or 4xE2FCAT transfection, vehicle or 100 μm of either UDCA or TUDCA was added to cells. After an additional 12 h, 1 nm TGF-β1 was included in the cultures. The cells were incubated with TGF-β1 for 36 h after which all floating and attached cells were harvested for CAT ELISA (Roche Applied Science) and luciferase assays (Promega Corp.), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Twelve hours prior to transfection with the expression plasmids, hepatocytes were treated with vehicle or 100 μm of either UDCA or TUDCA. At 48 and 60 h post-transfection, all cells were harvested, and total protein extracts were analyzed for p53 or Bax expression, respectively. In addition, attached cells were also fixed for morphologic detection of apoptosis. Immunoblotting—Steady-state levels of pRb, p53, Mdm-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax proteins, as well as NF-κB and IκB and their intracellular location were determined by Western blot. Briefly, 200 μg of total, cytosolic, or nuclear protein extracts were separated on 6 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Following electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblots were incubated with 15% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% milk solution, the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive to p53 and Bax or primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies to pRb, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mdm-2, NF-κB p65 subunit and IκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and finally with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were processed for protein detection using Super Signal™ substrate (Pierce). β-actin was used as a loading control. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and Bax transcript expression were determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from rat primary hepatocytes using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp.). Specific oligonucleotide primer pairs were incubated with cDNA template for PCR amplification using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System from Roche Applied Science. The following sequences were used as primers: Bcl-2 sense 5′-CTGGTGGACAACATCGCTCTG-3; Bcl-2 antisense 5′-GGTCTGCTGACCTCACTTGTG-3; Bax sense 5′-TGGTTGCCCTTTTCTACTTTG-3′; Bax antisense 5′-GAAGTAGGAAAGGAGGCCATC-3′; Bcl-x sense, 5′-AGGTCGGCGATGAGTTTGAA-3′; Bcl-x antisense, 5′-CGGCTCTCGGCTGCTGCATT-3′; β-actin sense 5′-TGCCCATCTATGAGGGTTACG-3′; and β-actin antisense 5′-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACG-3′. The product of the β-actin RNA served as control. Immunocytochemistry—Hepatocytes were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4 at room temperature for 10 min, washed three times with a mixture containing PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide for 15 min, cells were incubated with an activation-dependent anti-NF-κB antibody at a dilution of 1:50 in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, hepatocytes were incubated with secondary donkey anti-goat IgG antibody conjugated with Cy5 at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed for 5 min and mounted using Fluoromount-G. Fluorescence was visualized using a MRC1000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—The relative intensities of protein and nucleic acid bands were analyzed using the ImageMaster 1D Elite densitometric analysis program (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 for Windows 95 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) for the analysis of variance and Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. UDCA Inhibits E2F-1-mediated Transcription Induced by TGF-β1—It has been established that unbound E2F mediates apoptosis by TGF-β1 in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells (14.Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3181-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, UDCA inhibits TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in HuH-7 cells and in primary rat hepatocytes (4.Rodrigues C.M.P. Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 5.Rodrigues C.M.P. Ma X. Linehan-Stieers C. Fan G. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting that E2F could be an important regulatory factor targeted by UDCA. In this study, apoptosis was assessed by changes in nuclear morphology and by caspase activation (Fig. 1). Significant levels of apoptosis occurred in cultured primary rat hepatocytes after incubation with TGF-β1, with a maximum apoptotic response at 36 h (p < 0.01). UDCA and TUDCA protected against the TGF-β1-induced nuclear fragmentation and caspase-3-like activation by 50–70%. In contrast, the caspase-3 inhibitor significantly prevented apoptosis at 12 h (p < 0.05), but not at later time points, suggesting that UDCA protection is not simply due to caspase inhibition. Both re-supplementation with z-DEVD-fmk at 12 h and caspase activity assays confirmed that the weak inhibitory effect on apoptosis after 12 h did not result from loss of activity of the caspase inhibitor. In addition, similar results were obtained with caspase-9 and -8 inhibitors, as well as with the z-VAD-fmk pan-caspase inhibitor, thus minimizing the possibility that other caspases could induce apoptosis at 24 h or later, in the absence of caspase-3 activation (data not shown). Primary rat hepatocytes were then transfected with one of two CAT transcription reporter constructs under E2F-dependent promoters, E2F-1CAT and 4xE2FCAT, and exposed to TGF-β1 for up to 36 h. The observed cell death was associated with a marked increase in transcriptional activation of E2F-1, which was detectable at 6 h but significant only at 12 h (p < 0.05) through 36 h (p < 0.01) of incubation with TGF-β1 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, UDCA significantly abrogated the TGF-β1-induced E2F-1 expression as early as 12 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). Thus, we determined whether UDCA reduces E2F-1 activation by inhibition of caspase activity. Our results indicated that inhibitors to caspase-3, -9, or -8 did not prevent TGF-β1-induced E2F-1 expression at 6 or 12 h, suggesting that E2F-1 is a caspase-independent target of UDCA. Curiously, all caspase inhibitors slightly increased TGF-β1-induced E2F-1 activation, perhaps due to their inherent toxicity. However, because of their downstream role in the apoptotic cascade, it is not surprising that caspase inhibitors prevented apoptosis with TGF-β1 at 12 h but not E2F-1 activation. In addition, CAT activity was >2-fold higher with 4xE2F than with the E2F-1 promoter at 36 h (Fig. 2C). UDCA reduced CAT activity by ∼ 70% in cells transfected with E2F-1CAT (p < 0.01) and 4xE2FCAT (p < 0.05) reporter plasmids. TUDCA also significantly inhibited TGF-β1-mediated E2F transcription at 36 h (p < 0.01). Based on the observation that TGF-β1 induced significant hepatocyte apoptosis, we determined whether the activation of E2F transcription was due to a caspase-mediated loss of pRb. The results showed that TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activation of E2F-1 was indeed associated with a loss of pRb at 12 h through 48 h (Fig. 3A). However, the inhibition of the E2F-mediated transcription by UDCA and TUDCA was not entirely dependent on changes in pRb expression. In fact, both bile acids significantly prevented TGF-β1 associated loss of pRb at 12 and 24 h, but not beyond these time points (Fig. 3B). Moreover, coincubation with caspase inhibitors did not prevent TGF-β1-induced pRb degradation at 6 or 12 h, and further increased pRb loss at 6 h (Fig. 3C). Thus, these data suggest that TGF-β1-induced E2F activation is not merely a secondary event due to decreased levels of pRb, but rather directly modulated by UDCA.Fig. 3Modulation of pRb expression in primary rat hepatocytes. Cells were incubated with 1 nm TGF-β1 or no addition (control) ± UDCA, TUDCA, or caspase inhibitors for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. In coincubation experiments, cells were either pretreated with 100 μm UDCA or TUDCA 12 h prior to incubation with TGF-β1, or incubated with 50 μm of either caspase-3 (z-DEVD.fmk), caspase-9 (z-LEHD.fmk) or caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD.fmk) 1 h prior to adding TGF-β1. Total proteins were extracted for Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative immunoblot of pRb in cells exposed to TGF-β1 for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h.

https://openalex.org/W2063322239,"Bradykinin (BK) is an important mediator in several inflammatory and vascular diseases that acts in part via induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The mechanisms involved in BK-mediated COX-2 induction are unclear. Here we characterized the transcriptional mechanisms involved in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. BK stimulated the activity of a transiently transfected 966-bp (–917 to + 49) COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct. There was no reduction in BK-induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with COX-2 promoter constructs of 674, 407, 239, and 135 bp or constructs with mutated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- or NF-κB-binding sites. In contrast luciferase activity was reduced in cells transfected with a 407-bp COX-2 promoter fragment containing a mutated cAMP response element (CRE)-binding site, suggesting that the CRE binding site is critical. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides specific for the CRE-binding region of the COX-2 promoter and consensus oligonucleotides showed strong specific binding. Furthermore BK increased consensus cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter (p6CRE/luc)-mediated luciferase expression. CRE activation occurred by BK inducing cytosolic phospholipase A2-mediated arachidonic acid release and rapid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, thereby increasing cAMP. Indomethacin inhibited BK-induced PGE2 production, cAMP accumulation, and CRE/luc reporter and COX-2 promoter luciferase activity. Exogenous PGE2 and EP2 (ONO-AE1 259) and EP4 (ONO-AE1 329) PGE2 receptor agonists mimicked the effect of BK. Collectively these studies indicate that COX-2 induction by BK in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells is mediated by the CRE through a novel autocrine loop involving endogenous PGE2.

BK together with Lys-BK or kallidin are also the principal kinins involved in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis (3.Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). BK binds to specific cell surface receptors, B1 and B2. The B1 receptor is induced in response to inflammatory challenge, whereas B2 receptor expression is constitutive. Both receptors are members of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family. Ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors, which are expressed in many cell and tissue types, gives rise to diverse physiological responses including cytokine and growth factor production. bradykinin pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell(s) human PASMC prostaglandin E2 nuclear factor κB cyclooxygenase electrophoretic mobility shift assay cAMP response element cytosolic phospholipase A2 interleukin tumor necrosis factor cAMP-response element-binding protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase E-prostanoid CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the production of prostaglandin, prostacyclin, and thromboxane from arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipid by phospholipases, is converted to prostaglandin H2 by COX and then to the specific prostaglandin by terminal synthases. There are different isoforms of COX: COX-1, whose expression in constitutive, and COX-2, which is induced in response to pro-inflammatory peptides and mediators (4.Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). There is also the recently identified COX-3, whose function has been less well characterized (5.Chandrasekharan N.V. Dai H. Roos K.L. Evanson N.K. Tomsik J. Elton TS Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13926-13931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that BK induces COX-2 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), but the transcriptional mechanisms used by BK to induce COX-2 have not been defined (6.Bradbury D.A. Newton R. Zhu Y.M. Stocks J. Corbett L. Holland E.D. Pang L.H. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L717-L725Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The COX-2 promoter has binding sites for a number of transcription factors including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), C/EBP, AP-2, and cAMP response element (CRE), which are involved in COX-2 induction in response to several other stimuli. For example NF-κB is involved in IL-1β- and hypoxia-induced COX-2 expression in lung epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells (7.Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 8.Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.S. Liu W.L. Dubois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

In fibroblasts, COX-2 induction by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and IL-1β utilizes the C/EBP-binding domain (9.Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There are a number of candidate transcription factors for the effect of BK on COX-2 because BK has been shown to activate transcription factors that have binding motifs on the COX-2 promoter. BK induced IL-1β mRNA in a human lung fibroblast cell line by activation of NF-κB (10.Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and also activated NF-κB in HeLa cells transfected with BK B2 receptors (11.Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our own studies of regulation of the IL-8 gene have shown that BK can activate C/EBP (12.Zhu Y.M. Bradbury D.A. Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29366-29375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A CRE is also present on the human COX-2 promoter, but its role has been less well defined. Signaling via the CRE- and AP-1-binding motifs has been reported in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated COX-2 induction in murine osteoblastic cells (13.Okada Y. Voznesensky O. Herschman H. Harrison J. Pilbeam C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we have determined the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the COX-2 promoter by BK in HPASMC. Mutational and deletional analysis of the COX-2 promoter showed that NF-κB and C/EBP sites were not required for the increase in COX-2 promoter activity produced by BK. In contrast mutations of the CRE site abolished the effect, suggesting that the CRE was essential. Consistent with this, BK increased activity of a CRE luciferase construct and CREB binding to the COX-2 promoter by EMSA. Furthermore studies with exogenous PGE2, EP2 and EP4 PGE2 receptor subtype agonists, and the COX inhibitor indomethacin showed that BK-induced activation of the CRE was due to an autocrine loop involving the early release of PGE2 via cPLA2 and action on EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. Cell Culture—Proximal human HPASMC were purchased at passage 3 from Clonetics® (BioWhittaker UK Ltd., Wokingham, UK). The PASMC were cultured to passage 6 in smooth muscle cell growth medium-2 BulletKit® (Clonetics®, BioWhittaker UK Ltd.). All of the experiments were set up in triplicate or quadruplicate using passage 6 cells cultured in 6- or 24-well plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator (Leec, Colwick, Nottingham, UK). The confluent cells were growth-arrested by serum withdrawal for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium with or without bradykinin (Sigma). For the inhibition experiments the cells were preincubated for 30 min with either 1 μm indomethacin (Sigma) or 0.1% Me2SO (Sigma) as the vehicle control. The highly selective EP2 and EP4 PGE2 receptor subtype agonists ONO-AE1 259 and ONO-AE1 329, which were a gift from ONO Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan), were used in the PGE2 receptor studies (14.Maruyama T.

Assessment of Cell Viability—One well of the 24-well plate in each condition was detached using 0.025% trypsin and 0.01% EDTA. The cell number and percentage of viability were assessed using a hemocytometer and 0.4% Trypan blue (Sigma). PGE2 Assay—The PGE2 levels in the culture supernatants were assessed by radioimmunoassay as described previously. The bound [3H]PGE2 (Amersham Biosciences) was measured using the Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Bioscience Ltd., Pangbourne, UK). The PGE2 levels were calculated with Riasmart software (Packard Bioscience Ltd.). PGE2 was chosen because it is the main prostaglandin produced by pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (16.Wen F.Q. Watanabe K. Yoshida M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1998; 59: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). cAMP Assay—The cAMP was assayed after freon-amine (Sigma) extraction using [8-3H]adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate, ammonium salt (Amersham Biosciences), and protein kinase A cAMP-dependent binding protein (Sigma) as described previously. This assay is based on the competitive binding between the unlabeled endogenous cAMP and a known, fixed quantity of 3H-labeled cAMP for an added known amount of the 3′,5′-cAMP-dependent protein kinase (17.Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). [3H]Arachidonic Acid Release—Confluent PASMC were growth-arrested by withdrawal of serum for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 18.5 KBq/ml of [3H]arachidonic acid (Amersham Biosciences), and the cells were incubated for 16 h. The culture supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed three times in sterile serum-free medium. The cells were then treated with or without 10 μm BK and for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. The antibiotic and calcium ionophore calcimycin A23187 was used as a positive control. After the incubation times the supernatants were removed, and the released [3H]arachidonic acid was counted using Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer and Emulsifier Safe liquid scintillation mixture (Packard Bioscience Ltd.). The remaining cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and counted as above. The percentage [3H]arachidonic acid release was calculated as shown in the following equation.&percnt;[3H-]AArelease=radioactivityinmediumradioactivityinmedium+radioactivityincelllysate×100(Eq. 1) Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting for COX-1 and COX-2 was performed as described previously (18.Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1132-L1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (Cowley, Oxford, UK). The staining intensity of the bands was measured using a densitometer (Syngene, Braintree, UK) together with Genesnap and Genetools software (Syngene). The figures depicting Western blotting are representative of four blots. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—HPASMC were cultured to confluence in 6-well plates and growth-arrested for 24 h by serum withdrawal. The cells were treated with BK at a final concentration of 10 μm and collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 25 μl including 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 25 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer, 0.5 mm of each dNTPs, and 1× first strand buffer. (Promega). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. PCR was carried out by adding 10 μl of cDNA to 40-μl reaction mixture giving final concentrations of 1 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm of each dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 1× PCR buffer (Promega), and 0.5 μm of both the upstream and downstream PCR primers (Sigma). The primer sequences were as follows: COX-2 sense, 5′-TTC AAA TGA GAT TGT GGG AAA ATT GCT-3′; COX-2 antisense, 5′-AGA TCA TCT CTG CCT GAG TAT CTT-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3′; GAPDH antisense, 5′-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3′; cPLA2 sense, 5′-CCA AAG TGA CAA AGG GGG CC-3′; cPLA2 antisense 5′-GCT ACC ACA GGC ACA TCA CG-3′; COX-1 sense, 5′-TGC CCA GCT CCT GGC CCG CCG CTT-3′; and COX-1 antisense 5′-GTG CAT CAA CAC AGG CGC CTC TTC-3′. Amplification was carried out with a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA) after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min. This was followed by 30 cycles of PCR using the following temperatures and times: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 58 °C for 2 min, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% of agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer Tris-boric acid-EDTA (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized using ultraviolet illumination and the GeneGenius gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene). Transfection of COX-2 Promoter with Deletions and Mutations—The PASMC were transiently transfected for 2 h using a liposomal transfection system (LipofectAMINE LF2000; Invitrogen). Transfections of the COX-2 promoter were performed using C2.2 (–2375/+49) 2424-bp or C2.1 (–917/+49) 966-bp fragments and C2.1 with a series of deletions or site-specific mutations ligated with a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 basic (Promega UK, Southampton, UK). Deletions consisted of Dra (–625/+49) 674-bp, Sty (–358/+49) 407-bp, Alu (–190/+49) 239-bp, and Rsa (–86/+49) 135-bp fragments. Mutations consisted of C/EBP (–132/–124), CRE (–59/–53), and NF-κB motifs κBu (–447/–438) and κBd (–224/–214) on the COX-2 promoter that bind p50/p65 NF-κB heterodimers. The cells were cultured in 24-well plates to confluence, growth-arrested, and transfected using 1 μl of LF2000 and 0.8 μg of DNA/well according to the company instructions. The cells were co-transfected with 1 μg/well of the internal control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega UK) containing the Renilla luciferase gene (6.Bradbury D.A. Newton R. Zhu Y.M. Stocks J. Corbett L. Holland E.D. Pang L.H. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L717-L725Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation with or without 10 μm bradykinin, the cells were harvested, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay system kit (Promega UK) and a Microlumat Plus LB 96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbag, Germany). LipofectAMINE was shown to have a transfection efficiency of 10–20% under these conditions using HPASMC and green fluorescent protein (data not shown). Transfection with p6CRE/luc Reporter—The p6CRE/luc construct contains the firefly luciferase gene under control of the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and six CREs and was obtained from S. Rees (Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, UK). This construct responds to agents that increase cAMP levels (19.Scott M.G. Swan C. Jobson T.M. Rees S. Hall I.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Confluent, growth-arrested HPASMC in 24-well plates were transfected for 2 h using 2 μl of LF2000 and 1 μg of DNA/well. The medium was removed and incubated with serum-free medium containing either 1 μm indomethacin or 0.2% Me2SO for 30 min. BK was added to give a final concentration of 10 μm. Medium was added to the control wells. The cells were incubated for 2 h, after which the supernatants were removed, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase levels were measured using a luciferase assay system kit (Promega UK) and the Microlumat Plus LB 96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG). In some of the wells 10 nm exogenous PGE2 was added. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The nuclear protein fractions for EMSA were prepared using Nu-Clear extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Oligonucleotides containing the CREB sequences 5′-AAC AGT CAT TTC GTC ACA TGG GCT TG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CA AGC CCA TGT GAC GAA ATG ACT GTT-3′ (antisense) (Sigma) were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega UK). Fifteen micrograms of nuclear protein, 32P-labeled double-stranded probe (40,000 counts/min/ng), and 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) were mixed in a total volume of 10 μl. In competition assays, 50× unlabeled competitors were added at the same time as probe addition. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer and subjected to electrophoresis for 60 min. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography on Kodak XAR film at –70 °C for 19–48 h. Supershift was demonstrated using 400 ng of specific goat polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-human CREB-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Statistical Analysis—The results of the cAMP, PGE2, and luciferase levels were expressed as the means of the triplicate or quadruplicate wells for that experiment. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results shown represent the means ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences. A p value of <0.05 (two-tailed) was regarded as statistically significant. BK Induces COX-2 Protein and PGE2 Release—We have previously reported that BK induces COX-2 protein and stimulates increased PGE2 release in cultured human PASMC (6.Bradbury D.A. Newton R. Zhu Y.M. Stocks J. Corbett L. Holland E.D. Pang L.H. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L717-L725Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we also found that BK increased PGE2 release. There was a significant difference in PGE2 levels in cells treated with 10 μm BK at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 1A). COX-2 was induced by BK with COX-2 protein detected at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h, with the strongest bands at 4 and 8 h. COX-1 protein was constitutively expressed and remained constant at all the time points (Fig. 1B). BK Induction of COX-2 Is Transcriptional—Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that BK increased COX-2 mRNA levels with time with a 2-fold increase at 60 min reducing to almost basal levels by 4 h (Fig. 2A). To confirm that this was due to COX-2 gene transcription rather than stabilization of mRNA, the cells were cultured for 1 h with 10 μm BK together with 5 and 10 μg/ml actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. The actinomycin D-treated cells showed a reduction in mRNA density (Fig. 2B). Western blotting demonstrated that incubation for 4 h with 10 μm BK together with 5 and 10 μg/ml actinomycin D inhibited COX-2 protein induction by BK (Fig. 2C). The cells were transfected with a 966-bp COX-2 promoter fragment (–917 to +49) ligated to firefly luciferase (C2.1). There was a 5.4 ± 0.27-fold increase in luciferase activity in the BK-treated cells compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that induction of COX-2 by BK is transcriptional and not mediated by post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. Mutations in the CRE but Not the NF-κB- or C/EBP-binding Sites in the COX-2 Promoter Reduce BK-stimulated Luciferase Activity—To determine which transcription factors are involved, the cells were transfected with 966 bp of the wild type COX-2 promoter (C2.1) and a series of deletion constructs ligated to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. A diagram representing the COX-2 promoter showing the key transcription sites and the positions where the restriction enzymes cleave the promoter to generate the series of deletions is shown in Fig. 3. BK increased the luciferase levels 5.4 ± 0.27 in the C2.1 construct. There was no reduction in luciferase activity with any of the deletions compared with the C2.1, suggesting that even the smallest Rsa fragment of the COX-2 promoter, which contains only the CRE transcription factor, was able to induce COX-2 (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4A, increase in luciferase expression in PASMC transiently transfected with the deletion series of the COX-2 promoter luciferase constructs after 2 h of incubation with 10 μm BK. The cells were cultured in 24-well plates to confluence, growth-arrested, and transfected using 1 μl of LF2000 and 0.8 μg of DNA/well. The cells were co-transfected with the internal control plasmid pRL-SV40 containing the Renilla luciferase gene and corrected for any variations in transfection efficiency. The figure represents the mean and S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.

The cells were cultured in 24-well plates to confluence, growth-arrested, and transfected using 1 μl of LF2000 and 0.8 μg of DNA/well. The graph shows the fold increase of luciferase activity in cells treated with BK compared with those with no BK treatment.

However, there was a significant inhibition (p < 0.01) with the mutated CRE construct (–59/–53), suggesting that this factor is necessary for COX-2 induction by BK (Fig. 4C). BK Increases CREB Binding to the COX-2 Promoter—We used EMSA to determine whether BK treatment increased CREB binding to the COX-2 promoter. Incubation with 10 μm BK for 60 min induced CREB-1 binding activity with consensus and COX-2 promoter CRE oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, A and B). Supershift studies using a monoclonal antibody to CREB-1 produced gel retardation with the consensus sequence (Fig. 5A) and with the COX-2 promoter-specific primers (Fig. 5B). Competition with 50-fold excess unlabeled COX-2 promoter-specific CRE oligonucleotides blocked transcription factor binding, whereas excess AP-1 oligonucleotides did not block CRE transcription factor binding, demonstrating that the binding was specific (Fig. 5C). BK Increases cAMP Production and Activates a 6CRE/luc Reporter Construct—To confirm that BK was increasing cAMP and thereby activating CRE-mediated transcription, we performed cAMP assays after BK stimulation and also measured activation of a 6CRE/luc reporter gene. BK rapidly increases intracellular cAMP levels (Fig. 6A) and increased the activity of the 6CRE/luc reporter construct (Fig. 6B), thereby demonstrating that BK was acting to increase cAMP and stimulate CRE-mediated transcription. BK-induced Release of PGE2 via cPLA2 Is Responsible for Generating the cAMP Signal—BK is known to produce a rapid increase in PGE2 by activating cPLA2 (20.Pyne N.J. Tolan D. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328 (Pt 2): 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because PGE2 can increase cAMP via EP2 and EP4 receptors (21.Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22.Coleman RA Smith WL Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that cPLA2 induced early PGE2 production was the upstream signal to increase cAMP and stimulate cAMP-mediated CRE activation and gene transcription. We found that BK induced an increase in cPLA2 mRNA that was maximal at 60 min. Furthermore we saw a significant increase in [3H]arachidonic acid release in the BK-treated cells at 30, 60, and 120 min (Fig. 7, A and B). This was accompanied by PGE2 generation (Fig. 7C). To test the role of this early PGE2 release, we determined the effect of its inhibition by indomethacin, a COX inhibitor. We found that PGE2 release was inhibited by preincubation with 1 μm indomethacin (Fig. 8A). Moreover indomethacin also inhibited BK-mediated increases in cAMP levels (Fig. 8B) and BK increases in 6CRE/luc reporter luciferase activity (Fig. 8C). Furthermore indomethacin inhibited CRE transcription factor binding by EMSA (Fig. 8D). The inhibitory effects of indomethacin on PGE2 release by cPLA2, cAMP generation, 6CRE/luc reporter activity, and EMSA CRE binding strongly suggest that early PGE2 release by cPLA2 is critical in the signal transduction cascade.Fig. 8A, cells were cultured for 30 min with 10 μm BK after preincubation for 30 min with either 1 μm indomethacin or 0.1% Me2SO as a vehicle control. PGE2 release was measured and compared with unstimulated cells. BK increased PGE2 release. ***, p < 0.001. Pretreatment with indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, abolished the BK-associated increase in PGE2. +++, p < 0.001. B, cells were cultured for 30 min with 10 μm BK after preincubation for 30 min with either 1 μm indomethacin or 0.1% Me2SO. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured and compared with unstimulated control cells and time 0 levels. There was no detectable cAMP in the control cells. There was a significant increase in cAMP in the BK-treated cells after 30 min. ***, p < 0.001. Pretreatment with indomethacin abolished the BK-associated increase in cAMP. +++, p < 0.001. C, BK-mediated cAMP-driven luciferase activity is inhibited by indomethacin in PASMC transfected with 6CRE/luc luciferase reporter construct. Confluent, growth-arrested cells in 24-well plates were transfected for 2 h using 2 μl of LF2000 and 1 μg of DNA/well. BK increased luciferase relative light units (RLU). ***, p < 0.001, which was significantly reduced by indomethacin; +++, p < 0.001. The figure shows the mean and S."

Breast cancer in humans is associated with a loss of heterozygosity or mutation of the PTEN gene, and decreased PTEN expression has been associated with invasive breast cancer and poor prognosis (2.Garcia J.M.

The principal activity of PTEN is to dephosphorylate a phospholipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), produced by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (8.Cantley L.C.

Despite the obvious importance of PTEN, only a handful of molecules are known to control its expression. Intracellular molecules reported to regulate PTEN transcription include p53 (10.Stambolic V.

Cell. 2001; 8: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (11.Patel L. Pass I. Coxon P. Downes C.P. Smith S.A.

Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These proteins induce PTEN promoter activity and putative binding sites for each have been identified in the PTEN promoter. Transforming growth factor β and progesterone have also been proposed to alter PTEN expression. Transforming growth factor β inhibited PTEN expression, but the nature of this regulation is unknown (13.Li D.M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar). Endometrial PTEN levels were higher during the secretory compared with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle implying an association with progesterone levels (14.Mutter G.L. Lin M.C. Fitzgerald J.T. Kum J.B. Eng C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2334-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of PTEN in the control of cell survival and proliferation, it stands to reason that extracellular factors such as hormones or growth factors should also influence PTEN expression. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are potent mitogens that impact development, are implicated as risk factors in breast cancer, and are overexpressed in human cancers (15.Werner H. Le Roith D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 183-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Baker J. Liu J.-P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). IGF-I and IGF-II are produced by breast cancer cell lines (17.Quinn K.A. Treston A.M. Unsworth E.J. Miller M.J. Vos M. Grimley C. Battey J. Mulshine J.L. Cuttitta F. J. Biol.

IGFs are known to mediate their cellular effects, at least in part, through the PI3K pathway (19.Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate through biochemical, genetic, and molecular studies that IGF-II negatively regulates this pathway by increasing PTEN expression. Our results show that this PTEN regulation functions during mouse mammary development and that IGF-mediated PTEN regulation involves the immediate early gene egr-1. Mice, Tissue, and Serum Analyses—The generation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-IGF-II mice has been reported (21.Moorehead R.A. Fata J.E. Johnson M.B. Khokha R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained following the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Whole mount, in situ hybridization, BrdUrd immunohistochemistry, serum progesterone, and 17-β-estradiol analyses were performed as previously described (22.Fata J.E. Chaudhary V. Khokha R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mammary Tissue Manipulations—Administration of recombinant proteins to mammary glands involved injection of human IGF-II (rhIGF-II; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin or rhIGF-I (Calbiochem) and insulin (Sigma) in 10 mm acetic acid with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm HCl. The 4th inguinal mammary glands were exposed surgically, and 10 μl containing 1 μg of rhIGF-II, 1 μg of rhIGF-I, and 10 μg of insulin or vehicle was injected. Elvax-40 pellets containing 300 ng of rhIGF-II or vehicle were generated (23.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Moorehead R.A. Martin D.C. Khokha R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and respectively implanted into the 4th inguinal or contralateral mammary glands of 33-day-old wild type mice, and tissue analyzed 7 days later. For mammary transplants, the 4th inguinal fat pads of 21-day-old mice were cleared by removing the tissue between lymph node and nipple. A 2 × 2 mm piece of removed tissue was transplanted as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Whole mounts were analyzed 21 days later. Mini-osmotic pumps (Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) containing 40 μg of rhIGF-II/100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin or vehicle (pump rate 0.25 μl/hr) were implanted in the abdominal cavity of 35-day-old wild type females and mammary tissue analyzed 14 days later. Western Analysis—Protein isolation and Western blotting was performed as described previously (21.Moorehead R.A. Fata J.E. Johnson M.B. Khokha R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) except pIRS-1 (Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), actin (Sigma), and cyclin D1, Egr-1, insulin receptor, IGF-IIR, α-tubulin, and keratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells—Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient for egr-1 or pten were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (12.Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted from mammary tissue and reverse transcribed. Resulting cDNAs were amplified using a 56 °C annealing temperature and 23 cycles with primers for either PTEN (5′-ACAGACCTAGGCTACTGCTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCAAGACTTCCGTTC-3′), or the house-keeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) (5′-GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG-3′ and 5′-GATTCAACTTGCGCTCATCTTAGGC-3′). PCR samples were electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with the appropriate 32P-labeled probe. Membranes were analyzed using a PhosphoImager and Imagequant software (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time PCR was performed as previously described (24.Wall S.J. Bevan D. Thomas D.W. Harding K.G. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 91-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using a forward (5′-CCCAGTCAGAGGCGCTATGTATAT-3′) and reverse (5′-gttccgccactgaacattgg-3′) primer for PTEN and the probe (5′-CAGACCCGTGGCACTGCTGTTTCAC-3′). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transfections and luciferase assays were performed as previously described with the following modifications (12.Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Following transfection with 500 ng of the reporter plasmid DNA, cells were placed in medium containing 0.5% serum and incubated at 37 °C for a further 24 h. Cells were then treated with IGF-II at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for a period of 4 h and harvested at the appropriate time interval. All values were normalized using 100 ng CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. Statistics—All values are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test, and values were considered significant when p < 0.05. IGF-II Injection Increases Mammary PTEN—We analyzed whether recombinant IGF-II administered in an acute or chronic regimen altered Akt and PTEN levels in mouse mammary tissue. Local injection into the gland increased phosphorylated Akt levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). As expected, IGF-II administration resulted in rapid and sustained phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (Fig. 1B). Despite this, Akt phosphorylation was only transient, peaking around one hour post-injection and declining to pre-injection levels an hour later (Fig. 1, B and C). Concomitant with phosphorylated Akt decline was an increase in PTEN protein (Fig. 1, B and D). IGF-II did not activate MAPK pathways as Erks or p38 were not phosphorylated at 1 h post-injection, whereas epidermal growth factor injection provided a positive control for Erk/p38 activation (data not shown). PTEN mRNA levels also rose over time (Fig. 1, D and E). Chronic exposure to elevated IGF-II was achieved through implanting mini-osmotic pumps containing IGF-II or vehicle. These pumps systemically released a constant amount of IGF-II over a 14-day period spanning 35–49 days of age. PTEN protein levels were significantly elevated in the mammary tissue of mice receiving this treatment. In parallel with chronic PTEN protein up-regulation, a significant reduction in the levels of phosphorylated Akt was observed (Fig. 1F). This demonstrates that IGF-II has the ability to influence molecules that both positively and negatively regulate PI3K signaling in vivo, through IRS-1 and PTEN, respectively. Transgenic IGF-II Increases Mammary PTEN—To investigate the biological relevance of IGF-II-mediated PTEN induction in the mammary gland, we used MMTV-IGF-II mice that we have previously generated (21.Moorehead R.A. Fata J.E. Johnson M.B. Khokha R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We compared and found similar levels of type-I IGF (IGF-IR), insulin (Fig. 2A), and type-II IGF-II receptors (data not shown) in the wild type and transgenic mammary tissue. We then confirmed that IGF-IR was activated in transgenic tissue by assessing phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the developing mammary gland (Fig. 2A). Similar to our above findings with acute and chronic IGF-II administration, we found a significant reduction in phosphorylated Akt levels (Fig. 2, A and B), concomitant with a significant increase in PTEN protein levels (Fig. 2, A and C) in transgenic mammary tissue. Immunohistochemistry localized the reduced phosphorylated Akt and elevated PTEN protein to the transgenic mammary epithelium (data not shown). IGF-II Inhibits Mammary Ductal Development—The PI3K/Akt/PTEN pathway is at the crux of cell survival, capable of influencing apoptosis, and more recently has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression (25.Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 26.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1, a key component of cell cycle progression is a downstream effector of Akt (25.Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Diminished levels of phosphorylated Akt permit cyclin D1 degradation (26.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 levels were significantly lower in the IGF-II overexpressing mammary tissue in 55 day-old mice (Fig. 2A). At this age, mouse mammary tissue is normally undergoing intense proliferation associated with epithelial ductal morphogenesis. To determine the effects of IGF-II-induced PTEN and resulting reduction in PI3K signaling, we assessed mammary morphogenesis in MMTV-IGF-II mice. Mammary ductal morphogenesis was significantly retarded in transgenic mice (Fig. 3, A–F) as is evident by a reduction in epithelial duct length, number of ducts, and the presence of terminal end buds in 75-day-old mice. Terminal end buds normally disappear by this age, and their presence indicates that lengthening of the ducts is not yet complete (27.Ball S.M. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, mammary epithelial proliferation was significantly inhibited as measured by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3, G–I). These phenotypes are opposite to those reported for conditional mammary PTEN knockout mice that have excessive ductal branching and mammary epithelial proliferation (28.Li G. Robinson G.W. Lesche R. Martinez-Diaz H. Jiang Z. Rozengurt N. Wagner K.U. Wu D.C. Lane T.F. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Wu H. Development. 2002; 129: 4159-4170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This highlights the biological impact PTEN levels have in mammary morphogenesis. Because pubertal mammary development is dependent on 17β-estradiol and progesterone (29.Shyamala G. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 1997; 8: 34-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we measured the serum levels of these hormones and found no difference between transgenic and wild type mice (data not shown). This indicates that retarded mammary development did not arise from altered ovarian function in MMTV-IGF-II mice. We next determined whether chronic IGF-II exposure would phenocopy mammary ductal retardation. A slow-release recombinant IGF-II pellet was implanted in the developing mammary gland of wild type mice while the contralateral gland received a control pellet. The IGF-II pellet retarded mammary ductal length by an average of 26% (data not shown). These data show that ectopic IGF-II expression decreased epithelial proliferation and inhibited pubertal mammary morphogenesis. Other well established signaling pathways linked to cell proliferation include Erk1/Erk2, p38 MAPK, and JNK/SAPK. However, no significant differences were found in the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/Erk2 or p38 MAPK in transgenic mammary tissue at day 55 (Fig. 3J). We assessed ATF-2, which is downstream of JNK/SAPK, and observed that ATF-2 phosphorylation was also unaltered (Fig. 3J). Thus, we ruled out the involvement of these potential pathways in mediating the inhibitory effect of IGF-II on epithelial proliferation. IGF-II Effect Is Epithelial Cell Autonomous—Both epithelial and stromal factors influence ductal development (23.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Moorehead R.A. Martin D.C. Khokha R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30.Dunbar M.E. Young P. Zhang J.P. McCaughern-Carucci J. Lanske B. Orloff J.J. Karaplis A. Cunha G. Wysolmerski J.J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that transgenic mammary IGF-II expression was exclusive to epithelial cells (Fig. 3, K and L). To determine whether epithelial IGF-II was sufficient to delay ductal progression, reciprocal mammary transplants were performed between wild type and transgenic mice. Cleared mammary fat pads were generated in both wild type and transgenic mice by severing the epithelial ductal trees prior to puberty. Transgenic mammary epithelium was implanted into wild type cleared fat pads (Fig. 3N), whereas wild type tissue was implanted into cleared transgenic fat pads (Fig. 3M). Epithelial ducts emanating from the transgenic transplants were significantly shorter than those from wild type transplants (Fig. 3O). Thus, this phenotype was epithelial cell autonomous; epithelial IGF-II rather than the host environment (stromal and endocrine factors) was responsible for the retarded mammary development. Because human breast cancer originates in epithelial cells, the existence of an IGF-II/PTEN link in epithelial cells and its relation to mammary growth is particularly relevant. IGF-II Regulates PTEN Transcription via Egr-1—We first tested the requirement of PTEN in IGF-II mediated Akt inactivation. Akt phosphorylation was sustained upon IGF-II treatment in pten–/– MEFs in relation to the wild type MEFs. Additionally, the basal level of Akt activation was substantially higher in pten–/– MEFs (Fig. 4A). To determine whether IGF-II regulates PTEN transcription, we used a PTEN-luciferase construct, pPTEN. MEFs transfected with this construct showed significant induction of luciferase activity after IGF-II treatment compared with a control PGL3 vector (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that IGF-II is able to induce PTEN promoter activity. A similar increase in PTEN promoter activity was also observed in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). The IGF axis is able to induce the transcription factor egr-1 in embryonic and cardiac fibroblasts (31.Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32.Winnay J.N. Bruning J.C. Burks D.J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that egr-1 directly activates PTEN during irradiation-induced signaling to a similar magnitude as observed above (12.Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the requirement of egr-1 for IGF-II regulation of PTEN transcription. MEFs transfected with PTEN-luciferase constructs lacking the three putative egr-1 binding sites (d117), but retaining the p53 binding site, failed to show luciferase induction following IGF-II treatment (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, egr-1–/– MEFs containing intact PTEN promoter constructs also showed no induction of luciferase activity when treated with IGF-II (Fig. 4B). The higher basal reporter activity in wild type cells may be reflective of its higher p53 levels compared with the egr-1–/– cells. In addition, IGF-II administration resulted in elevated PTEN protein levels in wild type MEFs but not egr-1 null MEFs (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we found that IGF-II injection into the mouse mammary gland induced Egr-1 protein expression in vivo (Fig. 4D). At present, the receptors that mediate the IGF-II effect remain to be elucidated. In this study we demonstrate that the growth factor IGF-II induces expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. PTEN is the major negative regulator of PI3K signaling, the very pathway used by IGFs to transmit their growth-stimulatory signal. This represents the first example of a negative feedback loop in IGF signaling that operates through PTEN to control proliferation. The biological consequences of this feedback are illustrated by experimentally increasing IGF-II levels, which lead to reduced proliferation and delayed mammary development. Regulation of PTEN occurs at the transcriptional level and the immediate early gene egr-1 is a necessary component of this loop. Similar feedback loops have been demonstrated in other signaling pathways including signaling from the insulin receptor (33.Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 34.Fiorini M. Alimandi M. Fiorentino L. Sala G. Segatto O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The canonical IGF-II pathway is mitogenic and implicated in mammary carcinogenesis. Our study demonstrates that through up-regulation of PTEN, IGF-II exerts a hypomorphic effect during mammary gland development. This effect bears a striking similarity to the MMTV-neu mouse, a widely used model of mammary tumorigenesis that also has hypomorphic mammary glands (35.Mukherjee S. Louie S.G. Campbell M. Esserman L. Shyamala G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complexity of oncogene action, whereby a growth factor can restrain its own mitogenic action by up-regulating a key tumor suppressor. Loss of this negative feedback loop may release the oncogene's cancer promoting ability, allowing its proliferative effect to dominate. We have found that the immediate early gene egr-1 is vital to the induction of PTEN by IGF-II. Studies have shown that egr-1 is an integral player in the IGF axis. It induces IGF-II promoter expression in HepG2 cells in response to hypoxia (36.Bae S.K. Bae M.H. Ahn M.Y. Son M.J. Lee Y.M. Bae M.K. Lee O.H. Park B.C. Kim K.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5989-5994PubMed Google Scholar). Also, stimulation of IGF signaling induces egr-1 expression, an effect that may be dependent on IRS-1 (31.Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32.Winnay J.N. Bruning J.C. Burks D.J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, egr-1 is both upstream and downstream of IGF-II signaling. It is conceivable that another level of regulation exists within the IGF-II/PTEN negative feedback loop wherein IGF-II signals through egr-1 to induce PTEN, but egr-1 also leads to IGF-II induction. Such multiple negative and positive regulatory loops likely operate within all cells to temper the actions of external growth stimuli. We have previously examined the PI3K/Akt/PTEN pathway at a different stage of mammary physiology in MMTV-IGF-II mice, namely post-lactation involution. We found that, unlike during mammary development, IGF-II did not influence PTEN expression during mammary involution (21.Moorehead R.A. Fata J.E. Johnson M.B. Khokha R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding is not surprising because the two stages have diametrically opposed cell fates and are structurally, hormonally, and functionally distinct. The developing mammary gland is primarily composed of ductal epithelium proliferating under the influence of estrogen and progesterone, whereas involuting mammary gland is lobulo-alveolar epithelium undergoing apoptosis initiated by prolactin withdrawal (37.Robinson G.W. McKnight R.A. Smith G.H. Hennighausen L. Development. 1995; 121: 2079-2090PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Russo I.H. Russo J. Surg. Pathol. 1994; 5: 307-326Google Scholar). The marked differences at these stages likely account for the disparate effects of IGF-II on PTEN. Egr-1 and PTEN, the components of our proposed negative feedback loop of IGF-II signaling, have been individually implicated in breast cancer (2.Garcia J.M. Silva J.M. Dominguez G. Gonzalez R.

Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is possible that alterations in egr-1 and/or PTEN break the negative feedback loop, allowing the proliferative effects of IGF-II to dominate. It is important to note that loss of PTEN function in breast cancer is predominantly through loss of expression and not mutation. Our findings describe a potentially important PTEN regulatory pathway involving the breast cancer mitogen, IGF-II. We thank Drs. V. Stambolic and T. W.

We have recently identified cDNA for CoA synthase and demonstrated that it encodes a bifunctional enzyme possessing 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase activities. Molecular cloning of CoA synthase provided us with necessary tools to study subcellular localization and the regulation of this bifunctional enzyme. Transient expression studies and confocal microscopy allowed us to demonstrate that full-length CoA synthase is associated with the mitochondria, whereas the removal of the N-terminal region relocates the enzyme to the cytosol. In addition, we showed that the N-terminal sequence of CoA synthase (amino acids 1–29) exhibits a hydrophobic profile and targets green fluorescent protein exclusively to mitochondria. Further analysis, involving subcellular fractionation and limited proteolysis, indicated that CoA synthase is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are the main components of the mitochondrial outer membrane, are potent activators of both enzymatic activities of CoA synthase in vitro. Taken together, these data provide the evidence that the final stages of CoA biosynthesis take place on mitochondria and the activity of CoA synthase is regulated by phospholipids.

Taken together, these data provide the evidence that the final stages of CoA biosynthesis take place on mitochondria and the activity of CoA synthase is regulated by phospholipids. Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor in numerous biosynthetic and degradative pathways of cellular metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the synthesis and β-oxidation of fatty acids, and the degradation of amino acids. The biosynthesis of CoA is highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and involves five enzymatic steps, which use pantothenate (vitamin B5), ATP, and cysteine (1.Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Strauss E. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 157-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The pathway is initiated by pantothenate kinase, which converts pantothenic acid into 4′-phosphopantothenic acid. The 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthase and phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase catalyze the formation of 4′-phospho-pantothenoylcysteine and 4′-phosphopantetheine (4′PP), 1The abbreviations used are: 4′PP4′-phosphopantetheineEGFepidermal growth factorSODsuperoxide dismutaseCoAsycoenzyme A synthaseVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelPPATphosphopantetheine adenylyltransferasedPCoAKdephospho-coenzyme A kinaseEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinMOMmitochondrial outer membranePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolamine. respectively. The last two steps of CoA biosynthesis are mediated by CoA synthase, which is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing 4′PP adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase activities. Therefore, CoA synthase mediates coupling of phosphopantetheine with ATP to form dephospho-CoA and the subsequent phosphorylation of the 3′-hydroxyl group to generate CoA. 4′-phosphopantetheine epidermal growth factor superoxide dismutase coenzyme A synthase voltage-dependent anion channel phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase dephospho-coenzyme A kinase enhanced green fluorescent protein mitochondrial outer membrane phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine. Biosynthesis of CoA is regulated by various extracellular stimuli, including nutrients, hormones of metabolic homeostasis, and cellular metabolites. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tissue level of CoA is reduced by insulin, glucose, fatty acids, and pyruvate, whereas glucagon and glucocorticoids stimulate CoA biosynthesis (3.Robishaw J.D. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Smith C.M. J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Changes in the rate of CoA biosynthesis occur with fasting, re-feeding, and several pathological conditions, such as diabetes, Reye syndrome, cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and cardiac hypertrophy (7.Reibel D.K. Wyse B.W. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: H606-H611PubMed Google Scholar, 8.McAllister R.A. Fixter L.M. Campbell E.H. Br. J.

Moreover, the ratio between CoA and its thioester derivatives is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been demonstrated that starvation and diabetes increase the Acyl-CoA:CoA ratio, which leads to mobilization of fatty acids (2.Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12.Lopaschuk G.D. Neely J.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1987; 19: 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, the ratio between acyl-CoA and CoA affects the activity of a number of cellular enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, carnitine acetyltransferase, and citrate synthase (13.Millar A.H. Knorpp C. Leaver C.J. Hill S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 334: 571-576Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14.McEvily A.J. Harrison J.H. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1258: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The analysis of CoA metabolic intermediates in bacteria and mammalian cells demonstrated that both pantothenate and 4′PP could accumulate in significant amounts, indicating the existence of two rate-limiting steps in CoA biosynthesis (16.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Rock C.O. Calder R.B. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1377-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Studies from several laboratories provided evidence that pantothenate kinase is the main regulatory enzyme in CoA biosynthesis (3.Robishaw J.D. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Rock C.O. Calder R.B. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

The activity of pantothenate kinase is strongly inhibited in a feedback regulatory mode by CoA and all of its acyl esters (6.Halvorsen O. Skrede S. Eur. J.

So far, very little is known about the regulation of 4′PP adenylyltransferase activity of CoA synthase, which seems to be another control point in maintaining CoA homeostasis. No physiological regulators of CoA synthase have been reported so far. However, the regulation of this step may control the re-utilization of 4′PP arising from the turnover of the acyl carrier protein or the degradation of CoA by a phosphodiesterase. The compartmentalization of the CoA biosynthetic pathway is very important but is not well understood. In baker's yeast, a multienzymatic CoA-synthesizing complex has been isolated and shown to contain all enzymatic activities involved in CoA biosynthesis (20.Bucovaz E.T. Tarnowski S.J. Morrison W.C. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Sobhy C.M. Rhoades J.L. Fryer J.E. Wakim J.M. Whybrew W.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1980; 30: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21.Bucovaz E.T. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Whybrew W.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, such a complex has not been observed in other organisms. In mammalian cells, the first three enzymes in the pathway of CoA biosynthesis are cytosolic proteins (17.Rock C.O. Calder R.B. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1377-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22.Aberhart D.J. Ghoshal P.K. Cotting J.A. Russell D.J.

Biochem. 1974; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The data on the localization of CoA synthase are somewhat controversial. The 4′PP adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase activities of CoA synthase have been reported in the cytosol (3.Robishaw J.D. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mitochondrial outer membrane (25.Tahiliani A.G. Neely J.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1987; 19: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in the mitochondrial matrix (26.Skrede S. Halvorsen O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of CoA synthase cDNA has facilitated the task of analyzing subcellular localization of the enzyme and its regulation in response to various extracellular stimuli and metabolic changes (27.Zhyvoloup A.

Furthermore, CoA synthase was mapped more precisely to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondrial localization of CoA synthase was shown to be mediated by the N-terminal sequence, which targets green fluorescent protein solely to mitochondria. We also provide evidence for the first time that both activities of CoA synthase are activated by phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. This study demonstrates that the last two steps of CoA biosynthesis occur on the outer mitochondrial membrane and that phospholipids can modulate the activity of CoA synthase. Materials—Tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen; insulin-like growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, dephospho-CoA, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol were from Sigma; mitochondrial marker MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos was from Molecular Probes. All chemicals used in this study were of analytical reagent grade. Cell Cultures and Antibodies—MCF7 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. The anti-VDAC1, anti-Mn-SOD and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (9E-10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Generation of rabbit polyclonal anti-CoAsy antibodies was described previously (27.Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S.

Plasmid Construction, Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length coding sequence of CoAsy was PCR-amplified by Vent polymerase and cloned into pFastBacHTb vector in frame with the His-tag epitope at the N terminus (Invitrogen). Generation of recombinant baculovirus was carried out using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Amplification of recombinant baculovirus, infection of Sf9 cells, and affinity purification of His-CoAsy were performed according to manufacturer's recommendations. To generate mammalian expression constructs, PCR-amplified sequences of full-length CoAsy (amino acids 1–563), ΔTMCoAsy (amino acids 29–563), ΔNCoAsy (amino acids 187–563), and dPCoAK (amino acids 349–563) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the C-terminal Myc-tag epitope. An 87-bp cDNA fragment coding for the first 29 amino acids of CoAsy was amplified by PCR and cloned in frame with the 5′-end of the green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI 373A automated sequencer. Immunofluorescence Analysis—NIH3T3 cells, grown on 13-mm coverslips, were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA 3.1-CoAsy, pcDNA 3.1-ΔTMCoAsy, pcDNA 3.1-dPCoAK, or pcDNA 3.1-ΔNCoAsy constructs using PolyFect under recommended conditions (QIAGEN). Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated with 100 nm MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Molecular Probes) for 15 min before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary anti-Myc antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were incubated with fixed cells for 1 h followed by incubation with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse antibodies. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-N1-CoAsyN plasmids was carried out using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Fluorescently labeled cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, and the images were analyzed using the LSM510 image browser software. Isolation of Mitochondria—Crude heavy and light mitochondrial fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation as recommended in OptiPrep Application Sheets (Axis-Shield PoC AS; www.axis-shieldpoc.com/density/dtech.htm). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were collected from two 150-mm plates and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). Cell suspension was homogenized with 15–20 passages through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was retained and the supernatant further centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The last two pellets were termed heavy and light mitochondrial fractions and used for isopycnic fractionation in an OptiPrep density gradient. Fractionation of Organelles with Preformed Density Gradient—Fractionation of the light and heavy mitochondrial pellets was performed in a continuous 10–30% OptiPrep (iodixanol) gradient according to manufacturer's recommendations (Axis-Shield PoC AS). Briefly, the gradient was formed by diffusion of 10/20/25/30% steps for 60 min. Heavy and light mitochondrial fractions were re-suspended in 5% OptiPrep, layered on the top of the gradient, and centrifuged in a swinging-bucket rotor at 80,000 × g for 2 h. After unloading the gradient, obtained fractions were frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath and stored at –80 °C. Limited Proteolysis, Alkaline and Urea Extractions—To determine the sensitivity of CoAsy to protease treatment, a light mitochondrial fraction (100 μg of proteins) was incubated with 1 μg of proteinase K for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 2 mm CaCl2. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and boiling in gel loading buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for detection of CoAsy, VDAC1, and Mn-SOD. The same quantity of a light mitochondrial fraction was extracted with 3 m urea and 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0, or under neutral conditions as described previously (30.Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Raza H. Avadhani N.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 156: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pellets and soluble fractions obtained in all types of extraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-CoAsy, anti-VDAC1, and anti-Mn-SOD antibodies. Enzymatic Assays—PPAT and dPCoAK activities were measured as described previously (27.Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S. Savinska L. Ovcharenko G. Verdier F. Valovka T. Fenton T. Rebholz H. Wang M.L. Shepherd P. Matsuka G. Filonenko V. Gout I.T. J. Biol.

All phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. Appropriate amounts of phospholipid solutions were mixed and solvent was vaporized in a SpeedVac at room temperature for 1 h. Lipid vesicles were freshly prepared in 1× assay buffer by vigorous vortexing of mixed phospholipids followed by sonication for 1 min at room temperature. The quality of prepared vesicles was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. The N-terminal Region of CoAsy Possesses a Conserved Hydrophobic Stretch—We and others have recently cloned cDNAs encoding mammalian CoAsy (27.Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S. Savinska L. Ovcharenko G. Verdier F. Valovka T. Fenton T. Rebholz H. Wang M.L. Shepherd P. Matsuka G. Filonenko V. Gout I.T. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis and biochemical studies revealed that CoAsy is a multidomain protein, possessing two enzymatic domains: 4′PP adenylyltransferase in the middle and dephospho-CoA kinase at the C terminus. No significant homology to known protein domains or motifs was reported for the N-terminal region of CoAsy in previous studies. However, further inspection of CoAsy revealed the presence of a hydrophobic segment, extending from residues 7 to 29 (Fig. 1). It is followed by a long peptide segment that is typically hydrophilic. This finding suggested that the N-terminal sequence of CoAsy might be involved in anchoring the enzyme to a membranous component of the cell. CoAsy Is Localized on Mitochondria—To analyze the subcellular localization of CoAsy, we employed immunofluorescent-confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation approaches. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged CoAsy, the fluorescent signal was localized within discrete structures in the cytoplasm, resembling mitochondria (Fig. 2A). To confirm this, Myc-tagged, CoAsy-transfected cells were treated with MitoTracker 15 min before fixation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the green fluorescent signal corresponding to Myc-tagged CoAsy completely overlaps with the orange fluorescence of MitoTracker. The specificity of the antibody signal was tested by probing NIH3T3 cells transfected with empty vector using both anti-Myc and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies. NIH3T3 cells expressing the Myc-tagged CoAsy constructs were also probed with secondary antibody alone. In both cases, the fluorescent signal was at background level (data not shown). Mitochondrial localization of Myc-CoAsy was also confirmed in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (data not shown). A series of CoAsy deletion mutants were constructed to identify the region involved in targeting the enzyme to mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Initially, we generated and tested two truncated mutants: Myc-ΔNCoAsy and Myc-dPCoAK. Transient expression of these constructs in NIH3T3 cells clearly indicated that these deletions yielded proteins that lose mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2B). Based on these data and the prediction analysis, we have created a mutant that lacks 29 amino acids from the N terminus but contains the conserved hydrophobic stretch. When expressed in NIH3T3 cells, this mutant also lacked mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that CoAsy is localized on mitochondria and that this association is mediated by the N-terminal sequence. The Extreme N-terminal Sequences Target CoAsy to Mitochondria—Green fluorescent protein has proven to be a powerful and convenient fluorescent tag for monitoring the expression and subcellular localization of genes of interest, protein domains, or specific motifs. We therefore cloned the N-terminal sequence of CoAsy coding the first 29 amino acids into the pEGFP-N1 mammalian expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis showed that cells transfected with control plasmid pEGFP-N1 exhibited a strong green fluorescent signal throughout the cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, cells with pEGFP-CoAsyN construct showed the green fluorescent product CoAsyN-EGFP to be localized to specific sites in the cytosol, resembling mitochondria (Fig. 3). To confirm that these sites correspond to mitochondria, transfected cells were treated with MitoTracker 15 min before fixation. Converging the two images, gave a yellow fluorescent pattern, suggesting the colocalization of both fluorescent signals on the same cellular organelles, namely mitochondria. Based on this finding, we conclude that the extreme N-terminal sequences of CoAsy, corresponding to amino acids 1–29, are responsible for mitochondrial targeting of CoAsy. CoAsy Cofractionates with Purified Mitochondria—We have also employed the technique of subcellular fractionation to study the localization of CoAsy in MCF-7 cells, which express significant levels of endogenous enzyme (27.Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S. Savinska L. Ovcharenko G. Verdier F. Valovka T. Fenton T. Rebholz H. Wang M.L. Shepherd P. Matsuka G. Filonenko V. Gout I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22107-22110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The light and heavy mitochondrial pellets were obtained from exponentially growing MCF-7 cells and further fractionated in 10–30% OptiPrep gradient. Unloaded fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against CoAsy and VDAC1. The results shown in Fig. 4A indicate the presence of CoAsy in the light mitochondrial fraction and that its fractionation pattern is similar to that of VDAC1, which is a specific marker of the mitochondrial outer membrane (34.Massa R. Marliera L.N. Martorana A. Cicconi S. Pierucci D. Giacomini P. De Pinto V. Castellani L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we analyzed CoAsy and catalase (a marker of peroxisomes) activities in obtained fractions. As shown in Fig. 4B, the dPCoAK activity of CoAsy is present in the same fractions as VDAC1, whereas catalase activity appears in fractions that correspond to peroxisomes according to the OptiPrep application manual (Fig. 4C). A similar pattern of distribution of CoAsy, VDAC1, and catalase was obtained with the use of the heavy mitochondrial fraction (data not shown). These results demonstrate that native CoAsy co-fractionates with mitochondria. CoAsy Localizes to the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane—To determine the submitochondrial topology of CoAsy, purified mitochondria were subjected to limited proteolysis and extraction under alkaline conditions and with 3 m urea. To ascertain whether CoAsy is exposed on the mitochondrial surface and is sensitive to proteolysis, purified mitochondrial fractions were treated with proteinase K. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with CoAsy, VDAC1, and Mn-SOD antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, mitochondria-associated CoAsy is significantly more sensitive to protease treatment than VDAC1, which forms mitochondrial pores and is only partially exposed on the surface. Extraction under neutral conditions indicated that CoAsy, VDAC1, and Mn-SOD (as a matrix marker) remain associated with mitochondria (Fig. 5B). The results of an extraction assay with 3 m urea showed that VDAC1 and Mn-SOD are resistant to this treatment, whereas a small proportion of CoAsy is extracted from mitochondria. When the mitochondrial suspension was treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, the amount of CoAsy associated with mitochondria was significantly reduced, but the amount of VDAC1 or Mn-SOD was not altered. These data suggest that protein-protein interactions may also contribute to the association of CoAsy with the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Taken together, these results indicate that CoAsy is a membrane-associated protein that is anchored to the MOM through its N-terminal region, exposing both enzymatic domains to the cytosol. In addition, protein-protein interactions seem to be involved in stabilizing the association of CoAsy with the membranes. Growth Factors and Metabolic Regulators Do Not Alter Subcellular Localization of CoAsy—A number of cellular proteins have been shown to interact with mitochondria in a regulated manner. Therefore, it was interesting to investigate whether growth factors and activators of cellular metabolism can modulate subcellular localization of CoAsy. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Myc-CoAsy, starved for 24 h in medium without donor calf serum and stimulated with insulin-like growth factor, EGF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or donor calf serum. Subcellular localization of Myc-CoAsy was analyzed by confocal-immunofluorescent microscopy using anti-Myc epitope antibodies. The Myc-CoAsy signal was found exclusively on mitochondria, and its localization did not alter in cellular responses to insulin-like growth factor, EGF, donor calf serum, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (data not shown). Modulation of CoAsy Activity by Phospholipids—The activity of many membrane or membrane-associated proteins is regulated by phospholipids. Studies of the lipid composition of the MOM in mammalian cells showed that phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the main components (35.Ardail D. Privat J.P. Egret-Charlier M. Levrat C. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering this, we initially investigated the effect of these two phospholipids on the PPAT and dPCoAK activities of CoAsy. In this study, we used recombinant CoAsy derived from a baculoviral expression system. The data presented in Fig. 6A reveal that both PPAT and dPCoAK activities of CoAsy are strongly activated by PC- and PE-containing vesicles. We observed 21- and 9-fold activation of dPCoAK activity by 10 mm of PE and PC, respectively. The PPAT activity is enhanced ∼6- and 2-fold by the same concentration of PE and PC, respectively. The outcome of this study was reproduced in four independent experiments. In addition, we tested the effect of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, prepared with 10% PC to increase the stability of the vesicles. Addition of these phospholipids into PC-based vesicles had only a small stimulatory effect on PPAT and dPCoAK activities of CoAsy (data not shown). It is important to note that the activation of CoAsy by phospholipids is concentration dependent. Maximum activation of PPAT activity was observed with 2.5 mm PC/PE, whereas dPCoAK activity did not reach a plateau even with 20 mm PC/PE (Fig. 6B). This finding demonstrates, for the first time, that phospholipids, such as PC and PE, are potent modulators of CoAsy activity in vitro. The CoA biosynthetic pathway was deciphered more than 20 years ago. The enzymes mediating the five universal steps in CoA biosynthesis have been purified from many sources and extensively characterized. However, molecular cloning of corresponding cDNAs has been accomplished only recently. The availability of molecular reagents that have evolved from these studies provided the necessary tools for the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms governing CoA biosynthesis. The focus of this study was on the analysis of subcellular localization and regulation of CoAsy, the enzyme that mediates the last two stages of CoA biosynthesis. The compartmentalization of the CoA biosynthetic machinery has been the subject of many studies. It has been demonstrated that the first three enzymes of the CoA biosynthetic pathway are cytosolic proteins. To date, subcellular localization of CoAsy has not been clearly defined. Both PPAT and dPCoAK activities of CoAsy were reported to be present in the cytosol, mitochondrial outer membrane and mitochondrial matrix (3.Robishaw J.D. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Tahiliani A.G. Neely J.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1987; 19: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26.Skrede S. Halvorsen O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study clearly demonstrate that CoAsy is localized on mitochondria. A panel of deletion mutants was used to demonstrate that the conserved hydrophobic stretch at the N terminus anchors CoAsy to mitochondria. Based on protease sensitivity assay and extraction of CoAsy from purified mitochondria, we propose that the N-terminal conserved hydrophobic stretch, and perhaps protein-protein interactions, anchor the enzyme on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Moreover, we provide evidence that CoAsy is not localized on peroxisomes, which are, together with mitochondria, the main stores of cellular CoA. The biosynthesis of CoA on the MOM may facilitate its transport into mitochondria or the generation of CoA-thioesters. The existence of a specific CoA transporter on the mitochondrial inner membrane has been reported (36.Tahiliani A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18426-18432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the transport of CoA into mitochondria is driven by the membrane potential, which is stimulated by substrates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, such as succinate, malate, and α-ketoglutarate. It is important to note that the pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane are big enough for CoA to translocate freely into the inter membrane space. Several CoA- or CoA thioester-modifying enzymes are associated with the MOM. For example, long chain acyl-CoA synthase uses CoA and long chain fatty acids to generate acyl-CoA (37.Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6581-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Production of acyl-CoA is the first step in a series of events leading to the degradation of fatty acids by β-oxidation. Long chain acyl-CoA synthase was found in complex with VDAC (38.Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Tandler B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39.Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and it is possible that anchoring of CoA synthase to the outer mitochondrial membrane could be facilitated by specific interactions with VDAC or VDAC-associated proteins. Another example of a MOM-associated protein is acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, which catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA (40.Abu-Elheiga L. Brinkley W.R. Zhong L. Chirala S.S. Woldegiorgis G. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Similar to CoA synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 is targeted into the MOM in the NH2in–COOHout orientation via a unique N-terminal hydrophobic region. So far, sequence determinants necessary for targeting of cellular proteins to the MOM have not been clearly defined. It has been proposed that proteins with a moderately hydrophobic stretch and adjacent positively charged amino acids favor targeting to the MOM (24.Kuroda R. Ikenoue T. Honsho M. Tsujimoto S. Mitoma J.Y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41.Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 16: 277-288Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, proteins with highly hydrophobic stretch and without net positive charges within the flanking region are targeted to the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membranes. We are currently testing by site-directed mutagenesis and confocal microscopy whether these criteria apply for CoAsy. The regulation of CoA synthase activity is not well understood. No physiological regulators of CoAsy have been identified so far. We demonstrate in this study that PE and PC, the main components of the MOM, are potent activators of CoAsy in vitro. We propose that binding of 4′PP to the PPAT domain induces a conformational change, which primes CoAsy for activation by membrane phospholipids. The interaction between CoAsy and phospholipids may remove a conformational constraint on both the PPAT and dPCoAK activities. The region of CoAsy involved in lipid activation remains to be identified. Our preliminary data indicate that sequences within the dPCoAK domain mediate phospholipid-induced activation of CoA synthase. 2A. Zhyvoloup, unpublished observations. Overall, these findings indicate that the last two stages of CoA biosynthesis take place on the mitochondrial outer membrane and that the activity of CoA synthase is regulated by phospholipids. We are grateful to Peter Shepherd for useful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

RcsC is a sensor protein, RcsB is its cognate response regulator, and YojN is a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein that is apparently used as an intermediary in the phosphoryl transfer from RcsC to RcsB (7.Takeda S.

The RcsB and RcsA proteins bind to a sequence motif, termed RcsAB box, present in the cps genes of several species (15.Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol.

For example, RcsB activation of the tviA gene requires the TviA protein (11.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and full activation of the osmC and ftsA genes needs an unidentified factor(s) (12.Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P.

The Salmonella ugd gene encodes UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, an enzyme required for the production of both colanic acid (19.Stevenson G. Andrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and 4-aminoarabinose (5.Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Transcription of the ugd gene is induced by three different signals by means of three different two-component regulatory systems (Fig. 1). Low Mg2+ promotes ugd transcription in a process that requires the Mg2+-responsive PhoP/PhoQ system, the PhoP-regulated protein PmrD, and the PmrA/PmrB system (21.Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fe3+ promotes ugd transcription in a process that is dependent on the Fe3+-responsive PmrA/PmrB system but independent of the PhoP/PhoQ system and the PmrD protein (22.Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A tolB mutation induces ugd transcription via the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system and its co-activator RcsA protein but independently of the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB systems (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ugd promoter has putative binding sites for the PmrA, RcsB, and PhoP proteins (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PmrA protein binds to a region of the ugd promoter (23.Aguirre A. Lejona S. Vescovi E.G. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3874-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that harbors a motif found in the promoter of other PmrA-activated genes, such as pbgP and pmrC (24.Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27185-27190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although binding of the RcsB protein to the ugd promoter has not been reported, mutation of the putative RcsB-binding site abolished ugd transcription promoted by the tolB mutation (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of a putative PhoP-binding site in the ugd promoter is intriguing because (i) the low Mg2+ induction of the ugd gene, like that of other PmrA-activated genes, is dependent on the PmrD protein and the PmrA/PmrB system (21.Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and (ii) there is no clear -10 region near the putative PhoP-binding site, which is in contrast to genes that are directly regulated by PhoP, such as phoP, mgtA, and mgrB (25.Minagawa S. Ogasawara H. Kato A. Yamamoto K. Eguchi Y. Oshima T. Mori H. Ishihama A. Utsumi R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report a new condition that activates the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system and establish that the requirement for the RcsA protein in RcsB-mediated transcription of the ugd gene is dependent on the inducing condition, but that cps transcription is RcsA-dependent, regardless of the inducing condition. Our results uncover a potential new function for the PhoP protein in activating gene expression. The participation of several combinations of regulatory systems in the control of ugd expression may be due to the participation of UDP-glucuronic acid (i.e. the product of the reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase) in the biosynthesis of different cellular structures produced under different conditions.

Construction of Chromosomal Deletions and Chromosomal Mutants—A chromosomal deletion mutant of the PhoP-binding site was constructed as described (28.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar), using primers 1744 (5′-GAAGGCATTTTCCATACCGAATGGTTGGAATAATTTCTGCAAAAATGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and 2502 (5′-GCGATAAATCAATAAGAATAGAGATAAAAAAAAGCCCGGTATCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′). The construction of base substitutions at the RcsB site was accomplished through a combination of multiple PCRs based on a described method (28.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). To retain an intact PhoP-binding site and to conserve the distance between the transcription factor-binding sites described in this study, we constructed strain EG13866, in which a chloramphenicol cassette from plasmid pKD3 was placed upstream of the PhoP-binding site using primers 2475 (5′-AAAAAAGCCCGGTATTAAACCGGGCTTAAACATTTTTGCAGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAAG-3′) and 2476 (5′-TGATAAAGAAGGCATTTTCCATACCGAATGGTTGGAATAAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′). To introduce the GAA → CTT substitution at the RcsB-binding site, we first generated two PCR products with strain EG13866 DNA as template: one using primers 1502 (5′-CGGGATCCGTCCCGGATATCGTGATTTTC-3′) and 2100 (5′-CAGATTATCGGTATTAC-3′), and another using primers 1501 (5′-GGAATTCAGATCACCGATGCTTACGC-3′) and 2009 (5′-GTAATCCGATAATCTG-3′). Then, the two PCR products were used as template for a PCR with primers 1501 and 1502. An analogous protocol was used to generate CTG → GGC substitutions using the mutagenic primers 2101 (5′-GAAGATAATGGCAATTG-3′) and 2102 (5′-CAATTGCCATTATCTTC-3′). Plasmids—Plasmids harboring transcriptional fusion to the ugd promoter have been described (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). S1 Nuclease Assay—The S1 nuclease protection assay was performed as described (29.Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), with RNA harvested form mid-exponential phase cultures (A600 of 0.4-0.6) grown in 50 ml of N minimal medium, pH 7.7, containing either 10 μm MgCl2 or 10 μm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm FeSO4. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A PCR product generated with primers 1501 and 1007 (5′-GCAATAAGCAAACCATTAGA-3′) and Salmonella chromosomal DNA as template was used as probe. This probe was labeled at the 5′ end by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) as described (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DNase I Footprinting—DNase I protection assays were carried out using the appropriately labeled primer. DNA fragments used for DNase I footprinting were amplified by the PCR using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosomal DNA as a template. Prior to the PCR, primers 2001 (5′-GACTACTTTGGTGCGCAC-3′) and 1827 (5′-CGGGATCCTCATTACGATAAACACA-3′), which anneal to the coding and non-coding strand of ugd respectively, were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The ugd promoter region was amplified with the labeled primers 2001 and 2021 (5′-CGGGATCCAACTTAATTATGAATCATGA-3′) for the coding strand or with the labeled primers 1827 and 2000 (5′-CGGGATCCGGCATTTTCCATACCG-3′) for the non-coding strand. Approximately 25 pmol of labeled DNA and 0, 10, 12.5, or 50 pmol of PhoP-H6 protein in a 100-μl volume were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The buffer used for protein-DNA incubations was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. DNase I (Invitrogen) (0.05 units) was added and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 25 mm EDTA. DNA fragments were purified with Wizard DNA cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI) and dissolved in 30 μl of H2O. Samples (6 μl) were analyzed by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with the appropriate primer. Fe3+ Promotes ugd Transcription Independently of the PmrA/PmrB System—Transcription of PmrA-activated genes is coordinately induced by Fe3+ in a process that requires the Fe3+ sensor PmrB and the DNA-binding transcriptional regulator PmrA (22.Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although this is true for the PmrA-activated pbgP and pmrC genes, we determined that Fe3+ could still promote ugd transcription in pmrA (Fig. 2A) and pmrB mutants (data not shown). This is in contrast to the induction of PmrA-activated genes that takes place in low Mg2+, where inactivation of the pmrA gene abolished transcription of both the ugd (Fig. 2B) and pbgP (Fig. 2D) genes. As expected, expression of the PhoP-activated PmrA-independent mgtA gene was not affected by Fe3+ or by inactivation of the pmrA gene (Fig. 2, E and F). These data demonstrate that Fe3+ can specifically activate ugd transcription independently of the PmrA/PmrB system. Fe3+ Activates the RcsC/YojN/RcsB System, which Mediates the PmrA-independent Transcription of the ugd Gene—We hypothesized that the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system might be responsible for the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent activation of the ugd gene because, like a tolB mutation (30.Fognini-Lefebvre N. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31.Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Raina S. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4872-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Fe3+ treatment of a pmrA mutant perturbs the outer membrane (32.Chamnongpol S. Dodson W. Cromie M.J. Harris Z.L. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and because a tolB mutation promotes ugd transcription in an RcsC/YojN/RcsB-dependent manner (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, Fe3+ could not promote ugd transcription in rcsB pmrA (Fig. 3A), rcsC pmrA, and yojN pmrA double mutants (data not shown). On the other hand, the rcsB mutant displayed wild-type levels of ugd expression in response to the Fe3+ and low Mg2+ signals (Fig. 3A), which are mediated by the PmrA/PmrB system and the PhoP/PhoQ-PmrD-PmrA/PmrB pathway, respectively (Fig. 1). Fe3+ treatment of the pmrA mutant appears to activate the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system (as opposed to acting solely on the ugd promoter) because it also promoted transcription of the cps operon (Fig. 3B) and repressed expression of the flhDC genes (Fig. 3C). These results establish that Fe3+ treatment of a pmrA mutant activates the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system, which is necessary for the pmrA-independent transcription of the ugd gene. The Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent Activation of the ugd Gene Does Not Require the RcsA Protein—Genes under transcriptional control of the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system can be divided into two classes based on their requirement for the RcsA protein: RcsA-dependent (e.g. cps and rcsA) and RcsA-independent (e.g. osmC, ftsZ and tviA). Although the tolB-promoted transcription of the ugd gene requires RcsA (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent transcription of the ugd gene seems to be RcsA independent because ugd expression was similar in pmrA and pmrA rcsA strains (i.e. only 35% lower in the latter; Fig. 3A). This is in contrast to cps transcription, which was reduced nearly 8-fold by the rcsA mutation. These results indicate that the requirement for the RcsA protein in the RcsB-mediated transcription of the ugd gene is signal dependent. The Regulatory Protein PhoP Is Necessary for the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent Transcription of the ugd Gene—We investigated the possibility that the PhoP protein might be involved in the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent transcription of the ugd gene because (i) these experiments were carried out in low Mg2+, which is the signal that activates the PhoP protein (29.Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and (ii) the ugd promoter harbors a putative PhoP-binding site (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We established that Fe3+ promoted ugd transcription in phoP, pmrA, and rcsB single mutants and in a phoP rcsB double mutant but not in phoP pmrA or rcsB pmrA double mutants (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that bacteria experiencing Fe3+ and low Mg2+ promote ugd transcription via two pathways: the PmrA/PmrB pathway (operating when the RcsB protein is not active) and a pathway requiring both the PhoP/PhoQ and RcsC/YojN/RcsB systems (operating when the PmrA protein is not active; Fig. 1). RcsA-independent and -dependent ugd Transcription Is Mediated by the Same Promoter—To define the ugd promoters used by the various regulatory proteins, we performed S1 mapping experiments using RNA harvested from bacteria grown under different conditions. When grown in low Mg2+, the wild-type strain produced an S1 product that originated from the PmrA-dependent promoter because it was absent from RNA prepared from the pmrA mutant (Fig. 5A). This S1 product was more intense in wild-type cells induced by low Mg2+ and Fe3+ (Fig. 5A) and of the same size as that detected in organisms grown in LB broth (Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Fig. 5B), which is an environment of relatively low Mg2+. On the other hand, a pmrA mutant exposed to Fe3+ produced a smaller S1 product (Fig. 5A), which is of the same size as that induced by the tolB mutation in an RcsB-dependent fashion (Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Fig. 5B). These experiments indicate that two promoters mediate ugd transcription: a distal promoter that is PmrA-dependent but RcsB-independent, and a proximal promoter that is RcsB-dependent but PmrA-independent (Fig. 5C). Moreover, they indicate that both RcsA-dependent and -independent transcription of the ugd gene use the same promoter. Defining the cis-Acting Sequences Required for the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent Transcription of the ugd Gene—Using plasmid-borne lac fusions to the ugd promoter, we have recently established that the 283-bp region upstream of the ugd start codon (Fig. 5C) has all the necessary cis-acting sequences necessary for ugd transcription promoted by the tolB mutation (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This region includes a PmrA-binding site (21.Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the putative RcsB-binding site, as well as a bona fide PhoP-binding site, because the PhoP protein footprinted the region -223 to -198 from the ugd start codon (Fig. 5D). We have now determined that this region harbors the sequence information required for the low Mg2+ PmrA-dependent, as well as for the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-dependent and -independent transcription of the ugd gene (Fig. 6). Indeed deletion of the 79-bp sequence including the PhoP-binding site abolished the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent transcription of the ugd gene (Fig. 6). To rule out the possibility of potential phenotypes resulting from the lac fusion being in a multicopy number plasmid, we constructed strains harboring a lac fusion to the chromosomal copy of the ugd gene and mutations in the RcsB- and PhoP-binding sites. Deletion of the PhoP-binding site abolished ugd expression promoted by low Mg2+ and Fe3+ in a pmrA mutant (Fig. 7), but had no effect on ugd transcription promoted by Fe3+ or by the tolB mutation in a pmrA+ strain (Fig. 7). Mutation of the conserved GAA and CTG sequences in the RcsB-binding site abolished the Fe3+-promoted activation that takes place in the pmrA mutant (Fig. 6B) but had no effect on the low Mg2+ and Fe3+ activation that is mediated by the PmrA protein (Fig. 7). Cumulatively, these results are in agreement with the data resulting from inactivation of the regulatory genes: (i) mutation of the phoP gene or the PhoP-binding site in the ugd promoter abolished the Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent activation of ugd but had no effect on the Fe3+-promoted activation mediated by the PmrA protein or the RcsB-mediated activation promoted by a tolB mutation; and (ii) mutation of the rcsB gene or the RcsB site in the ugd promoter abolished both the tolB- and Fe3+-promoted PmrA-independent activation of ugd transcription. We have identified a new condition that activates the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system, established that the requirement for the RcsA protein in RcsB-promoted transcription depends on the particular promoter and inducing condition, and uncovered a novel interaction between two-component system proteins. We have demonstrated that the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system is activated in a pmrA mutant experiencing Fe3+ and low Mg2+, resulting in transcriptional activation of the ugd (Fig. 3A) and cps genes (Fig. 3B) and transcriptional repression of the flhDC operon (Fig. 3C). What this condition has in common with previously reported activating conditions of the Rcs system, such as those resulting from inactivation of the tolB gene (30.Fognini-Lefebvre N. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31.Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Raina S. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4872-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the overproduction of the DnaJ-like protein DjlA (33.Chen M.H. Takeda S. Yamada H. Ishii Y. Yamashino T. Mizuno T. Biosci.

Hoover T.A. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is the perturbation of the outer membrane. Indeed, Fe3+ disrupts the outer membrane of pmrA Salmonella, rendering it susceptible to killing by vancomycin and lysis by deoxycholate (32.Chamnongpol S. Dodson W. Cromie M.J. Harris Z.L. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have established that the two conditions that induce RcsB-dependent transcription of the ugd gene (i.e. a tolB mutation or Fe3+ and low Mg2+ in a pmrA mutant) use the same transcription start site (Fig. 5, A and B; Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and require the same putative RcsB-binding site at the ugd promoter (Fig. 7; Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is despite the fact that these activation conditions differ in their requirement for the response regulator protein PhoP and the co-activator protein RcsA (Fig. 4; Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PhoP protein had been implicated previously in the transcriptional induction of the ugd gene in response to low Mg2+ because of its role as transcriptional activator of the PmrD protein, which is a posttranscriptional activator of the PmrA/PmrB system (Ref. 21.Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). However, the PhoP protein plays a different role in ugd transcription in a pmrA mutant experiencing Fe3+ and low Mg2+ because (i), this activation requires the PhoP-binding site at the ugd promoter (Figs. 6 and 7), (ii) it is dependent upon the RcsB protein (Fig. 3A), (iii) it is independent of the PmrA protein (Fig. 3A), and (iv) different transcription start sites are used in the two activation conditions (Fig. 5, A and B). The PhoP protein may promote RcsB-dependent transcription of the ugd gene by interacting with the RcsB protein and/or by altering the ugd promoter in a fashion that facilitates RcsB binding. Our results reinforce the idea that the RcsB protein uses different partners to promote transcription. RcsB-regulated genes have been divided into those that are RcsA-dependent, such as cps and rcsA (1.Gottesman S. Trisler P. Torres-Cabassa A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and those that are RcsA-independent, such as ftsZ (12.Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38.Costa C.S. Anton D.N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 201-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tviA (11.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and osmC (14.Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Placement of the Salmonella ugd gene into one of these groups is problematic because ugd transcription is RcsA-dependent when the inducing condition is a tolB mutation (20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but RcsA-independent when the inducing condition is Fe3+ and low Mg2+ in a pmrA mutant (Fig. 3A). This is most surprising given the fact that transcription of the Salmonella cps genes is RcsA-dependent under both inducing conditions (Fig. 3B; Ref. 20.Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol.

We suggest that the RcsB protein utilizes different co-regulatory proteins depending both on the inducing condition, which may control the levels of co-regulatory proteins, and the promoter in question, which may have binding sites for co-regulatory proteins. This is supported by the requirement for additional factors in the transcriptional activation of the RcsB-regulated RcsA-independent tviA (11.Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), osmC, and ftsA (12.Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol.

Furthermore, it may explain the incongruent results reported for the RcsA-dependence of the RcsB-mediated repression of the master flagellar regulator flhDC locus. Repression of flhDC transcription resulting from overexpression of the RcsB protein in LB broth (39.Francez-Charlot A. Laugel B. Van Gemert A. Dubarry N. Wiorowski F. Castanie-Cornet M.P.

Dominguez-Bernal G. Tierrez A. Garcia-Del Portillo F. Casadesus J. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar), was independent of RcsA. Yet, overexpression of the RcsA protein repressed flhDC transcription in an RcsB-dependent manner (39.Francez-Charlot A. Laugel B. Van Gemert A. Dubarry N. Wiorowski F. Castanie-Cornet M.P. Gutierrez C. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, RcsB derivatives that are predicted to mimic the phosphorylated state of the protein could bind to the osmC and flhDC promoters in the absence of the RcsA protein (17.Sturny R. Cam K. Gutierrez C. Conter A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4298-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39.Francez-Charlot A. Laugel B. Van Gemert A. Dubarry N. Wiorowski F. Castanie-Cornet M.P. Gutierrez C. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), suggesting that a highly activated RcsB may promote transcription in the absence of co-regulators. A pattern that seems to be emerging about RcsB-regulated genes is that all RcsA-dependent genes are involved in the production of capsule, whereas those that are RcsA-independent participate in a variety of different cellular functions. Thus, the dual status of the ugd gene is likely caused by its participation in both capsule and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. We thank F. Solomon for technical assistance."

On the other hand, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), abundantly stored in bone matrix, stimulates bone formation with a local injection in rodents. Although our previous study suggested that Smad3 is an important molecule for the stimulation of bone formation, no reports have been available about the effects of PTH on Smad3. In this present study, we examined the effects of PTH on Smad3 and the physiological significance in mouse osteoblastic cells. PTH promoted the expression of Smad3 mRNA within 10 min and the protein level in a dose-dependent manner in MC3T3-E1 and rat osteoblastic UMR-106 cells. Protein kinase A (PKA) activator as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activators increased Smad3 protein level, and both PKA and PKC inhibitors antagonized PTH-induced Smad3, indicating that PTH promotes the production of Smad3 through both PKA and PKC pathways. Next, we examined anti-apoptotic effects of PTH and Smad3 in these cells, employing trypan blue, transferase-mediated nick end labeling, and Hoechst staining. Pretreatment with PTH or overexpression of Smad3 decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by dexamethasone and etoposide. Moreover, a dominant negative mutant, Smad3ΔC, abrogated PTH-induced anti-apoptotic effects. On the other hand, PTH augmented TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PTH enhanced TGF-β-induced production of type I collagen, whereas it did not affect TGF-β-reduced proliferation in MC3T3-E1 cells. These observations indicated that PTH amplified the anabolic effects of TGF-β by accelerating the transcriptional activity of Smad3. In conclusion, we first demonstrated that PTH-Smad3 axis exerts anti-apoptotic effects in osteoblasts and reinforces the anabolic action by TGF-β in osteoblasts. Hence, PTH-Smad3 axis might be involved in the bone anabolic action of PTH.

Hence, PTH-Smad3 axis might be involved in the bone anabolic action of PTH. The bone is a highly specialized and dynamic organ with continuous regeneration, called remodeling. Bone remodeling consists of two different events, resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts. For an increase in bone mineral density, a positive balance, in which the formation is prior to the resorption, should be gained. The ability to gain the positive balance may be a therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. Although several agents are capable of decreasing bone resorption and halting further bone loss in osteopenic states, the ideal drug would be an anabolic agent that increases bone mass by stimulating bone formation.

On the other hand, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is most abundant in bone matrix, compared with other tissues (9Jennings J.C. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TGF-β is stored in an inactive form, released from the bone matrix, and activated in the bone microenvironment (10Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced by osteoblasts and appears to regulate bone metabolism in various ways, including skeletal development and bone remodeling (11Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13361-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TGF-β modulates the proliferation, differentiation, and production of bone matrix proteins of osteoblasts (10Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TGF-β regulates the transcriptional response of the target genes through the two receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 (16Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 induces their association with the common partner Smad4, followed by translocation into the nucleus where these complexes activate transcription of specific genes (16Massague J.

We recently reported that Smad3 promotes the production of type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (18Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T.

Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mice with the target disruption of Smad3 exhibited the osteopenia caused by the decreased bone formation (20Borton A.J. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we have proposed that Smad3 is a molecule of promoting bone formation. Although several studies indicated that PTH increases TGF-β expression and secretion in osteoblasts (21Pfeilschifter J. Laukhuf F. Muller-Beckmann B. Blum W.F. Pfister T. Ziegler R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Wu Y. Kumar R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there have been no papers that reported the effects of PTH on Smad3 in osteoblasts. Hence, in our present study, we examined the effects of PTH on the expression and the transcriptional activity of Smad3, and also its physiological significance in osteoblasts. Materials—MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells were kindly provided by Dr. H. Kodama (Ohu Dental College, Ohu, Japan) and Dr. T. J. Martin (St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia), respectively. Human recombinant TGF-β, human PTH-(1-34), cycloheximide, actinomycin D, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, forskolin, N6,O2′-dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMPS), PTH-(3-34) amino peptide, staurosporine, H7, and H89 were purchased from Sigma, and Sp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphorothioate ((Sp)-cAMPS) from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). Anti-Smad3, Smad2, Smad4, and anti-phosphorylated Smad3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells were cultured in α-MEM (containing 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid) and DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), respectively. The medium was changed twice a week. Construct and Transient Transfection—Myc-tagged Smad2 and Smad3 and flag-tagged Smad4 were prepared, as previously described (23Lebrun J.-J. Takabe K. Chen Y. Vale W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Smad3 DNA was derived from rat. A mutant form of Myc-tagged Smad3 (Smad3ΔC), in which the MH2 domain corresponding to amino acid residues 278-425 was removed, was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Chen. Myc-Smad3, Myc-Smad3ΔC, and empty vector (pcDNA3.1+) (each 3 μg) were transfected to MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Six h later, the cells were fed with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. Forty-eight h later, the transfected cells were used for the experiments. To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, we characterized at least three independent clones for each transfection. Empty vector-transfected cells were used as the control. Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/6-well plate. Twenty-four h later, cells were transfected with 3 μg of the reporter plasmid (p3TP-Lux) and the pCH110 plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (1 μg), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Fifteen h later, the medium was changed to a fresh one containing 4% FBS, and the cells were incubated for an additional 9 h. Thereafter, cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5.0 ng/ml TGF-β in medium containing 0.2% FBS. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the relative β-galactosidase activity as described (18Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36024-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Western Analysis—Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm PMSF, complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Protein quantitation was performed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Twenty μg of proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Proteins were transferred in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 137 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% dried milk powder. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibodies (Sigma), and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, plus a protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was clarified and incubated with anti-flag antibody (Sigma) on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis employing anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—Cultures were trypsinized, and the cells were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation (24Abrams H. Rohrschneider L. Eisenman R. Cell. 1982; 29: 427-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were gently resuspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5% aprotinin, and 0.5% leupeptin; allowed to swell for 10 min; processed by 20 strokes in a Dounce tissue homogenizer; and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. After decanting the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% aprotinin, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and briefly sonicated. Nuclear pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT; and again processed in a Dounce homogenizer. After a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, supernatants were dialyzed for 5 h against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT. Protein quantitation was performed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Western blot analysis was performed as described above. RNA Extraction and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the acid guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method. Twenty μg of total RNA was denatured, run on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and fixed with ultraviolet light (Funa-UV-Linker, Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was hybridized to a DNA probe labeled with 32P (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 42 °C. The hybridization probe was the 2.8-kb fragment of the α1 gene of type I procollagen (a gift from Dr. T. Kimura, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). After hybridization, the filter was washed twice with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC) containing 0.5% SDS and subsequently washed twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 58 °C for 1 h. The filter was exposed to x-ray film, using intensifying screen at -80 °C. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with human β-actin cDNA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Reverse transcription of 5 μg of cultured cell total RNA was carried out for 50 min at 42 °C and then 15 min at 70 °C, using Super Script™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), which contained RT buffer, oligo(dT)12-18, 5× First-Strand Solution, 10 mm dNTP, 0.1 m DTT, SuperScript II (RT-enzyme), and RNase H (RNase inhibitor). PCR using primers to unique sequences in each cDNA was carried out in a volume of 10 μl of reaction mixture for PCR (as supplied by TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), supplemented with 2.5 units of TaKaRa Taq™, 1.5 mm amount of each dNTP (TaKaRa), and 10× PCR buffer, which contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. Twenty-five ng of each primer and 1 μl of template (from a 50-μl RT reaction) were used. Thermal cycling conditions and primer sequences are described below: 1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min; 2) cycling for cDNA-specific number of cycles; 96 °C for 1 min, cDNA-specific annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer sequences, annealing temperature, and cycle numbers were as follows. Smad3 sequences were 5′-GAGTAGAGACGCCAGTTCTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTGGAGAACCTGCGTCCAT-3′ (62 °C; 25 cycles) (25Yanagisawa K. Osada H. Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Takagi K. Takahashi T. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sequences were 5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ (58 °C; 22 cycles). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range, as assessed by densitometry (NIH Image J, version 1.08i, public domain program). An equal volume from each PCR was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were evaluated. Marker gene expression was normalized to GAPDH expression in each sample. Determination of Osteoblast Apoptosis—Trypan blue staining (Invitrogen; 0.1% final concentration) was used for routine quantification of apoptosis (26Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In brief, a drop of the cell suspension was mixed with a drop of the trypan blue solution. The ratio of each volume was 1:1. The total numbers of viable and nonviable cells were calculated under the light microscopy (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Apoptosis cleaves cellular DNA into histone-associated fragments. As the more specific staining to detect apoptosis, transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and Hoechst staining were employed. In brief, cells were cultured on round cover glasses (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) set in 6-well plates and the glasses attached by cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS two times, followed by fixation with 4% neutral formaldehyde. Then, these fixed cell layers on the glasses were stained. TUNEL reaction was performed using an Apoptosis in Situ Detection kit (Wako), following the standard protocol, as described (28Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). Hoechst staining was performed to view the pyknotic fragmented nuclei typical of apoptotic cells, using Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). In each experiment, the percentages of numbers of apoptotic cells per total ones in randomly selected fields were calculated using hemocytometer. Each experiment was performed at least three times. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. These cells were maintained in α-MEM with 10% FBS. After 48 h of culture, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h. The incubation was terminated by removal of the medium, washed with PBS twice, and followed by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice in 10 min. After removal of the trichloroacetic acid, the residue was dissolved in 20 mm NaOH at 37 °C, and scintillation mixture was added. Each sample was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Statistics—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test or analysis of variance. PTH Stimulated the Expression of Smad3 mRNA and Protein—First, we examined the effects of PTH on the expressions of Smad3 mRNA and protein. In MC3T3-E1 cells, PTH-(1-34) stimulated the expression of Smad3 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). PTH-(1-34) also stimulated the expression of Smad3 protein in both MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, we performed the time-course experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, PTH-(1-34) promoted the expression of Smad3 mRNA within 10 min in MC3T3-E1 cells. The expression of Smad3 protein was enhanced by PTH-(1-34) within 1 h in MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). These effects of PTH-(1-34) were sustained at least for 24 h. Moreover, PTH-(1-34) increased the level of phosphorylated Smad3 within 6 h (Fig. 2D). Because the up-regulation of Smad3 by PTH-(1-34) was initiated in early times, PTH might stimulate the expression of Smad3 without protein synthesis de novo. We therefore employed cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor. Although 10 μm cycloheximide did not affect PTH-induced expression of Smad3 mRNA, PTH-induced Smad3 protein was reduced with 10 μm actinomycin D (Fig. 3). These findings suggested that PTH promoted the expression of Smad3 at the transcriptional level independently of protein synthesis de novo in osteoblasts.Fig. 2PTH stimulates the expression of Smad3 in the early times.A, after confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in serum-free α-MEM for 12 h, cells were treated with 10-8m PTH-(1-34) for the indicated time.

The PTH signals are known to be transduced through PKA and PKC pathways (1Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PTH would up-regulate the Smad3 expression through PKA and/or PKC pathway(s). As shown in Fig. 4, activators for PKA pathways, db-cAMP and (Sp)-cAMPS as well as forskolin, and an activator for PKC pathway, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, promoted the expression of Smad3 mRNA and protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4, A and B) and UMR-106 cells (Fig. 4C). In addition, a specific inhibitor of PKA pathway, H89, as well as the inhibitors of PKC pathways, staurosporine and H7, antagonized PTH-induced expression of Smad3 mRNA and protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5, A and B) and UMR-106 cells (Fig. 5C). These findings indicated that PTH stimulates the expression of Smad3 mRNA and protein through both PKA and PKC pathways in osteoblasts.Fig. 5Both PKA and PKC inhibitors antagonize PTH-induced expression of Smad3.A, after confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in serum-free α-MEM for 12 h, cells were pretreated with a PKA inhibitor (10-8m H89) or PKC inhibitors (10 nm staurosporine or 50 μm H7) for 6 h and treated with 10-8m PTH-(1-34) for 1 h.

Recent study revealed that mice with the targeted disruption of Smad3 exhibited osteopenia caused by decreased bone formation, including the promoted apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes (20Borton A.J.

These evidence suggested that Smad3, as well as PTH, possesses anti-apoptotic effects in osteoblasts. We therefore examined the effects of PTH and Smad3 on dexamethasone- or etoposide-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106 cells. We employed trypan blue staining, TUNEL staining, and Hoechst staining methods to detect the apoptotic cells. The trypan blue stain method is generally used to distinguish the viable cells from nonviable ones. As shown in Fig. 6, dexamethasone and etoposide induced the number of nonviable cells in MC3T3-E1 (A and B) and UMR-106 cells (C and D). Treatment with PTH-(1-34) as well as Smad3 overexpression antagonized dexamethasone- and etoposide-induced cell death. The truncated Smad3 mutant, Smad3ΔC, lacks its MH2 region in C terminus and possesses dominant negative effects on endogenous Smad3 activity, as previously described (18Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T.

We studied the reaction of reduced endothelial NOS oxygenase domain with O2 in the presence of 4-amino-BH4 at –30 °C by optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. With Arg as the substrate, we observed a trihydropteridine radical with a corresponding heme species that was oxyferrous, with a Soret maximum at 428 nm and no EPR signal. With NG-hydroxy-l-arginine (NHA) no pterin radical appeared, whereas an axial ferrous heme·NO complex was formed. The corresponding optical spectra, with Soret bands at 417/423 nm, suggest that the proximal sulfur ligand is protonated. Accordingly, 4-amino-BH4 serves as a one-electron donor to Fe(II)·O2 with both Arg and NHA, but the reaction cycle cannot be completed with either substrate. We propose that protonation ofFe(II)O2- is inhibited in the presence of 4-amino-BH4. With Arg, dissociation ofO2- and binding of O2 yields Fe(II)·O2 and a pteridine radical; with NHA, reaction of the substrate with heme-boundO2- eventually yields Fe(II)·NO and reduced 4-amino-BH4. These results suggest that BH4 donates a proton toFe(II)·O2- during catalysis and that inhibition by 4-amino-BH4 may be due to its inability to support this essential protonation step.

Both reactions consume one equivalent of O2 as well as electrons in stoichiometries of 2 and 1 equivalent for the first and second cycle, respectively. Oxygen binding and NO synthesis take place at a P450-type heme in the oxygenase domain; the electrons are provided by NADPH via two flavin moieties in the reductase domain. The molecular mechanism of neither cycle is fully known yet but it is generally believed that hydroxylation of Arg follows a similar pathway as proposed for mono-oxygenation by cytochrome P450.

Low Temperature Optical Spectroscopy—Low temperature UV-visible absorption spectra of the reaction between reduced eNOSoxy and O2 were measured in a Cary 3E (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) spectrophotometer, adapted for low temperature studies, according to previously published procedures (6.Bec N.

Mayer B. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples in 50% ethylene glycol, 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) were made anaerobic by gassing with argon for 30 min at 0 °C. Just enough anaerobic dithionite solution was added to the samples at room temperature to shift the Soret band from 396 nm to 412 nm, indicating the reduction of ferric heme to the ferrous state. Samples were cooled to –30 °C, and the reaction was initiated by blowing 250 μl of pure O2 through the 200-μl solution. The samples were allowed to react for 20 s before flash-freezing in –130 °C n-pentane. EPR spectra were recorded at 9.65 GHz on a Bruker ESP300E EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments cryostat 900 (0.5- or 2-milliwatt microwave power, 100-kHz modulation frequency, 1-, 3-, and 10-G modulation amplitude, and temperatures between 4 and 100 K). Radicals and low spin heme signals were quantified by double integration and comparison with 0.5 mm Cu(II) under nonsaturating conditions as a standard. High spin ferric heme was quantified by comparison with 100% ferric high spin NOS and with high spin/low spin NOS mixtures of known composition. EPR simulations were performed using the SimFonia program provided by Bruker. Hyperfine coupling constants were varied along with line widths in x, y, and z direction until optimal fitting was achieved. A Lorentzian/Gaussian line shape ratio of 1.0 was always used. P1/2 values of the microwave power saturation were determined over a range of 0.3 microwatt to 200 milliwatts and least-squares fitted to I = 1/(1 + P/P1/2)b/2, in which I is the EPR intensity, P is the microwave power, and P1/2 and b are fitting parameters formally representing the microwave power at half-saturation and the inhomogeneity factor. NOS Activity Determinations—NADPH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm and 37 °C in a total volume of 250 μl with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer (24.Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NO synthesis was quantified as nitrite/nitrate formation by the Griess assay according to published procedures (25.Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Hansert B. Bohle D.S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3465-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) in 96-well microplates with an Anthos HT3 microplate reader (Fresenius Kabi, Linz, Austria). Calibration curves were constructed with NaNO2. The effect of 4-amino-BH4 on the integrity of the heme in single-turnover was investigated by measuring the Soret absorbance of the ferrous·CO complex (24.Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Typically, samples of 1-ml total volume, containing 3 μm eNOSoxy, 2 mm Arg, 0.2 mm CHAPS, 2.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 50 μm BH4 or 4-amino-BH4, were prepared in quartz cuvettes equipped with screw-on rubber septa (Hellma type 117.104-QS, Müllheim/Baden, Germany). Samples were made anaerobic by flushing with argon for 5 min. Subsequently, samples were reduced by titration with sodium dithionite, added with a Hamilton syringe from 50 mm stock solutions that were prepared in 50 mm de-aerated potassium Pi (pH 7.4). After complete reduction, single-turnover was induced by flushing with pure O2 for 1 min. The progress of reduction and oxidation was monitored by absorption spectroscopy. After complete oxidation, samples were flushed with CO for 1 min and reduced with excess dithionite. Absorption spectra were recorded after each step in the procedure. Effect of 4-Amino-BH4 on NO Synthesis—Previous studies have shown that 4-amino-BH4 is a strong BH4-competitive, reversible inhibitor of NO synthesis, measured as conversion of radiolabeled arginine and NHA to citrulline (16.Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Wachter H. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17.Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C.F. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P.

J. 1997; 328: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To elucidate how 4-amino-BH4 affects the second step of NOS catalysis, we compared the formation of nitrite/nitrate from NHA by NOS in the presence and absence of BH4 and 4-amino-BH4 (Fig. 1). In the presence of BH4, 10-min incubation of hnNOS with NHA in complete assay reaction mixture yielded 42.2 ± 1.8 μm nitrite (n = 5). Nitrate was barely detectable (≤3 μm). In the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), nitrite formation decreased by about 50% (18.2 ± 0.5 μm). Partial inhibition of NOS activity in the presence of SOD/CAT has been observed before and is apparently due to unmasking of NO-induced autoinhibition by scavenging ofO2- (26.Mayer B.

Koesling D. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As expected, nitrite formation decreased in the absence of BH4, but the remaining yield (22.4 ± 5.7 μm) was still remarkably high. The oxidation of NHA in the presence of BH4-free NOS has been reported before and was proposed to involve the NOS heme directly (28.Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29.Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, to be mediated by NOS-derivedO2- (30.Moali C. Boucher J.-L. Renodon-Corniere A. Stuehr D.J. Mansuy D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In agreement with the latter hypothesis, we found that the activity in the absence of pterin was almost completely abolished by SOD/CAT (3.1 ± 0.9 μm). With Arg instead of NHA the yield of nitrite was 16.1 ± 2.6 μm in the presence of BH4; hardly any nitrite formation (2.1 ± 0.5 μm) occurred in the absence of pterin (not shown). With 4-amino-BH4 results were very similar to those obtained in the absence of pterin. With NHA as the substrate, the yield was 17.6 ± 5.0 μm and SOD/CAT almost completely inhibited nitrite formation (1.3 ± 0.8 μm remaining). With Arg as the substrate, nitrite formation was hardly detectable (1.6 ± 0.4 μm, not shown). These results show that 4-amino-BH4 does not support SOD/CAT-resistant (i.e. genuinely enzymatic) NO synthesis from either substrate, whereas it allows uncoupledO2- production, resulting in indirect SOD/CAT-sensitive formation of nitrite from NHA. Integrity of the Heme-thiolate Bond in the Presence of 4-Amino-BH4 —To establish whether catalysis in the presence of 4-amino-BH4 affects the heme coordination structure, we determined if single-turnover has any effect on the formation of the characteristic absorption band at 450 nm in the presence of CO under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). In all cases, addition of dithionite to anaerobic eNOSoxy caused a shift of the Soret band from 395 nm (high spin ferric heme) to 414 nm (ferrous heme). Upon addition of O2 to fully reduced eNOSoxy, the Soret maximum was shifted back to 395 nm, indicating complete reoxidation. Addition of CO to the reoxidized compound, with both BH4 and 4-amino-BH4, resulted in a Soret band at 450 nm with little or no evidence of P420 formation (Fig. 2, A and B). An absorbance maximum at 450 nm was also formed in the absence of pterin, but it was unstable and slowly converted to a 420-nm species (Fig. 2C), in line with earlier reports (31.Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results indicate that, like BH4, 4-amino-BH4 stabilizes the coordination structure of the heme. Effect of 4-Amino-BH4 on NADPH Oxidation—To study the effects of 4-amino-BH4 on uncoupled O2 reduction, we compared NADPH oxidation by hnNOS in the presence and absence of BH4 and 4-amino-BH4 and of Arg and NHA (Fig. 3). In the absence of substrate, both BH4 and 4-amino-BH4 moderately increased NADPH oxidation. Whereas Arg alone did not significantly affect NADPH oxidation, it counteracted the activity increase caused by BH4, probably due to NO-induced autoinhibition. Surprisingly, even stronger inhibition of NADPH oxidation occurred in the combined presence of Arg and 4-amino-BH4, even though NO is not formed under these conditions. The presence of Arg decreased the activity observed with 4-amino-BH4 by 78 ± 14%, which suggests that inhibition of NADPH oxidation involves catalytic turnover, thus providing the first indication of a mechanism-based component of NOS inhibition by 4-amino-BH4. In the presence of NHA, NADPH oxidation was decreased, probably because the higher NO/NADPH ratio for this substrate (2 as compared with 2/3 for Arg) results in stronger NO-induced autoinhibition. Consequently, a similar decrease of NADPH oxidation by 4-amino-BH4 as obtained with Arg is not to be expected (inhibition of NADPH oxidation by 4-amino-BH4 would decrease the rate of NO synthesis and hence partially relieve NO-induced inhibition). Nevertheless, with NHA as well, NADPH oxidation became slower by 46 ± 13% in the presence of 4-amino-BH4. EPR Spectroscopy: The Reaction with Arg—Previous studies have demonstrated the formation of a relatively stable BH3 radical intermediate in single-turnover of reduced NOS with O2 and Arg (8.Hurshman A.R.

Similar radical intermediates are formed with other tetrahydropteridines that support NO synthesis (10.Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C.F. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32.Wei C.-C. Wang Z.-Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We surmised that, despite the fact that 4-amino-BH4 is an inhibitor of NO synthesis, it might nevertheless yield a one-electron oxidized radical, because its electrochemical properties resemble those of BH4 (15.Gorren A.C.F. Kungl A.J. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that the 4-amino-BH3 radical was indeed formed in single-turnover of reduced eNOSoxy with O2 and Arg. For the turnover sample, the radical amounted to 30% of the heme concentration, which corresponds to ∼60% of the pterin (approximately half of the pterin binding sites remain unoccupied in 50% ethylene glycol (13.Gorren A.C.F. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11763-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). This yield is comparable to that of BH3· under similar conditions (Refs. 9.Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 10.Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C.F. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, and this study). The ferric high spin signal was 45% of total heme, and no other species were observed, indicating that about half of the heme was EPR-silent. When the samples were incubated at –30 °C for 1 h before being frozen, the radical had almost completely (>95%) disappeared, whereas ferric heme increased to approximately 90% (not shown). The main difference with the BH3 radical at 10 K was that the EPR spectrum of 4-amino-BH3 exhibited more resolved hyperfine splitting, which might suggest line broadening of the BH3 radical signal (Fig. 4B). Line broadening might be caused by dipolar coupling between the pterin radical and high spin ferric heme, which is to be expected in view of the proximity of the two paramagnets. Such broadening should disappear at higher temperature because of fast relaxation of the heme. Indeed, at 100 K the BH3 radical signal was sharper, with hyperfine splitting similar to that of 4-amino BH3 at 10 K (Fig. 4C). This confirms that at 10 K the BH3 radical signal is broadened by dipolar coupling with the heme and that similar broadening does not occur for the 4-amino-BH3 radical. Strong interaction between the spins of the pterin and the adjacent heme can also be deduced from the microwave power saturation behavior, with all pterin radicals reported thus far exhibiting remarkably high P1/2 values (8.Hurshman A.R.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We derived fitting parameters of 1.0 milliwatts for P1/2 and 0.77 for b, suggesting strong dipolar coupling between BH3 and high spin ferric heme (33.Galli C. Innes J.B. Hirsh D.J. Brudvig G.W. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 110: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 4-amino-BH3 radical showed signs of partial saturation already at 10 microwatts (Fig. 5), with fitting parameters of 65 microwatts and 0.42 for P1/2 and b, respectively. The low value of P1/2 indicates that the majority of the radical is magnetically isolated, resulting in slow relaxation. However, the extremely low b value is suggestive of heterogeneity, with a minor part experiencing dipolar coupling with the heme (33.Galli C. Innes J.B. Hirsh D.J. Brudvig G.W. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 110: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated previously that successful simulation of the BH3 radical EPR spectrum requires the assumption that the unpaired electron resides mainly at N5, and that N5 is protonated (10.Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C.F. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the BH3 spectrum observed in the present study at 100 K was satisfactorily fitted (Fig. 4C) with hyperfine interactions from N5, N5-Hα, and C6-Hβ, in line with a recent study (12.Du M. Yeh H.-C. Berka V. Wang L.-H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most of the features of the spectrum of 4-amino-BH3 observed at 10 K could be reproduced with similar fitting parameters, in line with the conclusion that most of the 4-amino-BH3 radical is magnetically isolated (Fig. 4A). However, a truly adequate fit required the introduction of a minor fraction with a much broader signal, in accordance with the microwave power saturation curve. It should be noted that the fitting parameters of the broad signal do not represent true hyperfine constants, because they are affected by coupling with the heme. Furthermore, the corr"

Recently, mutations that abrogated transcriptional activation of C/EBPα were detected in acute myeloid leukemia patient samples. Moreover, the progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to blast crisis in patients was correlated with down-modulation of C/EBPα.

Restoration of C/EBPα expression in KCL22 cells triggered a profound proliferative arrest, a block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and a gradual increase in apoptosis.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder caused by the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. In the chronic phase of the disease, the leukemic cells retain the ability to differentiate into mature granulocytes; however, after a period of 3–5 years, transformation to the acute fatal stage invariably occurs characterized by aggressive proliferation of immature cells and block in differentiation. The molecular events underlying the transition from the chronic phase to the blast crisis are still poorly understood (7Ahuja H. Bar-Eli M. Arlin Z. Advani S.H. Allen S.L. Goldman J. Snyder D.

The BCR-ABL-positive KCL22 cell line is composed of myelomonocytic blast cells established from an individual with blast transformation of CML. In contrast to normal myeloid progenitor cells, we found that KCL22 cells have no detectable expression of C/EBPα protein. To study the possible role of C/EBPα in blastic transformation of CML, we stably transfected KCL22 cells with C/EBPα under the control of a zinc-inducible promoter. Brief ectopic expression of C/EBPα triggered these BCR-ABL-positive cells to undergo growth arrest, develop neutrophilic morphologic changes, up-regulate levels of G-CSF receptor, and express primary, secondary, and tertiary granule genes. In addition, we used high density oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify novel C/EBPα target genes and to gain further insight into the process of leukemogenesis. Chemicals—All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in 95% ethanol to a stock concentration of 10–2 mol/liter and stored at –70 °C. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) was purchased from Sigma. Plasmids and Transfections—The zinc-inducible C/EBPα expression vector (pMTα) was constructed by inserting a full-length human C/EBPα cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. D. G. Tenen, Harvard Institute of Medicine, Boston, MA) at the HindIII and KpnI sites of MTCB6+ (pMT) (a kind gift from F. J. Rauscher III, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). The KCL22 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were transfected with either pMTα (KCL22-pMTα) or pMT (KCL22-pMT, as a control). Both plasmids carry neomycin resistance gene as a selection marker. Using an Electro Square Porator T820 electroporation apparatus (BTX, San Diego, CA), a total of 2.5 × 107 KCL22 cells were electroporated with 30 μg of linearized plasmids at 310 V for 35 ms. Selection with G418 at 1 mg/ml was started 48 h after electroporation to obtain stably transfected cells. Multiple polyclonal and monoclonal cultures were screened for zinc-inducible C/EBPα expression by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysate (30 μg) was electrophoresed on 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal C/EBPα,-β, or-γ antibodies (0.2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or C/EBPϵ (13Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakowa E.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibody (0.9 μg/ml) followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was performed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells were cultured in medium supplemented with ZnSO4 (100 μm) for up to 14 days, and total RNA was harvested at different time points. Three micrograms of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (1 unit, Promega, Madison, WI) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 25–35 cycles, 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. RT-PCR for 18 S was utilized as an internal control to ensure equal loading of samples. Sequences of the primers will be provided upon request. Reaction products were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, and images of PCR products were captured using AlphaImager 2000 Gel Documentation software. Real-time PCR was performed to ensure quantitative nature of gene expressions either using SYBR Green I or a gene-specific TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For SYBR Green protocol, RT-PCR reactions were carried out using HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 50 ng of cDNA for all genes of interest (500 to 5 ng in serial dilutions for standard curves) or 1 pg for 18 S (10 to 0.1 pg for standard curve), and SYBR Green I in a 1:60,000 dilution in triplicate. Melting curve analysis was carried out as described previously (14De Vos S. Krug U. Hofmann W.K. Pinkus G.S. Swerdlow S.H. Wachsman W. Grogan T.M. Said J.W. Koeffler H.P. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 12: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were: a 95 °C initial activation for 15 min was followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and fluorescence determination at the melting temperature of the product for 20 s on an ICycler detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Determination of C50 cycles and quantification were done as previously described (14De Vos S. Krug U. Hofmann W.K. Pinkus G.S. Swerdlow S.H. Wachsman W. Grogan T.M. Said J.W. Koeffler H.P. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 12: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, real-time PCR for RIN1 gene was carried out using a Taq-Man probe according to the manufacturer's protocol. Concentrations of primers and TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (sequences will be provided upon request) were 300 and 100 nm, respectively. All PCR experiments were performed multiple times using both polyclonal and monoclonal cell cultures to ensure reproducibility. Cell Proliferation and Morphologic Analysis—KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells (5 × 104) were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum either with or without ZnSO4 (100 μm), and the mean number of viable cells in triplicate experiments was determined on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 using trypan blue exclusion. The cellular morphology was studied after Wright-Giemsa staining of cytospin slides. Cell Cycle Analyses and Apoptosis Assays—Cell cycle analyses were performed on KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells incubated for 0, 3, 6, and 9 days with ZnSO4 (100 μm). The cells were fixed in cold ethanol, stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed by FACScan and CELLFit programs (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end-labeling technique using in situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotide Microarray Expression Analysis—KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells were cultured in media containing 100 μm ZnSO4 (Sigma) for 12 h for the induction of C/EBPα. Three independent cultures were carried out for the microarray experiments. Total RNA extracted by TRIzol was purified using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 8 μg of purified total RNA from each sample was used to prepare biotinylated cRNA probes, and 15 μg of labeled cRNA from each sample was used for hybridization to HuGeneFL Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) at Microarray Core, University of California, Los Angeles. Following the hybridization, arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and scanned on a Hewlett Packard scanner. The measured fluorescence intensity values were captured using GeneChip software (Affymetrix), and the data were normalized by global scaling to a target value of 2500 and to the average fluorescence intensity for the entire microarray (15Voehringer D.W. Hirschberg D.L. Xiao J. Roederer M. Lock C.B. Herzenberg L.A. Steinman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2680-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Microarray Data Analysis—Data generated by GeneChip software (Affymetrix) were exported to GeneSpring software version 4.2 (Silicon Genetics, Inc., San Carlos, CA) for further analyses. Pairwise comparisons were performed to examine C/EBPα gene effect in triplicate. Gene lists were generated by selecting genes with at least 2-fold expression change and the raw intensity value of at least 1000 in the experimental sample in triplicate experiments. For -fold expression change calculations, average difference values below the detection limit of 10, including the negative expression values, were set at an arbitrary “11” to capture the genes that are not expressed in one sample but switched on in the other or vice versa.

Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions, electrophoresed on a denaturing formaldehyde gel, and blotted in 20× SSC overnight to a nylon membrane. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in Ultra-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) and [α-32P]dATP-labeled full-length C/EBPα cDNA or partial cDNA probes for CXCR4, C3aR1, annexin 1, LITAF, cyclin D2, annexin 1, BTG2, IFI15, CASP2, and RIPK1 domain-containing adaptor with death domain (CRADD), monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (ELANH2), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (loading control). The blots were washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS followed by two washes with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min each. The probes were generated by PCR, and PCR products were sequenced to ensure gene specificity. Sequences of the primers used will be provided upon request. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of staining buffer (RPMI media with 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide), and incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated murine monoclonal antibody against human CXCR4 (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed in staining buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of C/EBP Family Members in KCL22 Cells—Previously, we observed a lack of C/EBPα DNA binding activity in the KCL22 cells (leukemic cell line derived from a patient with CML in myeloid blast crisis) (16Verbeek W. Gombart A.F. Chumakov A.M. Muller C. Friedman A.D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of protein expression of the C/EBP family members (α, β, ϵ, and γ) by Western blotting detected expression of C/EBPβ and -ϵ, but no expression of C/EBPα and -γ (data not shown). We previously showed that C/EBPβ in these cells had a mutation (17Vegesna V. Takeuchi S. Hofmann W.K. Ikezoe T. Tavor S. Krug U. Fermin A.C. Miller C.W. Koeffler H.P. Leukemia Res. 2002; 26: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and could not bind to C/EBP DNA binding sequences (16Verbeek W. Gombart A.F. Chumakov A.M. Muller C. Friedman A.D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of detectable C/EBPα protein lead us to hypothesize that restoration of C/EBPα expression would promote granulocytic differentiation of KCL22 cells. The human C/EBPα cDNA expression vector under the control of a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter was stably transfected into KCL22 cells. The protein levels of C/EBPα were measured in cells from different clones of KCL22-pMTα cultured in either zinc-containing or -deficient media for 16 h. C/EBPα protein levels in cells from two independent clones (#1 and #2) are shown in Fig. 1A. Using real-time RT-PCR, we analyzed C/EBPα mRNA expression levels in KCL22-pMTα cells (clone #1) and in purified normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. Results showed that levels of C/EBPα mRNA are 50-fold higher in the KCL22-pMTα cells compared with normal bone marrow cells (Fig. 1B). ATRA, 9-cis-RA, and HMBA Inhibited Proliferation of KCL22 Cells without Triggering Differentiation—We examined whether KCL22 cells have the ability to differentiate by chemical reagents that are known to trigger differentiation in other AML cell lines. The KCL22 cells were cultured for up to 14 days in the presence of either ATRA (10–7 to 10–5 mol/liter), 9-cis-RA (10–7 to 10–5 mol/liter), or HMBA (4 mmol/liter). Cell proliferation was markedly inhibited by the different treatments in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). However, none of the treatments led to the differentiation of KCL22 cells as measured by morphologic changes of differentiation or up-regulation of expression of neutrophil-specific genes (collagenase and lactoferrin; data not shown). C/EBPα Expression in BCR-ABL-positive Cells Rapidly and Dramatically Induced Granulocytic Differentiation—Overexpression of C/EBPα in the 32D cl3 myeloblasts was shown to trigger neutrophil differentiation (18Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cotransfection of BCR-ABLp210 in the murine nonmalignant 32D cl3 cells prevented differentiation of these cells (18Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using KCL22 cells stably transfected with zinc-inducible C/EBPα expression plasmid, we addressed the question of whether restoring C/EBPα expression can trigger differentiation in human CML blast cells that express BCR-ABL. Multiple clones of KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells were grown in media either with or without ZnSO4 (100 μm) for up to 14 days. Cell morphology was examined daily by cytospin and staining with Wright-Giemsa. Most remarkably after only 3 days in the presence of ZnSO4, many of the KCL22-pMTα cells morphologically matured to myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, and neutrophils (>90%) (Fig. 3A). Most of the cells had a reduction in their nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with more condensed nuclear chromatin, and many had segmented nuclei typical of mature granulocytes. In contrast, KCL22-pMT cells grown in the presence of ZnSO4 (Fig. 3A) as well as KCL22-pMTα and KCL22-pMT cells grown without ZnSO4 had the characteristic appearance of myeloblasts, indistinguishable from untransfected KCL22 cells (data not shown). Induction of expression of C/EBPα also induced a remarkable up-regulation of neutrophil-specific genes in the KCL22 cells. KCL22-pMT and KCL22-pMTα cells were cultured either with or without zinc, and total RNA was extracted daily and analyzed by RT-PCR. In the absence of zinc, the transcript levels of MPO, collagenase, lactoferrin, CAP18, gelatinase, and CD11b were negligible or very low. Within 3 days of culture in zinc-containing media, KCL22-pMTα cells dramatically increased their levels of each of these granulocyte-related genes (Fig. 3B). In addition, the mRNA expression level of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), a known direct target of C/EBPα, also markedly increased in the presence of zinc (Fig. 3C). Real-time RT-PCR was also performed on selected genes to ensure quantitative induction"
https://openalex.org/W2034302810,"MEFV is a gene expressed specifically in myeloid cells and whose mutations underlie an autosomal recessive auto-inflammatory disease, called familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), characterized by recurrent episodes of serosal inflammation. This gene, which encodes a protein with unclear physiological functions, has been shown to be up-regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). However, the mechanism of this regulation is unknown, and the MEFV promoter is still to be characterized. Here, we show that 243 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human MEFV gene are sufficient to direct high level expression of MEFV in TNFα-treated cells. The TNFα-induced expression of MEFV is dependent on both NFκB p65 and C/EBPβ that bind to evolutionarily conserved sites located, in the human promoter, at positions –163 and –55, respectively. As shown by a series of transcription and gel shift assays performed with wild-type and mutated promoter sequences, these two transcription factors act differently on the TNFα-dependent transcription of MEFV: C/EBPβ is the key regulatory factor required to confer cell responsiveness to TNFα, whereas NFκB p65 increases this response by means of a synergistic interaction with C/EBPβ that is dependent on the integrity of the identified –55 C/EBP binding site. Given the phenotype of patients with FMF, this C/EBP-NFκB interaction may represent a key step in the control of an inflammatory response that is abnormally high in this disease. These data, which shed novel light on the pathophysiology of FMF, represent an unusual example of cross-talk between C/EBP and NFκB pathways in TNFα signaling.

Although the first mutations have been identified 6 years ago, the pathophysiology of this unusual disease remains unclear, even though several lines of indirect evidence strongly suggest the involvement of MEFV in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways both in humans and in mice (3.Richards N.

Indeed, the protein predicted by MEFV, called pyrin or marenostrin, was shown to belong to an expanding family of molecules containing a protein:protein interaction domain called pyrin domain (5.Bertin J.

In addition, FMF shares striking clinical similarities with a number of other inflammatory syndromes defining the group of hereditary recurrent fevers. Because several of these related diseases have been shown to result from mutations in the CIAS1 gene (i.e. Muckle-Wells syndrome (11.Hoffman H.M. Mueller J.L. Broide D.H. Wanderer A.A. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), familial cold urticaria (11.Hoffman H.M. Mueller J.L. Broide D.H. Wanderer A.A. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

Aksentijevich I. Galon J. McDermott E. Ogunkolade B. Centola M. Mansfield E. Gadina M. Karenko L. Pettersson T. McCarthy J. Frucht D. Aringer M. Torosyan Y. Teppo A. Wilson M. Karaarslan H. Wan Y.

Cell. 1999; 97: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar)), it is tempting to speculate the existence of pathophysiological mechanisms that may be common to those genetic disorders and involving the underlying genes. In this regard, it is noteworthy that cryopyrin, the protein encoded by CIAS1, which contains a pyrin domain, has been shown to be a potential regulator of the NFκB transcription factor (14.Manji G.A. Wang L. Geddes B.J. Brown M. Merriam S. Al-Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. Jurman M. Cao J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11570-11575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whereas TNFα, the ligand of TNFR1A, is a well known cytokine involved in the acute-phase response to a wide range of inflammatory stimuli (15.Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MEFV gene displays a highly restricted pattern of expression: MEFV transcripts are found specifically in myeloid cells, essentially in monocytes and neutrophils, two cell types that participate in the inflammatory infiltrates found in patients with FMF (1.The French FMF Consortium Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 2.The International FMF Consortium Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). These transcripts, which are expressed during myelomonocytic differentiation (16.Tidow N. Chen X. Muller C. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Centola M. Wood G. Frucht D.M. Galon J. Aringer M. Farrell C. Kingma D.W. Horwitz M.E. Mansfield E. Holland S.M. O'Shea J.J.

Blood. 2000; 95: 3223-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are also present in a number of cell lines, including the early myeloblastic KG1 cells, as well as in HeLa cells (16.Tidow N. Chen X. Muller C. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, several inflammatory mediators are known to increase the expression of the human MEFV gene: TNFα and LPS in monocytes, and interferon-γ in both monocytic and granulocytic cells (17.Centola M. Wood G. Frucht D.M. Galon J. Aringer M. Farrell C. Kingma D.W. Horwitz M.E. Mansfield E. Holland S.M. O'Shea J.J. Rosenberg H.F. Malech H.L. Kastner D.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3223-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which those cytokines regulate MEFV gene expression is entirely unknown, and, from a more general viewpoint, the MEFV promoter is still to be characterized.To gain insights into the pathophysiology of FMF, we have investigated the regulation of the human MEFV gene that, on the basis of in silico means, contains in its 5′-flanking region putative binding sites for a variety of transcription factors, including NFκB and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP). The NFκB family includes the p50, p65, and c-Rel proteins, which exist as homo- or heterodimers. In unstimulated cells, the NFκB dimers are bound to the inhibitory protein IκB, which masks the nuclear localization signal of NFκB, thereby retaining the dimers in the cytoplasm. The binding of TNFα to TNFR1 leads to the activation of the IKK complex, which, in turn, phosphorylates IκB. The subsequent ubiquitination of IκB, followed by its degradation by the proteasome, leads to its dissociation from NFκB, which results in activation and nuclear translocation of the NFκB dimers that interact with the promoter region of a number of target genes (for review, see Refs. 18.Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar and 19.Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBP family of transcription factors contains six members (C/EBPα, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ) and is characterized by the presence of a COOH-terminal basic DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper domain that promotes homo- and heterodimerization of the different family members. These latter factors, which are induced by several cytokines, play key roles in numerous cellular responses, including immune and inflammatory processes, by regulating cytokine and acute phase response genes (for review, see Ref. 20.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of putative binding sites for both NFκB and C/EBP in the 5′-flanking region of the human MEFV gene prompted us to assess the role of those proteins in the regulation of MEFV transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—Four MEFV promoter constructs were generated by PCR amplification using human genomic DNA (Boehringer) as template. Standard PCR reactions, with cycling temperature of 94, 55, and 72 °C, were performed using one of the following forward primers (–1013) 5′-TATAAAGATCTTGAGTAGCTGGGAGTACAGGT-3′, (–483) 5′-TATAAAGATCTCTCACAGGACTGTATTCAGTG-3′, (–243) 5′-TATAAAGATCTGGTCTAGTGTGGAGGCGAGGT-3′, or (–133) 5′-TATAAAGATCTCACAGCCGGCATGGACACACC-3′ (the number in parentheses indicates the position of the 5′ base of the primer within the MEFV promoter sequence) and the reverse primer (+37) 5′-TATAAAGCTTCTGAGCAGGAGAGGCTCGAGC-3′. The forward primers contain a HindIII restriction enzyme site, whereas the reverse primer contains a BglII restriction site. The PCR products were digested by HindIII and BglII enzymes and cloned into the luciferase vector pGL3 linearized using the same enzymes. The four generated MEFV promoter constructs were designated p1013-MEFV-Luc, p483-MEFV-Luc, p243-MEFV-Luc, and p133-MEFV-Luc, according to the forward primer used in the PCR reaction (Fig. 1). The responsive elements identified in silico by means of the TFSEARCH (Yutaka Akiyama: TFSEARCH: Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites, available at www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/) and the MATINSPECTOR (Genomatix, available at www.genomatix.de) software were subjected to point-directed mutagenesis, using the mutated oligonucleotides described in Fig. 1A and according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The mutated derivative constructs were named p243-MEFVMut NFκB-Luc, p243-MEFVMut C/EBP-Luc, p243-MEFVMut NFκB/C/EBP-Luc, p243-MEFVMut C/EBP2-Luc, and p243-MEFVMut NFκB/C/EBP2-Luc (Fig. 1B), according to the oligonucleotides used. The C/EBPβ cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR performed with total RNA extracted from HeLa cells as template and the following primers (forward: 5′-TTCATGCAACGCCTGGTGGCCTGG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCGCTAGCAGTGGCCGGAGGAGGC-3′). The reverse transcription-PCR products were subsequently cloned into the TOPO-V5 expression vector (Invitrogen). The NFκB p65 expression vector used in this study has been described previously (21.Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing.Cell Growth, Treatment, and Transfection—KG1 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa and HEK293 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 3 × 105 HeLa or 4.5 × 105 HEK293 cells were cultured 24 h in 6-wells culture plates and transfected using 350 ng of the MEFV promoter construct or the empty pGL3 vector, with or without C/EBPβ and/or NFκB p65 expression vectors (100 ng of each plasmid construct), according to the manufacturer's instructions (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen). Total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. When indicated, 18 h after transfection, cells were treated with TNFα (50 ng/ml, Tebu). The cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega assay system. Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration, which was measured using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce), rather than to a second reporter plasmid, because, as shown by others (22.Huszar T. Mucsi I. Terebessy T. Masszi A. Adamko S. Jeney C. Rosivall L. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 88: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the use of such internal standards in transient experiments may lead to a systematic error. Each transfection experiment was performed independently at least three times. Results of one representative experiment done in triplicate are presented.Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean values ± S.D. Differences among groups were analyzed by means of the analysis of variance test, and statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—KG1 and untransfected HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium α or Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen), respectively, in the absence or in the presence of 50 ng/ml TNFα. Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows: cells were resuspended and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and proteases inhibitors). 25 μl of buffer B (Nonidet P-40 10%) were added to HeLa extracts; all extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 s. The pellets, which contain nuclear fractions, were then resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors), vortexed for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min; the resulting supernatants correspond to nuclear extracts. DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 5–20 μg of nuclear extracts, 5 μl of 4× binding buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science), 1 ng of probe end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 μCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). For NFκB EMSAs in KG1 cells, protein extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, Igepal 1%, and protease inhibitors. For competition assays, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added prior to the binding reaction. For supershift experiments, protein extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of antibodies directed against either C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, NFκB p65, or NFκB p50 for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the binding reaction. Anti-C/EBPα and anti-C/EBPβ antibodies were kindly provided by R. Barouki (INSERM, Unit 490, Paris, France); antibodies against C/EBPδ, NFκB p65, and NFκB p50 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA·protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 150 V, and analyzed by autoradiography. The oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are described in Fig. 1A.RESULTSThe 1-kb 5′-Flanking Sequence of MEFV Is Sufficient to Confer Responsiveness of HeLa Cells to TNFα—Because MEFV transcription is known to be up-regulated by TNFα and NFκB is the main transcription factor involved in TNFα signaling, we screened the 1-kb MEFV sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site (17.Centola M. Wood G. Frucht D.M. Galon J. Aringer M. Farrell C. Kingma D.W. Horwitz M.E. Mansfield E. Holland S.M. O'Shea J.J. Rosenberg H.F. Malech H.L. Kastner D.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3223-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the presence of potential NFκB binding sites. Three potential binding sites for NFκB (consensus sequence: 5′-GGGGAATCCC-3′) were identified, at positions –594 (5′-GGAAGAACCA-3′), –428 (5′-GGAAGGTCCC-3′), and –163 (5′-GGAAAATCCT-3′) (Fig. 1B). To assess the effect of TNFα on MEFV transcription, we therefore first cloned a 1013-bp MEFV fragment encompassing these three sites upstream of the transcriptional start site into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3. Promoter activity was determined by luciferase assays after transfection of the resulting plasmid designated p1013-MEFV-Luc into the human HeLa cell line that is known to express MEFV (16.Tidow N. Chen X. Muller C. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with the activity of transfected cells exposed to TNFα (Fig. 2). All luciferase values were normalized to cell protein concentration and compared with those for the promoterless vector pGL3. The luciferase activity of transfected cells exposed to TNFα was found to be 5- to 10-fold greater than that of untreated cells; in contrast the luciferase activity of cells transfected with pGL3 was extremely low (about 15-fold lower than that of cells transfected with p1013-MEFV-Luc) and remained unchanged after TNFα treatment. These results, therefore, show that the 1013-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of MEFV displays a basal promoter activity and that this sequence is sufficient to confer responsiveness of HeLa cells to TNFα.Fig. 2Delineation of the human MEFV promoter region involved in TNFα activation. HeLa cells were transfected either with one MEFV promoter construct (p1013-MEFV-Luc, p483-MEFV-Luc, p243-MEFV-Luc, or p133-MEFV-Luc), or with the empty luciferase pGL3-Luc vector. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h (TNFα) or left untreated (UT). Relative luciferase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are represented as mean values ± S.D. of a representative experiment done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Importance of nt –243 to +37 for the TNFα-dependent Activation of the MEFV Promoter—To map the functionally important sites for the responsiveness of the human MEFV promoter to TNFα, we generated a series of three deleted constructs of the 5′-flanking region of MEFV with respect to the three potential binding sites for NFκB located at positions –594, –428, and –163 (Fig. 1B). Transfection of these constructs into HeLa cells revealed the existence of a TNFα-inducible promoter activity in p1013-MEFV-Luc, p483-MEFV-Luc, and p243-MEFV-Luc (Fig. 2). In contrast, further deletion of the MEFV promoter between nt –243 and –133 resulted in a significant decrease (2- to 3-fold) of TNFα inducibility of the MEFV promoter, without affecting basal promoter activity (Fig. 2), whereas targeted disruption of the –594 or –428 NFκB putative site in the context of the intact 1-kb promoter did not affect significantly MEFV responsiveness to TNFα (data not shown).These results argue against the involvement of the –594 and –428 putative NFκB binding sequences in MEFV responsiveness to TNFα, while indicating the presence of a TNFα-responsive element located within the proximal region of the MEFV promoter (nt –243 to –133), which contains the third putative binding site for NFκB (at nt –163). However, although TNFα inducibility of the p133-MEFV-Luc promoter was substantially reduced when compared with that of constructs containing larger promoter regions, it was not completely abrogated, indicating the presence of additional site(s) involved in TNFα responsiveness and located within the first 133 bp of the promoter region (Fig. 2). Interestingly, this region contains a putative binding site for C/EBP at position –55.Both the –163 NFκB and –55 C/EBP Binding Sites Are Required for the TNFα-dependent Activation of the MEFV Promoter—To examine the possible contribution of the putative binding sites for NFκB (–163) and C/EBP (–55) to the responsiveness of the MEFV promoter to TNFα, we constructed two mutant reporter genes: p243-MEFVMut NFκB-Luc, in which the NFκB site was disrupted by two point mutations, and p243-MEFVMut C/EBP-Luc, in which the C/EBP site was disrupted by a single nucleotide substitution (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3, mutation of the NFκB site decreased the ability of the MEFV promoter to respond to TNFα, in a range (2–3-fold) similar to that documented with the deletion construct (p133-MEFV-Luc) encompassing this sequence (Fig. 2). Most importantly, disruption of the C/EBP binding site resulted in a complete loss of TNFα inducibility of the MEFV promoter without affecting basal promoter activity (Fig. 3); similar results were obtained when the same point mutation was introduced in the –55 C/EBP site of all other MEFV promoter constructs (data not shown).Fig. 3Contribution of the putative binding sites for NFκB (at position –163) and C/EBPβ (at nt –55) to the TNFα-dependent transcriptional activation of the MEFV promoter. HeLa cells were transfected either with the wild-type p243-MEFV-Luc construct or the mutated constructs p243-MEFVMut NFκB-Luc or p243-MEFVMut C/EBP-Luc. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h (TNFα) or left untreated (UT). Relative luciferase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are represented as mean values ± S.D. of a representative experiment done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, these results strongly suggest that member(s) of the C/EBP protein family would play a key role in mediating TNFα inducibility of MEFV expression. More precisely, the putative binding site for C/EBP located at position –55 appears to be necessary for conferring responsiveness of the MEFV promoter to TNFα, whereas the –163 NFκB site would enhance the C/EBP-mediated stimulating effect of TNFα on MEFV transcription.NFκB p65 and C/EBPβ Bind the –163 NFκB and –55 C/EBP Sites of the Human MEFV Promoter, Respectively— Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to determine whether the promoter contained bona fide NFκB and C/EBP binding sites. Radiolabeled 20-mer oligonucleotides spanning the region from nt –59 to –39 and containing the putative binding site for C/EBP, designated MEFVC/EBP, were incubated with nuclear protein extracts prepared from untreated and TNFα-treated HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4A (lanes 1 and 2), this probe revealed a complex in both conditions, whereas no shift was observed when nuclear extracts were incubated with the MEFVMut C/EBP oligonucleotide (an oligonucleotide differing by a single nucleotide critical for C/EBP binding) as the probe (lanes 3 and 4). Binding specificity was further determined by competition assays (Fig. 4B): the formation of the complex could be inhibited by an excess of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotides corresponding either to the MEFVC/EBP site or to a consensusC/EBP site (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4), but not by the MEFVMut C/EBP oligonucleotide (lane 3).Fig. 4Binding of C/EBPβ and NFκB p65 factors to the MEFV promoter assessed by gel shift assays. EMSAs were performed with protein extracts obtained from HeLa or KG1 cells left untreated (–) or treated (+) with TNFα, and different probes corresponding to the wild-type oligonucleotide MEFVC/EBP, the mutated oligonucleotide MEFVMut C/EBP, or the wild-type oligonucleotide MEFVNFκB. A, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with TNFα for 6 h (lanes 2 and 4) or left untreated (lanes 1 and 3) were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the normal C/EBP binding site (MEFVC/EBP) (lanes 1 and 2) or a mutated C/EBP binding site (MEFVMut C/EBP) (lanes 3 and 4). B, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with TNFα for 6 h were incubated with the MEFVC/EBP oligonucleotide as probe, and competition experiments were performed using a 100-fold excess of one of the following cold oligonucleotides: MEFVC/EBP (lane 2), MEFVMut C/EBP (lane 3), or ConsensusC/EBP (lane 4). C, nuclear extracts from HeLa and KG1 cells treated with TNFα for 24 h (lanes 2–5 and lanes 7–12, respectively) or left untreated (lanes 1 and 6, respectively) were preincubated with antibodies directed against C/EBPα (lanes 3 and 10), β (lanes 4 and 11), or δ (lanes 5 and 12), or with an excess of cold MEFVC/EBP (lane 8) or ConsensusC/EBP (lane 9) competitor oligonucleotides, and then incubated with the wild-type MEFVC/EBP oligonucleotide as probe. D, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with TNFα for 30 min (lanes 2–5) or left untreated (lane 1) were incubated with the MEFVNFκB probe, and competition experiments were performed using an excess of cold MEFVNFκB, MEFVMut NFκB, or ConsensusNFκB oligonucleotides. E, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with TNFα for 30 min (lanes 2–4) or left untreated (lane 1) were preincubated with antibodies directed against either NFκB p65 (lane 3) or NFκB p50 (lane 4) and then incubated with the MEFVNFκB oligonucleotide as probe. Similar experiments were performed with protein extracts obtained from KG1 cells (lanes 5–8). The identity of the shifted bands indicated by an arrowhead in panels D and E is discussed in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify which C/EBP member binds to the proximal region of the MEFV promoter, we performed supershift experiments using antibodies directed against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (Fig. 4C). Nuclear extracts of HeLa cells were preincubated with each of these antibodies before the addition of the labeled MEFVC/EBP probe. The whole complex was retarded by a C/EBPβ antibody (lane 4), whereas anti-C/EBPα and C/EBPδ antibodies had no effect on the mobility of the complex (lanes 3 and 5). Altogether, these data indicate that C/EBPβ is the protein member of the C/EBP family whose specific binding to a site located at position –55 of the human MEFV promoter is required for the TNFα-dependent activation of MEFV gene expression.To determine whether C/EBPβ is also able to bind the –55 MEFV promoter site in hematopoietic cells, we performed similar EMSAs using nuclear extracts of KG1 cells, a myeloblastic cell line that e"

The TNF receptors utilize at least two distinct mechanisms to activate pathways mediating cell death or survival. The intracellular signaling domains of some receptors in this family, such as Fas, contain a helical death domain that couples to the apoptotic machinery through interactions with adaptors, such as FADD (Fas-associated death domain), that also contain death domains. Other related TNF family receptors utilize adaptors in the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family of RING/zinc finger proteins (2.Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D.

Thus, determination of cell fate may occur, in part, at the level of recruitment of the adaptor proteins. Six TRAF proteins have been identified in humans and mice, numbered sequentially TRAF1–6. TRAF2–6 contain two N-terminal zinc-binding domains, including a ring finger and five zinc finger motifs followed by a conserved TRAF domain. It is this conserved TRAF C-terminal domain that mediates binding to the cytoplasmic domains of TNFRs or signaling activators. TRAFs serve as co-inducers of downstream signaling, through a complex set of related and yet unique interactions with a range of binding affinities for the various TNFRs (13.Chung J.Y. Park Y.C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 19.Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the TRAF domain of TRAF3 in complex with the recognition motif PVQET from CD40 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K.

A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and also in complex with the binding motif PIQCT from TANK (21.Li C. Ni C.Z. Havert M.L. Cabezas E. He J. Kaiser D. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Cheng G. Ely K.R. Structure. 2002; 10: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) revealed that TANK and CD40 bind to the same binding pocket on the surface of the TRAF3 domain, supporting the hypothesis that TANK and CD40 compete for the TRAF site. Similarly for TRAF2, peptides from a number of TNFRs that contain a PXQXT or (P/S/T/A)X(Q/E)E motif bind in the homologous crevice (22.Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of the LTβR is 194 residues in length and contains a large proline-rich region (∼60 residues) near the C terminus that is responsible for initiating NF-κB activation and apoptosis (23.Force W.R. Glass A.A. Benedict C.A. Cheung T.C. Lama J. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11121-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A series of deletion mutants localized the binding site for TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5, but the minimal binding motif 389PEEGDPG395 showed limited homology to the conserved recognition motif in other receptors that engage TRAFs, including CD40, HVEM, CD27, EDAR, or B cell-activating factor receptor. Thus, it was unclear how this sequence would establish molecular contacts to propagate signal transduction (13.Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To develop a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive TRAF-mediated signaling from the lymphotoxin-β receptor, we present here structural studies of TRAF3 in complex with a fragment of the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR. The crystal structure clearly identifies the recognition motif that binds to the conserved TRAF domain. Comparison with the molecular interactions seen in the TRAF3/CD40 complex (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K.

A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reveals that the primary intermolecular contacts are made in the same surface binding crevice on TRAF3 that accommodates CD40 (20.Ni C.Z.

Mutational analyses of residues at the contact interface identify unique interactions that provide specific recognition of TRAF3 for LTβR that are discrete from those that drive specific recognition for CD40 or TANK. Crystallographic Analysis—TRAF3 used for this study was the shortened molecule, produced by tryptic cleavage that removed 36 residues from the N terminus. This truncated molecule was shown previously to produce crystals with marked improvement in diffraction (24.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Zheng J. Havert M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1340-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The crystals were grown as described (24.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Zheng J. Havert M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1340-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in hanging drops by vapor diffusion from reservoir solutions containing 15% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 0.1 mm MES, pH 6.5. The crystals formed at room temperature in space group P321 to a size of 500 × 500 × 25 μm in 2–3 days. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 385PYPIPEEGDPGPPGLSTPHQEDGK408 from the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR was soaked into TRAF3 crystals. The crystals were cryoprotected with 25% glycerol and flash frozen. Diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline BL9-1 at –175 °C using a MAR345 image plate detector. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (25.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing.

After refinement Fo – Fc difference maps and OMITMAPS (28.Bhat T.N. Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1984; 17: 244-248Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were used to fit the peptide. Clear electron density was visible for backbone atoms in the early maps to position the peptide at the binding crevice on TRAF3. The final model included all of the residues in the peptide. Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The R factor and Rfree were 26.6% and 31.5%, respectively. Molecular images for the figures and electrostatic surfaces were prepared with MOLMOL (29.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and SPOCK (30.Christopher J.A. SPOCK: The Structural Properties Observation and Calculation Kit. Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1998Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—The LTβR peptide was synthesized with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on Rink's amide methoxybenzhydrylamine resin using an Advanced Chemtech 350 multiple peptide synthesizer. The peptide was acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and deprotected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% H2O, and 2.5% triisopropylamine. After cleavage, the crude peptide was precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse phase C18 Cosmosil column developed with a water, acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient. The final product was analyzed and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Construction of LTβR and TRAF3 Mutants—Site-specific mutations were introduced into the cDNA sequences of human LTβR and TRAF3 in the pCDNA3-mycLTβR (10.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and pSG5-FLAG-TRAF3 vectors (31.Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), respectively, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR were made: P387A, P389A, D393A, E390A/E391A, and E390A/E391A/D393A. For TRAF3, the following single mutants were made: R393A, Y395A, L432E, F448E, S454A, S455A, S456A, and F457E. The residue numbers for TRAF3 correspond to those used in the report of the crystal structure of TRAF3 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of LTβR or the LTβR mutants was PCR-cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to create GST-LTβR fusion proteins using the following primers: 5′-ggaattcaagagccacccttctctctgc-3′ and 5′-cctcgaggtcagtcatgggtgataaattgg-3′ containing EcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria (BL-21) from pGEX plasmids and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, bacterial cultures in the log phase of growth were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. For some mutants, induction time was reduced to 1 h to prevent the formation of protein aggregates. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1.5% Sarkosyl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in PBS) and sonicated on ice to lyse the cells. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed once with PBS, twice with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, and twice with co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 142 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and resuspended in co-immunoprecipitation buffer. GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining and normalized to ∼1 μg/5 μl by adding “empty” beads. GST-CD40 and GST-TANK (TRAF-interacting motif) were expressed from the pGEX-CD40 (32.Sato T. Irie S. Reed J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and pGEX-TANK (21.Li C. Ni C.Z. Havert M.L. Cabezas E. He J. Kaiser D. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Cheng G. Ely K.R.

Binding of LTβR to TRAF3 was tested by isothermal titration calorimetry, but the binding was weak and not measurable by the calorimeter. Therefore in vitro binding assays were utilized. In Vitro Binding Assays—For the protein binding assays, the lysates were prepared from 293T cells transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pSG5-FLAG-TRAF3 or the FLAG-tagged TRAF3 mutants, pSG5-FLAG-TRAF2 (33.Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada J.N. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immobilized GST fusion proteins (∼5 μg) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with detergent buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 142 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) for TRAF2 and TRAF3 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for TRAF5. TRAF3/LTβR Complex—As reported earlier, the TRAF domains of TRAF3 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), TRAF2 (35.Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 36.McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) share a conserved folding pattern that incorporates an independently folded C-terminal domain (residues 348–504). This domain folds into an eight-stranded β-sandwich that is formed from two layers of β-sheet that each contain four antiparallel strands. TRAF3 is an oligomeric molecule that functions as a trimer in solution. The trimer is stabilized by coiled-coil interactions (10.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) between the long helices that are N-terminal of the conserved TRAF C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). In the crystal, one monomer is the asymmetric unit, and the three subunits are related by 3-fold crystallographic symmetry. For crystallization, we used tryptic digestion to shorten the N-terminal helices by 36 residues, and this procedure markedly improved the diffraction properties of the crystals (21.Li C. Ni C.Z. Havert M.L. Cabezas E. He J. Kaiser D. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Cheng G. Ely K.R. Structure. 2002; 10: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Zheng J. Havert M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1340-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the crystal lattice, the predominant intermolecular contacts involve the TRAF C-terminal β-sandwich domain, and the crystals are susceptible to twinning. In addition, large solvent channels exist along the length of the extended N-terminal helices. Tryptic digestion truncates these helices, thereby reducing the solvent content of the crystals and eliminating the twinning. To form the complex, a synthetic peptide encompassing the TRAF-binding region of the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR was dissolved and diffused into the TRAF3 crystals. The peptides bound to a surface crevice on the β-sandwich domain with a stoichiometry of 1:1, as shown in Fig. 1. Because of the crystallographic symmetry, the structure of the peptide is identical in each of the three sites in the complex. The LTβR sequence represented in the synthetic peptide was 385PYPIPEEGDPGPPGLSTPHQEDGK408. After the final refinement, all of the residues were ordered and clearly defined in the electron density (Fig. 2). The “alternating pattern” of large and small side chains in the sequence assisted the unambiguous positioning of the LTβR sequence at the TRAF3-binding crevice. In particular, strong density in the initial maps for the side chain of Asp393 dictated the assignment of this density to the aliphatic portion of the aspartic acid, whereas assignment of the flanking Gly392 or Pro394 was clearly not appropriate. Similarly, a large region of electron density directed the positioning of the side chain for Tyr386 rather than the two adjacent prolines. After the final cycles of refinement, the electron density was clear for the polypeptide backbone as well as 11 residues with large side chains. The long LTβR peptide was located in a restricted solvent “cave” that exists at the binding crevice on TRAF3. The overall dimensions of this cave are 15 × 19 × 22 Å, and the space in this portion of the crystal lattice is sufficient to accommodate the large peptide so that the conformation observed in the complex reflects the actual conformation and is not an artifact of crystal packing (20.Ni C.Z.

Structure of LTβR—The results of the refinement are presented in Table I. When LTβR binds to TRAF3, this region of the cytoplasmic domain assumes a reverse turn configuration, with the change in direction occurring through residues 394PGPPG398. The two flanking strands are in an extended conformation, and there are no intramolecular contacts made between these strands. The N-terminal sequence of the fragment binds at the same binding crevice where other TNFRs bind to both TRAF3 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and TRAF2 (22.Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 36.McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). All of the intermolecular interactions between LTβR and TRAF3 are made with residues 388IPEEGD393. (One set of intermolecular contacts involving the C-terminal strand of this segment of LTβR is observed with a symmetry-related TRAF3 molecule in the crystal lattice.) Comparison of TRAF3 Binding Motifs in LTβR and CD40 — LTβR and CD40 both bind to TRAF3 and propagate cellular signals. These receptors bear no sequence or structural resemblance in their cytoplasmic domains. However, their recognition motifs bind to the same binding crevice on the surface of TRAF3 despite the fact that the motifs are presented in completely different folding patterns. In Fig. 3, the structure of the TRAF3-binding fragment of LTβR is compared with the corresponding segment of CD40. Although both structures can loosely be described as reverse turns, the structural resemblance is obscure. It was known from previous work that the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 contains little secondary structure yet assumes an ordered structure when bound to TRAF3 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Given the large number of prolines in the cytoplasmic region of LTβR (33 of 193 residues), it is possible that this domain similarly lacks defined secondary structure. Yet, when bound to TRAF3, this segment does fold in a defined manner as seen in the complex in the crystal. In CD40, an intramolecular contact involving Thr254 established the configuration of the reverse turn and thus the orientation of a TRAF3-specific intermolecular contact (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10395-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In LTβR, no intramolecular interactions within the peptide were observed that stabilize the folding of the LTβR fragment, and no contacts were seen with TRAF3 other than those at the recognition motif. LTβR/TRAF3 Interactions—The residues in the first strand of the LTβR reverse turn represent the critical contacts for binding, and thus the recognition motif for TRAF3 is structurally defined as IPEEGD. These contacts are made in a shallow binding crevice at the edge of the β-sandwich. The intermolecular contacts in this binding crevice are quite similar to those seen when CD40 or TANK binds in complex with TRAF3 (20.Ni C.Z. Welsh K. Leo E. Chiou C.K. Wu H. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Proc.

It can be activated either by members of the Rho family of small G proteins, by proteolysis, or by interaction with lipids. Here we investigate the binding of PRK1 to RhoA and Rac1, two members of the Rho family. We demonstrate that PRK1 binds with a similar affinity to RhoA and Rac1. We present the solution structure of the second HR1 domain from the regulatory N-terminal region of PRK1, and we show that it forms an anti-parallel coiled-coil. In addition, we have used NMR to map the binding contacts of the HR1b domain with Rac1. These are compared with the contacts known to form between HR1a and RhoA. We have used mutagenesis to define the residues in Rac that are important for binding to HR1b. Surprisingly, as well as residues adjacent to Switch I, in Switch II, and in helix α5, it appears that the C-terminal stretch of basic amino acids in Rac is required for a high affinity interaction with HR1b.

The Rho family of small GTPases regulates a wide variety of cellular functions including cell growth and differentiation, cell motility and adhesion (via control of the actin cytoskeleton), and cell cycle progression (1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 2.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). An understanding, at a molecular level, of how these small G proteins control these cellular events would provide a major advance, potentially leading to therapeutic opportunities in areas such as hypertension (3.Mukai Y.

Small G proteins act as molecular switches, being active in the GTP-bound form and inactive in the GDP-bound form. The interaction of the G protein (in its GTP-bound conformation) with an effector protein triggers a downstream signaling cascade. Effectors for Rho include at least 11 proteins: diacylglycerol kinase, phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase, kinectin, rhotekin, rhophilin, p140 Diaphanous, myosin-binding subunit, citron, Rho kinase, and PRK 1The abbreviations used are: PRKprotein kinase C-related kinasePAKp21-activated kinaseGAPGTPase activator proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseSPAscintillation proximity assayNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceNOEnuclear Overhauser effectr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationGMPPNPguanosine 5′-[β,γimido]triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: PRKprotein kinase C-related kinasePAKp21-activated kinaseGAPGTPase activator proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseSPAscintillation proximity assayNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceNOEnuclear Overhauser effectr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationGMPPNPguanosine 5′-[β,γimido]triphosphate.

Within this group of effector proteins there are at least two Rho-binding motifs defined by sequence homology: REM (or class 1 Rho-binding motif) include the PRKs, rhophilin and rhotekin, whereas RKH (Rho effector homology 2 or class 2 Rho-binding motif) include the Rho kinases and kinectin (5.Bishop A.L.

The importance of the PRK effector family for the biological functions of the Rho family of small G proteins is indicated by the interactions that have been described for PRK1 and -2.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and vimentin (7.Matsuzawa K. Kosako H. Inagaki N. Shibata H. Mukai H. Ono Y. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Azuma I. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a major function of the Rho family proteins is known to be the control of the actin cytoskeleton, finding interactions between cytoskeletal proteins and Rho effectors was to be expected. PRKs are also implicated in the control of transcription factors (8.Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Takahashi M. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9.Takanaga H. Mukai H. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Ono Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), mitogenesis (10.Gao Q.S. Kumar A. Srinivasan S. Singh L. Mukai H. Ono Y. Wazer D.E. Band V. J. Biol.

Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PRK1 and -2 have also been shown to play a role in apoptosis, being activated by caspase 3 (12.Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Mlyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and being involved in the regulation of Akt (13.Koh H. Lee K.H. Kim D. Kim S. Kim J.W. Chung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34451-34458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, PRKs have been shown to be involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion with increased PRK activity promoting cell-cell adhesion (14.Calautti E. Grossi M. Mammucai C. Aoyama Y. Purro M. Ono J.L. Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The activity of PRKs in so many processes intimately involved in disease progression makes dissection of their regulation of widespread interest. PRK1 and -2 are highly related serine/threonine kinases that have a catalytic domain homologous to those of the protein kinase C family in their C termini and a unique regulatory domain in their N termini (Fig. 1) (15.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16.Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the protein was found to contain a pseudo-substrate sequence that acts as an auto-inhibitory region (17.Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This regulatory region also contains three leucine zipper type motifs (HR1 repeats a-c). The first of these repeats, HR1a, is now known to incorporate the inhibitory pseudo-substrate site (17.Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PRK1/2 kinase activity is enhanced by binding of the small GTP-binding proteins Rho and Rac in a GTP-dependent manner (18.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19.Lu Y. Settleman J.

Progress has been made recently in the dissection of the regulatory mechanisms employed by the Rho family effector molecules PAK (25.Lei M. Lu W.G. Meng W.Y. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (26.Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan M. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). It appears that many of the Rho family effectors are regulated in a similar manner, being maintained in a closed, inactive conformation via inhibitory intramolecular contacts. These inhibitory contacts can then be relieved by interactions with e.g. other proteins, fatty acids, and phosphoinositides. The involvement of small G proteins in the control of PRK1/2 was first defined when PRK1 was found to be a target for Rho (18.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 21.Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The minimal region required for Rho binding was found to be residues 33-111 (Fig. 1), which contains the first HR1 repeat, HR1a, and the pseudo-substrate site (27.Shibata H. Mukai H. Inagaki Y. Homma Y. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Narumiya S. Ono Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rho was subsequently found to bind to both isolated HR1a and HR1b domains but to HR1a in a more GTP-dependent manner, whereas no interaction was detected for HR1c (28.Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). G protein-interacting proteins are classically defined as effectors if they bind selectively to the GTP-bound (active) form of the G protein. These results therefore suggested that the HR1a repeat was the important Rho-binding site as it provided discrimination in favor of the active form of Rho. Both PRK1 and -2 have been demonstrated recently (19.Lu Y. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) to be targets not only for Rho but also for Rac. With the Rho family of small G proteins occupying such a central role in a diverse set of cellular processes, many of which are important and altered in disease progression, much effort has been expended over the last few years to elucidate the interactions of these proteins. Progress has been made in determining the structures of Rho family G proteins in complex with various effector proteins (29.Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O.

Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These structures have revealed much about the specificity of these interactions, information which is key to understanding the signaling pathways controlled by the Rho family. The x-ray structure of RhoA in complex with the HR1a repeat of PRK1 has been solved (35.Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This structure describes the fold of the HR1a domain as an antiparallel coiled-coil domain termed the ACC finger domain. The ACC finger domain describes a new category of G protein binding domains quite distinct from those found in other known Rho family effectors. It also differs from the ubiquitin fold Ras binding domains of Raf (37.Nassar M. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

The Rab binding domain of Rabphilin and the Rac/Arf effector Arfaptin are also helical, but the contacts that each make with their G proteins are quite different (43.Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The results of Flynn et al. (28.Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggesting the possibility of multiple G protein-interacting sites on PRK1 and further data identifying PRKs as targets for both Rac1 and RhoA (19.Lu Y. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) stimulated this work, in which we set out to determine the role of the multiple HR1 domains in PRK1/G protein interactions. We demonstrate here that the PRK1 HR1 repeats have different affinities for both Rho and Rac. We present the structure of PRK1 HR1b and a map of the contacts it makes in complex with Rac1. We also present data to show the necessity of the C terminus of Rac for high affinity binding to PRK1 and mutagenesis data that indicate the site of HR1b interaction on Rac. Expression Constructs—All proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins from the pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). The construct expressing residues 75-132 of PAK has been described previously (44.Owen D. Mott H.R. Laue E.D. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that expressing residues 198-439 of RhoGAP was a kind gift from Prof. Alan Hall (45.Lancaster C.A. Taylorharris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. Vanerp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HR1a expression construct consisted of PRK1 residues 1-106, HR1b residues 122-199, and HR1ab residues 1-199. Rac1 Q61L and all other mutants were expressed in pGEX2T from constructs encoding residues 1-191 cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The pGEX2T-Rac1 Q61L construct was used as a template to generate the C-terminal deletion constructs. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the required coding sequence, flanked directly by a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ stop codon followed by an EcoRI site to facilitate subcloning into pGEX2T. The resulting PCR products were ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and their sequences were verified using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) The coding fragments were then excised using BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX2T linearized with the same enzymes. Rac1 Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the pGEX2T-Q61L Rac1 expression construct encoding residues 1-191 was performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the Rac1 coding region of all mutants was verified using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Recombinant Protein Production—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Stationary cultures were diluted 1 in 10, grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. Proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Fusions of HR1a, -b, -ab, PAK GBD, and RhoGAP were eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads and used directly in SPAs. GST-Rac1 variants were cleaved from their GST tag while attached to the glutathione-agarose beads with thrombin (Novagen). Protein concentrations for all proteins were evaluated using their A280, amino acid compositions, and the extinction coefficients of tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and the guanine nucleotide (46.Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The integrity of each protein was determined by mass spectrometry. Labeled proteins for NMR spectroscopy were produced by growing the E. coli in a medium based on MOPS buffer, containing 50% labeled Celtone with 15NH4Cl and/or [13C]glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes). Labeled HR1b was cleaved from its GST tag with factor Xa (Roche Applied Science), and the resulting protein was further purified on a Superdex-30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in NMR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 0.05% NaN3). Nucleotide exchange of G proteins was performed as described previously (44.Owen D. Mott H.R. Laue E.D. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Scintillation Proximity Assays (SPA)—Affinities of Rac1 and RhoA proteins for GST-HR1 domains, GST-PAK-(75-132), and GST-RhoGAP were measured using SPAs. GST fusion protein was attached to a fluoromicrosphere via an anti-GST antibody in the presence of Q61L Rac/Q63L Rho·[3H]GTP. Binding of the G protein to the GST fusion protein brings the labeled nucleotide close enough to the scintillant to obtain a signal. Apparent Kd values for Q61L Rac·[3H]GTP, Q63L Rho·[3H]GTP, and proteins incorporating further mutations were measured as described previously (47.Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 48.Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by varying the concentration of Rac/Rho·[3H]GTP at a constant concentration of GST fusion protein. These assays were performed with 30 nm GST fusion protein. By using this method the upper and lower limits of the Kd values that can be measured are 1000 and 1 nm, respectively. For each affinity determination, data points were obtained for at least 10 different Rac1 concentrations. Binding curves were fitted using the appropriate binding isotherms (47.Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 48.Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to obtain Kd values. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples were produced to a final concentration of ∼1 mm in 500 μl with 10% D2O. Experiments were recorded on Bruker DRX spectrometers operating at 500 or 800 MHz, and all experiments were recorded at 298 K. 15N-HSQC, three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY (mixing time 100 ms), 15N-separated TOCSY (DIPSI-2 mixing time 60 ms), and HNHA experiments were recorded on uniformly 15N-labeled HR1b. 13C-HSQC, HQQC, three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, H(CC)(CO)NH, HCCHTOCSY (DIPSI-2 mixing time 18.4 ms), and 13C-separated NOESY (mixing time 100 ms) experiments were recorded on 13C,15N-labeled HR1b (see Ref. 49.Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33 (and references therein): 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed using AZARA and analyzed using ANSIG (50.Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbellburk S.L. Vanaken T. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). 3JHN-HA couplings were measured from an HNHA experiment. Backbone torsion angles were also estimated from CA, CO, CB, N, and HA chemical shifts using the program TALOS (51.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). These were used as restraints for ϕ and Ψ with errors of ±30°, or twice the standard deviation from TALOS, whichever was larger. In those cases where the 3JHN-HA could be measured, the error on the ϕ angle was set to ±10°. The titration of unlabeled Rac1 into 15N-labeled HR1b was performed in the same buffer conditions as the HR1b spectra. Titration points were measured at 1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8, and 1:1, HR1b:Rac1. Chemical shift changes were calculated as a final deviation δHN = √(δN)2 + (10 × δH)2, where δN = change in 15N chemical shift and δH = change in 1H chemical shift. Structure Calculations—Structures were calculated using CNS 1.0 and ARIA 1.0 (52.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), where the ambiguity of NOEs is reduced for each iteration by comparing the NOE tables with structures from the previous iteration. 20 structures were calculated for each iteration, and 7 were used for ARIA analysis. The total contribution of the accepted NOEs to the cross-peak volume was decreased during the 9 iterations from 1.01 (keeping all possibilities) to 0.8 (rejecting the possibilities that contribute less than 20% of the cross-peak volume). The parameters used for the calculation were essentially as described in Linge et al. (52.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) except that the length of the high temperature dynamics was increased to 6 ps and the cooling to a total of 39 ps (24 ps of cooling to 1000 K and 15 ps of cooling to 50 K). The HR1b/Rac1 modeling was performed with the protocol HADDOCK, interfaced to CNS 1.0 (53.Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). For all sets of residues, the solvent accessibility was estimated using the program NACCESS (54.Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS. University College, London1993Google Scholar), and those residues that were less than 50% solvent-exposed were not used. The HR1b residues whose chemical shifts had changed by more than the mean shift change were the active residues. The passive residues were defined as those that were within 5 Å of the active residues. The Rac1 active residues were defined as those that caused a greater than 2.5-fold increase in the Kd. The passive residues were those that were within 5 Å of the active residues. NMR Structure of PRK1 HR1b—The backbone resonances of HR1b were assigned using standard triple resonance NMR experiments. Complete assignments were obtained except for the backbone amides of residues 155-159. Side chain assignments were obtained using HCCH-TOCSY, 15N-separated TOCSY, and H(CC)(CO)NH experiments. 2077 distance restraints were extracted from 15N-separated and 13C-separated NOESY spectra, of which 1443 were unambiguous at the start of the calculation and 634 were ambiguous. These were translated by ARIA into 1575 restraints (1040 unambiguous and 535 ambiguous) for the first iteration. The remaining 502 restraints were removed, either because they were non-unique or because they were ambiguous restraints with more than 50 assignment possibilities. At the end of the final iteration there were 1207 unambiguous and 400 ambiguous restraints. 52 ϕ restraints were included from the 3JHN-HA measurements and an additional 69 loose ϕ and Ψ restraints from TALOS calculations. Table I shows the structural statistics for the 25 lowest energy structures of 100 calculated. The final structures had no NOE violations of more than 0.5 Å and no dihedral violations of more than 5°. The structures are of good quality as judged from a Ramachandran plot (87% of the residues are in the most favored region). The backbone r.m.s.d. over all non-terminal residues (124-191) is 0.82 Å. The HR1b structure is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of two α-helices, which pack together into an anti-parallel coiled-coil. The packing between the helices is mediated by a regular array of Leu, Ile, and Ala side chains. The structures are well defined over both the α-helices. The turn between the helices, residues 152-160, is less well defined by the NMR data. The NH resonances within this loop were absent from the spectra, suggesting that they are undergoing exchange on a ms time scale.Table IExperimental restraints and structural statisticsNo. experimental restraints Unambiguous1207 Ambiguous400 Dihedral restraints121〈SA〉a〈SA〉 represents the average root mean square deviations for the ensemble〈SA〉cb〈SA〉c represents values for the structure that is closest to the meanCoordinate precision r.m.s.d. of backbone atoms 124—191 (Å)0.82 ± 0.160.66 r.m.s.d. of all heavy atoms 124—191 (Å)1.39 ± 0.141.49 r.m.s.d. of backbone atoms 124—153, 160—191 (Å)0.67 ± 0.160.35 r.m.s.d. of all heavy atoms 124—153, 160—191 (Å)1.36 ± 0.121.20 r.m.s.d.

HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were used to study the transcriptional regulation of dCK. 5′-Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the dCK upstream region (positions –464 to –27) confirmed the importance of two GC-boxes (positions –317 to –309 and –213 to –206) and two E-boxes (positions –302 to –297 and –278 to –273). In vitro electromobility shift assays with HepG2 nuclear extracts and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with HepG2 chromatin extracts confirmed the presence of bound Sp1/Sp3 and USF1/2. Co-transfections in HepG2 cells showed that USF1 and USF2a stimulated and Sp1 repressed promoter activity from a dCK-luciferase reporter gene construct. In Sp- and USF-null Drosophila Mel-2 cells, both Sp1 and USF1 stimulated dCK promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, however, both Sp3 and USF2a were effectively inert. Combined Sp1 and USF1 showed additive transactivation at lower concentrations of Sp1. Sp1 was inhibitory at higher levels. Stimulation by combined USF1/USF2a with Sp1 was similar to that for USF1 alone with Sp1, whereas transactivation by Sp1 and USF2a without USF1 was synergistic. Physical interactions between USF and Sp proteins were confirmed by immunoprecipitations with Sp- and USF-specific antibodies. Domain mapping of USF1 and USF2a localized the functional interactions between USF and Sp proteins to the DNA binding domain of USF. Identifying the physical and functional interactions between Sp and USF proteins may lead to a better understanding of the basis for differential expression of the dCK gene in tumor cells and may foster strategies for up-regulating dCK gene expression and improving chemotherapy with araC and gemcitabine.

The human dCK gene spans over 34 kb on chromosome 4 (4q13.3-q21.1) and includes a coding region consisting of seven exons, ranging in size from 90 to 1544 bp (11.Song J.J. Walker S. Chen E. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Spychala J. Gribbin T. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Promoter activity was localized to a 697-bp upstream fragment, including 386 bp of 5′ upstream region, 250 bp of exon 1, and 61 bp of intronic sequence (11.Song J.J. Walker S. Chen E. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Spychala J. Gribbin T. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dCK promoter is highly GC-rich and lacks a TATA-box but contains a transcription initiator region located adjacent to the major transcription start site at position –146 relative to the start of translation. The initiation region also contains an imperfect E2F binding site (12.Chen E.H. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vitro DNase I footprint and electromobility shift assays demonstrated binding of Sp1 to two GC-boxes and upstream stimulatory factor (USF) to a critical E-box. Although site-directed mutagenesis of these cis-elements implied their transcriptional importance, the detailed mechanisms by which these binding associations regulate dCK gene expression have not been established. The Sp and USF proteins are ubiquitously expressed, yet both are implicated in the regulation of genes characterized by tissue-specific or developmental patterns of expression (13.Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 14.Henrion A.A. Martinez A. Mattei M.G. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sp1 and the related Sp3 proteins can exert activating or inhibiting effects on transcription, depending on the cell or promoter context, through binding to GC- or GT-box elements (13.Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The USF proteins belong to the class of b-HLH-ZIP (basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper) transcription factors, including the nuclear proteins Myc, Max, Mad, Mxi1, AP4, TFEB, TFE3, MiTF, and ADD1 (15.Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27.Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). USF was first identified by its capacity to stimulate transcription from the adenovirus late promoter and was purified from HeLa cells as two polypeptides, designated USF1 (43 kDa) and USF2a (44 kDa) (16.Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 38-kDa form, designated USF2b, was described (15.Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 proteins are encoded by two separate genes, and USF2a and 2b represent alternate splice forms of USF2 (15.Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 proteins have similar DNA binding domains (67% homology) but differ in their N-terminal transactivation domains, yet all forms bind to the E-box motif (CACGTG) as homo- and heterodimers (18.Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19.Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H. Sawadogo M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar). An attractive biological feature of USF and Sp proteins is their abilities to mediate a wide range of transcriptional activities via protein-protein interactions with other families of transcription factors. Moreover, evidence for cooperative interactions between USF and Sp proteins has been described, via binding to juxtaposed E-box and GC-elements (20.Li N. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28170-28177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21.Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the proximity of the essential GC- and E-box elements in the dCK promoter, co-operative interactions between USF and Sp proteins can, likewise, be envisaged to regulate expression of this gene. In this report, we significantly extend earlier reports of dCK promoter structure and function in lymphoid cells (12.Chen E.H. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We characterize the major cis-elements and transcription factors that regulate dCK in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and document the existence of physical interactions between the USF and Sp proteins that can potentially regulate dCK promoter activity over a wide range. Chemicals and Reagents—[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Restriction and modifying enzymes, reporter gene vectors (pGL3-Basic, pRLSV40), and other molecular biologicals were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The pPacSp1, pPacO, and pCMV-Sp1 plasmid constructs were provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA), and the pPacSp3 and pPacUSp3 constructs were provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (Philipps-Universitat, Marburg, Germany). The pPacUSF2b plasmid construct and the mammalian (CMV) expression plasmid construct of USF2a were provided by Dr. Shiqing Yan (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). Cell Culture—The human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and was cultured as previously reported (21.Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Drosophila Mel-2 (D. Mel-2) cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and maintained in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 28 °C. Construction of dCK Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The dCK promoter was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA isolated from HL-60 promyelocytic cells using forward (5′-ggcccactgcaggtgacgccctct-3′, dCK/F2) and reverse (5′-tggagattttcttgatgcgggtcccctca-3′, dCK/R2) primers. The PCR products were first cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector. An antisense pGEM-T-Easy clone of the dCK promoter was identified and digested by NcoI and SalI, and the dCK promoter fragment was then subcloned into pGL3Basic at the XhoI and NcoI restriction sites to generate pdCK-464/+75. To generate the 5′-deletion constructs, pdCK-359/+75, pdCK-298/+75, pdCK-179/+75, and pdCK-27/+75, the pdCK-464/+75 construct was digested by SmaI, SmaI and Eco72I, SmaI and Bpu10I, and SmaI and SacI, respectively, and religated (the Bpu10I and SacI sites were bluntended with T4 DNA polymerase before ligation). Promoter constructs harboring nucleotide substitutions in putative transcription factor binding elements were prepared using an overlap extension PCR protocol (22.Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separate amplifications were performed for sense and antisense mutagenesis primers (Table I) with dCK/R2 or dCK/F2, respectively, using pdCK-464/+75 as template. The two products were mixed, and a second PCR was performed using the dCK/F2 and dCK/R2. The mutant amplicons were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. All the deletion and site-directed mutagenesis constructs were sequenced to confirm the intended deletions or mutations.Table ISummary of oligonucleotides for gel shifts and mutagenesisOligonucleotideSequencedCK-328/-289CCACACGCGCGGCCCCGCCCCGGCCTTCACGTGACCTGCGTdCK-223/-181GGCTTGAGGAGGGCGGGGCCGCCCCGCAGGCCCGCCAGTGTCCdCK-291/-260CGTGCGGAGCGCGCACGCGGGAACCCGCGCTdCK Gca mtCCACACGCGCGGCCttGttCCGGCCTTCACGTGACCTGCGTdCK E-box (a) mtCCACACGCGCGGCCCCGCCCCGGCCTTttttTGACCTGCGTdCK E-box (b) mtCGTGCGGAGCGCGtttttGGGAACCCGCGCTdCK GCb mtGGCTTGAGGAGGtttGGGCCGtttCGCAGGCCCGCCAGTGTCC Open table in a new tab Construction of USF1 and USF2 Drosophila and Mammalian Expression Plasmids—The USF1 coding cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from HepG2 total RNA with forward (5′-ttaggatccatgaaggggcagcagaaaacagct-3′, USF1atg) and reverse (5′-ttactcgagttagttgctgtcattcttgatgacgacctc-3′, USF1taa) primers. BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively (underlined), were incorporated into the primers for subcloning. To generate pPacUSF1, the PCR products were digested with BamHI/XhoI and inserted into the Drosophila pPac expression vector after excision of the Sp1 coding sequence from pPacSp1 (23.Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). To construct the N-terminal deletion plasmids of USF1, PCR reactions using the full-length pPacUSF1 as a template were carried out with a GC-Rich Kit (Roche Applied Science). The following oligonucleotides were designed as upstream PCR primers: Δ1–15, 5′-ttaggatcccagattcaggaaggtgcagtggct-3′; Δ1–39, 5′-ttaggatccgccaccttccctgaccccaacgtc-3′; Δ1–80, 5′-ttaggatccatcagtggctaccctgc-3′; Δ1–100, 5′-ttaggatccagtgatgatgcagttgacacggag-3′; Δ1–130, 5′-ttaggatccaccacatcggggagtacagctgct; Δ1–156, 5′-ttaggatccactggtcaattctttgtgatgatg-3′; Δ1–175, 5′-ttaggatcccgctcaattgcccctaggactcac-3′; and Δ1–196, 5′-ttaggatccgatgagaaacgcagggctcagcat-3′. The USF1taa oligonucleotide was used as the reverse primer for each amplification. The PCR products were digested with BamHI/XhoI and cloned into pPac, as described above. To generate the mammalian expression pcDNA3-USF1 construct, the USF1 cDNA from HepG2 cells was amplified with forward (5′-ggatcccacagagagatgaaggggcagcagaaaacagct-3′) and reverse (USF1taa) primers and the amplicon inserted into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Full-length pPacUSF2a and its N-terminal deletion constructs were generated by PCR using the mammalian (CMV) expression construct as template and USF2tga as downstream primer (5′-tttaagctttcactgccgggtgccctcgcc-3′, the HindIII site is underlined) and the following forward primers (the XhoI site in each oligonucleotide is underlined): USF2a, 5′-ttactcgagatggacatgctggacccg-3′ (designated USF2atg); Δ1–36, 5′-ttactcgaggaaggcggggacggcccagga-3′; Δ1–76, 5′-ttactcgaggtgacataccgcgtagtccaggtg-3′; Δ1–143, ttactcgaggctgtgatccaaaatcccttca-3′; Δ1–193, 5′-ttactcgagggccagttctacgtcatgatga-3′; and Δ1–223, 5′-ttactcgagaaaattgatggaaccagaacaccc-3′. The pPacUSF2Δ1–36 & 76–143 construct was generated by PCR with the Δ1–36 forward primer and USF2tga reverse primer, and pPacUSF2b (Δ76–143) as a template. The amplicons were digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into pPac at the XhoI/HindIII site. Overlap-extension PCR was used to create the USF2a internal deletions. Separate amplifications were performed with the internal forward and reverse deletion primers (Δ143–193, forward 5′-cccttcggccagttctacgtcatg-3′ and reverse 5′-gaactggccgaagggcgctgcaggacc-3′; Δ193–223, forward 5′-tttgtgatggatgagaaacgcagggctcagcat-3′ and reverse 5′-tttctcatccatcacaaagaattgaccagtgcc-3′; Δ223–242, forward 5′-ccttactctgtggagcggaggcggagg-3′ and reverse 5′-ccgctccacagagtaagggtgtgtccg-3′) and USF2tga and USF2atg, respectively. The products were mixed, and a second PCR was performed using the USF2atg and USF2tga primers. The amplicons were cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites in pPac. All constructs were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfections of dCK-luciferase reporter gene constructs (in pGL3-Basic) into HepG2 cells and reporter gene assays were performed as previously reported (21.Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. D. Mel-2 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the dCK-luciferase reporter gene constructs and Sp1 (10–500 ng of pPacSp1) or Sp3 (25 ng of pPacUSp3 and pPacSp3, for the long and short isoforms, respectively), and/or USF1 (100–500 ng of pPacUSF1) or USF2a (100–500 ng of pPacUSF2a), using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were harvested after 24 h for luciferase assays using the Single Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to total cell protein, measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay system. The expression levels of Sp1, USF1, and USF2a (including mutant forms) in D. Mel-2 cells were monitored by Western blotting (see below). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electromobility Shift Assays— Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells or D. Mel-2 transfectants were prepared by standard methods (24.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Electromobility shift assays with HepG2 and D. Mel-2 nuclear extracts were performed as previously described (21.Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, reaction mixtures were pretreated for 30 min with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Sp1 (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc.) and USF-1 and USF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed in HepG2 cells as previously described (39.Ge Y. Jensen T.L. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with Sp1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, active motif), USF-1, or USF2 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Standard PCR for the dCK promoter region was performed with forward (dCK/F2) and reverse (dCK/R2) primers spanning positions –464 to +75. An unrelated human gene (reduced folate carrier coding exon 1) was also amplified with forward (5′-cagtgtcaccttcgtcccctccg-3′, KS43/P8) and reverse (5′-gggtgatgaagctctcccctgg-3′, RFCPoly1) primers to validate the specificity of the ChIP assays. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts (300 μg) from D. Mel-2 cells, co-transfected with pPacSp1 and pPacUSF1, or pPacSp1 and pPacUSF2a, were diluted to 1 μg/μl with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstain A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride)). Samples were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, then treated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of rabbit USF1 or USF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit IgG, followed by incubation with 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm) and washed (four times) with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The eluates were electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were developed with Sp1 (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc.), USF1 or USF2 antibodies (in TTBS containing 0.5% fat-free dried milk powder) and Lumi-Light Western blotting Substrate (Roche Applied Science), and exposed to x-ray film. Localization of the Major cis-Elements in the dCK Promoter by 5′-Deletion and Mutation Analysis—A previous report demonstrated that two GC-boxes (positions –317 to –309 and –213 to –206; designated GCa and GCb, respectively) and one E-box (positions –302 to –297; designated E-box (a)) (Fig. 1) are important for dCK promoter activity in human lymphoblast cell lines (12.Chen E.H. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further investigate the interrelationships between these elements and their bound transcription factors, a 539-bp upstream fragment of the dCK gene was amplified from HL-60 genomic DNA (including 464 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and 75 bp of the first coding exon) and subcloned into pGL3-basic to generate pdCK-464/+75 (Fig. 1). Alignment of our dCK promoter sequence to the previously published sequence (12.Chen E.H. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed variations at three positions (not shown). However, no difference was observed between our dCK promoter sequence and the human genome sequence (GenBank™ accession AC093851). In addition to GCa and GCb-boxes and the E-box (a) elements, data base analysis revealed a previously unrecognized E-box (positions –278 to –273, designated E-box (b)) (Fig. 1). Transient transfections of pdCK-464/+75 into HepG2 cells resulted in high levels of promoter activity (Fig. 2). Deletion of 105 bp from the 5′-end of dCK-464/+75 (i.e. dCK-359/+75) slightly decreased activity (∼25%) (Fig. 2). Further deletion of 61 bp (i.e. pdCK-298/+75), including the GCa and the E-box (a) elements, resulted in a significant loss of promoter activity, to ∼15% of the level for the full-length construct. This decreased to 8% upon removal of an additional 113 bp of 5′ sequence (pdCK-179/+75), including GCb and E-box (b) (Fig. 2). Deletion of the E2F half site (pdCK-27/+75) did not result in any further change in promoter activity. Similar to results with lymphoid cells, site-directed mutagenesis of either the GCa and E-box (a) elements in pdCK-464/+75 was notably inhibitory in reporter gene assays (decreases of 33 and 45%, respectively, relative to the wild type construct). However, the effect of mutating both the GCa and E-box (a) elements was essentially the same as those for the individual mutants. Mutation of E-box (b) resulted in ∼20% decrease of dCK promoter activity. Mutation of GCb resulted in increased luciferase activity (∼17%) over the wild type pdCK-464/+75 construct, albeit less than reported for lymphoblast cells (12.Chen E.H. Johnson 2nd, E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The double GCa/GCb and E-box (a)/GCb mutants were also slightly activating. Interestingly, double mutation of the two E-boxes resulted in additive loss of dCK promoter activity (to 35% of the wild type). The double GCa/E-box (b) and E-box (b)/GCb mutants were slightly repressive (30 and 15% decrease, respectively). Collectively, these results implicate a 61-bp stretch beginning 298 bp upstream of the translation start and including the GCa and E-box (a) elements as important to dCK promoter transactivation. Furthermore, they imply that the downstream GCb-box is repressive and that mutating this element can override the inhibitory effects resulting from mutation of either the GCa or the E-box elements. The failure of the double GCa/E-box (a) mutant to repress activity to an extent similar to the pdCK-298/+75 deletion construct may reflect (i) the presence of E-box (b) between the GCb and E-box (a) and/or (ii) the repressive effects of GCb on pdCK-298/+75 activity. In Vitro and in Vivo Binding of Transcription Factors Bound to the GC-box and E-box Elements in the dCK Promoter—Gel shifts were used to identify the major transcription factors that bound to the dCK promoter. When a labeled oligonucleotide (dCK-328/-289, positions: –328 to –289) containing both the GCa and the E-box (a) elements was incubated with nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells, five distinct DNA-protein complexes (labeled 1–5) were detected (Fig. 3A, lane 2), which were completely abolished by treatment with excess unlabeled dCK-328/-289 probe (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Competition and supershift results suggested a complex interplay between USF binding to E-box (a), and Sp proteins binding to the GCa element. Thus, unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide completely abolished complexes 1, 2, 3, and 5 (lane 4), whereas a USF1 competitive oligonucleotide completely eliminated complexes 1, 2, and 4 (lane 5). Complexes 1, 2, 3, and 5 were variably supershifted by Sp1 and/or Sp3 antibodies (lanes 6 and 7), whereas USF1 or USF2 antibodies supershifted complexes 1, 2, and 4 and significantly decreased complexes 3 and 5 (lanes 8 and 9). Finally, competition with dCK-328/-289 containing mutated GCa (GCa mt, lane 10) abolished the formation of complexes 1, 2, and 4, and addition of dCK-328/-289, including a mutated E-box (a) (E-box (a) mt, lane 11), eliminated complexes 1, 2, and 5 and significantly decreased the signal of complex 3. When a labeled oligonucleotide spanning the E-box (b) (dCK-291/-260, positions: –291 to –260) was incubated with HepG2 nuclear extracts, one major DNA-protein complex was detected, which was completely abolished by excess unlabeled dCK-291/-260 or a USF1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4). However, competition was ineffective with the dCK-291/-260 oligonucleotide, including a mutated E-box (b) (E-box (b) mt, lane 7). Addition of USF1 or USF2 antibodies super-shifted the DNA-protein complex (lanes 5 and 6), confirming that this contains both USF1 and USF2 proteins. Gel shifts were also performed using HepG2 nuclear extracts and a labeled oligonucleotide spanning the GCb box (dCK-223/-181, positions: –223 to –181). Two DNA-protein complexes (complexes 1 and 2) were readily detected (Fig. 3C, lane 2) and were effectively competed by either excess unlabeled dCK-223/-181 or a Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 4). However, competition was ineffective if a dCK-223/-181 oligonucleotide was used in which the GCb element was mutated (GCb mt) (lane 7). Addition of Sp1 or Sp3 antibody supershifted both complexes (lanes 5 and 6), thus confirming the competition results and establishing that both Sp1 and Sp3 were bound to the GCb element. In vivo binding of the transcription factors to the dCK promoter in HepG2 chromatin extracts was confirmed by the ChIP assays (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate binding of the Sp and USF families of proteins to the critical GC and E-box elements in the dCK promoter. Co-transfections of Sp1 and USF1/USF2a in HepG2 Cells—To determine the functional significance of Sp1/3 and USF1/2 binding to the dCK promoter, transient co-transfections were performed in HepG2 cells using the pdCK-464/+75 reporter construct with Sp1, USF1, or USF2a expression constructs. Sp1 alone effected a 36% decrease of dCK promoter activity (Fig. 4). Overexpression of USF1 or USF2a, in the absence of Sp1, resulted in a potent stimulation of luciferase activity (12- and 9-fold, respectively). When USF1 or USF2a was co-expressed with Sp1, the maximal transactivation response compared with USF1 or USF2a, alone, was decreased by ∼25%. These results document an apparent repressor role for Sp1 binding, consistent with the findings of our mutagenesis experiments with the GCb element (Fig. 2). Moreover, they support a functional interaction"

Human CPT1A deficiency is characterized by recurrent attacks of hypoketotic hypoglycemia. We presently analyzed at both the functional and structural levels five missense mutations identified in three CPT1A-deficient patients, namely A275T, A414V, Y498C, G709E, and G710E. Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae permitted to validate them as disease-causing mutations. To gain further insights into their deleterious effects, we localized these mutated residues into a three-dimensional structure model of the human CPT1A created from the crystal structure of the mouse carnitine acetyltransferase. This study demonstrated for the first time that disease-causing CPT1A mutations can be divided into two categories depending on whether they affect directly (functional determinant) or indirectly the active site of the enzyme (structural determinant). Mutations A275T, A414V, and Y498C, which exhibit decreased catalytic efficiency, clearly belong to the second class. They are located more than 20 Å away from the active site and mostly affect the stability of the protein itself and/or of the enzyme-substrate complex. By contrast, mutations G709E and G710E, which abolish CPT1A activity, belong to the first category. They affect Gly residues that are essential not only for the structure of the hydrophobic core in the catalytic site, but also for the chain-length specificity of CPT isoforms.

Mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids is a major source of energy production, especially during fasting, illness, or sustained exercise. Contrary to medium- and short-chain fatty acids that can cross the mitochondrial membranes by simple diffusion, long-chain fatty acids are imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT, 1The abbreviations used are: CPTcarnitine palmitoyltransferaseCPT1Aliver isoform of human CPT1CATcarnitine acetyltransferaseTMtransmembranemtmutant.1The abbreviations used are: CPTcarnitine palmitoyltransferaseCPT1Aliver isoform of human CPT1CATcarnitine acetyltransferaseTMtransmembranemtmutant.

The first component of this system is CPT1, an integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein, which catalyzes the transfer of long-chain acyl group of the acyl-CoA ester to carnitine. CPT1 is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis. This provides a mechanism for physiological regulation of β-oxidation in all mammalian tissues and for cellular fuel sensing based on the availability of fatty acids and glucose (1.McGarry J.D.

CPT1A is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane by two transmembrane segments (TM1 and -2), its N terminus (residues 1–47) and C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 123–773) being located on the cytosolic face of mitochondria (11.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (1–147 residues) was shown to be essential for mitochondrial import and for maintenance of a folded active and malonyl-CoA-sensitive conformation (12.Cohen I. Kohl C.

Solubilized fibroblasts (100 μg of protein) from control (lane 1), patient 1 carrying the heterozygous A275T, A414V, and Y498C mutations (lane 2), patient 2 carrying the heterozygous G709E and R316fsX328 mutations (lane 3), and a previously described patient carrying the homozygous G710E mutation (lane 4) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotting using rat CPT1A and human β-actin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wild-type and CPT1A Mutants Expression in S. cerevisiae— The functional analysis of mutations A275T, A414V, Y498C, and G709E was performed using heterologous expression in yeast S. cerevisiae, an eukaryotic organism devoid of endogenous CPT1 activity (34.Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was previously used for the functional analysis of the mutation G710E (26.Prip-Buus C. Thuillier L. Abadi N. Prasad C. Dilling L. Klasing J. Demaugre F. Greenberg C.R. Haworth J.C. Droin V. Kadhom N. Gobin S. Kamoun P. Girard J. Bonnefont J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation experiments did not reveal any change in the mitochondrial targeting of the yeast-expressed wild-type and CPT1A mutants (results not shown). CPT1A immunodetection using variable amounts of mitochondria isolated from the different yeast strains show that proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized with different levels of expression (Fig. 3). Wild-type and mutants A275T and G709E were expressed at a similar steady-state level. By contrast, mutant Y498C exhibited a 2-fold lower protein level in comparison to wild-type, indicating that this mutation led to a slight protein instability. For mutants A414V and A275T-A414V, the level of protein expression was 20–30-fold lower than wild-type, indicating that the A414V substitution alone or in combination with A275T conferred a dramatic protein instability. Despite the fact that some of these mutations affect CPT1A protein stability, enough expressed proteins was recovered in yeast mitochondria, in contrast to what was observed in fibroblasts (Fig. 2), to perform the functional analysis of these substitutions. Enzyme Activity, Malonyl-CoA Inhibition, and Kinetic Properties of CPT1A Mutants—As shown in Table I, mutants A275T, Y498C, A414V, and A275T-A414V exhibited malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPT activity that was respectively 74, 46, 6, and 2% of that observed for the wild-type. For mutants Y498C, A414V, and A275T-A414V this decrease in CPT1 activity may partly result from the lower level of expressed protein (Fig. 3). As previously reported for mutant G710E (26.Prip-Buus C. Thuillier L. Abadi N. Prasad C. Dilling L. Klasing J. Demaugre F. Greenberg C.R. Haworth J.C. Droin V. Kadhom N. Gobin S. Kamoun P. Girard J. Bonnefont J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), mutant G709E was totally inactive whatever the concentration of substrate employed (Table I, Fig. 4, B and D) despite similar level of CPT1A protein expression when compared with wild-type (Fig. 3). Mutations A275T and Y498C did not alter malonyl-CoA sensitivity, their IC50 value for malonyl-CoA being similar to that of the wild-type (Table I). Due to the low residual activity in mutants A414V and A275T-A414V, it was not possible to assess their malonyl-CoA sensitivity. All mutants, except mutant G709E, exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration varied relative to a fixed concentration of palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 4, A and B) or when palmitoyl-CoA concentration varied when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA/albumin was fixed at 6.1:1 (Fig. 4, C and D). Mutation A275T was previously characterized in COS cells as a functionally neutral polymorphism (25.Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, analysis of its saturation kinetics, which was not performed in the study of Brown et al. (25.Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicated that this mutation decreased by 25% to 43% the Vmax and catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA with no alteration in the apparent Km for both substrates (Table I). In comparison to wild-type, mutant Y498C had a similar apparent Km for palmitoyl-CoA but a 2-fold decrease in its apparent Km for carnitine, indicating a slight increased affinity of the enzyme to this substrate. Moreover, mutant Y498C showed a 3-fold decrease in its Vmax and catalytic efficiencies for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA when compared with wild-type. Mutants A414V and A275T-A414V presented no alteration in the apparent Km for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, but at least a 98% decrease in their Vmax and catalytic efficiency whatever the substrate used (Table I). Thus, mutations A275T, Y498C, A414V, and A275T-A414V altered the Vmax and the catalytic efficiency more than the Km for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, whereas mutation G709E totally inactivated the enzyme.Table IEnzyme activity, malonyl-CoA inhibition and kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutants CPT1A expressed in S. cerevisiaeStrainActivityMalonyl-CoACarnitinePalmitoyl-CoACatalytic efficiency-Malonyl-CoA+Malonyl-CoAIC50KmVmaxKmVmaxCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAnmol/min/mgμmμmnmol/min/mgμmnmol/min/mgVmax/KmVmax/KmWild-type6.5 ± 0.60.8 ± 0.081.83 ± 0.4106.5 ± 8.4147.8 ± 10.582.8 ± 9.488.6 ± 10.21.4 (100%)1.07 (100%)A275T4.8 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.081.70 ± 0.32107.4 ± 16.887.0 ± 10.575.5 ± 8.361.1 ± 13.20.8 (60%)0.8 (76%)A414V0.4 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.03ND78.0 ± 8.01.6 ± 0.154.2 ± 4.21.1 ± 0.10.02 (1.5%)0.02 (1.9%)A275T-A414V0.13 ± 0.040.04 ± 0.02ND96.7 ± 2.90.6 ± 0.155.5 ± 3.50.4 ± 0.10.006 (0.5%)0.007 (0.7%)Y498C3.0 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.011.53 ± 0.0661.3 ± 6.829.2 ± 1.366.3 ± 9.525.9 ± 5.60.5 (34%)0.4 (37%)G709EUndetectableUndetectableNDNDNDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab Assessment of the Folding State of CPT1A Mutants—Previous works (14.Cohen I.

When the outer mitochondrial membrane is disrupted, such as during the swelling procedure, trypsin is able to cleave the loop connecting TM1 and -2, hence generating an 82-kDa fragment. Moreover, the catalytic C-terminal domain of the rat CPT1A has been shown to contain a highly trypsin-resistant 60-kDa folded core that could be observed when solubilized mitochondria were submitted to trypsin proteolysis (14.Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the human wild-type CPT1A protein also remained largely resistant to trypsin treatment in intact mitochondria. The integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane was checked by the inaccessibility of cytochrome b2 to trypsin proteolysis (Fig. 5A). Mutants A275T and G710E, as well as mutants A414V and A275T-A414V (results not shown), exhibited the same protease resistance as the wild-type protein, whereas mutants Y498C and G709E were sensitive to trypsin proteolysis (Fig. 5A). When yeast mitochondria containing either the wild-type or the mutants A275T and G710E were solubilized by Triton X-100 in the presence of trypsin, both the 82- and 60-kDa fragments were detected (Fig. 5B, f1 and f2 fragments). These results strengthened the fact that the human CPT1A protein also contained within its catalytic C-terminal domain a highly folded trypsin-resistant core that was not affected by mutations A275T and G710E. By contrast, the generation of the f1 and f2 fragments was either less efficient or totally absent in the case of mutants Y498C and G709E (Fig. 5B), suggesting a partial unfolding of their C-terminal domain. The endogenous matrix soluble HSP70 protein (mtHSP70) was used as a positive control for trypsin proteolysis as its conformational states can be assessed by limited trypsin proteolysis (35.Fung K.L.

Localization of Mutations in a Structure Model of Human CPT1A—To understand the possible molecular mechanism for the effects of these mutations on the catalytic activity and the conformation of the enzyme, we examined their locations in a structure model of human CPT1A. The model was created with the program MODELLER (36.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which shares 32% amino acid sequence identity with that of human CPT1A. Only residues 166–773 of human CPT1A have been used to built the structure model (Fig. 6A), as the first 160 residues of CPT1A do not have counterparts in CAT. This analysis indicates that residues Ala-275, Ala-414, Gly-709, and Gly-710 are in the core of the human CPT1A protein, whereas residue Tyr-498 is located in a surface loop which contains an inserted segment as compared with mouse CAT (Figs. 6A and 7).Fig. 7Sequence alignment of regions arrounding the human mutated CPT1A residues of various acyltransferases.

The α subunit Kap60p binds to the NLS of cargo molecules in the cytoplasm, forming stable complexes that must ultimately dissociate in the nucleoplasm. Although Kap60p can release NLSs on its own using an autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) motif that can occupy the NLS binding site, that mechanism is too slow to support rapid nuclear import. We previously showed that the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup2p and the exportin complex Cse1p·Gsp1p·GTP function as karyopherin release factors (KaRFs) because they can accelerate the rate of dissociation of NLSs from Kap60p. Here we dissect the molecular mechanics of their KaRF activity. We show that Cse1p accelerates dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes and Kap60p·Nup2p complexes by increasing the affinity of Kap60p for its AIS motif. In contrast, Nup2p uses a conserved sequence motif (VMXXRKIA) coupled to an AIS-like motif to accelerate dissociation of Kap60p·NLS complexes in a vectorial reaction mechanism. Mutation of either motif in Nup2p leads to a loss of KaRF activity and to the accumulation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes in the nucleoplasm of yeast. We discuss a model whereby Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p cooperate to establish directionality in the movement of Kap60p and NLS-cargos across the nuclear pore complex.

Proteins that need to be imported into nuclei (cargos) contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are recognized by mobile receptors termed karyopherins (importins/transportin). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the karyopherin αβ heterodimer Kap60p·Kap95p is responsible for import of proteins bearing a cNLS (6Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Kap60p subunit (karyopherin α; Srp1p) binds simultaneously to the NLS-cargo and to the Kap95p subunit (karyopherin β), whereas Kap95p facilitates transport of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes across the NPC by interacting with nuclear pore complex proteins (nucleoporins; Nups) (7Rexach M.

A subset of Nups and the Gsp1p GTPase contribute to the efficiency and directionality of Kap95p and Kap60p translocation across the NPC.

In nuclear import, Gsp1p·GTP binds to Kap95p (7Rexach M. Blobel G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In nuclear export, Gsp1p·GTP binds to the exportin Cse1p and enhances its affinity for Kap60p (its cargo) as the first step in Kap60p export out of the nucleus (16Solsbacher J. Maurer P.

Karyopherins bind cargos with high affinity to ensure the integrity of Kap·cargo complexes during transit through the NPC (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol.

Consequently, these interactions may have half-lives of several minutes, as in the case of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, karyopherins need to release cargos rapidly upon completion of translocation to ensure efficient nuclear import. In the case of most importins, binding of Gsp1p·GTP disrupts their association with cargos as the terminal step of transport (13Weis K.

However, in the case of Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS complexes, Gsp1p·GTP only accelerates the rate of dissociation of Kap60p·NLS from Kap95p, leaving the Kap60p·NLS complex intact (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An essential autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) motif in the importin β binding (IBB) domain of Kap60p (aa 1-61) can occupy the NLS binding pocket of Kap60p and has therefore been proposed to play a key role in the dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes (22Harreman M.T.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Nup2p and Cse1p function as karyopherin release factors (KaRFs) that accelerate the dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the case of Cse1p, its KaRF activity was strictly dependent on forming a complex with Gsp1p·GTP. Here, we define the molecular basis of Nup2p and Cse1p KaRF activities and explore their relationship to the Kap60p AIS motif. Preparation and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Genes encoding the proteins or protein fragments used were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using Taq or Pfu-driven polymerase chain reactions with designed oligonucleotides that incorporate restriction enzyme sites compatible for ligation into pGEX-2TK in frame with the 3′ end of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). Construction of Kap60p, Kap95p, Cse1p, Gsp1p, Nup2p, and NLS-cargo as GST fusions has been described previously (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Kap60ΔIBB construct lacks aa 1-61. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strains BLR or BL21 Codon Plus (Novagen) and were purified on glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In each case, a bacterial cell extract prepared from 1000 A600 units of cells was incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-coated Sepharose beads in batch for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the column, GST proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20 plus 15 mm reduced glutathione), and proteins were concentrated in a Centricon 30 unit (Amicon). Concentrated proteins were aliquoted in 1-mg portions, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. To remove GST, thawed GST fusions were treated with thrombin (Calbiochem) at room temperature for specific times. After adding hirudin (Calbiochem) to neutralize thrombin, the samples were applied separately to fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex 200 or Superose 6 sizing columns (Amersham Biosciences), which were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 2 mm DTT. Peak fractions containing the purified karyopherin, nucleoporin, or NLS-cargo were pooled, Tween 20 was added to 0.1%, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. His-tagged Gsp1p was purified and charged with GTP as described previously (25Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Point mutations in Nup2p and Kap60p were incorporated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Peptides containing the sequences GGGVMANRKIARMRHSKR (Nup1p aa 1059-1076) and CTPPKKKRKVEDP (SV40 T-antigen NLS) were obtained by chemical synthesis. Solution Binding Assay—All assays were performed using recombinant proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Tween 20). For each experiment, the GST-Nup, GST-Kap, or GST-NLS-cargo was incubated in batch with glutathione-Sepharose beads (1-2 μg of GST fusion per 10 μl of packed beads) (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of binding buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 s and were washed six times by resuspension in 0.5 ml of binding buffer and sedimentation as before. Two washes were done at room temperature and contained 100 μm ATP to remove any E. coli heat shock proteins that bound to the GST chimera. Washed collected beads were resuspended in a 50% slurry, and the bead slurry was aliquoted in 20-μl portions into siliconized 0.5-ml microtubes (Sigma) that contained protein additions, for a total volume of 40 μl. Tubes were then tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. At the end of incubations, beads were sedimented at 2,000 × g for 30 s, and unbound proteins in the supernatant fractions were collected by removing 30 μl from the meniscus; this constitutes the unbound fraction. Beads were washed twice and were resuspended with 30 μl of buffer. All samples were finally processed by adding 10 or 12 μl of 6× sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol to unbound and bound fractions, respectively. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and proteins in one-half of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular Dissociation Assay and KaRF Assay—Dissociation rates were assayed using purified radiolabeled proteins in a GST-based solution binding assay as described previously (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Nup2p and GST-NLS-cargo were immobilized separately on beads and incubated for 2 h with radiolabeled Kap60p at room temperature or 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 12 μl of the bead mix was then diluted 100 times into 1.2 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2,1mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing excess unlabeled Kap60p as competitor. In a KaRF assay, an unlabeled effector protein was added instead of the competitor. Beginning 10 s after dilution, beads were flash-collected on filters using a vacuum manifold. Bound radiolabeled Kap60p was eluted from filters with 1% SDS and quantified by scintillation counting. Single-exponential dissociation curves were fit to the data using GraphPad Prism™ software (Biosoft). Half-lives of complexes (t) were calculated using the equation t = ln2/koff. Quantitative Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeasts expressing Kap60p fused to the C terminus of the Gal4p DNA binding domain (Kap60pDBD) and the SV40 T-antigen NLS fused to the Gal4p activation domain (NLSAD) were grown to midlog phase in selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed once with 1 ml of H2O, and frozen at -70 °C. Cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in 60 μl of breaking buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed by vortexing with glass beads for five 1-min intervals with 1-min rest periods between intervals. Extracts were spun at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay. Liquid β-galactosidase assays contained 90 μl of Z-buffer (Na2HPO4·7H2O (16.1 mg/ml), NaH2PO4·H2O (5.5 mg/ml), KCl (0.75 mg/ml), MgSO4·7H2O (0.246 mg/ml)) and 20 μl of supernatant and were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 4 mg/ml ONPG (Sigma) in Z-buffer. Hydrolysis of ONPG by β-galactosidase was monitored at room temperature for 90 min by measuring ΔA415 in a Bio-Rad 96-well spectrophotometer. The rate of ΔA415 for each supernatant was normalized to the protein concentration, and data sets were compared with the largest rate obtained, which was assigned a value of 100% for convenience. Assays were performed in triplicate, and graphs are representative of at least two independent experiments. Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast expressing Kap60p-GFP were grown to midlog phase at 30 °C in selective media with 2% glucose. 2 μl of culture was spotted on a slide, and yeasts were visualized immediately with a Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Images were captured and adjusted using QED Imaging software and Photoshop 4.0. Nuclear import assays were performed as described in Ref. 26Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. Briefly, yeasts carrying the plasmid pCu413 cNLS-YFP (encoding YFP with the cNLS of large T-antigen under a copper-inducible promoter) were grown at 30 °Cto A600 = 1.0 in synthetic growth medium. Cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.4 into medium with or without 100 μm CuSO4 and grown for 2 h. Yeasts were then sedimented, washed once with 1 ml of water, and resuspended in 1 ml of medium containing 20 mm sodium azide and 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose. Following incubation for 1 h at 4 °C yeast were sedimented and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold medium containing 2% dextrose. Import assays were initiated by placing 2 μl of cells onto room temperature microscope slides, and in five 2-min intervals cells were categorized as either displaying nuclear cNLS-YFP accumulation or diffuse cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic fluorescence. Nup2p immunofluorescence was performed as described in Ref. 26Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. After growth in synthetic medium cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were sedimented and resuspended in 100 mm KH2PO4, followed by digestion with 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase for 15 min at room temperature. Spheroplasts were adhered to polylysine-coated slides and postfixed for 6 min in ice-cold methanol and 30 s in ice-cold acetone. Nup2p was detected using affinity-purified anti-Nup2p antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. We previously showed that Nup2p and Cse1p function as KaRFs (karyopherin release factors) to accelerate the dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We proposed that their reaction mechanisms proceed through a transient KaRF intermediate where Nup2p or Cse1p·Gsp1p·GTP bind to Kap60p and trigger an allosteric change in its structure that accelerates dissociation of the NLS-cargo. A diagram of these KaRF reaction mechanisms is shown in Fig. 1A (models i and iii). As a starting point in defining the molecular basis of Nup2p and Cse1p KaRF activity, we used a KaRF assay to test if the Kap60p AIS motif in the IBB domain is required by Nup2p or Cse1p·Gsp1p·GTP to accelerate release of Kap60p from NLS-cargo. In a sample KaRF assay (diagramed in Fig. 1B), the dissociation of radiolabeled Kap60p from NLS-cargo is monitored in the absence (line 1) or presence (line 2) of excess unlabeled Kap60p (control) or in the presence of a possible effector/KaRF (such as Nup2p or the Cse1p·Gsp1p·GTP complex) (line 3). The unlabeled Kap60p serves to prevent rebinding of radiolabeled Kap60p to the NLS-cargo-coated beads during their dissociation reaction, allowing accurate determination of their dissociation rate (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If the effector is active as a KaRF (line 3), then the dissociation rate of the Kap60p·NLS-cargo complex is accelerated beyond its intrinsic rate. In all of the KaRF assays shown below, the 5-min data point of control dissociation curves (circled in Fig. 1B, line 2) was normalized to a 0% value, and the dissociation of all radiolabeled Kap60p (circled in Fig. 1B, line 3) was assigned a 100% value. These values are plotted in a histogram format as a qualitative measure of the KaRF activity of possible effectors. In all cases where Gsp1p was used, it was preloaded with GTP; for convenience, however, Gsp1p·GTP is simply referred to as Gsp1p throughout. To test whether Nup2p and Cse1p·Gsp1p can accelerate release of an NLS-cargo from a Kap60p mutant lacking the IBB domain (Kap60pΔIBB; Δaa 1-61) or from a Kap60p point mutant lacking autoinhibitory function (Kap60p K54A) (23Harreman M.T. Cohen P.E. Hodel M.R. Truscott G.J. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21361-21369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we first had to measure the intrinsic rate of dissociation of these mutant Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes (Fig. 2, A and B). Radiolabeled Kap60pΔIBB and Kap60p K54A were incubated separately with NLS-cargo-coated beads and allowed to form complexes for 2 h at room temperature. Incubations were then flash-diluted 100-fold into buffer containing excess Kap60pΔIBB (Fig. 2A) or Kap60p K54A (Fig. 2B) as unlabeled competitors. At time points after dilution, beads in aliquots were flash-collected in a manifold filter, and the amount of radiolabeled Kap60p remaining in beads was determined by liquid scintillation. For reference, wild type Kap60p binds the NLS-cargo (the NLS of Cbp80p fused to the maltose-binding protein) with an affinity of KD = 2.8 nm, and a dissociation rate constant of koff = 1.8 × 10-3 s-1 (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that Kap60pΔIBB and Kap60p K54A dissociate more slowly from the NLS-cargo, with dissociation rate constants of koff = 1.3 × 10-4 s-1 and koff = 2.4 × 10-4 s-1, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that the AIS motif in the Kap60p IBB domain enhances the dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p by up to 13-fold. This enhancement is significant but is lower than the enhanced rate of dissociation when Nup2p or Cse1p·Gsp1p is present (koff ≥ 3.9 × 10-2 s-1 and koff ≥ 6.9 × 10-2 s-1, respectively) (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected from previous measurements, Cse1p·Gsp1p and Nup2p were capable of releasing all bound radiolabeled Kap60p from NLS-cargo within 5 min in a KaRF assay (Fig. 2C, black bars). In contrast, Cse1p·Gsp1p was ineffective in accelerating the dissociation of Kap60pΔIBB or Kap60p K54A from NLS-cargo (Fig. 2C, gray bars), despite being able to bind Kap60pΔIBB and Kap60p K54A as well as wild type Kap60p (data not shown) (22Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Combined, these results suggest that the AIS motif within the IBB domain of Kap60p is utilized by the Cse1p·Gsp1p KaRF reaction mechanism. In stark contrast, Nup2p was able to accelerate the dissociation of Kap60pΔIBB and Kap60p K54A from NLS-cargo (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that Nup2p does not need the Kap60p AIS motif or the IBB domain as part of its KaRF reaction mechanism. Stabilization of a Transient KaRF Intermediate (the NLS-cargo·Kap60p·Cse1p·Gsp1p Complex)—The accelerated release of NLS-cargo from Kap60p by Cse1p·Gsp1p was predicted to proceed through a transient tetrameric intermediate, where Kap60p binds simultaneously to NLS-cargo and Cse1p·Gsp1p (Fig. 1A, model iii) (15Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This intermediate was not detected previously, presumably because Kap60p releases the NLS-cargo very rapidly upon binding Cse1p·Gsp1p. However, if the release of the NLS-cargo was impeded by a defect in Cse1p KaRF mechanism, a tetrameric intermediate complex might be stabilized. Indeed, removal of the Kap60p IBB domain allowed detection of this intermediate in a solution binding assay (Fig. 2D). Beads coated with NLS-cargo were incubated with Kap60p or Kap60pΔIBB for 30 min, washed once, and incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of Cse1p·Gsp1p. In the absence of Cse1p·Gsp1p, most of the Kap60p was recovered bound to the immobilized NLS-cargo (lanes 2 and 3), and in the presence of Cse1p·Gsp1p, nearly all Kap60p was recovered in the unbound fraction (lane 4). In contrast, Kap60pΔIBB remained bound to the NLS-cargo in the presence of Cse1p·Gsp1p (lanes 5-7), and a portion of the Cse1p·Gsp1p added was recovered in the bound fraction in a stable complex with NLS-cargo and Kap60pΔIBB (lane 7). As expected, Cse1p·Gsp1p did not bind directly to immobilized NLS-cargo (lane 8). These data suggest that Cse1p·Gsp1p binds to the Kap60pΔIBB·NLS-cargo complex in a stalled KaRF intermediate, as depicted in Fig. 1A (model iii). Cse1p·Gsp1p Enhances the Affinity of Kap60p for Its IBB Domain—How does Cse1p·Gsp1p employ the Kap60p IBB domain to accelerate the release of NLS-cargo from Kap60p? In one scenario, Cse1p·Gsp1p might trigger an allosteric change in Kap60p structure that reduces its affinity toward the NLS-cargo, allowing the IBB domain to compete more effectively for the NLS-binding site. That scenario is unlikely, since Cse1p·Gsp1p cannot accelerate dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60pΔIBB (Fig. 2C). In a second scenario, Cse1p·Gsp1p might accelerate release of an NLS from Kap60p by increasing the affinity of Kap60p toward the AIS motif in its IBB domain. To test this, we examined the effect of Cse1p·Gsp1p on Kap60p binding to an isolated IBB domain in a solution binding assay (Fig. 2E). The IBB domain of Kap60p was immobilized on beads as a GST fusion (GST-IBB) and was incubated with Kap60p or Kap60pΔIBB in the presence or absence of Cse1p·Gsp1p for 1 h at 4 °C. Neither Kap60p nor Kap60pΔIBB bound to the isolated IBB domain (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that Kap60p is normally in a conformation that exhibits low affinity toward the IBB domain. However, in the presence of Cse1p·Gsp1p, Kap60pΔIBB bound stably to the immobilized IBB domain and formed a complex with Cse1p·Gsp1p (lane 5). In contrast, Cse1p·Gsp1p did not promote binding of full-length Kap60p to the immobilized IBB domain (lane 3), suggesting that wild type Kap60p binds its IBB domain in cis more effectively than in trans. In a similar experiment, Nup2p did not stimulate binding of Kap60p or Kap60pΔIBB to the immobilized IBB domain (data not shown). Altogether, the data suggest that Kap60p is normally in a conformation that binds weakly to its IBB domain, but Cse1p·Gsp1p binding can trigger an allosteric change in Kap60p structure that significantly enhances its affinity for the IBB domain. This allosteric conformation switch may be the molecular basis for Cse1p·Gsp1p KaRF activity (i.e. changing the Kap60p NLS-cargo binding pocket from a pro-NLS to a pro-IBB conformation). Cse1p Also Accelerates Dissociation of Kap60p from Nup2p via a KaRF Mechanism—It has been previously shown that Cse1p·Gsp1p antagonizes the interaction of Kap60p with Nup2p, and it was proposed that Nup2p serves as a platform for Cse1p-mediated export of Kap60p from the nucleus (10Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8468-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Hood J.K. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32360-32367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Cse1p·Gsp1p can also accelerate the rate of dissociation of Kap60p from Nup2p. To test this notion, we first had to measure the dissociation rate of radiolabeled Kap60p from immobilized Nup2p (Fig. 3A). At room temperature, this complex had a very short half-life (t ∼25 s; koff = 3 × 10-2 s-1) (data not shown) despite its high affinity (KD = 0.3 nm), making the analysis difficult. To solve that problem, we monitored the same reaction at low temperature, which slows down the dissociation rate. At 4 °C, the Kap60p·Nup2p interaction had a half-life of 4.5 min in the presence of excess unlabeled competitor Kap60p (koff = 2.5 × 10-3 s-1) (Fig. 3A). In comparison, the Kap60pΔIBB·Nup2p complex dissociated more slowly (data not shown). The dissociation of Kap60p and Kap60pΔIBB from Nup2p was monitored in a KaRF assay in the presence of Cse1p·Gsp1p or Nup2p as possible effectors (Fig. 3B). Cse1p·Gsp1p accelerated the dissociation of Kap60p but not Kap60pΔIBB from Nup2p (Fig. 3B), consistent with a KaRF mechanism whereby Cse1p·Gsp1p binds to Kap60p (in a Kap60p·Nup2p complex) and triggers an allosteric change in Kap60p structure that accelerates the release of Nup2p in an IBB-dependent mechanism (Fig. 1A, model ii).

Rhodopsin, located in the retina disc membrane of the eye, is responsible for the visualization of dim light. It is composed of the protein opsin (∼40 kDa) covalently linked to 11-cis-retinal through Lys296 of helix 7 (19.Ovchinnikow Y.U.A. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The chromophore 11-cis-retinal isomerizes upon light activation to its all-trans conformation, which changes the arrangement of the transmembrane helices (20.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K.

Transducin (GT) transduces the visual stimuli by coupling the light-induced conformational change of rhodopsin to the activation of a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP. This leads to the closure of cGMP-dependent channels in the plasma membrane of the rod outer segment. The resulting hyperpolarization of the membrane lowers the rate of transmitter release in the synaptic part of the photoreceptor cell, triggering downstream responses in bipolar cells of the retina. Knowledge of the structure of any of the receptors is crucial for the understanding of signal transduction. Rhodopsins have amino acid sequence and functional homology with other G-protein-coupled receptors and because the three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins are not readily available, computational modeling of GPCRs has been an active research area (25.Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 26.Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol.

A common structural feature of G-protein-coupled receptors is the presence of seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices. Conserved features in most G-protein-coupled receptors include sites of asparagine-linked glycosylation in the amino-terminal region (29.Hargrave P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), one or two palmitate-linked cysteines close to the carboxyl-terminal region (30.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S.

Cytol. 1992; 137: 49-97Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The seven transmembrane helices of rhodopsin were first observed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) in a projection structure of two-dimensional crystals from bovine rhodopsin (33.Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a low resolution view of the helices was obtained from cryo-EM studies on two-dimensional crystals of frog rhodopsin (34.Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In addition, information was obtained by NMR (35.Albert A.D. Watta A. Spooner P. Groebner G. Young J. Yaegle P.L Biochim.

Most detailed information we now gain from the crystal structure of rhodopsin, which was solved in 2000 (1.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C. Motoshima H. Fox B. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar), indicating that rhodopsin is a prototypical member of subfamily A of GPCRs. They represent about 90% of all GPCRs. Here we report an electron density map of bovine rhodopsin obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional rhodopsin crystals with p22121 symmetry. The usage of relatively small and not well ordered crystals made the process of structure determination challenging, although these crystals were better than the previous ones that were obtained from frog and bovine rhodopsin (43.Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P. Schertler G.F. X J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Special attention was paid to the extraction of amplitudes and phases, since usable raw data were limited to a maximum tilt of 45°. In addition, in the refinement process an improved unbending procedure was applied. Data could be reconstructed to a final resolution of 5.5 Å in the membrane plane. Most important, the position of the molecule relative to the bilayer could be determined because of the symmetry of the two-dimensional crystal. All seven transmembrane helices were traced unambiguously, and in the retinal binding pocket we find additional density pointing out the position of the β-ionine ring. In order to be able to compare our electron density with the atomic data available today, we modeled the atomic x-ray structure (1.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C. Motoshima H. Fox B. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) into our electron density map. Specimen Preparation and Electron Cryomicroscopy—Isolation, crystallization, imaging, and preliminary crystal quality assessment of untilted specimen are described in more detail elsewhere (43.Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P. Schertler G.F. X J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, rhodopsin was purified from bovine rod outer segments and solubilized in lauryldimethylamine oxide. The partially delipidated rhodopsin was dialyzed, and the resulting suspension was purified on a sucrose gradient. The crystal suspensions were put on carbon-coated electron microscopy grids and frozen in liquid ethane. All preparative work was carried out in dim red light. Images were taken at liquid nitrogen temperature using a 200-kV Hitachi field emission microscope. For the three-dimensional data set, electron micrographs were recorded with goniometer tilts ranging from 0 to 45°. Micrographs were recorded under standard low dose conditions using a spot scan procedure and a magnification of ×60,000. Image Processing and Data Analysis—Images were selected by judging the quality of either the optical or the computer-generated diffraction pattern. Untilted crystals were generally good out to 5- or 6-Å resolution (43.Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P. Schertler G.F. X J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Scanned areas (Zeiss SCAI densitometer) were processed with the MRC programs (44.Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This involved determination of lattice parameters, removing distortions, extraction of amplitudes and phases after boxing off the crystalline areas, correction for magnification, determination of tilt angles, determination of defocus and astigmatism, and then correction of the phases for the effects of the contrast transfer function. The corrected crystalline areas were combined using estimates of phase origins, defocus values, and crystal tilts. In the subsequent rounds, the crystal parameters (e.g. defocus values, phase origins, and crystal tilts) were refined to a stage where the individual phase residuals of the images compared with the whole data set did not improve any more. Averaged amplitudes were scaled against bacteriorhodopsin electron diffraction data. A least squares fit was applied to calculate lattice lines, which were truncated manually at points where the scatter of the observed phases approached random or where the observed amplitudes were too small. A preliminary three-dimensional map was used to calculate references to reunbend all images (e.g. distortions were removed according to the information given by these references) (program MAKETRAN (46.Kunji E.R.S. von Gronau S. Oesterhelt D. Henderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4637-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). Combination of all reunbent images and subsequent refinement of all crystal parameters led to improved three-dimensional data sets, which themselves were used to again reunbend all images. The quality of the data set was determined by analyzing the phase residuals of all images against the whole data set in resolution zones, calculating the overall average phase error, calculating the phase error between two independent halves of data, and calculating the R factor of the fitted lattice lines. Three cycles of unbending were applied, and in the final data set beam tilt was refined although this was only just significant. Phases to 4.6 Å were determined, but because of incompleteness of the data (42% below 5.3 Å) a resolution cut-off of 5.5 Å was chosen. The point spread function shows that the effective resolution perpendicular to the membrane plane is 12.4 Å (see inset in Fig. 2). Electron density maps were calculated using the CCP4 program suite (45.Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Density maps were calculated at different resolution cut-off values to ensure that the refinement procedure and sharpening of the map did not introduce spurious density and to verify that features discussed here are reproducible. This was also checked on earlier maps calculated with fewer cycles of refinement. Solvent flattening applied for one cycle using a solvent content of 75% in the CCP4 program. DM had little effect on the appearance of the map. The electron density maps were displayed with the programs O (47.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and VOLVIS (Research Foundation of the State University of New York). The fitting of ideal helices to the density map was performed in O (43.Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P. Schertler G.F. X J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the schematic drawings were made using Rasmol (Rasmol Molecular Renderer, Roger Sayle), and Bobscript (48.Merrit E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). The fitting of crystal data (1.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C. Motoshima H. Fox B. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) into our map was done by eye with helices 4, 6, and 7 serving as anchor points. In that process, only the fit of the seven transmembrane helices was optimized. In general, in electron density maps from two-dimensional crystals density on both sides of the membrane is weak, and therefore information on both sides of the membrane was cut out from the crystal data for the fitting. Image Processing and Data Merging—Dialysis of detergentsolubilized rhodopsin isolated from bovine rod outer segments resulted in the formation of rectangular two-dimensional crystals with p22121 symmetry. Lattice parameters were determined from untilted specimen to be 60.6 ± 0.8 and 86.3 ± 1.6 Å (43.Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P. Schertler G.F. X J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). From a large number of images, 97 crystalline areas were chosen and analyzed, and an improved iterative reunbending of all images was applied (46.Kunji E.R.S. von Gronau S. Oesterhelt D. Henderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4637-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There references generated from a “preliminary” merged structure were used to reunbend all images again. In Fig. 1, a comparison of phase residuals of the individual images is shown for images contained in the “preliminary” data set (open circles) and for images contained in the “final” data set (black circles). The “preliminary” data set consists of images, which were unbent in the conventional way (program MASKTRAN (44.Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar)). The “final” data set was obtained after three additional rounds of refinement, each round of refinement consisting of (a) creating references from the previous data set, (b) unbending all images, (c) extracting amplitudes and phases, (d) merging, and (e) refinement of crystal origin, crystal tilt, and defocus values against this new data set. In each round of refinement, steps c and d were performed as long as phase residuals improved. This was checked statistically (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the next step, the three-dimensional data set thus calculated was used as new reference for reunbending the images. The effects of this procedure on the phase error (calculated between two independent halves of data) are shown in Table I for the “preliminary” data set and for the subsequent rounds of reunbending.Table IOverall improvement of phases during the refinement procedureResolution rangePhase residuals for different refinement cycles1aEach refinement cycle consists of reunbending all images using a reference created from the previous data set.

Open table in a new tab Three-dimensional Density Map—The arrangement of the molecules in the bovine p22121 crystal is shown in Fig. 3. Because of the symmetry of the crystal, alternate molecules point up and down along a and b, as indicated with different frames in Fig. 3, a and b. However, because of the symmetry, they must overlap across the whole hydrophobic zone, thus determining the position of the rhodopsin molecules relative to the membrane bilayer. Fig. 3, a and b, shows slices through the density map, which are 12 Å apart, and the upper panel shows the center of the membrane bilayer. Helix contacts are indicated with asterisks. Information we gain from neighboring “upside down” molecules and molecules facing the same direction is shown in detail in c and d. The density of one rhodopsin molecule is shown in Fig. 4 in surface rendering. The molecule is seen from the side with helices 6 and 7 in the foreground and helix 4 in the background; the G-protein binding side is at the top. Helices are arranged clockwise when viewed from the intracellular side, and the contouring (∼1.7 σ) is chosen to emphasize the paths of the helices. Rhodopsin consists of three helices roughly perpendicular to the membrane plane (helices 4, 6, and 7) and four tilted helices (helices 1, 2, 3, and 5). All helices are curved or have kinks, and kinks in helices 5, 6, and 7 are most pronounced. The paths of the helices were traced by following the local density ridges using the “bones” algorithm of Greer (49.Greer J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, helix 5 was seen to extend to the intracellular membrane surface at a lower density level (see Fig. 4b). Slices through the density are shown (b–d), emphasizing the lower and higher resolution details. z = 0 refers to the center of the bilayer; and z = ±16 Å refers to the approximate limits of the hydrophobic zone of the membrane crystal. Positive z values extend toward the intracellular side of the molecule. From this zone, the different helices extend by different distances. An attempt was made to approximate the path of our helices with solid straight rods (Fig. 5). Therefore, the experimental density was fitted using ideal,"

PTH treatment greatly enhanced HyA staining throughout all layers of the periosteum, although its most dramatic effect occurred in the basal cambium layer.

PTH treatment enhanced the HyA staining of osteocytes in cortical bone tissue sections to the extent that the lacunocanalicular system became visualized. Three significant findings were revealed in this study. First, mature periosteal osteoblasts, under natural conditions, do not contain much HyA in their surrounding extracellular matrix but dramatically enhance their matrix HyA content when treated with PTH. Second, pre-osteocytes and osteocytes contain more HyA in their natural matrix than mature lining osteoblasts, and they appear to have functional PTH receptors because they responded to PTH treatment with an enhancement of HyA content. Finally, it was observed that the lining cells along the endosteal surface of the diaphysis did not stain strongly positive for HyA either naturally or when exposed to PTH treatment.

Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HyA has been detected in bone tissues by several investigators, and these studies suggest that the resident osteogenic cells produce HyA (25Noonan K.J. Stevens J.W. Tammi R. Tammi M. Hernandez J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13200-13206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Melick R.A. Mercuri S. Bingham P.J. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1977; 22: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still not known which types of cells in bone are the predominant ones to synthesize HyA in response to PTH treatment (31Wong G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4019-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The functions of HyA in bone are not known presently. Furthermore, it is not clear why PTH treatment greatly enhances the HyA content of bone tissue. The present study sought to answer three basic questions: 1) Does PTH rapidly stimulate HyA production in bone? 2) Are the primary target cells involved in this response the mature osteoblasts? 3) Is PTH-stimulated HyA deposition in bone tissue regions more associated with active bone formation? An affirmative answer to the first question would suggest it is a primary response to the hormone, whereas affirmative results to the latter two questions would suggest a possible role in active bone formation.To these ends, explants of tibial diaphyses from rapidly growing rats were cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of 1-100 nm PTH peptide and for varying times from 3 to 24 h. This approach has several experimental advantages to clearly identify the exact bone tissue locations and cells that respond to PTH treatment with an increased HyA production. First, the tibial diaphyses from rapidly growing rats exhibit growth principally by new bone deposition at the periosteal surface and any bone resorption at the endosteal surface (32Leblond C.P. Wilkinson G.W. Belanger L.F. Robichon J. Am. J. Anat. 1950; 86: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the sites of active bone formation and the general locations of the bone-forming osteoblasts are known in this bone explant model. Second, we have developed the necessary microdissection procedures to isolate the major tissue compartments comprising the tibial diaphysis (periosteum, marrow, and cortical bone). Finally, we have utilized a multidisciplinary approach using specific biochemical assays to measure HyA content and synthetic rates combined with a biotinylated HyA-binding protein complex (bHABC) (33Ripellino J.A.

Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to specifically localize HyA in tissue sections.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All of the reagents used in this study were of the highest purity commercially available. PTH1-34 was obtained from Bachem California. Chondroitin ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris) and hyaluronidase SD were from Seikagaku America. [35S]Sulfate and [3H]glucosamine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. RPMI 1640 was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone (Ogden, UT). Tissue culture dishes were from Falcon BD. Centricon 3 (3-kDa cutoff) microconcentrators were from Amicon. Paraffin was from Paraplast (Oxford Labware). Superfrost slides were from Fisher. Permaslip was from Alban Scientific. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit were from Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories). Mono® fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis reagents were from Glyko (a subsidiary of Bio-Rad). CarboPac PA1 (7 × 250 mm) was from Dionex Corp.Tissue Isolation and Culture—All of the animal procedures used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Weanling male rats (body weight, ∼50 g) were euthanized by asphyxiation with CO2. A 7-mm-long segment from the middle diaphysis of each tibia was obtained from the rats using aseptic techniques, and the ends of the bone cortex were left open to allow free access of medium into the marrow space within the medullary cavity. Tibial explants were cultured for 3, 6, 12, or 24 h with or without PTH1-34 (1-100 nm) in RPMI 1640 containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C. After culture, the tibial diaphyses were sequentially processed to isolate bone marrow, periosteum, and cortical bone. Marrow tissue was isolated from explants by pressurized irrigation of the diaphyseal medullary cavity using Hanks' balanced salt solution expressed through a blunt end 20-gauge needle. Apical periosteal tissue layers, as well as more than half of the basal cambium cell layer, were stripped off the bone by microdissection. Following this dissection, and only at this time, each bone cylinder was plugged at both open ends using bone wax (Fine Science Tools, Inc.). This was done to assure access of reagents to the periosteal bone surface only. The remaining cambium cells and osteoid matrix on the periosteal surface of the wax-plugged bone cylinders were isolated using type I collagenase digestion (0.5 mg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 37 °C. Cortical bone is operationally defined as the remaining bone tissue after the above manipulations. To determine HyA synthesis directly, some explant cultures of tibial diaphysis were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml each of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in the above described medium conditions.Measurement of HyA in Tissue Extracts—Bone marrow, periosteum, and cortical bone specimens were exposed separately to a strong denaturant solution containing protease inhibitors (4 m guanidine HCl, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8) with mixing for 24 h at 4 °C followed by five brief washes with the same solution. For each tissue compartment from these diaphyses, this extract represented the molecules solubilized from unmineralized tissue matrices (36Termine J.D. Kleinman H.K. Whitson S.W. Conn K.M. McGravey M.L. Martin G.R. Cell. 1981; 26: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Cortical bone tissue was subsequently extracted with the above guanidine HCl denaturant solution containing 0.4 m EDTA to quantitatively demineralize the specimens and solubilize the entrapped organic matrix molecules. After dialysis into enzyme buffer (3500-Da molecular mass cut-off), the samples were digested with chondrotin ABC lyase (0.1 units/ml) and hyaluronidase SD (0.01 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The unsaturated disaccharide digestion products were isolated from the enzyme and other proteins by ultrafiltration with a Centricon 3 (3000-Da molecular mass cut-off) or ethanol precipitation as previously described (37Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Midura R.J. Salustri A. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unsaturated HyA disaccharides were detected and quantified by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (37Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or CarboPac PA1 chromatography using UV absorbance (38Midura R.J. Salustri A. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled HyA unsaturated disaccharides were resolved using CarboPac PA1 chromatography (38Midura R.J. Salustri A. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and quantified from collected fractions by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS-3800).HyA Detection in Tissue Sections—Specimens were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% cetylpyridinium chloride (to prevent the solubilization of HyA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 6 h at 45 °C. The fixed samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and decalcified in 0.5 m EDTA in the above fixative solution for 16 h at 45 °C. The samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin after serial dehydration with a graded ethanol series to xylene. Sections of 5-μm thickness were cut and were placed on polychloroprene-coated Superfrost slides.bHABC, which contains the HyA-binding regions of aggrecan and link protein, was prepared from bovine articular cartilage, and HyA labeling was done as previously described (34Tammi R. Ripellino J.A. Margolis R.U. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 412-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang C. Tammi M. Tammi R. Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The specificity of HyA detection (negative control) was performed by preincubation of the bHABC probe with HyA oligosaccharides containing 14 disaccharide repeats (1 μg of HyA14/3 μg of bHABC) and using it instead of probe alone in the labeling protocol. Another control for probe specificity included the predigestion of some tissue sections with Streptomyces hyaluronidase before exposure to the bHABC probe. Deparaffinized sections were incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in 30% methanol for 10 min to block tissue peroxidases, washed with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer), and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites. Preblocked sections were incubated with bHABC (10 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C, washed thoroughly with phosphate buffer, and treated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with phosphate buffer, and the chromaphore was developed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit. After washing, the sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and then mounted with Permaslip.RESULTSBone Tissue Compartments—Mid diaphyseal bone segments of ∼7-mm length were obtained from the tibiae of young rats (Fig. 1, A and C), and further processed by irrigation, microdissection, and collagenase digestion to yield bone marrow, periosteum, and cortical bone tissue compartments (Fig. 1B). The bone marrow tissue contained both hematopoietic and adipocytic marrow cells and their associated extracellular matrix, as well as most of the endosteal lining cells (note their absence in Fig. 1E). Microdissection stripped periosteum (Ps) contained all of the apical tissue layers and nearly half of the basal cambium cell layer (mature periosteal lining osteoblasts) with its associated extracellular matrix (Fig. 1D). Collagenase digestion of the wax-plugged diaphyseal cylinders after microdissection removed all remaining cambium osteoblasts and osteoid matrix from the periosteal surface (Pc) (Fig. 1, compare E and F). The residual cortical bone tissue after completing all of the above manipulations contained mainly osteocytes, although there were some osteoblasts lining intracortical channels housing blood vessels and an occasional osteoclast apparent by histology (Fig. 1F).HyA Biochemisty—A total of 0.4 μg of HyA was recovered from freshly isolated tibial diaphyses at this age, with HyA detected in extracts from all tissue compartments (Table I). The HyA content of each tissue compartment was 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than its respective protein content. Periosteum contained a majority of the HyA content within the tibial diaphysis with 63 and 9% from Ps and Pc, respectively. Three-fold more HyA was identified in the unmineralized tissue extracts of cortical bone (13%) than that detected in the mineralized tissue extracts of cortical bone (4%).Table IHyA and protein contents of freshly isolated tibial diaphyseal tissuesTissue compartmentHyAaSolubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis using Glyko MONO® gels.Total HyAProteinbSolubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed by MicroBCA protein assay.Total proteinHyA to protein ratiocCalculated by dividing the HyA content (in μg) by the protein content (in μg) from the same sample and multiplying by 100%.ng%μg%%Ps249 ± 4363218 ± 14270.11Pc36 ± 12941 ± 3dRepresents the remaining protein signal after subtracting out the protein contribution from the collagenase solution.50.09CB52 ± 161379 ± 5100.07CBEDTAeSamples needed to be processed by ultrafiltration to remove EDTA, which interferes with the protein assay.17 ± 54138 ± 11170.01M44 ± 1111334 ± 32410.01Totals397 ± 41810 ± 230.05a Solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis using Glyko MONO® gels.b Solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed by MicroBCA protein assay.c Calculated by dividing the HyA content (in μg) by the protein content (in μg) from the same sample and multiplying by 100%.d Represents the remaining protein signal after subtracting out the protein contribution from the collagenase solution.e Samples needed to be processed by ultrafiltration to remove EDTA, which interferes with the protein assay. Open table in a new tab Tibial diaphyses were cultured as open ended explants in low serum medium with or without 10 nm PTH1-34 for 12 h because these conditions gave a nearly maximal response for HyA content (data not shown). After incubation, the tibial diaphyses were separated into their various tissue compartments, and the HyA content in each was quantified. PTH treatment increased the amount of HyA accumulated in all tissue compartments except marrow tissue (Fig. 2). The periosteal layers were the most affected, with 5- and 8-fold increases in HyA content detected in Ps and Pc, respectively. The relative increases in HyA content for both the unmineralized and mineralized cortical bone tissue extracts were similar, each exhibiting about a 2-fold increase.Fig. 2HyA contents in the apical periosteum (Stripped), cambium periosteum/osteoid (Col'ase), and unmineralized (-EDTA) and mineralized (+EDTA) extracellular matrix of the cortical bone and marrow tissue.

Explant cultures were incubated in low serum medium with or without 10 nm PTH1-34 for 6 h, because this is the latest time point still exhibiting a linear rate of [3H]glucosamine incorporation into HyA (data not shown). Without PTH exposure, the periosteum exhibited the greatest amount of HyA synthesis, ∼51% of the total recovered 3H-HyA (39% in Ps and 12% in Pc) (Fig. 3). Given the direct exposure of the periosteum to the culture medium, it likely was the major contributor of 3H-HyA in the culture medium, ∼40% of the total. Cortical bone, ∼6% of the total 3H-HyA (0.5% in the mineral phase), and bone marrow (∼3%) exhibited substantially lower amounts of HyA synthesis as compared with periosteum. The labeling ratio of 3H to 35S radioactivity in the chondroitin-4-sulfate disaccharides recovered from these various tissues after chondroitinase digestion was similar, suggesting that the specific activity of the [3H]glucosamine precursor in each tissue was equivalent (39Yanagishita M. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Levels of HyA synthesis in the culture medium, apical periosteum (Stripped), cambium periosteum/osteoid (Col'ase), and unmineralized (-EDTA) and mineralized (+EDTA) extracellular matrix of the cortical bone and marrow tissue. The tissues were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine as described under “Experimental Procedures”; a linear rate of 3H incorporation into HyA existed during the 6-h incubation period after a short lag phase (t1/2 ∼ 30 min) required for intracellular glucosamine equilibration.

B is the summary of the HyA synthesis data (means ± S.D.; n = 4 rats) from two independent trials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nearly all of the bone tissue compartments exhibited increases in the amount of 3H-HyA synthesized during the 6-h culture period as the result of PTH treatment (Fig. 3). The periosteum exhibited the greatest increase in 3H-HyA content in response to PTH treatment: 7- and 8-fold increases in Ps and Pc specimens, respectively. Interestingly, both the unmineralized and mineralized compartments of the cortical bone tissue showed ∼2-fold increases in HyA synthesis as a result of PTH treatment. Unlike all the other tissue compartments, bone marrow did not respond to PTH treatment with an increase in HyA synthesis. The labeling ratio of 3H to 35S radioactivity in the chondroitin-4-sulfate disaccharides recovered from all tissues after chondroitinase digestion was ∼15% higher in PTH-treated specimens as compared with their respective control tissues. This finding would suggest that PTH treatment slightly changed the specific activity of the [3H]glucosamine precursor in each tissue sample including marrow but that the extent of this change was equivalent for all bone tissues (data not shown). It also suggests that PTH treatment selectively enhances HyA synthesis over that for chondroitin sulfate containing proteoglycans in bone explant tissues, consistent with previous findings for osteoblast-like cells (29Midura R.J. Evanko S.P. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13200-13206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).HyA Histochemistry—The above biochemical analyses indicate that the periosteum produces most of the HyA in the tibial diaphysis and that it exhibits the greatest response to PTH treatment with respect to an increase in HyA synthesis. However, all of these bone tissue compartments contain several cell types, even the periosteum (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, another approach is required to identify those cells in each bone tissue compartment that produce HyA and those that synthesize increased amounts of HyA in response to PTH treatment. An HyA histochemical staining method was chosen based on the rationale that any cell capable of producing HyA would exhibit some positive staining for this macromolecule in its surrounding extracellular matrix and that those cells exhibiting enhanced HyA synthesis resulting from PTH treatment would show an enhanced staining for HyA in their surrounding extracellular matrix.Comparing sections of freshly isolated tibial diaphysis stained with a bHABC probe in the presence (Fig. 4B) or absence (Fig. 4A) of HyA oligosaccharides revealed the highly specific nature of this probe for detecting HyA in tissue sections. Using this probe, varying levels of HyA staining were detected in the extracellular matrices of all bone tissue compartments. The apical cell layers of the periosteum stained strongly positive for the presence of matrix HyA (Fig. 4C)."
https://openalex.org/W2104690717,"Initiation of the genetic programs for inflammation and immunity involves nuclear mobilization of transcription factor NF-κB. This signal-dependent process is controlled in part by the β-catalytic subunit of IκB kinase (IKKβ), which marks IκBα and other cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB for proteolytic destruction. The catalytic activity of IKKβ is stimulated by pathologic and physiologic inducers of NF-κB, such as the Tax oncoprotein and proinflammatory cytokines. We now report evidence that these NF-κB inducers target IKKβ for conjugation to ubiquitin (Ub) in mammalian cells. The apparent molecular size of modified IKKβ is compatible with monoubiquitination rather than attachment of a multimeric Ub chain. The modification is contingent upon signal-induced phosphorylation of the activation T loop in IKKβ at Ser-177/Ser-181. The formation of IKKβ-Ub conjugates is disrupted in cells expressing YopJ, a Ub-like protein protease that interferes with the NF-κB signaling pathway.

These findings indicate an important mechanistic link between phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and the biologic action of IKKβ. The inducible transcription factor NF-κB is biochemically coupled to cell-surface members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorGuHClguanidine hydrochlorideHispolyhistidineIKKIκB kinaseTNF-R1TNF receptor type 1UbubiquitinWTwild typeHAhemagglutininNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. receptor, Toll-like receptor, and immunoglobulin superfamilies (1.Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). NF-κB is persistently activated in cells expressing the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which has potent oncogenic properties (2.Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This deregulated pattern of NF-κB activity also underlies acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (1.Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is controlled by an inducible multicomponent protein kinase, termed IKK, which targets IκBα and other cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB for proteolytic destruction (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). IKK contains two catalytic subunits, designated IKKα and IKKβ, as well as a regulatory subunit called IKKγ (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). IKKβ and IKKγ are essential for proteolytic inactivation of IκBα, whereas IKKα mediates NF-κB subunit processing via an IKKγ-independent mechanism (4.Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol.

The catalytic activity of IKKβ is stimulated by signals that trigger its phosphorylation at Ser-177/Ser-181, such as TNF-α (5.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). These phosphoacceptors lie in a region of the catalytic domain that shares homology with regulatory “T loop” sequences found in mitogen-activated protein kinases and their upstream activators (5.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In contrast to its transient pattern of phosphorylation and activation in TNF-stimulated cells, IKKβ is chronically phosphorylated and activated in cells expressing the Tax oncoprotein (6.Carter R.S.

Tax-induced activation of IKKβ is blocked by YopJ (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

This finding with YopJ raised the possibility that IKKβ might be subject to signal-dependent ubiquitination. In keeping with this possibility, previous studies with partially purified kinase complexes suggested that IKK is conjugated to Ub in vitro (8.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). However, these pioneering in vitro experiments were conducted prior to molecular cloning of individual IKK subunits (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that IKKβ is conjugated to Ub in vivo following engagement of either the Tax or TNF signaling pathway. Signal-induced ubiquitination of IKKβ is disrupted by wild type but not protease-deficient versions of YopJ. Formation of IKKβ-Ub conjugates is dependent on the presence of IKKγ, which is essential for IKKβ catalytic activity. The apparent molecular size of IKKβ-Ub conjugates is consistent with attachment of a single Ub molecule to IKKβ, precluding efficient recognition by the 26 S proteasome (9.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in IKKβ that block phosphorylation at Ser-177/Ser-181 prevent its ubiquitination. In sharp contrast, the replacement of these sites with phosphomimetic amino acids yields a gain-of-function mutant that is constitutively ubiquitinated in the absence of an NF-κB agonist. We conclude that T loop phosphorylation at Ser-177/Ser-181 generates a conditional Ub-targeting signal in IKKβ. This contingent post-translational mechanism may be applicable to other inducible enzymes under T loop control that lie outside of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Signal-induced Ubiquitination of IKKβ in Vivo—The β-catalytic subunit of IKK is required for proteolytic inactivation of IκBα, a principle cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To determine whether IKKβ is ubiquitinated in vivo, we programmed 293T cells with expression vectors for Tax, IKKβ, IKKγ, and a HA-tagged form of human Ub. IKKβ immunocomplexes were prepared from recipient cells and then probed on immunoblots for their HA-Ub content. As shown in Fig. 1A (top), we were unable to detect HA-Ub in IKKβ immunocomplexes derived from control cells lacking either Tax or HA-Ub (lanes 1 and 2). However, Tax induced significant levels of IKKβ ubiquitination in transfectants expressing tagged Ub (lanes 3 and 4). This signal-dependent response could not be attributed to Tax-mediated stabilization of IKK subunits, because the steady-state expression levels of IKKβ and IKKγ were comparable in all of the transfectants (lower panels). These data strongly suggested that IKKβ is subject to Ub conjugation via a signal-dependent mechanism. To confirm this finding, we used nickel-chelate affinity (Ni-NTA) chromatography to purify IKKβ-Ub conjugates under stringent denaturing conditions (11.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). For these experiments, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for Tax, IKKγ, HA-Ub, and polyhistidine (His)-tagged IKKβ. His-tagged IKKβ was purified from recipient cells on Ni-NTA beads in the presence of 3 m GuHCl, eluted, and probed on immunoblots for HA-Ub. We found no evidence for the formation of immunoreactive IKKβ-Ub conjugates in control cells lacking either HA-Ub or Tax (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 1–3). However, in keeping with Fig. 1A, Ub-conjugated IKKβ was readily detected in extracts derived from cells coexpressing Tax and HA-Ub (lane 4). Similar results were obtained in complementary experiments with expression vectors for His-Ub rather than His-IKKβ, which enabled us to probe the IKKβ content in affinity-purified Ub conjugates under strong denaturing conditions (Fig. 1C). Based on these results from three independent experimental approaches, we conclude that IKKβ is subject to signal-dependent ubiquitination in transfected mammalian cells. Thus far, we have been unable to detect this modification in untransfected cells, presumably because of limited expression of the relevant IKKβ species at the endogenous protein level. Specificity and Extent of IKKβ Ubiquitination—Association of IKKβ with IKKγ is essential for proteolytic inactivation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To determine whether IKKγ is required for signal-induced ubiquitination of IKKβ, we conducted experiments with 293T cells expressing Tax, His-Ub, and IKKβ in the presence or absence of IKKγ. To provide stringent controls for specificity, parallel transfections were performed with point mutants of Tax that are selectively defective for either cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (Tax-M47) or NF-κB (Tax-M22) activation (10.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Ub conjugates were purified from cytoplasmic extracts by Ni-NTA chromatography, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then probed on immunoblots for their IKKβ content. As shown in Fig. 2A (top), wild type Tax failed to induce IKKβ ubiquitination in the absence of ectopic IKKγ (lanes 1 and 2). Provision of IKKγ in trans rescued this modification step in Tax-expressing cells (lane 4). Formation of IKKβ-Ub conjugates was also observed in experiments with Tax-M47 (lane 6) but not with Tax-M22 (lane 5), consistent with their differing capacities to activate IKKβ and NF-κB (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). All of the ectopic proteins were efficiently expressed (Fig. 2A, lower panels). We conclude that IKKγ is required for signal-dependent ubiquitination of IKKβ. Proteasome-mediated degradation of a substrate requires its attachment to a multimeric Ub chain containing at least four covalently linked Ub molecules (∼8 kDa each) (9.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The presence of this degradation marker is typically revealed as a ladder or a smear on SDS-PAGE gels, which we failed to detect in our experiments with Ub-conjugated IKKβ (Fig. 1). In keeping with this observation, Tax has no significant effect on the steady-state level of IKKβ (12.Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To estimate the molecular size of IKKβ-Ub conjugates under conditions that minimize Ub editing by cellular isopeptidases, proteins were extracted from 293T cells by direct lysis in 6 m GuHCl (11.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Ub-conjugated proteins were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel in conjunction with molecular weight standards, and probed on immunoblots for their IKKβ content (Fig. 2B). An approximate molecular size of 95 kDa was determined for the unmodified form of IKKβ derived from Tax-deficient cells (lane 1), whereas purified IKKβ-Ub conjugates derived from Tax-expressing cells migrated primarily as a single ∼105-kDa species (lane 4). The observed electrophoretic mobility shift was compatible with the attachment of a single His-tagged Ub molecule to IKKβ rather than a multimeric Ub chain. We consider this experimental result to be significant, because emerging studies indicate that monoubiquitin regulates the biologic activity of target substrates via a protease-independent mechanism (13.Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Role of T Loop Phosphorylation in IKKβ Ubiquitination— Tax-induced activation of IKKβ is contingent upon its phosphorylation at Ser-177 and Ser-181 (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To explore the role of Ser-177/Ser-181 in IKKβ ubiquitination, 293T cells were transfected with vectors for a mutant of IKKβ containing alanine replacements at these two sites (IKKβ.SA), IKKγ, Tax, and His-Ub. We then isolated His-Ub conjugates from recipient cells by chromatography on Ni-NTA beads, fractionated them by SDS-PAGE, and probed the resolved proteins on immunoblots for the presence of IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 3A (top), mutations that disrupt phosphorylation of Ser-177/Ser-181 in IKKβ blocked its ubiquitination in the presence of Tax (lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained with a kinase-dead mutant of IKKβ that is defective for ATP-binding (IKKβ.KM, lanes 5 and 6). IKKβ was constitutively ubiquitinated in Tax-deficient cells when Ser-177 and Ser-181 were both replaced with the phosphomimetic glutamic acid (IKKβ.SE, lane 7), which generates a constitutively active IκB kinase (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We conclude that Tax-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IKKβ are biochemically linked. Phosphorylation of IKKβ at Ser-177/Ser-181 is also required for its activation by proinflammatory mediators such as TNF (5.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To explore whether proinflammatory signaling pathways for NF-κB activation lead to IKKβ ubiquitination, we programmed 293T cells with expression vectors for His-Ub, IKKβ, IKKγ, and TNF-R1 rather than Tax. As shown in Fig. 3B (top), TNF-R1 induced significant levels of IKKβ ubiquitination relative to control cells lacking the ectopic receptor (lanes 1 and 2). However, this signal-dependent response was disrupted in cells coexpressing TNF-R1 and IKKβ.SA (lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblotting experiments confirmed that enforced expression of TNF-R1 stimulated IKKβ phosphorylation and that IKKβ.SA was efficiently expressed (Fig. 3B, lower panels). We conclude that both Tax and TNF-R1 induce IKKβ ubiquitination via a mechanism involving T loop phosphorylation of this catalytic subunit at Ser-177/Ser-181. Attachment of Ub to IKKβ Is Disrupted by YopJ—Tax-induced activation of endogenous IKKβ is blocked in cells expressing the Yersinia virulence factor YopJ (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that YopJ removes Ub-related modifiers from target proteins in mammalian cells (7.Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To determine whether YopJ interferes with stable formation of IKKβ-Ub complexes, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for Tax, HA-Ub, IKKβ, IKKγ, and YopJ. IKK complexes were immunopurified from recipient cells, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then probed for the presence of HA-Ub on immunoblots. As expected, Tax stimulated ubiquitination of IKKβ in YopJ-deficient cells (Fig. 4, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Coexpression with YopJ completely blocked this signal-dependent modification, which was accompanied by diminished T loop phosphorylation of IKKβ (lane 3, top two panels). In contrast, a protease-deficient mutant of YopJ containing a Cys → Ala substitution in its catalytic triad (7.Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) had no significant effect on signal-induced ubiquitination of IKKβ (top panel, lane 4). All of the ectopic proteins were efficiently expressed, including the protease-deficient mutant of YopJ (Fig. 4, lower panels). Thus, the capacity of YopJ to disrupt signal-induced ubiquitination of IKKβ is dependent on its protease function (7.Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how this protease function also impinges on the phosphorylation status of IKKβ. One possibility is that attachment of Ub to IKKβ protects the activated T loop from cellular phosphatases, leading to sustained IκB kinase activity. In summary, we have found that IKKβ is ubiquitinated in response to engagement of either the Tax or TNF signaling pathway. The apparent molecular size of Ub-modified IKKβ is most compatible with the attachment of a single Ub tag (Fig. 2B), precluding efficient recognition of the conjugate by the 26 S proteasome (9.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 13.Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). In keeping with prior in vitro studies (8.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), several lines in vivo evidence indicate a role for Ub in the regulation of IKKβ catalytic activity. First, ubiquitination of IKKβ is contingent upon the presence of IKKγ (Fig. 2A), a regulatory subunit that is essential for proper functional control of IKKβ (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4.Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Second, the modification is disrupted by YopJ (Fig. 4), which interferes with signal-dependent activation of endogenous IKKβ (6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Third, the formation of IKKβ-Ub conjugates is triggered by phosphorylation of IKKβ at Ser-177/Ser-181 (Fig. 3), a prerequisite for its activation by either Tax or TNF (5.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 6.Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We propose that phosphorylation at Ser-177/Ser-181 generates a substrate recognition motif, permitting the Ub-conjugating machinery to dock with and monoubiquitinate IKKβ (14.Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In turn, this modification regulates the biologic action of IKKβ via a proteasome-independent mechanism, perhaps involving the intervention of an IKKβ-specific Ub receptor (15.Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Resolution of this model awaits assignment of the Ub acceptor sites and functional studies with ubiquitination-defective mutants of IKKβ. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Kim Orth (University of Texas Southwestern) for the expression vector encoding protease-deficient YopJ and Dr. Eugene Oltz (Vanderbilt University) for helpful discussions."

It is widely believed that JNK plays an essential role in apoptosis induced by agents such as UV, cytokine, chemotherapeutic drugs, and ceramide (5.Stadheim T.A. Kucera G.L. Leuk.

Recent studies with Jnk(–/–) knockout mice showed that JNK activity is required for excitotoxin-induced apoptosis in the adult hippocampus and for apoptosis in the developing embryonic neural tube (7.Kuan C.Y.

Thus, JNK activity appears to be essentially involved in apoptotic progression of vaious cell types induced by a number of different apoptotic stimuli. JNK activity is regulated by various different mechanisms in cells under the different experimental conditions.

PKC-δ activity is involved in activation process of caspase-3 during apoptosis (16.Cataldi A. Miscia S. Centurione L. Rapino M. Bosco D. Grifone G. Valerio V.D. Garaci F. Rana R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). JNK activity is also regulated by JNK-interacting protein (JIP). JIP competes with c-Jun, ATF2 and Elk for JNK binding via its JNK-binding domain (JBD) (17.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Recent results showed that the peptide sequence containing JBD prevents nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated c-Jun and also suppresses neuronal cell death induced by NGF deprivation (18.Harding T.C.

JNK1 activity is also regulated by the JNK1 inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, which dissociates from a complex with JNK1 upon the entry of T-lymphocytes and HeLa cells into S-phase (19.Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20.Petel R. Bartosch B. Blank J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2247-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-3 cleaves p21WAF1/CIP1 at a specific site in vitro; this same cleavage occurs in apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells treated with ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2), a ginseng saponin with a dammarane skeleton isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (21.Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that caspase-mediated cleavage permits the release of the cyclin/Cdk complex from the p21WAF1/CIP1 inhibitor, resulting in an elevation of cyclin/Cdk kinase activity in the early stages of apoptosis (22.Jin Y.H. Yoo K.J. Lee Y.H. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30256-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of cyclin/Cdk kinase activity is required for apoptotic progression in several cell types, including HU-VEC cells, SK-HEP-1 cells, and HeLa cells (22.Jin Y.H. Yoo K.J. Lee Y.H. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30256-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23.Kim S.G. Kim S.N. Jong H.S. Kim N.K. Hong S.H. Kim S.J. Bang Y.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that p21WAF1/CIP1 plays a pivotal role in the induction of apoptosis. In the present study, we thus, examined whether JNK1 activity is up-regulated as a consequence of proteolytic cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1 and whether this activation is a functionally relevant event in apoptotic cells induced by G-Rh2 or paclitaxel. Here we show that JNK1 activity is up-regulated by a mechanism that is associated with the SEK1 activity in ealier stages, but afterward by a different mechanism that involves proteolytic cleavage of JNK1 inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 during apoptotic progression. We also provide evidence that JNK1 activity is efficiently down-regulated by ectopic overexpression of p21D112N, uncleavable mutant of p21WAF1/CIP1, and this down-regulation of JNK1 activity is functionally associated with suppression of apoptotic progression in the cells induced by treatment with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel. Further, we show that cells transiently expressing dominant negative version of JNK1 (DN-JNK1) or JBD, the JNK1 inhibitor, are markedly suppressed to undergo apoptosis induced by treatment of paclitaxel or G-Rh2. Thus, the JNK1 activation that is associated with PKC-δ activity and also with proteolytic dissociation of p21WAF1/CIP1 from JNK1-containing complexes, appears to be functionally relevant event in apoptotic progression of paclitaxel- and G-Rh2-induced cells. Reagents—Gisenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2) was dissolved in 70% ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. Paclitaxel, rottlerin, and Go6976 were obtained from Calbiochem and were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 100 μm, 100 mm, and 50 mm, respectively, and stored at –20 °C. GST-c-Jun and protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) was purchased from BD Pharmingen. [γ-32P]ATP and z-VAD-fmk were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—SK-HEP-1 and HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% calf serum and antibiotics-antimycotics (Invitrogen). SK-HEP-1 cells (1 × 107/cuvette) were transfected with 40 μg of pCMV-p21D112N or pCMV-DN-SEK1, and co-transfected with 20 μg each of pCMV-β-gal and pcDNA3 (mock), pcDNA3-Flag-JNK1 (wild-type JNK1) or pcDNA3-Flag-DN-JNK1 (dominant negative JNK1) by means of electroporation (250 V and 1,200 μF) employing the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II, and 48 h later the cells were treated with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel. After X-gal staining of transfected cells, the shrunk/rounded blue cells among all blue cells were counted in twenty different comparable fields. HeLa cells grown on a 6-well plate (60% confluent) were co-transfected with 2 μg each of pEGFP-C1 and pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Flag-JBD using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed according to standard methods. Cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β -glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml antipain) for 1 h. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Gelman). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk (Carnation) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-human caspase-3/CPP32 (Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-p21WAF1/CIP1, and rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK2 (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MKK3/MKK6 and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-SEK1/MKK4 (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun, mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-JNK1, rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1, rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38, and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1 and 2 (Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immune Complex Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer. The lysates were precleared by shaking with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated by shaking with rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1 or JNK2 at 4 °C. After an overnight incubation, immune complexes were recovered with protein A-agarose beads and washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Pellets were mixed with 1 μg GST-c-Jun, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 500 μm unlabeled ATP, and kinase buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm Na3VO4. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, and the supernatants were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The gel was dried, and the phosphorylation of the c-Jun substrate was determined by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Samples of total protein (500 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and released from agarose beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixture was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (BD Pharmingen) was used in caspase-3 assays according to a procedure based on the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of cell lysates were added to the reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose) containing 25 μm of Ac-DEVD-AFC in a 96-well plate. Lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence of the cleavage product was measured using a SpectraFluor F129003 (TECAN) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 465 nm, respectively. Immunocytochemistry—Active caspase-3 staining was used to monitor apoptotic cell death. Cells were plated on 18 × 18 mm glass coverslips at a confluency of 60% and were allowed to become adherent overnight. 24 h after co-transfection with 2 μg each of pEGFP-C1 and pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Flag-JBD, cells were either kept untreated or treated with G-Rh2. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation for 1 h with blocking solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% CAS in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, cells were stained by incubating the coverslips for overnight with anti-active capsase-3 antibody (Promega). The active caspase-3 staining was revealed by incubating cells for 1 h with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) and visualized by confocal microscopy (LEICA). Illumination sources were 488 nm and 505 nm. JNK1 Activity Is Selectively and Progressively Up-Regulated Among MAPKs during Apoptotic Progression of SK-HEP-1 Cells—Here, we have addressed whether JNK1 activity is involved in apoptotic progression of SK-HEP-1 cells induced by treatment with G-Rh2. Kinase assays with the JNK1 immunocomplex showed that JNK1 activity increases in a progressive fashion, with an early activation beginning at 10 min after treatment of the cells with G-Rh2 and a later, more sustained, activation beginning at 60 min (Fig. 1B, lower panel). By contrast, JNK2 activation and changes in its protein levels were not observed during G-Rh2-induced apoptosis. (Fig. 1B, two panels from bottom). The onset and time course for the later phase of JNK1 activation coincided well with the temporal profiles of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and morphological changes of cells with apoptotic characters (Fig. 1, A and B, upper and middle panels). JNK1 activation did not appear to be attributed to increased protein levels of the kinase (Fig. 1B). In addition, JNK1 activation was specific, because the activities of other kinases including p38, ERK1, ERK2, and MKK3/MKK6 as represented by levels of their phosphoforms were unchanged over the same time period (Fig. 1C). The result also showed that the activity of SEK1 kinase, as represented by levels of phospho-SEK1/MKK4, increased in parallel with that of JNK1 over the first 30 min; however, thereafter the kinase activity was undetectable in G-Rh2-induced cells, while JNK1 activity continued (Fig. 1C). We then examined whether a dominant negative version of SEK1 (DN-SEK1) can differentially perturb the JNK1 activation. The results showed that in cells transiently expressing DN-SEK1, the early JNK1 activation was effectively blocked, but was not the later JNK1 activation in G-Rh2-induced cells (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Moreover, expression of DN-SEK1 did not significantly perturb the apoptotic progression, as indicated by the proteolytic cleavage of PARP in the cells (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). SEK1 activity is thus, likely associated with the early phase of JNK1 activation but is independent of the later apoptosis-specific up-regulation of JNK1. We next examined whether both early and later JNK1 activation are due to specific phosphorylation sites. The results showed that phosphorylation of JNK1 at Thr183/Tyr185 was increased and paralleled with the time course of JNK1 activation during apoptosis, but the levels of phospho-JNK1 were not significantly changed during early and later JNK1 activation (Fig. 1B, the third panel from bottom). The results indicated that both early and later JNK1 activation may not be due to phosphorylation at different locations. Ectopic Expression of p21D112N, an Uncleavable Mutant of p21WAF1/CIP1 Effectively and Equally Blocks the JNK1 Activation and Apoptotic Progression—We then examined whether proteolytic cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1 is associated with the later phase of JNK1 activation and also whether this JNK1 activity is involved in apoptotic progression of G-Rh2-induced cells, because proteolytic cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1, an inhibitor protein of JNK1 occurred with a kinetics similar to the onset and time course for apoptosis in G-Rh2-induced SK-HEP-1 cells. The result from Western blot showed that the onset and time course for proteolytic cleavage of cellular p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel) coincides well with those of proteolytic dissociation of the JNK1-associated p21WAF1/CIP1 in the cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The later phase of JNK1 activation, thus, is likely associated with proteolytic dissociation of the JNK1 inhibitor from the JNK1 complex in the apoptotic cells. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, we tested whether ectopic overexpression of p21D112N, an uncleavable version of p21WAF1/CIP1, perturbs the later phase of JNK1 activation and apoptosis in G-Rh2-induced cells (Fig. 2B). The results demonstrated that p21D112N being expressed at high levels in the transient transfectants (Fig. 2B, left panel) effectively suppresses both apoptotic progression as determined by proteolytic cleavage of PARP, and the later phase of JNK1 activation after 60 min of G-Rh2 treatment of the cells (Fig. 2B, upper and middle panels). Moreover, protein levels of the JNK1-associated p21WAF1/CIP1 were correlated very well with the inhibitory effect on JNK1 activity in the cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel). In the mock transfectants, JNK1 activity was markedly up-regulated in accordance with the time course for disappearance of p21WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with JNK1-complex after 60 min of the G-Rh2 treatment. However, in the cells expressing p21D112N, later JNK1 activation was significantly suppressed after G-Rh2 treatment although early JNK1 activation was also slightly suppressed under the same conditions (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the later JNK1 activation is closely associated with proteolytic cleavage of the JNK1-associated p21WAF1/CIP1 and this JNK1 activation is functionally relevant to the induction of apoptosis. To further provide evidence that the later JNK1 activation is attributed to proteolytic cleavage of the JNK1-associated p21WAF1/CIP1, we tested whether z-VAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, could suppress the later phase of JNK1 activation and the apoptotic progression of G-Rh2-induced cells, because the site-specific cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1 in apoptosis is mediated by a caspase-3-like protease. As expected, both events were consequently blocked, as shown by the failure of PARP to undergo cleavage and by the decreased levels of p-c-Jun, respectively (Fig. 2C, upper and middle panels). Thus, the later phase of JNK1 activation is tightly linked to an activation mechanism that requires caspase activity and this kinase activity is again functionally associated with apoptosis. Since the protein levels of JNK1 were not changed in the cells following treatment with either G-Rh2 or z-VAD-fmk, or both, (Fig. 2C, lower panel), we ruled out the possibility that the suppressive effect on JNK1 activity is due to proteolytic degradation of JNK1 protein. The Later JNK1 Activation Is Linked to PKC-δ Activation in Apoptotic Progression—An earlier report has shown that PKC-δ is involved in the activation of JNK1 in apoptosis of UVB-treated cells (15.Chen N. Ma W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We then investigated if PKC-δ activity is also involved in the later apoptosis-specific JNK1 activation. For this, we first examined if PKC-δ activity is functionally associated with the later phase of JNK1 activation. The results clearly showed that the later JNK1 activations, as determined by levels of phosphoform of JNK1 (p-JNK1), are efficiently blocked by cotreatment of the cells with rottlerin, a specific PKC-δ inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this inhibitor accordingly blocked the G-Rh2-induced apoptosis to the control levels, as determined by proteolytic cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 3B). In addition, rottlerin prevented G-Rh2-induced activation of caspase-3 as measured by cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AFC, while the conventional PKC inhibitor, Go6976 did not (Fig. 3C). Thus, PKC-δ activity is very likely linked to the activation of caspase-3. These results indicated that PKC-δ activity-dependent caspase-3 activity is involved in the later phase of JNK1 activation in G-Rh2-induced apoptosis. JNK1 Activity Is Required in Apoptotic Progression—To provide direct evidence that the later phase of JNK1 activation is essential for the induction of apoptosis, we tested whether ectopic expression of dominant negative version of JNK1 (DN-JNK1) or JBD can differentially perturb apoptotic progression by selectively blocking JNK1 activity in SK-HEP-1 and HeLa cells treated with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel. Since the transfection efficiency of SK-HEP-1 cells with the DNA constructs was relatively low, we co-transfected the cells with the pcDNA3 vector carrying the β-gal cDNA to mark transfected cells. After X-gal staining on transfected cells, blue stained cells were counted and evaluated for their effects on apoptosis of the transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel (Fig. 4, A and C). The results clearly showed that apoptotic cell death is significantly promoted by transiently expressing the wild-type JNK1, while it is effectively suppressed by expressing DN-JNK1 in cells treated with G-Rh2 (Fig. 4A) or paclitaxel (Fig. 4C). Similarly, apoptotic cell death was significantly suppressed in HeLa cells expressing JBD after treatment with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel (Fig. 4, B and D) Further, the cell populations with apoptotic morphology such as condensed chromatin and shrinkage of cell size were markedly reduced in cells co-expressing JBD and GFP proteins as compared with those of mock transfectants following treatment of cells with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel. (Fig. 4E). To substantiate these results, we also determined apoptosis by staining active caspase-3 of these transfectants. The results showed that cell populations with active caspase-3 were significantly suppressed in transfectants co-expressing JBD and GFP proteins following treatment of cells with G-Rh2, while those with active caspase-3 were markedly increased in mock transfectants co-expressing GFP protein under the same conditions (Fig. 4F). These results clearly indicate that JNK1 activation is functionally relevant event to promote the apoptotic progression of the G-Rh2- or paclitaxel-induced cells. Prolonged JNK1 Activations during Apoptosis Are Regulated by Specific Activation Mechanisms—The data we provide in this study show that JNK1 activation is required for apoptosis induced by two different agents, G-Rh2 or paclitaxel in human hepatoma SK-HEP-1 and HeLa cells. JNK1 activation during apoptosis shows a rapid and prolonged up-regulation profile in that the early activation is evidently detectable as early as 10 min and the later activation is not only higher than the first one, but also coincident very well with the onset and time course of apoptosis that occurs after 1 h of the treatment (Fig. 1B). JNK1 activation appears to be specific because the activities of other protein kinases including JNK2 are remained unaltered during apoptosis (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, the later JNK1 activation appears to be mechanistically unrelated to the earlier JNK1 activation. The reason is that the SEK1 activity in the cells increases in parallel with the JNK1 activity only for the first 30 min, but thereafter is undetectable in the G-Rh2-induced cells, while the JNK1 activity keeps on gradually increasing during apoptotic progression. It is interesting to note here that both early and later JNK1 activation are unlikely due to increased phosphorylation of JNK1 at positions, Thr183 and Tyr185, phosphorylation of which residues are essential for JNK1 activation. Our results show that the levels of phospho-JNK1 (Thr183/Tyr185) are not significantly changed during early and later JNK1 activation (Fig. 1B). Importantly, in the transfection study with DN-SEK1, a dominant negative version of SEK1, overexpression of DN-SEK1 efficiently perturbs the early phase of JNK1 activation, but does not perturb the later phase of JNK1 activation in apoptotic cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, the results suggest that the early phase of JNK1 activation is linked to the SEK1-mediated mechanism, while the later phase of JK1 activation is conducted by a different mechanism. The Later Phase of JNK1 Activation Requires Proteolytic Cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1 That Is Associated with the JNK1 Complex—Since the later phase of JNK1 activation is not related to SEK1 activity in apoptotic progression of G-Rh2-induced cells (Fig. 3), we examined whether the later phase of JNK1 activation is associated with proteolytic cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1, because of the following reasons. First, p21WAF1/CIP1 has been shown as an inhibitor of JNK1 in vitro as well as in the cell culture. And thus, proteolytic dissociation of the inhibitor protein from JNK1 complex would consequently result in up-regulation of the kinase activity (20.Petel R. Bartosch B. Blank J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2247-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it has been also shown that proteolytic cleavage of this inhibitor is functionally relevant event for the induction of apoptosis (22.Jin Y.H. Yoo K.J. Lee Y.H. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30256-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our findings show that the JNK1-associated p21WAF1/CIP1 is proteolytically dissociated from the JNK1 complex with the same onset and time courses for proteolytic cleavage of cellular p21WAF1/CIP1 and the later JNK1 activations in G-Rh2-induced apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A). Importantly, p21D112N efficiently suppresses the later phase of JNK1 activation and G-Rh2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). The functional implication of proteolytic cleavage of p21WAF1/CIP1 is also supported by that protein levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 associated with the JNK1 complex are correlated well with the suppression of JNK1 activity (Fig. 2B). The results thus, suggest that the rapid and prolonged JNK1 activations during apoptosis are conducted by two specific mechanisms, the SEK1-mediated mechanism and an activation mechanism that is related to proteolytic dissociation of the inhibitor protein from JNK1-containing complex. In earlier studies, biphasic activations of JNK1 during apoptotic progression have been observed with other cell types induced by different apoptosis inducers including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in a fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a fusion of murine DC4 and Fas (24.Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), 12-0-tetradecanoulphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (25.Engedal N. Korkmaz C.G. Saatcioglu F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been postulated in these reports that either the early increase in JNK activity contributes to the later, sustained increase in JNK activity, which in turn plays a role in the induction of apoptosis or alternatively, the early JNK activation could be mechanistically and causally unrelated to the later phase of JNK activation (25.Engedal N. Korkmaz C.G. Saatcioglu F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the early JNK1 activation is functionally associated with the upstream kinase SEK1 activity, whereas the later phase of JNK1 activation is mechanistically and causally unrelated to the early JNK1 activation. The Later JNK1 Activation Is Linked to PKC-δ Activity-dependent Caspase Activity during Apoptotic Progression—For the following reasons, we have addressed here whether the later phase of JNK1 activation, which is unrelated to the SEK1-mediated mechanism, requires PKC-δ activity. First, the SEK1-mediated JNK1 activation is limited only to the early stage of apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Second, PKC-δ activity is thought to be linked to JNK1 activity in the cells induced by treatment with etoposide or UVB (15.Chen N. Ma W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our data show that rottlerin effectively and equally suppresses the later phase of JNK1 activation and apoptosis as indicated by suppressed levels of proteolytic cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP of the G-Rh2-induced cells (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the notion that the later phase of JNK1 activation is attributed to proteolytic dissociation of the JNK1 inhibitor protein. The reason is that rottlerin, which can selectively block the PKC-δ activity-dependent caspase-3 activation is able to prevent caspase-3-activity-dependent JNK1 activation that is attributed to caspase-3-mediated dissociation of the JNK1 inhibitor protein in G-Rh2-induced cells. Our results are also supporting for those of previous studies. Previously, PKC-δ has been shown to be required for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (26.Barrett C.M. Lewis F.L. Roaten J.B. Sweatman T.W. Israel M. Cleveland J.L. Lothstein L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 469-481PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear import of PKC-δ is also required in apoptosis (27.DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and that nuclear PKC-δ plays an important role in mediating up-regulation of caspase-3 activity in Jurkat T leukemic cells exposed to ionizing radiation (16.Cataldi A. Miscia S. Centurione L. Rapino M. Bosco D. Grifone G. Valerio V.D. Garaci F. Rana R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An earlier study has also shown that the phosphorylation of p21WAF1/CIP1 at Ser146 by PKC modulates its ability to interact with PCNA (28.Scott M.T. Morrice N. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possibility that PKC-δ may also be involved in up-regulation of the later phase of JNK1 activation that is functionally linked to caspase-dependent dissociation of p21WAF1/CIP1, JNK1 inhibitor protein, during apoptotic progression. Results herein imply that the early JNK1 activation is not functionally associated with the induction of apoptosis because, as evidenced by the results from the PARP cleavage assays (Fig. 1D), in cells expressing DN-SEK1, the early JNK1 activation is effectively prevented, but the PARP cleavages are not significantly perturbed during apoptosis in G-Rh2-induced cells. Although it is not clear how JNK1 is functionally and mechanistically linked to apoptosis, JNK activity appears to be involved in dual roles in signaling pathways for cell survival and apoptosis in different cell types induced by different stimuli. Some reports have concluded that JNK activity is required for cell survival of various cell types (29.Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24767-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30.Dougherty C.J. Kubasiak L.A. Prentice H. Andreka P. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), while other studies have suggest that JNK activity is required for apoptosis of different cell types (25.Engedal N. Korkmaz C.G. Saatcioglu F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31.Mc Gee M.M. Campiani G. Ramunno A. Nacci V. Lawler M. Williams C.D. Zisterer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18383-18389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Such discrepancies in the published literature have been reasoned to be due, at least in part, to specific cell type differences (32.Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, in murine IL-3-dependent FDC-P1 cells stably expressing DN-JNK1, DN-JNK1 potently blocks IL-3 withdrawal- or anisomycin-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and also enhances the rate of cell death following IL-3 withdrawal or anisomycin treatment (32.Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Further, in SEK1 gene-deficient mice, primary activated peripheral T cells exhibit enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis in response to TCR/CDϵ religation (33.Nishina H. Radvanyi L. Raju K. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3416-3420PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the SEK1-dependent JNK1 activation, such as the early JNK1 activation in G-Rh2-induced cells is functionally relevant event to the protection of cell survival against apoptotic cell death before the induced cells commit to apoptotic progression. The Later Phase of JNK1 Activation Is Essential for the Induction of Apoptosis—Since overexpression of p21D112N inhibits the later phase of JNK1 activation and G-Rh2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B), we investigated whether the later JNK1 activation is required for the induction of apoptosis. The results from studies with transfectants show that JNK1 significantly enhances, but DN-JNK1 markedly suppresses the susceptibility of the cells to G-Rh2- or paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells (Fig. 4, A and C). Further, in cells expressing JBD, apoptosis as represented by percentage of cell viability is markedly suppressed after treatment with G-Rh2 or paclitaxel (Fig. 4, B and D). The results evidently suggest that the later activated JNK1 is involved in the induction of apoptosis. The result is consistent with the results of earlier studies. In Jnk(–/–) knockout mice, experiments have provided evidence that JNK activity may be required for excitotoxin-induced apoptosis in the adult hippocampus and for apoptosis in the developing embryonic neural tube (7.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samamta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Direct inhibition of JNK activity in sympathetic neurons by treatment with the compound SB 203580, JNK inhibitor or by expressing the JBD of JIP-1 is shown to prevent NGF-induced apoptotic death (34.Eilers A. Whitfield J. Shah B. Spadoni C. Desmond H. Ham J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1439-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Collectively, we suggest that the early activation of JNK1 may be associated with a protective role for cell survival until the induced cells commit to apoptosis, whereas the later activation is linked to execution of apoptotic progression. On the basis of these results, we propose a possibility that the rapid and prolonged JNK1 activation, which are conducted by specific mechanisms, are functionally associated with an important role as a checkpoint for the execution of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2001862736,"Endogenous retroviruses have shaped the evolution of mammalian genomes. Host genes that control the effects of retrovirus insertions are therefore of great interest. The modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus insertions into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) tremor mutation and the Eya1(BOR) model of human branchiootorenal syndrome. Positional complementation cloning identifies Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1, providing an unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA processing. Population structure of the suppressive allele in wild Mus musculus castaneus suggests selective advantage. A congenic Mvb1(CAST) allele is a useful tool for modifying gene expression from existing mutations and could be used to manipulate engineered mutations containing retroviral elements."

We now report that the p53-dependent G1 checkpoint is blocked in human carcinoma cell lines after inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by folate analogs inhibitory to glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART). p53 accumulated in HCT116, MCF7, or A549 carcinoma cells upon GART inhibition, but, surprisingly, transcription of several p53 targets, including p21cip1/waf1, was impaired. The mechanism of this defect was examined. The p53 accumulating in these cells was nuclear but was not phosphorylated at serines 6, 15, and 20, nor was it acetylated at lysines 373 or 382. The DDATHF-stabilized p53 bound to the p21 promoter in vitro and in vivo but did not activate histone acetylation over the p53 binding sites in the p21 promoter that is an integral part of the transcriptional response mediated by the DNA damage pathway. We concluded that the robust initial response of the p53 pathway to GART inhibitors is not transcriptionally propagated to target genes due to a defect in p53 post-translational modifications and a failure to open chromatin structure despite promoter binding of this unmodified p53. p53 is believed to sense cellular ribonucleotide depletion in the absence of DNA strand breaks and to respond by imposition of a p21-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest.

It is currently thought that either ribonucleotide depletion per se and/or a slowing of the progression of replication forks can also be detected independently of direct DNA damage, resulting in signaling to p53 and initiation of a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (7.Gottifredi V.

GART inhibitors are unique in that they are inactive against the classical enzymatic targets for antifolates, i.e. dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase, but cause a potent inhibition of purine synthesis and consequent cytotoxicity (26.Smith S.G. Lehman N.L. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5697-5706PubMed Google Scholar) without detectable DNA damage (16.Zhang C.C. Boritzki T.J. Jackson R.C. Cancer Chemother.

Cancer. 1994; 69: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Others have reported (16.Zhang C.C. Boritzki T.J. Jackson R.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that GART inhibitors are cytotoxic to carcinoma cells that do not have p53 function but only cytostatic to carcinoma cells that retain wild-type p53 function; this suggestion would be quite compatible with the role of p53 as a direct sensor of nucleotide pools. However, we have found GART inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity to be unaffected by p53 status (28.Bronder J.L. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5236-5241PubMed Google Scholar), and, moreover, despite a substantial accumulation of p53 following DDATHF, there was no G1 arrest, as shown below. This paradox begged explanation. In this study, we report that human tumor cells respond to de novo purine synthesis blockade by GART inhibitors with p53 stabilization, but that the downstream transcriptional activation events causative of a G1 arrest are defective. The mechanism of inactivation of the p53 response involves interference with the posttranslational phosphorylation and acetylation of p53 and with histone acetylation at the promoters of p53-sensitive downstream targets, even though nuclear translocation and sequence-specific binding of this unmodified p53 are unaffected in vivo. This inactivation of the p53 pathway explains why p53 wild-type and null function carcinoma cells are equisensitive to the cytotoxicity of the GART inhibitors. Drug Solutions—Solutions of DDATHF, LY309887, D1694 (Eli Lilly), AG2304, AG2037 (Agouron), PALA (National Cancer Institute), methotrexate (Sigma), and cycloheximide (Sigma) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Etoposide (VP16)(Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO, and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma) and inosine (Sigma), in PBS. Cell Culture—Human colon carcinoma HCT116 p53+/+ and p53–/– cells were generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University), MCF7 (human breast carcinoma) and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (dFCS) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were determined free of mycoplasma using a ribosomal RNA PCR kit from ATCC. Irradiation was performed at a dose rate of 4.47 Gy/min using a Mark 137I-Cesium source. Flow Cytometry—G0/G1 synchrony was achieved by holding HCT116 p53+/+ and p53–/– cells at confluence for 48 h, then releasing from postconfluent synchrony by replating to a lower density. For dual parameter flow cytometry experiments, cells were released from G0/G1 synchrony into media containing 10% dFCS, 65 μm BrdU (to continuously label cells actively synthesizing DNA) and either PBS, 10 μm DDATHF, or 400 μm PALA. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested by trypsinization (0.1% trypsin/0.04% EDTA), fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C until flow cytometry. Cells were washed in 0.5% BSA in PBS, and DNA was denatured with 2 n HCl for 20 min at room temperature. The cell suspensions were neutralized by the addition of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, and again washed. Cell pellets were incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU FITC-conjugated antibody (BD PharMingen), diluted 1:6 in 0.5% BSA/0.5% Tween 20/PBS, washed, and resuspended in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 7 Kunitz units/ml ribonuclease B (Sigma). For single parameter flow cytometry studies, p53+/+ cells were released from synchrony into media containing either PBS or 10 μm DDATHF. Cells were fixed and stained in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 7 Kunitz units/ml RNase B in 3.2 mm sodium citrate buffer. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercapothethanol, 50 mm NaF, 0.05 mm Na3VO4, and 1× protease inhibitor complete mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad assay, against a standard of BSA. Total cellular proteins (20 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5–8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and were transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) or nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies were p53 monoclonal Ab-6 (Oncogene) at 1:100, p21 monoclonal Ab-1 (Oncogene) at 1:100, Gadd45 polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:125, Bax polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:2000, and monoclonal antibody active against α, β, and γ isoforms of actin (Oncogene) at 1:4000. Primary monoclonal antibody to Mdm 2 (1:300) was a generous gift from Dr. Swati Deb (Virginia Commonwealth University). Membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and complexes detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce). Quantification was performed on a Molecular Dynamics SI Densitometer using ImageQuant software. To analyze p53 post-translational modifications, total p53 levels were first quantitated by densitometry of Western blots, and a second experiment was subsequently performed in which loaded lysate or immunoprecipitate volumes were varied to allow equivalent amounts of p53 to be analyzed in each lane. For the phosphorylation-specific antibodies, 100 μg or greater lysate (digested with 40 μg/ml DNase I for 10 min at room temperature) were loaded, and polyclonal antibodies against p53 peptides with phosphorylated residues were serine 6 (AnaSpec) at 1:500, serine 15 (Cell Signaling) at 1:1000, and serine 20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200. For the acetylation-specific antibody against lysines 373/382 (Upstate, 1:500 dilution), p53 was first concentrated by immunoprecipitation with the Ab-6 antibody to p53, and then subjected to Western blotting. For analysis of p53 protein stabilization, HCT116 p53+/+ cells were either irradiated at 15 Gy or treated with 10 μm DDATHF and, after 2.5 h (post-irradiation) or 8 h (DDATHF), cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Cells were collected at various times thereafter, lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Approximately 1 × 107 cells were treated with drug, washed twice with PBS, scraped, and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF). Total cellular lysates (500 μg) were precleared for 1 h with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated overnight with 2 μg of anti-p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene). All incubations were carried out at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complexes were collected through the addition of 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry for 1 h. Beads were washed four times in ice-cold RIPA buffer, then resuspended in 50 μl of denaturing sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercapothethanol) and boiled for 5 min. After brief centrifugation to pellet the beads, 15-μl of immunoprecipitate were loaded onto a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed, and ubiquitinated p53 was detected by probing the blot with the Ab-6 p53 antibody as described above. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and poly (A)+ RNA was selected using an Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen). Poly(A)+ RNA was denatured by glyoxal/Me2SO treatment at 55 °C and 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated on a 1% agarose gel. RNA was transferred to ICN Biotrans membrane and probed with random-primed p21 cDNA (ATCC) or mdm2 cDNA (a gift from Dr. Swati Deb, Virginia Commonwealth University) in Gilbert's solution (0.5 m Na3PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 7% SDS] for 16 h at 65 °C. The membrane was washed to a stringency of 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The blot was stripped and reprobed with random primed glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA as described above. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) reactions containing 5.8 × 105 cpm probe synthesized from the hStress-1 Ribo-Quant Multiprobe Template Set (BD PharMingen), and 20 μg of total RNA were hybridized in 80% deionized formamide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, and 40 mm PIPES pH 6.7 overnight at 56 °C. Digestion with RNase A mixture (100 μg/ml ribonuclease A, 10 mm TrisCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm LiCl) continued for 30 min at 30 °C, and was terminated with the addition of 100 μg proteinase K and 0.5% SDS. Protected fragments were ethanol-precipitated, fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide-urea gel, the gel was dried and exposed to film, and fragments were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Immunofluorescence—Following release from G0/G1 synchrony, HCT116 cells were seeded at densities between 8 × 104 and 4.5 × 105 cells/well on 18 mm glass coverslips in RPMI 1640 + 10% dFCS with or without 10 μm DDATHF. Cells were washed, fixed in 100% MeOH at –20 °C for 3 min, rinsed, and stored in PBS at 4 °C until samples from all time points were collected. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and sodium azide (TBS-TA), pH 7.5 (0.14 M NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris base, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% sodium azide). All incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were incubated in mouse monoclonal anti-p53 Ab-6 (Oncogene) at a 1:20 dilution in 2% BSA in TBS-TA, and labeled with goat anti-mouse Texas Red antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:200 dilution in 2% BSA in TBS-TA. Cell staining was imaged using an Olympus Fastscan 2000 12-bit digital camera on an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus America) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The procedures for nuclear extract preparation and EMSA were adapted from Siliciano et al. (29.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). For each condition, ∼5 × 106 HCT116 p53+/+ cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, pelleted, and lysed on ice for 3–5 min in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Nuclei were pelleted, extracted for 45 min at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking in 1.5× volumes of the above lysis buffer adjusted to 400 mm NaCl, and cleared by centrifugation. 25 μg of nuclear extract or 25 ng of recombinant p53 protein (kindly supplied by Dr. Sumitra Deb, Virginia Commonwealth University) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm NaCl, 25 μg BSA, and 1 μg sonicated salmon sperm DNA. 32P-end-labeled p21 oligonucleotide (2 ng) containing the 5′ p53 consensus binding site at the p21 promoter (5′-ATC AAT TCT CGA GGA ACA TGT CCC AAC ATG TTG CTC GAG GAT-3′) was added, and incubation continued for another 20 min. For supershift analysis, nuclear extract or recombinant p53 was preincubated with 0.5 μg of Ab-6 p53 antibody (Oncogene) for 15 min prior to the addition of binding buffer. For competition studies, 20 or 40-fold molar excess cold wild-type p21 or cold mutant p21 (5′-ATC AAT TCT CGA GGA AAC GTT CCC AAA CGT TTG CTC GAG GAT-3′) oligonucleotide was added simultaneously with the wild-type 32P-labeled p21 probe. Samples were loaded onto a pre-run 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and DNA: protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was based on the protocol described by Kuo and Allis (30.Kuo M. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 cells per condition were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, after which cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 mm for 5 min. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, scraped, washed in buffer I (10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% Triton X-100), then washed in buffer II (10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl). All ChIP buffers contained 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and sonicated (Misonix) using conditions found to yield DNA fragments less than 1000 bp in size. Lysates corresponding to 2.5–3 × 106 cells were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C in a 50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) bead slurry blocked with 0.2 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 8 μg BSA, then incubated with antibody overnight. Antibodies used were 2 μg of p53 Ab-6 (Oncogene), 1 μg of di-acetyl lysine Histone H3 (Upstate), 4 μg of RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 μg of p300 N-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 4.5 μg of CBP A-22 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were captured by the addition of 30 μl of blocked 50% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, the supernatant from the controls containing no antibody was collected, and the DNA contained within was referred to as input DNA. Beads were washed extensively in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40), high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40), LiCl buffer (250 mm LiCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) and TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10 min at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted by 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and cross-links were reversed by the addition of 0.2 m NaCl and incubation at 65 °C for 6 h. DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in TE (total input DNA in 100 μl, immunoprecipitated DNA in 20 μl). Semi-quantitative and Real Time PCR—Semi-quantitative PCR was performed with 10–20 ng of input DNA and 0.5 or 1 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA in reactions containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.6 μm primers. For the upstream p53 consensus binding site on the p21 promoter, the primers were 5′-CTT TCC ACC TTT CAC CAT TCC-3′ (sense), 5′-AAG GAC AAA ATA GCC ACC AGC-3′ (antisense), and the product size was 234 bp. Amplification conditions were: 94 °C 30 s, 53 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s. For the downstream p53 binding site on the p21 promoter, the primers first described by Barlev et al. (31.Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) were 5′-CCA GCC CTT TGG ATG GTT T-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC TCC TTT CTG TGC CTG A-3′ (antisense), and the product size was 420 bp. Reactions contained 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dNTPs, and 0.6 μm primers, and amplification conditions were: 94 °C 1 min, 58.5 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min. PCR cycle number was varied from 25–30 cycles to keep the reaction within the linear range. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). The primers flanking the 5′ p53 binding site were those described above, whereas the primers flanking the 3′ p53 binding site were 5′-GAG GTC AGC TGC GTT AGA GG-3′ (sense), and 5′-TGC AGA GGA TGG ATT GTT CA-3′ (antisense), and these primers generated a 154 bp product. Real-time PCR analysis was performed with three-step amplification plus melt curve, and the amplification conditions were: 94 °C 15 s, Tm 30 s, 72 °C 30 s, with Tm values of 53 °C and 58.5 °C for the upstream and downstream p53 binding sites, respectively. ChIP real-time PCR experiments were performed twice, each with triplicate samples. Inactivation of the p53-dependent G1 Checkpoint by DDATHF—Normal embryonic skin fibroblasts have been reported to arrest in G1 and G2 after induction of a nucleotide deficiency with the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor PALA, whereas fibroblasts in which the p53 pathway had been inactivated by adenoviral E6 expression advance into and accumulate in S phase (8.Linke S.P. Clarkin K.C. Di Leonardo A. Tsou A. Wahl G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We found some striking differences when we compared the effects of p53 on cell cycle traverse of carcinoma cells treated with the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor DDATHF and the de novo pyrimidine inhibitor PALA.

https://openalex.org/W2045458074,"Guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B) is a single transmembrane receptor that binds C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The ligand/receptor appears critical in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation where it acts as an adversary of mitogenic signaling pathways. We have isolated three guanylyl cyclase-B isoforms generated from a single gene by alternative splicing and termed them GC-B1, GC-B2, and GC-B3. GC-B1 is full-length and responds maximally to CNP, GC-B2 contains a 25-amino acid deletion in the protein kinase homology domain, and GC-B3 only retains a part of the extracellular ligand-binding domain. GC-B2 binds CNP, but the ligand fails to activate the cyclase, while GC-B3 fails to bind ligand. When GC-B2 or GC-B3 is expressed coincident with GC-B1, they act as dominant negative isoforms by virtue of blocking formation of active GC-B1 homodimers. Relative expression levels of GC-B1, GC-B2, and GC-B3 vary across tissues and as a function of in vitro culture; the relative amount of GC-B2 to GC-B1 is repressed in cultured smooth muscle cells relative to endogenous ratios in the medial layer cells of the aorta. Thus, GC-B isoform levels can be independently regulated. Given that the splice variants serve as dominant negative forms, these will serve as regulators of the full-length GC-B.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Two subfamilies of the enzyme are found in mammals: single transmembrane GCs and soluble GCs (2.Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single transmembrane GCs (seven in mammals labeled GC-A through GC-G) exist as homodimers, are located on the plasma membrane, and share a common domain structure: an extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD), a single transmembrane segment (TM), a protein kinase homology domain (KHD), and a cyclase catalytic (CYC) domain (2.Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KHD is homologous with the catalytic domain of protein kinases, and although no protein kinase activity has been reported, the KHD acts as a critical regulatory domain (3.Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The single transmembrane GCs are receptors for extracellular signaling molecules, although ligands have been found for only three. GC-A is a receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, GC-B is a receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and GC-C is a receptor for heat-stable enterotoxins and endogenous peptides of the guanylin family (4.Waldman S.A.

CNP/GC-B has been suggested as a strong adversary of various mitogens in that elevations of intracellular cGMP induced by CNP block proliferation of cell types such as fibroblasts and myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells and the brain-derived neuronal growth factor- or nerve growth factor-induced proliferation of neuronal precursors (13.Chrisman T.D.

CNP may also inhibit proliferation through the suppression of arginine vasopressin-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels (16.Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally CNP at high concentrations inhibits progression of angioplasty-induced balloon injuries (17.Furuya M. Aisaka K. Miyazaki T. Honbou N. Kawashima K. Ohno T. Tanaka S. Minamino N.

In this report, we isolated and characterized the murine GC-B (Npr2) gene and found that three GC-B isoforms (GC-B1, GC-B2, and GC-B3) are generated from a single Npr2 gene and that GC-B2 and GC-B3 function as dominant negative isoforms. Materials—[α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), Na+[125I]–, nylon membranes (Hybond-N and Hybond-N+), polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P), Rapid-hyb hybridization solution, and x-ray film (Hyperfilm) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Salmon sperm DNA, TRIzol reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B were purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Atrial natriuretic peptide, CNP, and [Tyr0]CNP were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. Anti-α-smooth muscle actin mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 1A4), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2), and FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Antivon Willebrand factor rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-300) and mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Clontech. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GC-B ECD serum (no. 282) was a gift from Dr. Sharon Milgram, University of North Carolina. Animals—Mouse F1 hybrids between 129/SvEvTac and C57BL/6N strains were obtained from Taconic and used for tissue collection to isolate genomic DNA, RNA, protein, and cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). All experiments with the mice were conducted as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Isolation and Characterization of Murine Guanylyl Cyclase-B Gene— Approximately 1 × 106 clones of a 129/SvEvTac mouse genomic library (Stratagene) were screened with a rat GC-B cDNA probe fragment (EcoRI-XbaI, 2.0 kb) (5.Schulz S. Singh S. Bellet R.A. Singh G. Tubb D.J. Chin H. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Phage plaques were transferred to Hybond-N as recommended by the supplier and were then used for screening. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random prime method (RediPrime II random prime labeling kit, Amersham Biosciences) to give a specific activity of about 1 × 109 dpm/μg of DNA. Hybridization was with a Rapid-hyb hybridization solution supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (sonicated) at 65 °C for 16 h. The membranes were washed once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at ambient temperature for 10 min, once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. The membranes were then exposed to Hyperfilm at ambient temperature for 24 h. Five positive clones were isolated, and three clones (nos. 7, 11, and 12) (Fig. 1a) were characterized. Fragments of the phage clones were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and characterized by restriction enzyme mapping, Southern blot analyses, and DNA sequencing. Exon-intron and intronexon boundaries were determined by a comparison of nucleotide sequences of cDNA and the genomic DNA. The copy number was determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from murine tails. DNA was digested with KpnI, SpeI, SacI, or XbaI; electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose, Tris-acetate-EDTA gel; transferred to Hybond-N+; and then probed with the 0.3-kb cDNA fragment encompassing exons 4–7 (from the KpnI site to the location of primer RT-AS, Fig. 1a). The probe labeling, hybridization, and washing were as described for the library screening. The membranes were then exposed to Hyperfilm at –80 °C with intensifying screens for 12 h. RNA Isolation—RNA was extracted from various organs and primary cultures of aortic SMCs with TRIzol reagent as recommended by the supplier. Pituitary glands, adrenal glands, aortas, and ovaries were pooled (n = 3–5) prior to RNA isolation. Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—Five micrograms each of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by a Superscript II reverse transcriptase with a random primer (Invitrogen) following the supplier's instruction. PCR was with a recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using 2 μl each of the 20-μl reverse transcription (RT) reactions as the template unless otherwise specified. To isolate cDNA fragments containing full-length coding sequences, PCR of 40 cycles was accomplished with the cerebellar RT reaction with an Ex-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and primers listed in Table I (first set). Amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into a pGEM-Teasy TA cloning vector (Promega) and used for further analyses. The expression of GC-B1 and GC-B2 mRNA and the expression of GC-B1 and GC-B3 mRNA were detected by PCR with primers listed in Table I (second and third sets). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) mRNA was detected by PCR using 1 μl of the RT reaction and a mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Control Amplimer Set (Clontech) as internal control. The cycle number in each PCR was determined as amplification is in the exponential phase: 35 cycles for GC-B1 and GC-B2, 27 cycles for GC-B1 and GC-B3, and 25 cycles for Gapdh. Transcripts of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms (SM1 and SM2) (24.Hasegawa K. Arakawa E. Oda S. Matsuda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) were detected by PCR with the primers listed in Table I (fourth set); the cycle number of the PCR was 35. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose, Tris-acetate-EDTA gels, detected by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified by a Multi Image Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech). For some experiments, the gels were transferred to Hybond-N+ and detected by 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes located between the primers without containing the primer sequences: 5′-TGCAGTTTGGCAACTCGGATCGC-3′ for GC-B1 and GC-B2, 5′-GCAGAGAAGCAGATTTGGTGGACAG-3′ for GC-B1 and GC-B3, and 5′-GCCTTGACTGTGCCGTTGAATTTGCCGTGA-3′ for Gapdh; the hybridization and wash were at 42 °C. The 0.7-kb cDNA fragment corresponding to the C-terminal half of the ECD and the TM of GC-B, which was used as the probe for Northern blot analyses, was amplified for 40 cycles with the primers for GC-B1 and GC-B3 (Table I) and subcloned in a pGEM-Teasy vector.Table IList of primersmRNA speciesAmplification lengthAnnealing temperaturePrimersbp°CGC-B13,21360Sense: ATG-S, 5′-CTGCTCTATCCCCATGGCACTG-3′, -13 to +9aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.GC-B23,138Antisense: AS18, 5′-ATTGCCCATCCAAGTACCAGC-3′, +3200 to +3180aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.GC-B33,393GC-B136260Sense: E8S1, 5′-GAAGCTGATGCTGGAGAAGGAGC-3′, +1448 to +1470aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.GC-B2287Antisense: E11AS, 5′-GACAATACTCGGTGACAATGCAG-3′, +1809 to +1787aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.GC-B169257Sense: RT-S, 5′-AACGGGCGCATTGTGTATATCTGCGGC-3′, +669 to +695aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.GC-B3872Antisense: RT-AS, 5′-TTATCACAGGATGGGTCGTCCAAGTCA-3′, +1360 to +1334aNucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.SM137260Sense: SM-S, 5′-TGGAGGAGCAGGTTGAACAG-3′, +5581 to +5600bNucleotide numbers of the murine smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-1 (SM1) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D85923) (24).SM2411Antisense: SM1-AS, 5′-TTTCAATAACTCTACGGCCC-3′, +5991 to +5972bNucleotide numbers of the murine smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-1 (SM1) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D85923) (24).a Nucleotide numbers of murine GC-B1 cDNA where the adenine of the translational initiation codon is designated as +1.b Nucleotide numbers of the murine smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-1 (SM1) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D85923) (24.Hasegawa K.

Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (20 μg unless otherwise specified) was denatured by the formamide method; separated on a 1.0% agarose, MOPS gel; and transferred to Hybond-N. The 0.7-kb murine GC-B cDNA probe was labeled, and the hybridization and wash were as described for the library screening. The membranes were then exposed to Hyperfilm at –80 °C with intensifying screens for 48 h. Expression Vector Construction—Complementary DNA clones of each murine GC-B isoform (GC-B1, GC-B2, and GC-B3) were distinguished by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The 3.4-kb insert was isolated from pGEM/mGC-B3 after EcoRI digestion and ligated into the EcoRI site of a pCMV5 expression vector, generated from a pCMV1 vector through deletion of the HpaI-EcoRI fragment from the SV40 origin region (25.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to make pCMV5/mGC-B3. About 2.2-kb SmaI-EcoRI fragments of the inserts of pGEM/mGC-B1 and pGEM/mGC-B2, in which three GC-B isoforms are different from each other, were ligated between the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK(+) vectors (Stratagene). The SmaI-EcoRV fragments of resultant plasmids were used to replace the 2.4-kb SmaI-EcoRV fragment of the pCMV5/mGC-B3, which generated pCMV5/mGC-B1 and -B2; the EcoRV site existed outside the EcoRI cloning sites. To generate expression vectors with epitope tags, the SacII and HpaI sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) at nucleotides +55 to +60 and +68 to +73, respectively, on pCMV5/mGC-B1, pCMV5/mGC-B2, or pCMV5/mGC-B3; nucleotide +66 is the last nucleotide of the signal peptide sequence (Fig. 2a). Linkers encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK: sense, 5′-CGGGGGCAGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTGCCCCCGGC-3′), the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL: sense, 5′-CGGGGGCAGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGCGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCTGCCCCCGGC-3′), and the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA: sense, 5′-CGGGGGCATACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTCGG-3′; antisense 5′-CCGAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATGCCCCCGGC-3′) were inserted between the SacII and HpaI sites of the mutated expression vectors to generate pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B1, pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B2, pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B3, pCMV5/Myc-mGC-B2, and pCMV5/HA-mGC-B3. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown to 30–50% confluency in 100-mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. The cells were then transfected with one or a combination of pCMV5 (mock), pCMV5/mGC-B1, pCMV5/mGC-B2, pCMV5/mGC-B3, pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B1, pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B2, pCMV5/FLAG-mGC-B3, pCMV5/Myc-mGC-B2, or pCMV5/HA-mGC-B3 by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent following the supplier's instruction; plasmids of 5 μg in total were used for a 100-mm plate. The cells were transfected for 24 h, grown in the growth medium for another 24 h, and then used for the experiments. For some experiments, the cells were split into 12-well plates after transfection. Aortic SMCs were isolated from the thoracic and abdominal portion of the aorta of a male mouse at 5 weeks of age as described previously (26.Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). At passage 3, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and permeabilized with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% normal horse serum. Immunocytochemistry was with the anti-α-smooth muscle actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400) and anti-von Willebrand factor rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200) using a Vector M.O.M. immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories) and a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), respectively. Greater than 95% of the cells were positive for α-smooth muscle actin, and no cells positive for von Willebrand factor could be detected, indicating that the cells were predominantly SMCs with little contamination by endothelial cells. Estimation of Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—COS-7 cells transfected with GC-B isoform expression vectors were incubated with CNP at various concentrations or vehicle, and intracellular cGMP concentrations were estimated as described previously (13.Chrisman T.D. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Brains and lungs were isolated from mice at 5 weeks of age and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in 9 volumes (g wet weight/ml) of homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol). The membrane fraction was collected as a pellet after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in the homogenization buffer of the original volume, and the protein concentration was estimated by the BCA method (BCA Protein Assay kit, Pierce). GC activities in the membrane fraction of 40–80 μg of protein were estimated as described previously (13.Chrisman T.D. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Binding Assay—[Tyr0]CNP was iodinated by the chloramine-T method to give a specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol. COS-7 cells transfected with GC-B isoform expression vectors were prepared in 12-well plates as described above. The binding assay was with 125I-[Tyr0]CNP at 0.1–1 nm with or without 0.5 μm CNP to define nonspecific binding (27.Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblot analyses, membrane preparations were obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with GC-B isoform expression vectors as described previously (13.Chrisman T.D. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The preparation was solubilized in 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 40 μg/ml bromphenol blue) supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol during incubation at 60 °C for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min. Ten to 20 μg of protein/lane was electrophoretically solubilized in 4–15% gradient acrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P. GC-B isoforms were detected by the rabbit polyclonal anti-GC-B ECD serum (1:2,000), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:2,000), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (1:200), or rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (1: 3,000) using an ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) with horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Biosource, 1:100,000); Hyperfilm was exposed for 15 s–10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were solubilized in 150 μl/plate solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) by passing the solution 20 times through a 25-guage needle followed by incubation on ice for 1 h. The solution was then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid of 400 μl was then combined with 40 μl of prewashed, agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma, 1:1 suspension in the solubilization buffer) in the presence or absence of a FLAG peptide, added to block binding to the anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitation was for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was washed three times in the solubilization buffer and eluted in the 2× sample buffer by incubation for 5 min at 60 °C. The eluate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min and incubated with 100 mm dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to immunoblot analyses as described above. Deglycosylation of GC-B—The plasma membrane fraction from COS-7 cells (confluent, 100-mm plate) expressing each GC-B isoform was solubilized in 100 μl of 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol by boiling for 10 min. Thirty microliters of each of the solubilized membrane fractions were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 with or without peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding ⅕ volume of 5× sample buffer (313 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bromphenol blue), incubating at 60 °C for 10 min, and then subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses of data were performed by GraphPad Prism Version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Data of GC activities were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's posttest, and dose-response curves were drawn by a nonlinear regression analysis of the sigmoid dose-response type. Structure of Npr2 Gene—The murine GC-B (Npr2) gene is greater than 20 kb and consists of 22 exons and 21 introns (Fig. 1a). All exon-intron and intron-exon boundaries follow the GT and AG rule (Table II) (28.Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar), and only one gene exists based on Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1b). The gene structure is well conserved between murine and human (29.Takahashi Y. Nakayama T. Soma M. Izumi Y. Kanmatsuse K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in that genes from both species consist of the same number of exons with introns located at the same positions (Table III). Both species also have a long second intron of about 6.5 kb (Table III). The organization of the closely related GC-A receptor gene of mice, rats, and humans is also highly conserved in structural organization (29.Takahashi Y. Nakayama T. Soma M. Izumi Y. Kanmatsuse K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Gu Y.C. Pandey K.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

MC diversity and function is regulated by exogenous nitric oxide; however, the production and function of endogenously produced NO in MC is enigmatic. We used rat peritoneal MC (PMC) as an in vivo model to examine intracellular NO production.

Mast cells are immune effector cells located at strategic tissue sites, juxtaposed to vessels, epithelium, and nerves. These phenotypic and functionally heterogeneous cells release granule-associated mediators (e.g. histamine) and various newly formed molecules (e.g. phospholipid metabolites and cytokines) that play roles in innate and adaptive immune responses (1.Wedemeyer J.

Rosenwasser L.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S799-S804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The TH1 cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) inhibits MC function, and dysregulation of IFN-γ contributes to atopy and asthma (2.Busse W.W. Rosenwasser L.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S799-S804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). IFN-γ modulation of cell phenotype is complex and involves regulation of gene expression (3.Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) including the enzyme GTP-cyclohydrolase I (CHI), which produces tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (4.Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar).BH4 is a critical factor in the production of the neurotransmitters serotonin, catecholamines, and other cellular activities including proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation (4.Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The majority of cellular BH4 is synthesized de novo from GTP with CHI being rate-limiting (4.Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). CHI activity is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription and phosphorylation, and can be inhibited by the CHI feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) (5.Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hultner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6.Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BH4 is also an essential co-factor in NO formation from nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), and increases in NOS transcription and activity need to be accompanied by a concurrent increase in BH4 to sustain NO production (7.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).NO is a reactive radical with pleotrophic effects with both physiological and pathological functions (8.Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). NO is formed from l-arginine by the NOS family of isozymes that are subdivided on the basis of their Ca2+ dependence and transcriptional inducibility. Ca2+-dependent members include endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), characterized by constitutive expression and low NO production. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is up-regulated by a variety of inflammatory mediators and functions independently of cellular Ca2+ levels and releases large amounts of NO (8.Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar).MC functions including degranulation and adhesion can be regulated by exogenous NO (9.Coleman J.W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that rat peritoneal MC (PMC) also constitutively express eNOS and can up-regulate iNOS and produce NO (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar). More recent in vivo studies have implicated MC as a significant source of NO in vascular tissues, likely through nNOS (11.Kashiwagi S. Kajimura M. Yoshimura Y. Suematsu M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: e55-e64Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MC produce low amounts of NO, implying a paracrine, intracellular function. However, the roles for MC-derived NO remain poorly defined. Furthermore, our previous study showed that diverse stimuli induced differing levels of NO release from MC, despite similar induction of NOS (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, other regulatory events are responsible for differences in the time course, quantities, and outcomes of MC-derived NO (12.Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G315-G321PubMed Google Scholar). Because no data are available on the role that BH4 plays in NO production by MC, we hypothesized that post-transcriptional regulation of NOS activity by BH4 is a critical determinant in NO production by MC.The purpose of this study was 2-fold. First, to characterize both short term (<5 min) Ca2+-dependent constitutive NOS (cNOS) activity and sustained NO formation (>18 h) in MC using the fluorescent NO-sensitive probe diaminofluorescein (DAF). Second, to investigate the effects of CHI activity and BH4 levels in both short term (<5 min) and sustained (>18 h) NO production on MC reactivity. We demonstrate for the first time that a proportion of rat PMC dynamically activate intracellular Ca2+-dependent NOS activity (<5 min) after Ag stimulation, which inhibits degranulation. Furthermore, IFN-γ treatment enhances long term (>18 h) intracellular NO production, which also inhibits MC degranulation. MC constitutively express CHI mRNA and protein, and upon stimulation with IFN-γ, PMC up-regulate CHI mRNA and protein with a concordant increase in CHI activity. IFN-γ also decreases GFRP mRNA levels. The final outcome of these events is an increased level of NO production after IFN-γ treatment. Thus, modulation of MC BH4 levels controls NO formation and influences MC degranulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD (SD) BR) rats were obtained from Charles River Canada Inc. (Quebec, Canada). For experiments requiring antigen stimulation, the rats were sensitized with L3 larvae of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis 5-6 weeks before MC isolation (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental procedures were approved by the University Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.Chemicals—The NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione, and CHI inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The sepiapterin reductase inhibitor N-acetyl serotonin was obtained from Sigma, the pterin donor l-sepiapterin was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and the NO probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM) and Ca2+-sensitive dye FURA-2 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Antigen—Ag used to activate in vivo sensitized PMC was a collection of soluble excretory and secretory products of the nematode N. brasiliensis, prepared as previously described (13.Lee T.D. Shanahan F. Miller H.R. Bienenstock J. Befus A.D. Immunology. 1985; 55: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). The antigen concentration was described as worm equivalents (WE)/ml.MC Isolation and Stimulation—PMC were obtained by peritoneal lavage followed by centrifugation through gradient Percoll as previously described (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar). PMC purity was >98% as determined by staining with toluidine blue. Cell viability was >99%. For most experiments PMC from unsensitized rats were treated with medium containing IFN-γ (200 units/ml) (Invitrogen). For studies of MC secretion, PMC from N. brasiliensis sensitized rats were treated with Ag (5 WE/ml).Live Cell Fluorescence Determination of Intracellular NO and Ca2+ Production—NO production by PMC was assayed using DAF-FM, a cell-permeable NO-sensitive fluorescent dye (14.Suzuki N. Kojima H. Urano Y. Kikuchi K. Hirata Y. Nagano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Coverslip-bottomed Petri dishes (Falcon) were coated with rat plasma fibronectin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 37 °C. PMC were loaded with 10 μm of DAF-FM. For Ca2+ experiments, PMC were loaded with FURA-2 (5 μm) and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 without phenol red and placed in dishes and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before use.The cell images were obtained using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510) using a 488-nm (excitation) and 505-530-nm (emission) filter set for DAF and a 340-nm (excitation) and 530-nm (emission) filter set for FURA-2, with a 40 × 1.3 oil Plan-Neofluar objective that was maintained at a constant 37 °C with a heating ring. Ag (5 WE/ml) was added to the cells, and DAF/FURA-2 fluorescence intensity was determined in real time, with 1-s exposures obtained every 5 s to avoid photobleaching. Because DAF fluorescence is almost linear with NO concentration, quantitative analysis of each cell (8-15 cells/experiment) was obtained by averaging the peak relative fluorescent intensity (optical density arbitrary units) (15.Itoh Y. Ma F.H. Hoshi H. Oka M. Noda K. Ukai Y. Kojima H. Nagano T. Toda N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The percentage of change in fluorescence from base line (ΔF) was calculated by the equation ΔF = (Fb - F/Fb) × 100, where Fb is the basal fluorescence obtained from the frame before the addition of stimulus, and F is the fluorescence obtained after activation. The cells were defined as degranulating when they had ruffled membranes and had visibly extruded granules as previously described (16.Williams R.M. Shear J.B. Zipfel W.R. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1835-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Frame number and time reference were calculated using frame-by-frame analysis with MetaFluor imaging software (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown, PA). In some experiments the NOS inhibitor l-NAME or the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione was added 30 min before loading with DAF as negative and positive controls, respectively.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from PMC and pretreated with heparinase I (Sigma) as previously described (17.Gilchrist M. MacDonald A.J. Neverova I. Ritchie B. Befus A.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed on a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Boston, MA). The primers were designed to be intron-spanning based on published sequence data: CHI, sense, 5′-GATACCAGGAGACCATCTCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TAGCATGGTGCTAG TGACAG-3′ (PCR product, 370 bp); and GFRP, sense, 5′-CCACTCACCATGCCCTACCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCAGCAAGGTTCCTGAGGCT-3′ (PCR product, 369 bp). The conditions for PCR amplification were as follows: denaturing at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The optimized annealing temperature was 48 °C for CHI and 50 °C for GFRP. The products were run on a 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma).Cloning and Sequencing of cDNA Bands—The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1™ plasmid vector using the T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated with the GenElute™ Plasmid isolation kit (Sigma). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed using M13 forward and reverse primers. Sequencing was conducted using an ABI 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by a dideoxy chain termination method.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Using an External Standard—The linearized plasmid DNA containing the cloned inserts was used as a homologous amplification standard for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Absorbance measurements at 260 nm were used to calculate the number of copies/μl. Known dilutions of the standard were amplified in concert with the unknown samples and separated by agarose electrophoresis. Band densitometry (SigmaGel, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) was used to compare the intensities of the standards to the unknowns to obtain the relative number of copies/μl.Western Blot Analysis—PMC were incubated in 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well for 0-18 h in various experimental conditions. The cells were dissociated in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40). The total protein content was determined by the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad). Fifteen μg of protein from each sample was mixed with Laemmli buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). CHI was identified with rat monoclonal anti-CHI (6H11) (I. Ziegler, Munchen, Germany) (5.Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hultner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) diluted 1/500 (1 μg/ml) and 1/5000 in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Labeling was detected by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal substrate solution (Pierce). The resulting bands were scanned and quantified in a gel scanner (ImageMaster DTS; Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Detection of CHI—Localization of CHI in PMC was performed on PMC fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were blocked for 30 min with 10% fetal bovine serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of rat monoclonal CHI antibody (6H11). Specific antibody binding was detected with rhodamine red-labeled goat anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Negative controls labeled with isotype (rat IgG1) antibody were run concurrently.Enzyme Assay for CHI Activity—The activity of CHI was determined on homogenized cell extracts as previously described (5.Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hultner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction product was oxidized to neopterin triphosphate by acidic iodine solution. After reduction of excess iodine by ascorbic acid, the sample was immediately separated by ion pair reverse phase HPLC. Neopterin was then determined by reverse phase HPLC.Measurement ofNO2-Production—NO2- in culture (phenol red-free) supernatants was measured by the Griess reaction (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar).β-Hexosaminidase Assay—β-Hexosaminidase (β-hex) release was investigated as a functional measure of the BH4/NO effects on granule mediator secretion as has been previously described (18.Kulka M. Gilchrist M. Duszyk M. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 54-64PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were performed at least three times. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test for comparisons. p values < 0.01 were considered significant.On-line Supplemental Material—Real time images of degranulation and NO production in Ag/IgE-stimulated MC are shown in the on-line supplemental video. The video image was obtained over a 4-min period, with 1-s exposures every 5 s. The video was compressed 10 times using Adobe Premiere (Adobe Systems Canada, Ottawa, Canada). The images were captured using a 40× objective on a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. The video shows a flux of green DAF fluorescence in a proportion of MC, which is correlated with inhibition of degranulation. MC that are negative for DAF degranulate quickly.RESULTSSustained (>18 h) Intracellular Production of NO in IFN-γ-treated PMC—To confirm that IFN-γ treated PMC produced NO, we utilized the NO-specific fluorescent molecule DAF. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that IFN-γ caused an increase in intracellular DAF fluorescence after 18 h of treatment compared with controls. The DAF fluorescence localized to cytoplasmic and occasionally to perinuclear sites (Fig. 1A).Real Time Confocal Analysis of IgE-mediated Degranulation and NO Production—Next we wanted to assess constitutive NOS activity because there is evidence that MC possess cNOS activity (19.Hogaboam C.M. Befus A.D. Wallace J.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3767-3774PubMed Google Scholar). To study this short term (<5 min) NOS activity, its modulation, and association with degranulation, we developed a real time assay to detect DAF fluorescence and analyze dynamic changes in NO production by individual cells. PMC were isolated and loaded with DAF (10 μm). A large proportion of unstimulated PMC showed weak DAF fluorescence, with an occasional cell (<2%) having stronger cytoplasmic fluorescence. PMC showed no visible signs of degranulation, because their membranes were intact and showed no signs of granule release as noted in other MC live cell studies (16.Williams R.M. Shear J.B. Zipfel W.R. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1835-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Stimulation with Ag (5 WE/ml) caused an increase in the number of degranulating cells. Degranulating PMC did not shown any increases in DAF fluorescence (Fig 1B and the supplemental video). Interestingly a proportion (33.1 ± 2.2%, mean ± S.E. of 116 total cells in eight different experiments) of PMC showed an immediate (<2 min) increase in NO production (DAF fluorescence) and no visible signs of degranulation. DAF fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm of these cells, and a population of strong NO producing cells showed intense nuclear positivity (Fig. 1B and the supplemental video). Although the strong DAF fluorescence cells showed no sign of degranulation after 60 min of observation, some of the less positive cells eventually did show degranulation. Regression analysis comparing these weaker DAF fluorescent PMC to time of degranulation showed a highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.7056, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). Equal loading of PMC with DAF was confirmed by adding the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (100 μm); after 20 min almost all PMC showed strong cytoplasmic staining with DAF (data not shown). Interestingly, no nuclear localization of DAF fluorescence was seen after adding this exogenous NO source. Specificity of the effect was determined by pretreating PMC with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (100 μm); these cells showed no flux of DAF fluorescence (data not shown). These results support the hypothesis that PMC possess cNOS activity that can be stimulated in the short term (<5 min) in a proportion of cells by IgE cross-linking. Our data also suggest that immediate NO production by PMC causes inhibition of mediator release.Ca2+ Flux and NO Production in PMC—The results above may involve constitutive NOS (eNOS or nNOS) activity in PMC (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar). Because both eNOS and nNOS are Ca2+-dependent, we wished to determine whether increases in intracellular Ca2+ precede the flux of NO seen in Ag/IgE-treated PMC. PMC were isolated and loaded with both DAF (10 μm) and the Ca2+-sensitive dye FURA-2 (5 μm). As has been previously shown, upon stimulation with Ag (5 WE/ml), all PMC showed an increase in FURA-2 fluorescence beginning within 30 s (Fig. 1B) (20.Mori S. Saino T. Satoh Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2000; 63: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). DAF fluorescence in strong NO producing cells was delayed by almost 20 s on average compared with FURA-2 (Fig. 1D). However, DAF fluorescence in degranulating MC showed little change (Fig. 1E) Interestingly, although PMC were heterogeneous in their DAF positivity, all cells were homogenous in their Ca2+ flux (Fig. 1, D and E). This indicates that Ca2+ flux precedes short term NO production in nondegranulating, Ag-treated PMC.GTP-CHI/GFRP mRNA Expression in PMC—We recently showed that rat PMC treated with IFN-γ could be stimulated to express iNOS mRNA (10.Gilchrist M. Savoie M. Nohara O. Wills F.L. Wallace J.L. Befus A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 618-624PubMed Google Scholar); however, no data exist concerning the expression of CHI or GFRP in in vivo derived MC. mRNA production was thus determined using RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. PMC constitutively express significant CHI and GFRP mRNA. (Fig. 2). All of the PCRs were negative when the RT step was eliminated, indicating that there was no contamination from genomic DNA (data not shown). Cloned PCR amplicons were sequenced and showed >98% identity with published sequences by BLAST (NCBI) analysis.Fig. 2Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of CHI (A) and GFRP (B) mRNA expression in PMC treated with IFN-γ (200 units/ml). RNA from IFN-γ-treated PMC were isolated at indicated time points and analyzed by RT-PCR versus known concentrations of homologous cloned standard. Band densitometries from the standards were used to determine the relative copy number (rcn) in each of the IFN-γ-treated samples. Graphic representation of the time course with responses plotted as relative copy number. The data are from one representative experiment. Similar results were seen with three separate batches of PMC (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Differential Regulation of GTP-CHI and GFRP mRNA—Because stimuli that increase NOS expression often induce a concordant increase in de novo BH4 production (7.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we looked at CHI and GFRP mRNA regulation by IFN-γ. Total RNA was extracted from unstimulated PMC (>98% pure) and from PMC treated in vitro with IFN-γ (200 units/ml). CHI and GFRP mRNA production was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR versus a standard curve constructed with known copy numbers of cloned inserts amplified under identical PCR conditions. Within 2 h following treatment with IFN-γ, the CHI signal in PMC increased ∼3-fold. Levels of CHI mRNA reached maximal expression at 6 h and continued to increase to 18 h (Fig. 2A). No change in CHI mRNA was noted in unstimulated PMC at similar time points (data not shown). GFRP mRNA expression from IFN-γ-treated PMC was significantly down-regulated beginning at 2 h and continued until at least 18 h of treatment (Fig. 2B). The results are from PMC RNA obtained from three independent batches of cells.CHI Protein Expression—To further evaluate whether the actions of IFN-γ on GTP-CHI mRNA levels were extended to protein expression, Western blot analysis was employed. Unstimulated PMC constitutively produced a band of 30 kDa detected by the antibody 6H11 (Fig. 3A). Exposure of PMC to IFN-γ produced a significant increase in CHI protein expression, with maximal stimulation between 6 and 18 h. Again unstimulated PMC cultured during the same time showed no increase in CHI protein expression. Furthermore, PMC stimulated with Ag/IgE also showed no detectable change in protein expression (data not shown).Fig. 3CHI protein analysis.A, Western blot analysis using anti-CHI antibody (6H11) with 15 μg of total cell lysate obtained from PMC treated with IFN-γ (200 units/ml) for the indicated times. As a control, lysates from untreated PMC incubated for identical times were also analyzed. The results are representative of three separate experiments. B, confocal analysis of CHI localization in sham control and IFN-γ-treated PMC. Differential interference contrast (DIC) shows cell in the field. CHI immunofluorescence is shown in red.

Unstimulated PMC from naïve rats showed a clear plasma membrane pattern with some nuclear immunofluorescence in occasional cells. Membrane staining was confirmed by imaging en face 0.5-μm sections through each cell. This stacked series of multiple images was deconvoluted and three-dimensionally reconstructed using Zeiss LSM 510 software. PMC stimulated with IFN-γ, on the other hand, showed a pronounced increase in cytosolic immunofluorescence while maintaining membrane and some nuclear labeling (Fig. 3B).CHI Enzymatic Activity—To determine the functional consequences of IFN-γ treatment, we determined CHI enzymatic activity, employing a HPLC-based assay as previously described (5.Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hultner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

The pKa values extracted from the curves are apparent parameters, presumably affected by the nearby charged residues, and do not reflect the ionization of a simple catalytic histidine as found in the classic serine peptidases like chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The temperature dependence of kcat/Km did not produce linear Arrhenius plots, indicating different changes in the individual rate constants with the increase in temperature.

The results have revealed the relationship between the complex Michaelis parameters and the individual rate constants. Structure determination of the enzyme-substrate complexes has shown that the different substrates display a uniform binding mode. None of the glutamic acids interacts with a charged group. We conclude that the specific rate constant is controlled by k1 rather than k2 and that the charged residues from the substrate and the enzyme can markedly affect the formation but not the structure of the enzyme-substrate complexes.

Prolyl oligopeptidase is a member of a relatively new group of serine peptidases unrelated to the well known trypsin and subtilisin families (1.Rennex D. Hemmings B.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2.Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem.

Central Nervous System Agents. 2002; 2: 251-257Crossref Google Scholar). The new family includes enzymes of different specificities like the prolyl oligopeptidase itself, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl-peptidase, and oligopeptidase B (5.Polgár L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These enzymes selectively cleave substrates that are no longer than ∼30 amino acid residues in total. Prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) is implicated in the metabolism of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (6.Wilk S. Life Sci. 1983; 33: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7.Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 251-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8.Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B.

The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase has also been associated with depression (13.Maes M. Goossens F. Scharpá S. Meltzer H.Y. D'Hondt P. Cosyns P. Biol. Psychiatry. 1994; 35: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14.Williams R.S.B. Eames M. Ryves W.J. Viggars J. Harwood A.J.

Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1461-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The crystal structure determination of prolyl oligopeptidase has revealed that the carboxyl-terminal peptidase domain of the enzyme displays an α/β hydrolase fold and that its catalytic triad (Ser-554, His-680, and Asp-641) is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual β-propeller (16.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Recent engineering of the enzyme provided evidence for a novel strategy of regulation in which oscillating propeller blades act as a gating filter during catalysis, letting small peptide substrates into the active site while excluding large proteins, thereby preventing accidental proteolysis in the cytosol (17.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Polgár L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The active site region of prolyl oligopeptidase exhibits several charged residues such as Arg-643, Asp-642, Arg-252, Asp-149, and Arg-128. The complex electrostatic environment created by these residues may considerably influence the binding and thus the specificity of substrates. We have determined previously that, principally, five subsites of the enzyme (S3–S2′) interact with a polypeptide substrate (18.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1262-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work we have examined the effects of charged residues at different subsites. Because of the mainly positive environment around the active site, we substituted glutamic acid for the residues of the internally quenched substrate Abz 1The abbreviations used are: Abz2.aminobenzoylPhe(NO2)p-nitrophenylalanineNap2-naphthylamideZbenzyloxycarbonyl.-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala, as the leader peptide, where Abz and Phe(NO2) were the fluorescent donor and the quencher, respectively. 2.aminobenzoyl p-nitrophenylalanine 2-naphthylamide benzyloxycarbonyl. Enzyme Preparations—Prolyl oligopeptidase from porcine brain and its variants S554A and R252S were expressed in Escherichia coli JM105 cells and purified as described previously (19.Szeltner Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42613-42622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations were determined at 280 nm (3.Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Prolyl Oligopeptidases. Academic Press, New York1994: 188-200Google Scholar). Kinetics—The reaction of prolyl oligopeptidase with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Bachem Ltd., Bubendorf, Switzerland) was measured fluorometrically using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier four-position multicell holder accessory and a temperature controller. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Cells with excitation and emission path lengths of 1 and 0.4 cm, respectively, were used. The substrates with internally quenched fluorescence, Abz-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala and its derivatives, were prepared with solid phase synthesis, and their hydrolyzes were followed as in the case of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, except that the excitation and emission wavelengths were 337 and 420 nm, respectively. The pseudo-first order rate constants were measured at substrate concentrations lower than 0.1 Km and calculated by non-linear regression data analysis using the GraFit software (21.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Version 5. Erythacus Software, Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar). The specificity rate constants (kcat/Km) were obtained by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant by the total enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture. The Michaelis-Menten parameters (kcat and Km) were determined with initial rate measurements using substrate concentrations in the Km value range of 0.2–5. The kinetic parameters were calculated with nonlinear regression analysis. With substrates exhibiting very low Km values, initial rates below the Km could not be measured; therefore, the parameters were calculated from a single progress curve using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (22.Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 44-47Google Scholar, 23.Polgár L. Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Laboratory Manual on Proteolytic Enzymes: Tools and Targets.

Theoretical curves for the bell-shaped pH rate profiles were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1 and the GraFit software (21.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Version 5. Erythacus Software, Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar). In Equation 1, shown here,kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)(1/(1+10pK1-pH+10pH-pK2))(Eq. 1) kcat/Km(limit) stands for the pH-independent maximum rate constant, and K1 and K2 are the dissociation constants of the catalytically competent base and acid, respectively. When an additional ionizing group modifies the bell-shaped character of the pH dependence curve, the data were fitted to Equation 2 (doubly bell-shaped curve), shown here,kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)1(1/(1+10pK1-pH+10pH-pK2))+kcat/Km(limit)2(1/(1+10pK2-pH+10pH-pK3))(Eq. 2) where the limiting values stand for the pH-independent maximum rate constants for two active forms of the enzyme, and K1, K2, and K3 are the apparent dissociation constants of the enzymatic groups whose state of ionization controls the rate constants. The points for the rate constants for the substrate with Arg at position P2 were fitted to Equation 3, depicted here,kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)1(1/(1+10pK1-pH+10pH-pK2))+kcat/Km(limit)2(1/(1+10pK2-pH))(Eq. 3) which is composed of a bell-shaped and a sigmoid term. Extraction of Individual Rate Constants from Nonlinear Temperature Dependence—Deviation from the linearity of an Arrhenius plot may be indicative of changes in rate-limiting steps, which allows for resolution of the individual rate constants that compose kcat/Km as defined by Equations 4 and 5 (24.Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25.Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E.

Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that the substrate dissociates more slowly from its complex formed with the enzyme than it reacts to yield product (i.e. stickiness is high if k–1 < k2). It follows from Equation 5 that kcat/Km approximates k1 whenever α » 1. The temperature dependence of the rate constants can be obtained from Equation 6 (24.Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), presented here,kcat/Km=k1,0exp((-E1/R)(1/T-1/T0))q/(1+q)(Eq. 6) where q = α0exp((Eα/R(1/T – 1/T0)), k1,0 is the value of k1 at the reference temperature T0 = 298.15 K, E1 is the activation energy associated with k1, and Eα = E–1 – E2. From the temperature dependence of kcat/Km, the value of k1 and the ratio of k2/k–1 can be obtained together with the corresponding activation energies. Because T0 can be set to any value, the parameters can be calculated for various temperatures. Thermodynamic Parameters—The temperature dependence of kcat/Km and kcat were determined between 10 and 40 °C at concentrations of 2–20 nm prolyl oligopeptidase. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated from Eyring plots as shown in Equation 7,ln(k/T)=ln(R/NAh)+ΔS*/R-ΔH*/RT(Eq. 7) where k is the rate constant, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the absolute temperature, NA is the Avogadro number (6.022 × 1023/mol), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10–34 J·s), the enthalpy of activation ΔH* = –(slope) × 8.3 14 J/mol, and the entropy of activation ΔS* = (intercept – 23.76) × 8.3 14 J/mol·K. Equation 8, shown here,ΔG*'=ΔH*-TΔS*(Eq. 8) demonstrates how the free energy of activation, ΔG*, was calculated. Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, and Structure Refinement— The peptides with the S554A variant of prolyl oligopeptidase were co-crystallized using the conditions established for the wild type enzyme (16.Fülöp V.

X-ray diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (27.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The Effects of Glu at Various P Sites—We have shown previously that succinyl-Gly-Pro-4-nitroanilide is much worse as a substrate than Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (20.Szeltner Z. Rea D. Renner V. Fülöp V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42613-42622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In light of the basic environment of the active site, a rationale for the large difference may be the effect of the negative charge of the succinyl group. Therefore, we examined the effects on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the glutamic acid residue located at various sites of the leader peptide, Abz-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Arg-Ala, which corresponds to the P1-P4 amino acids of bradykinin, a possible natural substrate. Our previous x-ray crystallographic studies on the binding of an octapeptide indicated that the P3-P2′ residues were clearly associated with the enzyme, whereas the P4 residue might bind weakly (18.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1262-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Yet, we have also extended the position of Glu toward subsites 4 and 5, because it is known from the three-dimensional structure of prolyl oligopeptidase (20.Szeltner Z. Rea D. Renner V. Fülöp V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42613-42622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that Arg-252 and Arg-128 are not far from the binding site so that they may form appropriate subsites for the binding of Glu in those positions. We have also analyzed the effects of the opposite charge by using Arg at the P2 position. Fig. 1 illustrates the pH dependences of kcat/Km for the substrates containing P2 Arg and P2, P3, P4, and P5 Glu residues. The P2 Arg has a high pH optimum. The pH dependence does not follow a simple ionization curve, as indicated by the points deviated at low pH. The reaction of the peptide with a Glu residue at positions P2 or P4, in particular at P4, conforms to a double bell curve, whereas at positions P3 and P5 simple bell-shaped curves are displayed. The acidic limb of the pH dependence curve for substrates with Glu is shifted toward the lower pH region. The further the Glu is from the scissile bond, the greater the shift. The parameters of the pH dependence curves are shown in Table II, which also shows the kinetic parameters kcat and Km. The Km is highest for the peptide with P3 Glu and lowest with P2 Arg. This suggests that poor binding makes the peptide with P3 Glu the worst substrate of this series, whereas the best substrate that possesses a P2 Arg exhibits the strongest binding. The differences in the kcat values are less important. It may be noted that the carboxylterminal carboxyl group of the substrate does not affect the pH rate profiles because its ionization is outside of the pH range studied. Moreover, we did not observe any difference between the leader peptide and its amide derivative (not shown).Table IIKinetic and activation parameters for the reactions of prolyl oligopeptidaseParameterP2 ArgP2 GluP3 GluP4 GluP5 Glukcat (s-1)3.20 ± 0.092.40 ± 0.031.82 ± 0.031.70 ± 0.077.22 ± 0.21Km (μm)0.40 ± 0.071.54 ± 0.046.3 ± 0.21.32 ± 0.123.7 ± 0.3kcat/Km (μm-1 s-1)8 ± 1.41.55 ± 0.080.26 ± 0.011.56 ± 0.151.95 ± 0.17kcat/Km(lim)1 (μm-1 s-1)3.3 ± 1.11.2 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.3kcat/Km(lim)2 (μm-1 s-1)10.4 ± 0.43.4 ± 0.20.35 ± 0.012.9 ± 0.22.87 ± 0.03pK15.8 ± 0.55.1 ± 0.55.37 ± 0.074.7 ± 1.04.5 ± 0.1pK27.6 ± 0.27.1 ± 0.27.1 ± 0.3pK3>98.91 ± 0.088.73 ± 0.058.94 ± 0.098.68 ± 0.02pH optimum>8.57.977.96.6ΔH* (kJ/mol) for k1115.672.4102.280.7106ΔS* (J/mol·K) for k1274120202148238ΔG* (kJ/mol) for k133.836.44236.435.1ΔH* (kJ/mol) for kcat48.785.771.3ΔS* (J/mol·K) for kcat-7445.19.7ΔG* (kJ/mol) for kcat70.872.368.5 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Properties of the R252S Variant—Possible effects of Arg-252 on the kinetic parameters of the different substrates were examined by using the R252S variant, which eliminates a positive charge near the binding site. As seen from Table III it is the P3 Glu that is most affected, in particular in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. Interestingly, the rate constant for the P4 Glu substrate is not affected, and the rate constant for the neutral Z-Gly-Pro-Nap is only moderately decreased. Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence of kcat/Km for the P3 Glu substrate. It is seen that not just the value of the specificity rate constant but also its pH dependence has changed considerably. The alterations were less impressive with P4 Glu and P5 Glu. Nonetheless, it is clear from Table III and Fig. 2 that the electrostatic environment created by Arg-252 does influence the catalysis.Table IIIEffects of Arg252 on specificity rate constants for prolyl oligopeptidaseEnzymeP3 GluP4 GluP5 GluZ-Gly-Pro-Napμm-1s-1μm-1s-1μm-1s-1μm-1s-1Wild type0.332 (7)1.81 (7)3.09 (6.5)4.84 (8)R252S variant0.129 (6.5)1.80 (7.5)1.62 (7)3.77 (7.5)Wild type (NaCl)0.575 (7.6)5.50 (7.6)R252S0.125 (7)1.14 (7.8)variant (NaCl) Open table in a new tab Temperature Dependence of Rate Constants—To gain a deeper insight into the kinetic specificity of prolyl oligopeptidase, we have also investigated the temperature dependence of the catalysis. For each substrate the Arrhenius plot deviated from a straight line as shown in Fig. 3 for the substrates containing P2 Arg (Fig. 3A) and P3 Glu (Fig. 3B). It should be emphasized that the decline in the curve with the increase in temperature was not due to denaturation. Preincubation of the enzyme at high temperature for a longer time than that required for the activity measurement did not affect the value of the rate constant. The deviations from linearity were different for the various substrates, i.e. smaller with P2 Glu and greater with P2 Arg and P5 Glu, with P3 Glu and P4 Glu being intermediates. The nonlinear Arrhenius plot rendered it possible to determine the individual rate constants that compose kcat and Km (24.Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25.Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the moderate decline with P2 Glu did not permit us to extract precise k2/k-1 values from the curve. Unfortunately, above 40 °C the enzyme tended to denature, which prevented the accurate determination of the rate constants by using higher temperatures. It should be noted that conformational changes might also result in nonlinear Arrhenius plots (31.Massey V. Curti B. Ganther G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Fan X.Y. McPhie P. Miles E.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, sharp changes in slope were found at about 14 °C for d-amino acid oxidase; at the same temperature, sedimentation velocity and UV spectroscopy indicated a change in conformational state of the enzyme (31.Massey V. Curti B. Ganther G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present case, however, the data points fit well to the theoretical curve, which is not expected when conformational changes predominate. In addition, the activation energies seem to be independent of temperature as required in the short temperature range employed here, whereas reactions with different enzyme conformations could proceed with different activation energies. It is likely, however, that conformational changes are associated with the change in the rate constants. A further problem may arise from the cis-trans isomerization of proline-containing substrates (3.Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Prolyl Oligopeptidases. Academic Press, New York1994: 188-200Google Scholar, 33.Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4480-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which may also change with the increase of temperature. However, our experimental conditions were not rate-determining for cistrans isomerization (3.Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Prolyl Oligopeptidases. Academic Press, New York1994: 188-200Google Scholar). The kinetic (k1, k2/k-1) and activation (E1, E-1 – E2) parameters calculated from the temperature dependence of kcat/Km are listed in Table IV, which shows two interesting phenomena. First, the k1 is close to the specificity rate constant, independent of its value, and this suggests that the rate-limiting step is the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. This may be surprising, because usually the substrate binding is a very fast, diffusion-controlled process. In the present case, it appears that the nature of substrate controls the access to the active site. Secondly, the k1 values are not consistent with their activation energies (E1). For example, the higher k1 for P2 Arg is associated with a higher E1 compared with the E1 for the Glu-containing substrates having lower k1 values. Because the faster reaction displays too high an activation energy, the activation entropy should compensate for the unexpected effect.Table IVKinetic and activation parameters for the reactions of prolyl oligopeptidaseParameter15 °C20 °C25 °C30 °C35 °CP2 ArgapH 8.6. k1 (μm-1s-1)1.5 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.57.9 ± 1.517 ± 436 ± 9 k2/k-15 ± 22 ± 11.1 ± 0.40.6 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1 E1 (kJ/mol)118 ± 9120 ± 9120 ± 9118 ± 8118 ± 8 E-1 - E2 (kJ/mol)104 ± 5104 ± 5104 ± 5104 ± 5104 ± 6P2 Glu k1 (μm-1s-1)0.89 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.34.2 ± 0.86.8 ± 1.6 k2/k-163 ± 14928 ± 5613 ± 216 ± 83 ± 3 E1 (kJ/mol)75 ± 875 ± 875 ± 875 ± 875 ± 8 E-1 - E2 (kJ/mol)113 ± 51113 ± 51113 ± 51113 ± 51113 ± 51P3 GlubpH 7. k1 (μm-1s-1)0.064 ± 0.0140.13 ± 0.040.27 ± 0.100.55 ± 0.321.1 ± 0.8 k2/k-17.9 ± 9.94.9 ± 8.32.6 ± 4.11.4 ± 2.00.8 ± 1.0 E1 (kJ/mol)106 ± 24105 ± 21105 ± 18105 ± 21105 ± 21 E-1 - E2 (kJ/mol)92 ± 1494 ± 2295 ± 2394 ± 2294 ± 22P4 Glu k1 (μm-1s-1)0.81 ± 0.941.5 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.94.5 ± 1.97.7 ± 3.5 k2/k-116 ± 318 ± 133.7 ± 5.31.8 ± 2.30.8 ± 1.1 E1 (kJ/mol)83 ± 1783 ± 1783 ± 1783 ± 1783 ± 16 E-1 - E2 (kJ/mol)108 ± 31108 ± 31108 ± 31108 ± 31107 ± 35P5 Glu k1 (μm-1s-1)0.95 ± 0.042.05 ± 0.154.3 ± 0.58.9 ± 1.318 ± 3 k2/k-17.7 ± 2.23.3 ± 0.91.5 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.20.31 ± 0.08 E1 (kJ/mol)109 ± 6109 ± 6109 ± 6109 ± 6109 ± 6 E-1 - E2 (kJ/mol)119 ± 3119 ± 3119 ± 3119 ± 3119 ± 3a pH 8.6.b pH 7. Open table in a new tab The activation parameters (ΔH* and ΔS*) were calculated from Eyring plots (ln(k/T) versus 1/T), using the k1 values of Table IV. The plots gave perfectly straight lines (not shown), and the calculated parameters are shown in Table II. Indeed, the ΔS* is higher for the substrate having the P2 Arg compared with the ΔS* for the slower reactions of the Glu-containing substrates. Most importantly, the ΔS* values are positive for all substrates, which indicates that the transition states of the reactions are less ordered than the ground states, an atypical phenomenon in enzyme catalysis. The release on binding of the ordered water molecules that are associated with the substrates and the enzyme can account for the greatest portion of the highly positive values. Table II also shows ΔH* and ΔS* for kcat, which is characteristic of the breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex and does not principally involve the removal of water molecules. As expected, a negative ΔS* was obtained with the substrate containing P2 Arg. However, the rate constants for the negatively charged compounds display moderately or slightly positive values. Possibly, the enzyme-substrate complexes that include glutamic acids are more disordered, and their motions must be frozen out upon going to the transition state. Indeed, the ratios between side chain and main chain B-factors calculated from the crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate complexes are considerably higher in the P2 Glu and P4 Glu complexes than in P2 Arg (1.7, 1.6, and 1.2, respectively), indicating the higher mobility of the glutamate side chains. In contrast to the kcat/Km, the kcat yields linear Arrhenius plots (Fig. 4), which indicates that the substrate acylation is rate-limiting over the temperature range investigated and that k2 determines kcat (25.Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This plot yields k2 and E2, thereby allowing for resolution of six independent parameters as listed in Table V. In accordance with the above argument, the value of k2 agrees reasonably well with kcat calculated in a different way (Table II). The knowledge of k1 and k–1 renders it possible to calculate the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex (Ks = k–1/k1). In the reaction for the substrate with the P2 Arg, the Ks is practically the same as the Km value obtained from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Table II). The k1 and k–1 are considerably smaller with the P3 Glu, with the k1 decreasing to a greater extent. Hence, the difference between the Ks and Km is greater in this case. However, the k2 alters only slightly, so that the major difference between the two substrates resides in the formation and decomposition of the enzyme-substrate complex.Table VKinetic and activation parameters for the reactions of prolyl oligopeptidaseParameterP2 Arg (pH 8.6)P3 Glu (pH 7)P5 Glu (pH 7)k1 (μm-1s-1)7.9 ± 1.60.27 ± 0.102.9 ± 0.7k-1 (s-1)2.3 ± 0.10.49 ± 0.042.9 ± 0.2k2 (s-1)2.46 ± 0.091.27 ± 0.146.2 ± 0.3E1 (kJ/mol)120 ± 9105 ± 18120 ± 12E-1 (kJ/mol)163 ± 3195 ± 7190 ± 4E2 (kJ/mol)59 ± 3100 ± 774 ± 4Ks = k-1/k1 (μm)0.291.810.99 Open table in a new tab Substrate Binding Modes—Determination of the three-dimensional structures of the complexes formed between prolyl oligopeptidase and its substrates was essential for understanding the differences in the specificity rate constant. We have determined the crystal structures with substrates having P2 Arg and P2, P3, P4, and P5 Glu (Fig. 5). Instead of the wild type enzyme, we used the inactive prolyl oligopeptidase in which an alanine residue replaced the catalytic serine (18.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1262-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, during the long crystallization period the substrates were cleaved so that only the acyl parts of the substrates were seen in the electron density maps. These enzyme-product complexes share identical binding modes to the enzyme-substrate complexes determined previously (18.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1262-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the case of subtilisin modified also at the active site serine residue, an ∼106-fold decrease in activity was demonstrated with kinetic analysis (34.Carter P. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), indicating a small remaining activity, but with a different mechanism. Using the S554A variant, we succeeded in measuring a similarly very low kcat/Km, namely 0.98 ± 0.03 m–1 s–1, for the reaction with the substrate containing Arg at the P2 position. This represents a decrease of seven orders of magnitude. It may be noted that the remaining activity is not due to prolyl oligopeptidase impurity in the preparation, because the active enzyme can be inhibited by diisopropyl-phosphofluoridate, whereas the inhibitor does not affect the remaining activity. Also, the E. coli cells in which the enzyme is expressed do not contain prolyl oligopeptidase, which eliminates the possibility of active enzyme contaminating the inactive form. The crystal structures assumed similar binding modes for all substrates involved in important interactions with the peptide bonds of the P2 and P3 residues, as described earlier (16.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 18.Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol.

Of course, the P1 Pro ring interacting with the side chain of Trp-595 determines the primary specificity. The P2 side chains of both Arg and Glu are disordered, pointing toward the bulk water. Residues P4 and P5 are also disordered, indicating that they do not interact with the potential Arg binding sites. The substrate containing P3 Glu was not seen at all, suggesting that the binding constant is higher for this substrate than for the others This is consistent with the highest Km value for this substrate (Table II). The weak binding of the substrate with P3 Glu is reasonable in terms of the hydrophobic S3 subsite (which has a preference for Phe) and large hydrophobic groups such as the benzyloxycarbonyl group, but it disfavors the succinyl group, although this charged group binds at the same place as the aromatic ring (20.Szeltner Z. Rea D. Renner V. Fülöp V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42613-42622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Like prolyl oligopeptidase, the classical serine proteases also lack interactions between enzyme groups and substrate side chains. Apart from the primary specificity determinant (P1 residue), interactions tend to be between the enzyme and the substrate main chain groups (35.Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). The uniform binding of the different substrates is apparently at variance with the significant differences in rate constants and their dissimilar pH dependences. This indicates that substrate specificity is not entirely controlled by the binding mode but is also dependent on the route to the active site, which is markedly influenced by the charged residues of the substrate and the enzyme.

Surprisingly, homozygous clk-1 mutants display a wild-type phenotype when issued from a heterozygous mother. Here, we show that this maternal effect is the result of the persistence of small amounts of maternally derived CLK-1 protein and that maternal CLK-1 is sufficient for the synthesis of considerable amounts of ubiquinone during development. However, gradual depletion of CLK-1 and ubiquinone, and expression of the mutant phenotype, can be produced experimentally by developmental arrest. We also show that the very long lifespan observed in daf-2 clk-1 double mutants is not abolished by the maternal effect. This suggests that, like developmental arrest, the increased lifespan conferred by daf-2 allows for depletion of maternal CLK-1, resulting in the expression of the synergism between clk-1 and daf-2. Thus, increased adult longevity can be uncoupled from the early mutant phenotypes, indicating that it is possible to obtain an increased adult lifespan from the late inactivation of processes required for normal development and reproduction.

Qn is a prenylated benzoquinone (the numerical subscript denotes the number of isoprene repeats, which is a species-specific trait) that is primarily involved in numerous redox reactions in the cell, including those in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Yet, mitochondrial respiration is not strongly affected in clk-1 mutants, indicating that DMQ can substitute for some, but not all, of the Q functions in vivo (5.Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A.

Despite the presence of DMQ, clk-1 mutants require Q from their bacterial food source to proceed through development and become fertile adults (4.Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, when clk-1 mutants are transferred onto a Q8-deficient E. coli strain before the early larval stages, they arrest development at the second larval stage, and when the animals are transferred onto Q8-deficient bacteria later in development, they become sterile adults. This fact strongly suggests that DMQ9 cannot functionally replace Q9 for all of its cellular roles, and that at least some Q is required, which can be provided as Q8 in the diet. Thus, the viability and overall good health of the clk-1 mutants seems to rely on a combination of endogenously produced DMQ9 and dietary Q8. It is currently unclear how the substitution of Q9 for DMQ9 relates to the Clk phenotype, especially given the relatively high mitochondrial respiration observed in these mutants. However, the increased lifespan of clk-1 mutants could be directly caused by the absence of Q9. Indeed, the altered redox properties of DMQ9 might reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (11.Miyadera H. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whose most abundant source is the Q reaction intermediate semiubiquinone (12.Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of ROS production has previously been implicated in lifespan determination in the worm (13.Feng J. Bussiere F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 14.Hekimi S. Guarente L. Science. 2003; 299: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the effect on lifespan could be secondary to the severe developmental and reproductive phenotypes caused by the lack of endogenous Q production. Indeed, clk-1 mutant worms develop slowly and have a markedly reduced brood size (15.Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas disruption of mouse clk-1 results in embryonic lethality, suggesting that Q is essential for mammalian development as well (6.Levavasseur F.

Commun. 2001; 289: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the difficulties in interpreting the consequences of manipulating endogenous Q production to obtain effects on lifespan is that the effect on lifespan could be only secondary. Here, we propose that, in maternally rescued animals, the effect of clk-1 mutations on adult lifespan is uncoupled from their effects on development and reproduction. We show that this uncoupling is produced by the presence of maternally contributed CLK-1 protein and endogenously produced Q9 during larval development and early adult life, followed by a depletion of ubiquinone later in life, which leads to an increased adult lifespan. Given that almost all developmental and reproductive phenotypes are fully wild type in maternally rescued animals and that a long lifespan is still observed, this excludes the early phenotypes as being necessary for longevity. Nematode Strains and Culture Methods—Animals were cultured as described (17.Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and raised on the standard E. coli strain OP50 at 20 °C, unless otherwise indicated. When assaying nematode growth on Q-deficient bacteria, we used the bacterial strains DM123 (a ubiB knockout) and GD1 (a ubiG knockout) (18.Poon W.W. Davis D.E. Ha H.T. Jonassen T. Rather P.N. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19.Macinga D.R. Cook G.M. Poole R.K. Rather P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was grown in 2YT growth medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When working with DM123 and GD1, nematode growth media plates were supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin to prevent contamination from other bacterial strains. The following strains and mutations were used: N2 (Bristol strain), clk-1(qm30) III, dpy-17(e164) III, unc-32(e189) III, and daf-2(e1370) III. Phenotypic Characterization—clk-1 maternally rescued animals (denoted as clk-1 m+), were derived from clk-1(qm30) homozygous mutants crossed with clk-1(+) males. Heterozygous clk-1(qm30)/clk-1(+) cross progeny, which have a wild-type phenotype, were singled and allowed to self-fertilize. clk-1(qm30)/clk-1(qm30) animals of the first homozygous generation were examined. Total Development—Gravid hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs for 1 h (Table I). The progeny were monitored every 12 h until the animals reached adulthood.Table IBrood sizes and durations of development of clk-1 mutants on various bacterial food sources n.a., not applicable.Bacterial food sourceBrood sizeaThe brood sizes of animals whose parent was transferred on the named food source and who have thus undergone their entire development on this food sourceDevelopmentbThe length of development from egg to the adult molt was measuredclk-1/+clk-1 m-clk-1 m+clk-1/+clk-1 m-clk-1 m+number of eggshoursOP50310 ± 36cThe brood sizes of clk-1/+ on OP50 bacteria, which are considered to be the wild-type brood sizes, are significantly different at p < 0.05 from those of all other genotypes on all bacterial strains, except for the clk-1m+ brood sizes on OP50, which are not significantly different (p = 0.78)114 ± 23304 ± 5360.2 ± 7.0dThe durations of development of clk-1/+ animals on OP50, which are considered to be the wild-type durations, are not significantly different (p > 0.25) from the duration of development on ubiB or those of clk-1m+ on OP50 or ubiB.

Larvae that had hatched during that period were singled and monitored every 2 h until they molted into adults. The clk-1 maternally rescued animals were identified as those animals that produced slow growing progeny (see Fig. 5). Defecation—Cycles were scored as described previously (20.Branicky R. Shibata Y. Feng J. Hekimi S. Genetics. 2001; 159: 997-1006PubMed Google Scholar). Self-brood Size—Animals were singled onto plates during the L4 stage and transferred daily until the end of egg laying. The progeny laid on each plate was counted. When measuring the brood size of animals raised on the Q-deficient bacterial strains (DM123 or GD1), their parents were switched to this strain as adults so that the animals were raised on Q-deficient bacteria throughout development. Strategy Used to Arrest Animals at the L1Stage—100 animals were allowed to lay eggs for 10 h on an unseeded plate supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) to prevent bacterial growth. The parents were then removed with a sterile pick. All of the progeny laid subsequently hatched and arrested at the L1 stage because of the absence of food. Samples of animals were then washed off the plate using sterile M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42.3 mm Na2PO4, 85.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4) a few hours after the end of the limiting laying (Day 0 control), as well as every subsequent third day. The collected L1 larvae were transferred to a plate seeded with bacteria (either the standard OP50 or DM123) to allow animals to resume development. Animals were then scored for various behavioral phenotypes at the young adult stage. The genotypes of the parents used for the limited laying were clk-1(qm30) (to produce the clk-1(qm30) m- mutant controls) and + clk-1(qm30)/dpy-17(e164) +. Maternally rescued animals of the genotype clk-1(qm30) m+ and heterozygous controls of the genotype + clk-1(qm30)/dpy-17(e164) + were taken from the same plate. The genotypes of these animals were confirmed by checking the phenotype of the progeny. Aging Assay—To generate clk-1(qm30) maternally rescued animals in the daf-2(e1370) background, the daf-2(e1370) clk-1(qm30) double-mutant hermaphrodites were crossed with daf-2(e1370) males. Heterozygous cross progeny of the genotype daf-2 clk-1/daf-2 + animals were identified by their fast growth. The progeny of these animals were then synchronized for the aging assay at the final molt into adulthood and were singled. The clk-1 maternally rescued animals were identified as those animals that produced slow growing progeny. All animals were raised at 20 °C and switched to 25 °C just after the final molt into adulthood. Aging was performed as described (21.Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Approximately 2000 clk-1 maternally rescued animals of the genotype dpy-17(e164) clk-1(qm30) were picked at each larval stage. Similarly, 2000 N2 wild-type animals were picked at each larval stage as positive controls. Over 5000 clk-1(qm30) mutant animals were also collected as negative controls. Animals were denatured in SDS sample buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol by boiling at 85 °C for 5 min. Protein samples were run on an acrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with the primary anti-CLK-1 antibody 2774 (22.Hihi A.K. Kebir H. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41013-41018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (1:1000), and subsequently with donkey anti-rabbit antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, 1:2500). The secondary antibody was detected by using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). HPLC Assay for Ubiquinone Quantification: Collecting Worms—To obtain a large number of clk-1 maternally rescued animals for HPLC analysis, the strain clk-1(qm30) unc-32(e189) was used to separate maternally rescued animals from their heterozygous and wild-type sibs by selecting for the severe Unc phenotype. Approximately 1000 heterozygous hermaphrodites of the genotype clk-1(qm30) unc-32(e189)/++ were picked and allowed to perform a 12-h limited egg laying (100 animals/large plate). These parents were then washed off the plate leaving the eggs behind. The synchronized progeny were raised to the adult stage and were then collected by rinsing plates with M9 buffer. To separate the maternally rescued animals from their heterozygous and wild-type sibs, a total of 150 μl of worms suspended in M9 was applied to the center of a large plate (15 cm) that was seeded with food around the edges. Wild-type and heterozygous animals were able to move toward the food, while homozygous clk-1(qm30) unc-32(e189)m+ animals were left in the center of the plate because of their severe Unc phenotype. These worms were collected by cutting out the center of the plate and washing the worms off the agar on to a clean plate. This selection strategy was then repeated a second time, resulting in a worm prep that contained over 95% clk-1 maternally rescued animals. Worm pellets were then frozen at -80 °C until ubiquinone extraction was performed. The worm strain unc-32(e189) was used as a Q9 biosynthesis control and the strain clk-1(qm30) unc-32(e189) was used as a DMQ9 biosynthesis control. Control strains used were synchronized by allowing 100 gravid hermaphrodites to lay eggs for 10 h on a single large plate, with a total of 40 large plates used for each genotype. At the end of the 10-h limited laying period, parents were washed off the plate with M9 buffer, leaving the eggs behind on the plate. Progeny were then allowed to grow to adulthood and were collected by washing the plates with M9. These worms were then washed as outlined above to remove contaminating E. coli. Worm pellets were then frozen at -80 °C until ubiquinone extraction was performed. Quinone Extraction—A worm sample of around 500 μl was sufficient to obtain enough Q for HPLC analysis. Q extraction was performed as described (33.Rousseau G. Varin F. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1998; 36: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Worm extracts were completed to 1 ml with water and then transferred to a 50-ml plastic tube. 50 μl of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (Aldrich) suspended in ethanol (10 mg/ml) was added to the worm sample to prevent auto-oxidation of Q. This sample was homogenized for several minutes at maximum speed by using a hand-held homogenizer. 1 ml of 0.1% SDS was then added to the mixture to denature the sample. A second round of homogenization was then performed. After this, 2 ml of ethanol were added to the tube to collect the homogenized, denatured worm mix by vortexing for 30 s. This mixture was then transferred to a corex tube. 2 ml of hexane was added, and the tightly capped test tube was vigorously vortexed for 2 min. The sample was then centrifuged for 5 min at 2200 rpm, and 1.5 ml of the hexane organic supernatant layer was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The hexane extraction was then repeated a second time. The combined hexane extracts were then evaporated using a heated speed vacuum. Samples were then re-suspended in a total of 70 μl of the methanol/ethanol (70:30) mobile phase for HPLC analysis. Samples were kept on ice and run within 2 h of extraction to keep ubiquinone degradation to a minimum. HPLC Analysis—HPLC analysis was performed by using a methanol/ethanol (70:30) mobile phase solvent. This mixture was boiled for 30 min to eliminate air bubbles and then allowed to cool to 40 °C, which was then maintained throughout the HPLC experiment using a heat plate. Samples were eluted at a rate of 2 ml/min and were analyzed at a wavelength of 275 nm. The ubiquinone standard Q9 (Sigma) was used to determine the elution profile for this compound. Maternally Rescued clk-1 Mutants Can Complete Larval and Reproductive Development When Raised on Q-deficient Bacteria—clk-1 mutants raised on E. coli strains defective in Q8 biosynthesis arrest development or become sterile, depending on the time of transfer onto the Q-deficient food source (4.Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This phenotype is likely the most direct consequence of the Q9 biosynthesis defect of clk-1 mutants, as the wild-type and other long-lived mutant strains have normal growth and reproduction on a Q-deficient food source (10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability to complete growth and produce progeny on Q-deficient E. coli reflects the endogenous Q status of the animal (10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consequently, we assayed the ability of clk-1 maternally rescued animals to complete growth and produce a full brood on a Q8-deficient food source. As reported previously, we found that clk-1(qm30) mutants raised from embryogenesis on the Q8-deficient E. coli strains DM123 (a ubiB knockout strain) or GD1 (a ubiG knockout strain) arrest at the L2 stage (4.Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although this arrest is fully penetrant, it is not absolute, as the clk-1 mutants start to exit the L2 arrest after ∼1 week, and almost all animals subsequently become sterile adults. The late recovery from arrest has not been reported previously. Yet, we observed this phenomenon consistently for all conditions under which the mutants arrest. Presumably, this was previously missed because, as the animals do not proceed through the developmental stages slowly but are fully arrested for at least a week, there was no reason to suspect that they would resume development and eventually all reach adulthood. On the other hand, both clk-1(qm30)/+ heterozygotes and maternally rescued clk-1(qm30) mutants raised on DM123 or GD1 are able to complete larval development at a normal rate under these conditions (Table I). Moreover, there is no obvious developmental lag for the maternally rescued mutants when raised on DM123 or GD1. This strongly suggests that maternally rescued clk-1 mutants possess sufficient amounts of endogenous Q9 to complete larval development. We next asked if maternally rescued clk-1 mutants raised from embryogenesis onward on a Q8-deficient diet would be able to produce progeny. In agreement with previous results, we found that clk-1(qm30) mutants raised on the standard OP50 bacterial strain have a reduced mean brood size compared with the wild type (15.Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but that clk-1(qm30) mutants raised on the Q8-deficient strains DM123 or GD1 are fully sterile (Table I, Fig. 1, Refs. 4.Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that clk-1 maternally rescued animals are able to produce a large brood (>200) when raised on either OP50, DM123, or GD1 (Table I). Thus, maternally rescued clk-1 mutants can complete reproductive development when raised on Q-deficient bacteria. clk-1 Maternally Rescued Animals Have Measurable Levels of Ubiquinone—The observation that clk-1 maternally rescued animals are fully rescued for both growth and fertility on a Q-deficient food source strongly suggests that clk-1 maternally rescued animals have amounts of endogenous Q9 that are sufficient for normal function. To investigate this further, we performed HPLC analysis to determine the Q9 and DMQ9 content of maternally rescued clk-1 mutants as well as of the wild-type and clk-1 mutant controls at the young adult stage (Fig. 2). Wild-type control animals show a peak eluting at ∼690 s, which corresponds to the Q9 standard (682 s). As expected, clk-1 mutants exhibit a peak eluting earlier, at 651 s, which corresponds to the more polar compound DMQ9 (5.Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Maternally rescued clk-1 adults show dual peaks at 650 s and 686 s, which correspond to DMQ9 and Q9, respectively (Fig. 2). Our measures of quinones are not strictly quantitative as, for technical reasons, we had to use a relatively rough measure of worm mass (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, the recovery of the quinones is likely to be very similar in every extract as all peaks that can be identified from trace to trace based on elution time have very similar peak heights in every trace (Fig. 2). In addition, as clk-1 mutant animals normally produce as much DMQ9 as wild-type animals produce Q9, and in maternally rescued clk-1 mutants, as the DMQ9 and Q9 peaks are of very similar height, there seem to be considerable amounts of Q in these animals. In summary, it seems that maternally rescued clk-1 mutants have Q9 and are likely able to produce it. The presence of DMQ9 could suggest that there may not be sufficient CLK-1 activity at the adult stage to fully catalyze the conversion of DMQ9 to Q9. Consistent with the latter view, clk-1 maternally rescued animals are fully rescued for all adult behaviors with the exception of the egg-laying rate, which is similar to that of clk-1 mutants (15.Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CLK-1 Protein Is Present throughout Larval Development in Maternally Rescued clk-1 Mutants—The level of Q9 present in maternally rescued mutants is similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that this Q9 cannot, in its majority, correspond to the Q9 found in the oocyte that gave rise to the animal. Therefore, either CLK-1 protein or some alternative enzyme must be present in maternally rescued mutants. To explore this, we used an anti-CLK-1 antiserum and carried out immunoblot analysis to detect CLK-1 in developmentally staged animals. We collected the same number of worms at each developmental stage and for each genot"
https://openalex.org/W2033350100,"Transition protein 2 (TP2), which is expressed during stages 12–15 of mammalian spermiogenesis, has been shown to undergo phosphorylation immediately after its synthesis. We reported earlier that TP2 is phosphorylated in vitro at threonine 101 and serine 109 by the salt extract of sonication-resistant (elongating and elongated) spermatid nuclei and the protein kinase phosphorylating TP2 was identified to be protein kinase A (PKA). We now report that the cytosol from haploid spermatids but not from premeiotic germ cells is able to phosphorylate recombinant TP2 in vitro at threonine 101 and serine 109. The kinase present in the haploid spermatid cytosol that phosphorylates TP2 has been identified to be the sperm-specific isoform of protein kinase A (Cs-PKA). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that Cs-PKA was present in the haploid spermatids and absent from premeiotic germ cells. The rat Cs-PKA transcript was amplified and sequenced using the isoform-specific primers. The sequence of rat Cs- PKA at the N terminus differs from mouse and human by one amino acid. Western blot analysis using specific anti- C \alpha 1 antibodies revealed that C \alpha 1-PKA is absent in haploid spermatid cytosol. We have also established an in vitro nuclear transport assay for the haploid round spermatids. Using this assay, we have found that the cytoplasmic factors and ATP are absolutely essential for translocation of TP2 into the nucleus. Phosphorylation was found to positively modulate the NLS dependent import of TP2 into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2081846517,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are intimately involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. HS and the related glycosaminoglycan heparin interact with FGFs and FGF receptors (FGFRs), and it is believed that both interactions are required for productive FGF signaling. Attempts to inhibit FGF activity have been made with modified heparin preparations, various heparin-like polysaccharide analogues and other polyanionic molecules, which may all act by interfering with the physiological HS-FGF-FGFR interactions on the cell surface. Here, we have studied the potential of sulfated derivatives of a bacterial polysaccharide (capsular polysaccharide from Escherichia coli K5 (K5PS)) in the modulation of FGF-heparin/HS interactions and FGF signaling. We demonstrate that O-sulfated and N,O-sulfated species of K5PS, with high degrees of sulfation, displaced FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-8b from heparin. However, only O-sulfated K5PS efficiently inhibited the FGF-induced proliferation of S115 mammary carcinoma cells and 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas N,O-sulfated K5PS had little or no inhibitory effect. Studies with CHO677 cells lacking endogenous HS, as well as with chlorate-treated S115 cells expressing undersulfated HS, indicated that whereas exogenously administered heparin and N,O-sulfated K5PS restored the cellular response toward FGF stimulation, O-sulfated K5PS was largely devoid of such stimulatory activity.

FGFs have been implicated in physiological processes such as embryonic development (1.Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tissue regeneration but also in a number of pathological conditions including cancer, inflammatory diseases, fibrosis, etc. (2.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). FGF signals are thought to stimulate tumor cell proliferation in an autocrine or paracrine fashion and various types of malignant tumors have been shown to overexpress FGFs and FGF receptors (FGFRs) (2.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 3.McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). FGFs are also potent angiogenic factors that promote tumor neovascularization by stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (4.Folkman J. Klagsbrun M.

FGFs exert their biological activities by binding to FGFRs that leads to FGFR dimerization, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic receptor domains, and activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways (5.Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF activity is critically dependent on the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) (6.Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 7.Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar), a component of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix (8.Bernfield M.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). HS has been demonstrated to interact with FGFs as well as with the extracellular domains of FGFRs (10.Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). HS likely plays a critical role in the formation of “ternary complexes” consisting of FGF, FGFR, and HS, in which HS concomitantly interacts with both the growth factor and receptor components of the complex (11.Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 12.Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K.

Cells lacking endogenous HS thus respond poorly to FGFs, whereas the response can be readily restored by addition of heparin (6.Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

By contrast, in cells which express endogenous HSPGs, exogenously administered heparin may inhibit rather than stimulate FGF signaling, presumably by perturbing the interactions of cellular HSPGs with FGFs/FGFRs (13.Moscatelli D.

The capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K5 bacteria (hereafter denoted as K5 polysaccharide or K5PS) has the same structure as the primary polymerization product of heparin/HS biosynthesis, consisting of alternating d-glucuronic acid and d-N-acetylglucosamine units (GlcAα1,4GlcNAc)n (16.Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). K5PS can be subjected to various degrees of chemical N-deacetylation/N-sulfation as well as O-sulfation (17.Casu B. Grazioli G. Razi N. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Oreste P. Tursi F. Zoppetti G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37900-37908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to yield different heparin/HS-like semisynthetic polysaccharides (Fig. 1). Highly sulfated species of K5PS have been shown to bind to FGF-2 and inhibit FGF-2 induced endothelial cell proliferation, probably by interfering with the formation of FGF-2·FGFR·HS complexes (18.Leali D. Belleri M. Urbinati C. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Ribatti D. Rusnati M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37900-37908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N,O-sulfated polysaccharide species have also displayed anti-angiogenic activity in chick chorioallontoic membrane assays (18.Leali D. Belleri M. Urbinati C. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Ribatti D. Rusnati M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37900-37908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). The results presented in this paper provide novel data with regard to the properties of sulfated K5PSs as FGF inhibitors. We have assessed the previously described series (18.Leali D. Belleri M. Urbinati C. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Ribatti D. Rusnati M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37900-37908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of chemically sulfated derivatives of K5PS for their capability to interact with FGFs and modulate FGF-induced cellular responses. Our data suggest that whereas various species of sulfated K5PS bind FGF-1, FGF-2 and FGF-8b, only a highly O-sulfated preparation was an efficient inhibitor of the biological activity of FGFs at low (≤1 μg/ml) concentrations. Experiments in cells lacking endogenous active HS suggest that the differential inhibitory capacity of the preparations derive from differences in their agonist/antagonist properties with regard to FGF signaling. Thus, compounds such as O-sulfated K5PS deserve to be further explored as inhibitors of FGF-dependent tumor cell proliferation. Materials—Cell culture media, chemicals for the preparation of low sulfate DMEM (LSDMEM) (6.Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), testosterone, and the monoclonal antibodies against ERKs were from Sigma. Sodium chlorate was purchased from Merck, and [methyl-3H]thymidine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. FGF-1 and FGF-2 were from Peprotech. The expression vector for FGF-8b was kindly provided by Dr. Graig MacArthur (Washington University). FGF-8b was produced and purified as described elsewhere (19.MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32616-32623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The K5PS preparations used in this study were kindly provided by Drs. Giorgio Zoppetti and Pasqua Oreste. The synthesis and characterization of the K5PSs have been described elsewhere (18.Leali D. Belleri M. Urbinati C. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Ribatti D. Rusnati M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37900-37908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a series of sulfated K5PSs has been generated by chemical N-deacetylation/N-sulfation and/or O-sulfation of the unmodified K5PS structure (GlcA-GlcNAc)n (18.Leali D. Belleri M. Urbinati C.

The modified compounds included fully N-sulfated K5PS without (K5-NS) or with (K5-NSOS) O-sulfation as well as O-sulfated K5PS (K5-OS). The O-sulfation of K5-NSOS was somewhat lower than that of K5-OS, such that their overall degrees of sulfation were similar (3.84 versus 3.77 sulfate groups/disaccharide unit, respectively). However, in both N-sulfated and N-acetylated preparations the degree of GlcN 6-O-sulfation was nearly 100%, such that the differences in O-sulfation were found in the 2-O- and 3-O-sulfation of the GlcA units and in the 3-O-sulfation of the GlcN residues. The mean molecular masses of the preparations were in the range of 10–15 kDa. Cell Cultures—S115 mouse mammary carcinoma cells (21.Leppä S. Härkönen P. Jalkanen M. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 nm testosterone. For experiments, the cells were grown in medium containing 4% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FCS (DCC-FCS) (22.Noguchi S. Uchida N. Sato B. Koyama H. Matsumoto K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) instead of FCS, followed by a 24-h serum starvation in a 1:1 mixture of serum-free Ham's F-12 and DMEM (23.Tanaka A. Matsumoto K. Nishizawa Y. Lu J. Yamanishi H. Maeyama M. Nonomura N. Uchida N. Sato B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and treatment with testosterone/FGF and K5PSs in various combinations, as specified in the figure legends. To assess the cellular DNA synthesis, [methyl-3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium for the last2hofthe incubation. Subsequently, the cells were washed and solubilized into 1 m NaOH followed by quantification of the incorporated radioactivity in a beta counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Alternatively, cell growth was assessed by staining the cells with crystal violet (24.Gillies R.J. Didier N. Denton M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) after various periods of incubation. In some experiments, the added saccharide was withdrawn after a 24-h incubation by change of the culture medium, after which the cells were allowed to grow for 48 h before crystal violet staining. The treatment of S115 cells with sodium chlorate has been described elsewhere (25.Borgenström M. Tienhaara A. Spillmann D. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in LSDMEM containing 5% DCC-FCS and 30 mm sodium chlorate, followed by trypsinization, replating, and starvation in LSDMEM supplemented with 0.1% DCC-FCS and 30 mm sodium chlorate. Testosterone and K5PSs were added to the cells that were subsequently assessed for [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation as described above. HS-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (line 677; Ref. 26.Esko J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the same cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding FGFR-1 or FGFR-4 (20.Loo B.-M. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32616-32623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS, whereas mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. For the [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation experiments, both types of cells were serum-starved and FGF-stimulated according to the protocol described above. Analysis of ERK Phosphorylation—To analyze the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, S115 cells were cultured as described above and lysed in Laemmli buffer at the time points of 2, 10, 20, and 60 min followed by fractionation of the lysates on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose by semidry blotting. Sample loading was studied by protein staining with Ponceau S. The membranes were blocked in PBS (0.15 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.4% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (0.1–0.2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After several washes with 0.4% Tween 20 in PBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins (dilution 1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed several times followed by visualization of the bound antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the membranes were soaked in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and re-probed with monoclonal antibodies against ERK 2. FGF Binding Assay—To study the ability of sulfated K5PSs to displace [3H]heparin from FGF, [3H]heparin (20,000 cpm), sulfated K5 polysaccharides (0.05–5 μg/ml), and FGFs (2.5 μg/ml) were incubated in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were rapidly passed through PBS-washed nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius, 25-mm diameter, pore size: 0.45 μm) using a vacuum suction apparatus followed by two washes of the filters with PBS. Proteins and protein-bound saccharides bind to the filter, whereas unbound saccharides pass through (27.Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The filter-bound [3H]heparin was released with 2 m NaCl and quantified by scintillation counting. Inhibition of Testosterone-induced Proliferation of S115 Cells by Sulfated K5PSs—Stimulation of S115 cells with testosterone leads to a morphological change of the cells from epithelial to fibroblast-like phenotype, increased proliferation, ability to grow in soft agar, and disorganization of the actin filament network (28.Darbre P.D. King R.J.B. Cancer Treat. Res. 1988; 40: 307-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The process has been shown to involve testosterone-induced expression of FGF-8b (29.Tanaka A. Miyamoto K. Minamino N. Takeda M. Sato B. Matsuo H. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8928-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 30.Ruohola J.K. Valve E.M. Vainikka S. Alitalo K. Härkönen P.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2179-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to require the presence of sulfated HSPGs (25.Borgenström M. Tienhaara A. Spillmann D. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Previous data indicate that such proliferation, as measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA, can be inhibited by heparin (25.Borgenström M. Tienhaara A. Spillmann D. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31.Kasayama S. Sumitani S. Tanaka A. Yamanishi H. Nakamura N. Matsumoto K. Sato B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We studied whether sulfated K5PSs were able to influence the testosterone-induced proliferation of S115 cells. The results indicated that K5-OS inhibited the proliferation efficiently (Fig. 2A), whereas K5-NS, K5-NSOS, or unmodified K5PS had little or no inhibitory activity. To assess the inhibitory capacity of K5-OS in a more detail, a range of polysaccharide concentrations was studied in the same cell proliferation assay and their inhibitory capacities were compared with that of heparin (Fig. 2B). The results showed that K5-OS caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition at low concentrations (0.1–1 μg/ml), whereas ∼10-fold higher concentrations of K5-NSOS were required for corresponding inhibitory effects. Notably, heparin had only a limited effect on cell proliferation. These data suggest that the structurally distinct preparations of sulfated K5PSs differed markedly in their inhibitory capacity, albeit their overall degrees of sulfation were similar. The results also demonstrate that sulfated K5PSs inhibit the testosterone-induced proliferation of S115 cells much more efficiently than heparin. We further assessed the effect of K5-OS on cell proliferation by treating S115 cells with K5-OS and testosterone for various periods of time and determining the relative cell numbers by crystal violet staining. Whereas testosterone treatment induced cell proliferation, cells treated with a combination of K5-OS and testosterone displayed less proliferation than control cells without testosterone treatment (Fig. 3A), confirming the idea that K5-OS inhibited testosterone-induced proliferation of S115 cells. Unmodified K5PS did not affect the testosterone response and heparin had only a minor effect, in agreement with the [3H]thymidine incorporation data presented above. To study whether the growth inhibition by K5-OS was reversible, cells were grown in the presence of K5-OS and testosterone for 24 h, after which the medium were changed, and the cells were cultured in the presence of testosterone alone for additional 48 h. Following the withdrawal of K5-OS, increased cell proliferation was observed (Fig. 3B) suggesting that the antiproliferative effect was reversible in nature. Inhibition of FGF-8b-induced Proliferation and ERK Phosphorylation by K5-OS—The transforming effect of testosterone on S115 cells has been demonstrated to involve up-regulation of FGF-8b expression (29.Tanaka A. Miyamoto K. Minamino N. Takeda M. Sato B. Matsuo H. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8928-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We proceeded to test the effects of K5PSs on S115 cells specifically stimulated with FGF-8b, which induced an increased DNA synthesis in serum-starved S115 cells (Fig. 4A). The effect of FGF-8b was efficiently inhibited by low concentrations of K5-OS (0.1–1 μg/ml), whereas K5-NSOS caused only a partial inhibition (Fig. 4B). The non-O-sulfated species of K5PS did not inhibit the proliferative effect of FGF-8b. To study the effect of K5-OS on the downstream signaling initiated by FGF stimulation, we analyzed its ability to inhibit FGF-8b induced phosphorylation of ERK, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Serum-starved S115 cells were treated with FGF-8b and K5-OS, followed by fractionation of cell lysates on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against phosphorylated ERK 1/2. Stimulation with FGF-8b induced rapid ERK phosphorylation, such that the maximal induction was seen 10 min after the start of the FGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Concomitant treatment with K5-OS prevented the ERK phosphorylation completely, whereas heparin or unmodified K5PS did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation. Collectively, the above data indicate that K5-OS antagonizes FGF-8b signaling in S115 cells and further suggest that the inhibitory effect of K5-OS on the proliferation of testosterone-stimulated S115 cells may be mediated through inhibition of FGF-8b activity. FGF-Antagonist Activity of K5-OS Is Influenced by the FGF Species and Cell Type Involved—Previous data suggest that the proliferation of S115 cells may be stimulated also by FGF-1 or FGF-2 (32.Nakamura N. Yamanishi H. Lu J. Uchida N. Nonomura N. Matsumoto K. Sato B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and we thus assessed the effect of K5PSs on the biological activity of these FGF species. The results indicated that whereas both FGF-1 and FGF-2 enhanced the DNA synthesis of S115 cells, their effects were almost completely inhibited by K5-OS at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (Fig. 5). By contrast, K5-NSOS appeared to stimulate rather than inhibit the corresponding FGF responses. To assess whether sulfated K5PSs were able to influence the FGF response in other cells than S115, we performed studies with 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that were stimulated with FGF-1, FGF-2, or FGF-8b and treated with K5PSs. Analogously to the results with S115 cells, the proliferative effects of FGF-2 and FGF-8b were inhibited by K5-OS, although the extent of inhibition remained lower than that seen in S115 cells. Notably, the effect of FGF-1 was not influenced by K5-OS in 3T3 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that different cell types may differ in their sensitivity toward the inhibitory effect of K5-OS upon FGF stimulation and further that the inhibitory capacity of the polysaccharide may differ according to the target FGF species. K5-OS and K5-NSOS Inhibit Binding of FGFs to Heparin— A possible mechanism of how sulfated K5PSs might inhibit FGF signaling involves their binding to the growth factors, hence interference with the cellular HS-FGF-FGFR interactions. We studied the binding of K5PSs to FGF-1, FGF-2, or FGF-8b by assessing their capacity to displace [3H]heparin from FGF. FGF was incubated in solution with [3H]heparin and different concentrations of K5PSs, after which the FGF-bound [3H]heparin was quantified by trapping the formed protein-saccharide complexes on nitrocellulose filters (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unlabeled heparin, K5-OS, and K5-NSOS all competed with [3H]heparin for binding to the various FGFs species in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 6), whereas unmodified K5PS had no inhibitory capacity. Although the sulfated K5PSs differed somewhat in their inhibitory potency with regard to the polysaccharide structure and also the FGF species involved, both the O-sulfated and N,O-sulfated preparations were efficient inhibitors of the [3H]heparin-FGF interactions at the concentration of 1 μg/ml used in the cell culture assays. These data suggested that other reasons than differential FGF binding capacity should be explored to satisfactorily explain the different capacities of K5-OS and K5-NSOS in the inhibition of FGF-induced cell growth. Different Effects of K5-OS and K5-NSOS on FGF Activity in Cells Lacking Endogenous HS—Given the findings that both K5-OS and K5-NSOS bound avidly to FGFs, whereas only the former preparation inhibited FGF-induced cell proliferation, we proceeded to study whether K5-OS and K5-NSOS might differ in their effects on FGF signaling in cells lacking endogenous HSPGs. We have earlier demonstrated that S115 cells treated with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of cellular sulfation reactions including the sulfation of HSPGs (6.Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), require exogenous heparin/HS for their proliferation upon testosterone stimulation (25.Borgenström M. Tienhaara A. Spillmann D. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the DNA synthesis of chlorate-treated S115 cells was not enhanced by testosterone treatment, whereas the testosterone response was restored by addition of heparin (Fig. 7A). Addition of K5-NSOS also restored the testosterone response in a concentration dependent manner such that K5-NSOS appeared at least as potent as heparin in this regard. By contrast, K5-OS had only a weak positive effect on the [3H]thymidine incorporation by chlorate-treated S115 cells (Fig. 7A) indicating that its ability to facilitate the testosterone-induced proliferative response was clearly distinct from that of K5-NSOS. We further studied the effects of K5PSs on FGF signaling in CHO677 cells, which are deficient in endogenous HS but responsive to FGF in the presence of exogenous heparin (33.Lundin L. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Kanda S. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24653-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CHO677 cells were treated with FGF-8b alone or together with heparin/K5PSs and subjected to the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The results were essentially similar to those obtained with chlorate-treated S115 cells in that heparin and K5-NSOS elicited a marked FGF response, while K5-OS had a much weaker effect (Fig. 7B). However, the differences between the stimulatory capacities of K5-NSOS and K5-OS were more pronounced in chlorate-treated S115 cells than in CHO677 cells. To assess whether the differential ability of K5-OS and K5-NSOS to enhance FGF signaling was dependent on the FGF species used to stimulate the cells, similar experiments were performed with CHO677 cells treated with FGF-1 and FGF-2. The results indicated that K5-NSOS was consistently more potent in stimulating the FGF responses regardless of the FGF species (Fig. 7, C and D). Unmodified K5 did not enhance thymidine incorporation in either of the model systems studied (data not shown). The FGF responses of the wild-type CHO677 are presumably mediated by FGFR-1, which is expressed at low levels by the cells (33.Lundin L. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Kanda S. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24653-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To investigate how the cellular FGFR expression influenced the capacity of K5PSs to modulate FGF signaling, their effects on the proliferative FGF response were studied in CHO677 cells transfected to express a higher level of FGFR-1 or FGFR-4 (20.Loo B.-M. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32"
https://openalex.org/W2020297795,"GPEET procyclin is a major glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of procyclic (insect stage) trypanosomes in culture and is heavily phosphorylated in the GPEET pentapeptide repeat. The phosphorylation reaction is a late event and occurs during maturation and transport of GPEET or on the parasite surface by an ecto-protein kinase. Initial biochemical characterization of the GPEET kinase activity now shows that it depends on bivalent cations for maximal activity, is stimulated by sulfhydryl group reagents, and is specific for ATP as phosphoryl donor. No kinase activity is detected in bloodstream form trypanosomes in culture, whereas strong phosphorylation is observed in early procyclic forms. In addition, the GPEET kinase activity is absent from procyclic trypanosomes that have repressed GPEET synthesis but can be induced in these same stocks by conditions, which also induce GPEET expression. However, the presence of an active kinase does not depend on the presence of (functional) GPEET because it can be detected in parasites expressing a non-phosphorylatable GPEET mutant protein and in procyclin null mutant trypanosomes. Interestingly, the presence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid moiety seems necessary for GPEET to become phosphorylated. Together, the results demonstrate that GPEET and its kinase are expressed during the same life cycle stages and that factors that induce the expression of GPEET in vitro also induce the expression of the GPEET kinase.

Bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei cause both sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle and are transmitted between mammals by the tsetse fly. They exist as two forms, proliferating long slender forms and non-dividing short stumpy forms (1.Vickerman K. Nature. 1965; 208: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After being taken up by the tsetse fly as part of a blood meal, the short stumpy bloodstream forms rapidly differentiate into procyclic forms in the midgut lumen of the insect host. During this process, trypanosomes replace the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 1The abbreviations used are: VSGvariant surface glycoproteinGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolFBSfetal bovine serumpCMBpara-chloromercuribenzoic acidmAbmonoclonal antibodypCMPSp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. coat by a set of stage-specific surface glycoproteins termed procyclins (2.Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M. Nature. 1987; 325: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This change of surface protein coat must be under tight control; because the closely packed VSG protects the parasite in the mammalian bloodstream against the immune system of the host, a premature loss of VSG would be lethal for the parasite. Similarly, uncontrolled expression of the highly immunogenic procyclins on bloodstream forms would allow the host to mount a strong immune response and eliminate the parasite. variant surface glycoprotein glycosylphosphatidylinositol fetal bovine serum para-chloromercuribenzoic acid monoclonal antibody p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. In T. brucei procyclic forms the protein surface coat consists of EP and GPEET procyclins, both of which are characterized by internal amino acid repeats (reviewed in Ref. 3.Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schürch N. Bütikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and are attached to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (4.Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5.Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem.

The closely related EP procyclin isoforms are encoded by 3 classes of genes and contain up to 30 tandem repeat units of Glu-Pro, whereas GPEET procyclin is encoded by a single copy gene and contains 5 or 6 pentapeptide (Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr) repeats (8.Roditi I. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mature form of GPEET is expressed as a non-glycosylated 24–32-kDa protein that is modified on the GPI anchor by a large carbohydrate side chain consisting of branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine groups capped with sialic acid (7.Treumann A.

In addition, GPEET is heavily phosphorylated on the threonine residues of its pentapeptide repeats (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J.

Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) making it a highly negatively charged surface protein. The relative amounts of EP and GPEET can vary considerably in culture, depending on the trypanosome stock and the culture medium. In one stock, T. brucei procyclic forms express almost exclusively EP on their surface (11.Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas in another stock GPEET represents >85% of the procyclins (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During synchronous differentiation of the pleomorphic strain AnTat 1.1 from bloodstream forms to procyclic forms in DTM medium in vitro, EP and GPEET are co-induced (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Vassella E. Van Den Abbeele J. Bütikofer P. Kunz Renggli C. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar) and continuously expressed during culture in this medium (12.Vassella E. Van Den Abbeele J. Bütikofer P. Kunz Renggli C. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar). A similar co-induction of EP and GPEET expression is also observed during differentiation of stumpy forms in SDM-79 medium. In contrast however, after 10 days of culture in the same medium, procyclic forms completely repress surface expression of GPEET, whereas EP expression is maintained. This down-regulation of GPEET can be prevented by the addition of glycerol to SDM-79 indicating that external signals can influence procyclin expression (12.Vassella E. Van Den Abbeele J. Bütikofer P. Kunz Renggli C. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of GPEET expression by external signals is also observed in T. brucei 29-13 (a derivative of T. brucei 427) procyclic forms, which express almost no GPEET in SDM-79 but show dramatic up-regulation of GPEET under conditions of glucose depletion (11.Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast to the glycerol effect in AnTat 1.1, which cannot be reversed by the addition of glycerol to parasites after they have stopped expressing GPEET (12.Vassella E. Van Den Abbeele J. Bütikofer P. Kunz Renggli C. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar), the glucose-depletion phenotype in 29-13 parasites is fully reversible by increasing the glucose concentration in the medium (11.Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The observation that GPEET is phosphorylated (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J.

Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is surprising because phosphorylation of surface proteins is a rare event in biology, and its functions are largely unknown. Phosphorylated GPEET is detected close to the flagellar pocket and on the surface of T. brucei 427 procyclic trypanosomes, suggesting that the phosphorylation reaction occurs late during maturation and transport of GPEET, or on the parasite surface (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPEET phosphorylation occurs on six of seven threonine residues in the pentapeptide repeat (10.Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and can be detected by antibodies that specifically recognize the unphosphorylated (K1 antiserum) or phosphorylated (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5H3) form of the protein (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of all threonine residues in the GPEET repeat by alanines results in a GPEEA mutant protein, which can no longer be phosphorylated (13.Bütikofer P. Jelk J. Malherbe T. Vassella E. Acosta-Serrano A. Kunz Renggli C. Brun R. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). T. brucei 427 parasites expressing GPEEA instead of GPEET are viable in culture and can establish an infection in the tsetse fly midgut (13.Bütikofer P. Jelk J. Malherbe T. Vassella E.

Phosphorylation of surface proteins and extracellular components has also been described in other parasites. Cell membrane-associated and secreted kinases have been shown to phosphorylate parasite or host proteins in Trichinella spiralis infective larvae (14.Arden S.R. Smith A.M. Booth M.J. Tweedie S.

It has been speculated that the ecto-protein kinases from Leishmania may be involved in modulating the host immune system or host-parasite interactions. Although some basic characterization of the kinases has been reported, none of the enzymes has been purified to homogeneity, and no information is available at the genetic level. Surface protein phosphorylation is mediated by ecto-protein kinases acting extracellularly on ecto-domains of cell surface proteins or on soluble proteins using extracellular ATP as a substrate. In particular, ecto-protein kinase activities have been described at the surface of a number of cells in the circulatory system, such as platelets, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelial and endothelial cells (reviewed in Ref. 22.Redegeld F.A.

These include various cAMP-dependent and -independent protein kinases, protein kinase C and protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinases 2) or CK2-like enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 22.Redegeld F.A.

To characterize the kinase responsible for GPEET phosphorylation, we performed a basic biochemical analysis of the kinase activity using membranes from hypotonically lysed procyclic trypanosomes. In addition, we studied the expression of the kinase activity in procyclic forms expressing mutant forms of GPEET and in trypanosomes from different life cycle stages expressing no or high levels of GPEET.

Low glucose SDM-79 was prepared with glucose-free RPMI 1640 replacing the minimum Eagle's medium powder and by omitting additional glucose (normally present in SDM-79 at 9.3 mm). This mixture was supplemented with normal heat-inactivated FBS (10%), resulting in a final glucose concentration of 1 mm. Glucose-depleted medium (0.25 mm glucose, final concentration) differed from low glucose medium in that 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FBS was used in place of normal serum. Bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei MiTat 1.2 were cultured in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (43.Carruthers V.B. Cross G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Preparation of Crude Membranes—Washed trypanosomes (5 × 108–5 × 109 cells) were hypotonically lysed by incubation in 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min on ice. The suspension was pressed three times through a 27-gauge needle (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor (30 min, 10,000 rpm, 4 °C), the crude membrane pellet was incubated in 10 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 m KCl) for 15 min on ice and washed once with the same buffer. After another washing step with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, membranes were resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration equivalent to 2 × 106 cells/μl. Purification of Dephosphorylated GPEET—To dephosphorylate GPEET, washed T. brucei 427 procyclic forms (2 × 109 cells) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 3 μl of alkaline phosphatase in 200 μl of 50 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 1 mm MgCl2. Subsequently, trypanosomes were sequentially extracted with chloroform:methanol, chloroform:methanol:water, 9% butanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 exactly as described before (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated GPEET from the butanol and Triton extracts was purified by chromatography on octyl-Sepharose (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fractions of interest were pooled, dried under N2, washed with 20% (v/v) propan-1-ol, resuspended in 9% (v/v) butanol at a concentration equivalent to 107 cells/μl, and stored at 4 °C. Nitrous Acid Treatment—T. brucei 427 procyclic forms were incubated in the presence of [3H]ethanolamine to label the GPEET GPI anchor (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently, GPEET was dephosphorylated and purified as described above. Treatment of GPEET with nitrous acid, which specifically cleaves the GPI moiety between the non-acetylated glucosamine and the inositol, was done essentially as described elsewhere (45.Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5324-5329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified, 3H-labeled, and dephosphorylated GPEET was incubated overnight at room temperature in 200 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 250 mm NaNO2 and 0.02% (w/v) Triton X-100. A control sample was incubated in 200 μl of buffer containing 250 mm NaCl instead of NaNO2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 6 m HCl, and the products were separated by octyl-Sepharose chromatography as mentioned above. The water-soluble cleavage products eluted in the flow-through of the column, whereas uncleaved GPEET bound to the column material and was eluted by increasing the propan-1-ol concentration (5.Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fractions of interest were pooled, dried under N2, washed with 20% (v/v) propan-1-ol in water, resuspended in 9% (v/v) butanol, and stored at 4 °C. Phosphorylation Assay—In the standard phosphorylation assay, membranes from 2 × 107 trypanosomes were incubated in 60 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 280 μm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 8.3 mmpara-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB). In some experiments, purified dephosphorylated GPEET from 2 to 5 × 107 trypanosomes was added as exogenous substrate. The phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/assay; 7–21 nm final concentration) followed by incubation for 15 min at 27 °C. In some experiments, [γ-32P]ATP was replaced by [α-32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay) or 32Pi (5 μCi/assay). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 4 times concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer, containing 10% (w/v) SDS. After boiling for 10 min, phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To study GPEET phosphorylation on intact trypanosomes, washed parasites (2 × 107 cells/assay) were incubated in SDM-79 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/assay). The reaction was stopped after 15 min at 27 °C, and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed as described above. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions (46.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 12% polyacrylamide gels. For detection of 32P-labeled proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, fixed, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat UV or Biomax-MS films (Integra Biosciences AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) at –70 °C. For detection of 3H-labeled proteins, gels were fixed, soaked for 90 min in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat UV films. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described before (6.Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) milk powder in blotting buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl), incubated with the first antibody diluted in blocking solution followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted in blocking solution. The washing steps in between were carried out in blotting buffer. Antigen binding was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two different first antibodies were used for immunoblotting: a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (K1 antiserum) that recognizes the non-phosphorylated form of GPEET (47.Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Kunz Renggli C. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 5H3) directed against the phosphorylated form of GPEET (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the GPEET Kinase—In vitro, GPEET phosphorylation can be induced by incubating crude membranes from hypotonically lysed procyclic forms with [γ-32P]ATP (9.Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize further the kinase responsible for GPEET phosphorylation, we studied its enzymatic properties and set up an assay to investigate its activity and regulation in procyclic form trypanosomes. The presence of the GPEET kinase on the parasite surface was studied by incubating T. brucei 427 procyclic forms in fresh SDM-79 medium in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the phosphorylated proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography showed multiple labeled bands between 20 and 100 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1). The presence of label was not because of unspecific binding of radiolabeled ATP to protein because no radioactivity was detected in parasites incubated in the presence of [α-32P]ATP instead of [γ-32P]ATP (results not shown). Similarly, no label was recovered in samples incubated in the presence of [32Pi], demonstrating that the binding of radioactivity was not the result of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP with subsequent binding of [32Pi] to protein (results not shown). Such a hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate group of ATP may occur spontaneously or by the action of a surface-oriented ATPase as it has been reported in other trypanosomatids (48.Berrêdo-Pinho M. Peres-Sampaio C.E. Chrispim P.P.M. Belmont-Firpo R. Lemos A.P. Martiny A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Meyer-Fernandes J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

The results of the simulations indicated that two protonation states are possible without disturbing the overall geometry of the active site. We then verified experimentally the presence of the two protonation states by studying the substrate hydrolysis and inhibitor binding reactions at different pH values and come to the conclusion that one of the protomeric states is relevant for inhibitor binding, whereas the other is relevant for substrate hydrolysis.

Fumagillin inhibits the growth of vessels in tumors, and a derivative of the compound has been evaluated in clinical trials as an anticancer drug. The antiangiogenic effect of fumagillin and other inhibitors of MetAP-II have been attributed to the inhibition of the Ets-1 transcription factor expression and the activation of the p53 pathway (5Wernert N.

Besides from being anticancer drug targets, MetAPs have the potential to become the target proteins of antibacterial substances because the MetAP functionality is essential for cell growth and bacteria possess only one of the two known MetAP subtypes (7Li X.

MetAPs are metal-dependent enzymes. It is not clear which metal activates the MetAPs in vivo. For in vitro experiments, cobalt is commonly used because it activates all known MetAPs and the cobalt-substituted enzymes are usually the most active (8Ben-Bassat A. Bauer K. Chang S.Y. Myambo K. Boosman A. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc and iron(II) have also been shown to activate some MetAPs (9D'Souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Walker K.W. Bradshaw R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2684-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The metal-chelating residues in all known MetAPs are two glutamates, two aspartates, and one histidine. The geometric arrangement of these residues is practically identical in all of the MetAP x-ray structures (11Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4581-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Several three-dimensional structures of MetAPs have been determined by x-ray diffraction methods including the structure of human MetAP-II with a covalently bound fumagillin molecule (13Roderick S.L.

B. 1964; 136: 864-871Crossref Scopus (40077) Google Scholar) has long been used to study the reactivity of organic molecules and recently began to find its way into biochemistry (18Carloni P. Rothlisberger U. Parrinello M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We present here an example in which the application of density functional theory to a biochemical problem led to a hypothesis, which was subsequently verified by experiments. Our results do not only explain a couple of biochemical phenomena related to MetAPs but also demonstrate the impact that modern quantum-chemical methods can have on the study of biological systems where they can help fill the gap between mere conjectures and physical reality. Our motivation for examining the MetAPs from a theoretical point of view stems from the highly selective, irreversible inhibition mechanism of fumagillin and related epoxides. Many enzyme inhibitors that form a covalent adduct with their target proteins (e.g. the β-lactam antibiotics and acetyl salicylic acid) are important drugs. We believe that the fumagillin/MetAP example is a good test case for theoretical methods that aim at rationalizing the development of covalent enzyme inhibitors, because a large amount of high quality x-ray structural data, also with bound inhibitors, has been published over the last few years. As a first step toward an understanding of the catalytic and inhibitor-binding mechanisms of MetAPs, we studied different protonation states of the active site water molecules by means of molecular dynamics simulations in a combined quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) framework. In the 1.9-Å resolution, x-ray structure of Escherichia coli MetAP (Protein Data Bank code 2mat), one water molecule (or hydroxide ion) is bridging the two cobalt ions and another water molecule is bound to the cobalt ion that is not coordinated to the histidine. Three different protomeric states were examined (see Fig. 2) as follows: one with two bound water molecules, one with a bridging hydroxide ion and a water molecule, and one with two hydroxide ions. For the quantum-mechanical part of the system, the ab initio molecular dynamics method described by Car and Parrinello (CPMD) (19Car R. Parrinello M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1985; 55: 2471-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9341) Google Scholar) was used. Because an accurate treatment of the open-shell cobalt(II) ion is very demanding in the framework of CPMD, we decided to use zinc(II) ions as the active-site metals in the CPMD simulations. The fundamental problem with cobalt is the uncertainty of its spin state and the multiplicity of the bi-cobalt system. A computational study of a di-cobalt system would therefore require the simulation of eight different electronic configurations that is not feasible with CPMD and currently available supercomputer resources. Given the fact that at least some MetAPs have been shown to be active with zinc and considering that a thorough theoretical analysis of the zinc- and cobalt-substituted truncated MetAP active sites did not reveal major geometrical differences between a di-zinc and a di-cobalt system (20Jorgensen A.T. Norrby P.-O. Liljefors T. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2002; 16: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we assume that the replacement of cobalt by zinc does not affect the validity of our results. Furthermore, preliminary CPMD simulations on a di-cobalt MetAP active site with one water and one hydroxide ion did not show geometric or dynamic differences to a di-zinc system (see Supplemental data).

The size of the orthorhombic QM box was 13.2 × 15.9 × 17.2 Å, corresponding to a minimum image distance of 6.4 Å.

Experimental Methods—E. coli MetAP was purified from an overproducer strain that was kindly provided by Drs. Lowther and Matthews. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using the method of Yang et al. (35Yang G. Kirkpatrick R.B. Ho T. Zhang G.F. Liang P.H. Johanson K.O. Casper D.J. Doyle M.L. Marino J.P.

The fumagillin concentration in the inhibition experiments was 66 μm, which is slightly below the IC50 of fumagillin at pH 7 under otherwise identical conditions. Tris/maleate buffer was used for the incubation of MetAP with and without fumagillin at pH 5–8.5 (volume of 30 μl, 15 min, 37 °C). For the ensuing Met-Gly-Met-Met hydrolysis and detection reactions, the pH was adjusted to pH 7.5 by adding 170 μl of 4-fold concentrated Tris/maleate buffer. The fluorescent reaction product (resorufin) was measured using a Wallac microtiter plate reader. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Detailed descriptions of the experiments are given in Supplemental material. Simulations—In the CPMD simulations, the system with the two water molecules coordinated to the zinc ions showed a pronounced movement of the coordinating water molecules away from the x-ray structure of E. coli MetAP that has one water molecule located between the metals. The system evolved to a structure in which there was no more “bridge” between the metals and one water molecule started to form a strong hydrogen bond to a carboxylic acid. The simulation was stopped after ∼5000 steps of simulation (0.85 ps), because the geometry remained essentially stable. In contrast, the structure with one bridging hydroxide was stable during the whole simulation time (∼10,000 steps), showing only the expected thermal motions and a twist of one carboxylic acid group. Fig. 3 gives a comparison of the active site geometries of the biwater and the water-hydroxide system with the crystal structure. Hydrogens have been omitted for clarity. The final state of the bi-hydroxide system is not shown, because it deviates strongly from the crystal structure and a comparison with the other systems would not make any sense. After only ∼1000 steps of simulation, large deviations from the crystal structure were observed in the bi-hydroxide system. After 3000 steps, the metal-coordinating residues were considerably displaced from the crystal structure positions and the simulation was stopped. It becomes clear from Fig. 3 that both the bi-water and the water-hydroxide system are intrinsically stable and quite similar to the 2mat x-ray structure. The root mean square deviations of the active site heavy atoms in comparison with the x-ray structure (hydrogens were not used because they are not present in the x-ray structure) are 0.81 Å for the bi-water and 0.85 for the water-hydroxide system. The main changes are as follows. 1) The bridging water leaves the position between the two metals in the bi-water simulation. 2) In the water-hydroxide simulation, the bridging hydroxide remains in place and one of the metal-coordinating carboxylic acid groups twists to a position that is perpendicular to the x-ray structure. Nevertheless, this residue remains a binding partner for one of the metal ions. A picture of the final state of the simulation is shown in Fig. 4. This figure also shows the HOMO-1 orbital, which is localized at the hydroxide ion, the species that very likely acts as the nucleophilic agent in the substrate hydrolysis reaction. The HOMO orbital, which is ∼0.5 eV higher in energy, is localized at one of the carboxylic acid groups. Experiments—The pH profiles of the inhibitor binding and substrate hydrolysis reaction are given in Fig. 5. It is evident that the pH optimum of the substrate hydrolysis reaction is at pH 7.5, whereas the binding of fumagillin becomes increasingly favored at lower pH. The results presented above allow the following conclusions. 1) In the x-ray structure of E. coli MetAP (2mat), the bridging water molecule is most probably deprotonated. However, an active site with two (fully protonated) water molecules coordinated to the metal ions is also stable, albeit with a different coordination geometry. The x-ray structure of the E. coli MetAP (2mat) was determined at a pH larger than 7, whereas several other MetAP structures were determined at a more acidic pH. (human MetAP-II, see Ref. 15Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The pH in the crystallization medium can not be determined exactly, but the experimental (buffer) conditions described by Liu et al. (15Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) indicate that the pH was below 7. Examining one of these x-ray structures (1bn5), we found that no bridging water molecule is present between the two metals. Taken together, the x-ray structure and the results of the CPMD simulations indicate that two protonation states are possible without disrupting the active site geometry. At a more basic pH, one water molecule is deprotonated and bridging the two metal ions. From the electronic structure calculations, this protonation state is expected to be relevant for the catalytic process. Two water molecules are present in the active site at more acidic pH, each one coordinating a different metal ion. The covalent binding of fumagillin to MetAP requires protonation of the epoxide oxygen. Proton donation from an active site group, in particular from one of the active site water molecules, is more likely in the protonation state with two water molecules (i.e. at more acidic pH). In other words, our calculations and the analysis of the crystal structure indicate that the active site of binuclear E. coli MetAP is characterized by the presence of a water molecule with a pKa of ∼7. This is at the lower border of the pKa values reported for waters coordinating to zinc ions in organic complexes (36Bertini I. Luchinat C. Bertini I. Gray H.B. Lippard S.J. Valentine J.S. Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1994: 37-106Google Scholar). The binding of fumagillin is expected to be favored at more acidic pH, whereas a more basic pH would be required for catalysis. This finding opened the way to an experimental validation of the theory of which we determined the pH-profile of the fumagillin inhibition reaction and the enzymatic activity of MetAP (see Fig. 5). It is obvious that the binding of the inhibitor is favored under more acidic conditions as compared with those that are optimal for the substrate hydrolysis reaction. This observation provides strong substantiation to our interpretation of the QM/MM CPMD simulation results. In summary, the mechanisms of the fumagillin binding and the initial step of the substrate hydrolysis reactions are shown in Fig. 6. The substrate hydrolysis reaction starts with the attack of the metal-bound hydroxide ion to the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond. This mechanism differs slightly from the one that is given in the recent literature (12Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4581-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) where the deprotonation of the metal-bridging water occurs after the substrate has been bound in the active site. Recent theoretical work on the reaction mechanism of imipenem binding to the di-nuclear zinc-β-lactamase (37Suarez D. Diaz N. Merz Jr., K.M. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the substrate hydrolysis mechanism of the di-nuclear bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (38Schürer G. Horn A.H.C. Gedeck P. Clark T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 8815-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) indicate that the nucleophilic attack on the substrate originates from a “terminally” bound and not a bridging hydroxide ion. The nucleophilicity of a hydroxide ion that is complexed to one metal ion is higher than that of a bridging hydroxide. Considering these results, we suggest a mechanism (Fig. 6, bottom) in which a bridging hydroxide (as in the crystal structure) is found in the resting state of the enzyme and the binding of the substrate causes a rearrangement of the complexation pattern. Subsequently, the amide carbonyl carbon is attacked by the terminally bound hydroxide ion, which has an increased nucleophilicity as compared to the bridging hydroxide ion in the resting state. It may be argued that the acidic pH leads to the protonation of an active site residue other than the metal-coordinating water and that fumagillin binding is therefore facilitated by a modification of the non-covalent complex that precedes the binding reaction. However, the only groups that could readily be protonated within the studied pH range would be His-79 and His-178. His-79 is the binding partner of fumagillin. A protonated and therefore positively charged His-79 would certainly be much less prone to act as a nucleophile on fumagillin, and it can thus be assumed that His-79 remains neutral. Therefore, if one assumes that His-79 is not being protonated, it is also very unlikely that His-178 is protonated because the chemical surrounding (which could influence the pKa of the histidine imidazole) is quite similar for both histidines. Furthermore, literature values for the histidine side chain pKa range from 6 to 6.4, which is below the value of ∼7 for the protonation event in the MetAP active site. The results of the CPMD simulations presented here do not provide quantitative free energy data of the different protomeric states. It would certainly be very useful to obtain such data, which could be used to calculate the pKa of metal-bound waters and other ionizable groups in the active site. However, one must be aware of the fact that the prediction of pKa values would require very exact free energy data of different protomeric states and a very complete sampling of conformational space. Even in the classical-mechanical simulation framework (where the computational cost of simulations is smaller by several orders of magnitude and a much more complete exploration of conformational space is possible), free energies are notoriously difficult to predict (39Reinhardt W.P. Miller M.A. Amon L.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we think that a meaningful prediction of free energy differences and pKa values by ab initio simulation methods is currently not feasible. The situation may be somewhat different when less complex systems such as pure water or small solvated ions are considered. In such cases, present computer capabilities can be sufficient to adequately determine pKa values by ab initio MD simulations. Recent experimental work (40Cosper N.J. D'souza V.M. Scott R.A. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13302-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has shown that E. coli MetAP may under certain circumstances function as a mononuclear enzyme, i.e. with only one metal ion coordinating to the active site residues. The metal content and the identity of the metal in the MetAP enzymes in vivo are not known. With the sole exception of the publication mentioned above, all of the experimental data of E. coli and yeast and human MetAPs, including all of the published x-ray structures, have been obtained with bi-nuclear enzymes because enzymes with lower metal content had only marginal or no catalytic activity under the respective experimental conditions. Therefore, we are confident that it is reasonable to assume the presence two metal ions in the active site as we did in our simulation system. Fumagillin and its congeners inhibit the growth of vessels in tumors. Considering the fact that the extracellular pH in tumors is more acidic than in normal tissues, (41Gillies R.J. Raghunand N. Karczmar G.S. Bhujwalla Z.M. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging. 2002; 16: 430-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and assuming that the endothelial cells of vessels in tumors are under the influence of the acidic extracellular tumor pH, one may reason that the pH profile of the fumagillin-MetAP binding reaction leads to selectivity (or targeting) of the fumagillin effect to tumor vessels. The results presented here have several implications for the rational design of MetAP inhibitors. First, virtual screening (docking/scoring) procedures should preferably be made on MetAP active sites with a net charge of –1 if inhibition at neutral pH is desired (e.g. for MetAP inhibitors with antibacterial activity). The active site net charge has a pronounced influence on the binding energetics of ligands in virtual screening and in physical reality, because electrostatic interactions are the strongest driving force for intermolecular attraction and repulsion. Second, irreversible inhibitors different from fumagillin should preferably be compounds that are activated by a nucleophilic attack (coming from the hydroxide ion) or by deprotonation. Such inhibitors would be much more active at physiological pH than fumagillin. For instance, the deprotonation of β-hydroxynitrile esters (cf.Fig. 7) causes cleavage of the ester bond and subsequent formation of acrylonitrile, which can then bind (as a “Michaelis-like” electrophile) to one of the cysteine residues near the MetAP active site. The sequence of reactions would be based on a “basic activation” and not acidic activation as with fumagillin. In conclusion, we have clarified the protonation behavior of the MetAP active site and made an experimental proof of a hypothesis that was generated on the basis of quantum-mechanical calculations.

The soluble nucleotide binding domain of Atm1 (Atm1-C) has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. Dissociation constants (KD) for Atm1-C binding of ATP (KD ∼97 μm, pH 7.3, and ∼102 μm, pH 10.0) and ADP (KD ∼43 μm, pH 7.3, and 92 μm, pH 10.0) were measured by fluorimetry. The higher binding affinity for ADP suggests that the transmembrane-spanning domain may be required to promote a structural change in the nucleotide binding domain to facilitate substrate export and ADP release. ADP also had an inhibitory effect on Atm1-C with an IC50 of 10 mm. The Michaelis-Menten constants Vmax, KM, and kcat of Atm1-C were measured as 1.822 μm min–1, 513 μm, and 0.055 min–1, respectively. The metal dependence of Atm1-C ATPase demonstrated a reactivity order of Mn2+ > Mg2+ > Co2+, while Mg2+ and Co2+ were both found to be inhibitory at higher concentrations. The pH profile and structural comparison with HisP are consistent with a role for His and Lys in promoting the ATPase activity. Structural analysis of Atm1-C by CD spectroscopy suggested a similarity of secondary structure to that found for a prokaryotic homologue (HisP), whereas modeling of the Atm1-C tertiary structure using HisP as a template is also consistent with a similarity in tertiary structure. Atm1-C tends to form a dimer or higher aggregation state at higher concentration; however, the concentration dependence of Atm1-C on ATPase activity and the results of a Hill analysis (napp = 1.1) demonstrated that there was essentially no cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis, in contrast to observations for the prokaryotic HisP transporter, which demonstrated full cooperativity for both full-length and the soluble domains. Accordingly, any cooperative response must be mediated through the transmembrane domain in the case of the eukaryotic Atm1 transporter.

ABC transporters are composed of four structural domains: two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which show a high degree of sequence similarity throughout the family, and two transmembrane domains that typically show six transmembrane-spanning helices (1Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and function of ABC-type proteins have been intensively studied (2Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol.

Recently, the first high resolution x-ray crystal structure of a prokaryotic NBD of histidine permease (HisP) was reported (7Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and has provided insight on the structural basis for function in this class of ATP-dependent transporters. In prokaryotic systems, these transport complexes are usually constituted of individual subunits, whereas in the eukaryotic ABC transporters, they are normally formed from a single peptide chain (1Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol.

It is a transmembrane-spanning protein that is putatively involved in the transfer of iron-sulfur clusters from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol (14Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition to the transmembrane-spanning domain, the protein also possesses a soluble nucleotide-binding domain that mediates hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. Presumably, this ATPase activity is involved in regulating the opening and closing of the channel and/or driving substrate through the channel. The human homologue of Atm1p, ABC7, displays a very high sequence homology in the soluble nucleotide binding domain. Defects in the human ABC7 gene have been shown to cause a rare type of X-linked sideroblastic anemia associated with cerebellar ataxia (XLSA/A) (15Shimada Y. Okuno S. Kawai A. Shinomiya H. Saito A.

Similar mutations in Atm1p or ABC7 have been shown to result in the accumulation of high levels of free iron in the mitochondrion and a lack of iron-sulfur clusters in cytosolic proteins. Three other proteins (Bat1, Bat2, and Erv1) have also been suggested to assist this ABC transporter for iron-sulfur cluster translocation (20Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); however, the functional role of Atm1p in mediating iron-sulfur cluster trafficking remains unknown. Three mitochondrial ABC transporters have thus far been discovered in yeast (11Lill R. Kispal G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the structural and functional properties of these eukaryotic transporters are poorly understood. In this paper, we report the cloning, purification, and characterization of the soluble C-terminal ATP-binding domain of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Atm1 (Atm1-C) and make a detailed comparison with the bacterial HisP protein. This provides a starting point for studies of eukaryotic ABC7-type transporters and an initial step toward the understanding of iron-sulfur cluster export mechanisms in mitochondria. Construction of pET21-Atm1-C—The soluble C-terminal domain of Atm1 (Atm1-C) was predicted by computer analysis of the transmembrane segment using the program Dense Alignment Surface Method (22Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. Von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide-binding domain of the prokaryotic HisP was found to be similar to that for Atm1-C and was further characterized by use of the search tool SWISS-MODEL (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html). The Atm1-C sequence starts from Leu436 of Atm1, and the corresponding gene fragment encoding Atm1-C was PCR-amplified by use of the following primers: 5′-GGC CGC CAT ATG CTT AAA GGC GGA TCT ATT CAA TTC G-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA TGC ATC TCC GGA TTT ATT CGA TTC-3′. Subsequently, this gene was cloned into pET-21b(+) between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The sequence of expression vector pET21-Atm1-C was finally confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and subsequently transformed into an E. coli BL21(DE3) host. Overexpression and Purification of Atm1-C—Expression plasmid pET21-Atm1-C was transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) as described elsewhere (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Cells were grown to an A600 ∼0.7 and were then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. After harvesting and washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, the cells were lysed by sonication with 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3. Since Atm1-C was found to form inclusion bodies, following sonication, the pellet was washed in turn with 50 ml of each of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 500 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3, buffers to remove soluble and membrane-associated proteins. Subsequently, the Atm1-C inclusion body was dissolved in 20 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 10.0) at 4 °C overnight. The denatured solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove the insoluble pellet. Subsequently, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold by the slow addition of a pH 10.0 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. After renaturation, the refolded Atm1-C was concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration. Pure Atm1-C was obtained following ion exchange chromatography (DE52) and gel filtration (G75) chromatography. For DE52 purification, the column was washed with 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-OH, pH 10.0, and subsequently the protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 m to 250 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-OH and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 10.0. The running conditions for the G75 column included an equilibration buffer with 50 mm Tris-OH, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 10.0. The purity of Atm1-C was based on 12% SDS-PAGE analysis. Determination of the Aggregation State of Atm1-C—The aggregation state of Atm1-C was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 12 column on an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. The experiment was performed in a pH 10.0 buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The gel filtration column had previously been calibrated with the FPLC molecular mass standards lysozyme (14.3 kDa), deoxyribonuclease I (31 kDa), pepsin (35 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and bovine serum albumin dimer (132 kDa). Blue dextrin was used to determine the dead volume. Molecular masses were determined by plotting log molecular masses of standards versus Kav, where Kav = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0), Ve represents elution volume, V0 is dead volume, and Vt is total column volume. Fluorescence Determination of ATP and ADP Binding Constant to Atm1-C by Fluorimetry—A 500-μl solution of 10 μm Atm1-C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3 or pH 10.0) was titrated with 1-μl aliquots of ATP or ADP (from 5 or 50 mm stocks) in reaction buffers containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3 or 10.0). The total volume of titrant added was 20 μl, and the effect of the dilution on the emission intensity was negligible. The change in fluorescence emission was monitored by use of a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (Tyr and Trp excitation) or 295 nm (Trp excitation) and an emission wavelength of 330 or 340 nm, respectively. The data were plotted as ΔI/Io versus ATP or ADP concentration and fitted by use of the equation ΔI/Io = constant[S]/(KD + [S]) (24Encinas M.V. Rojas M.C. Goldie H. Cardemil E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), where ΔI = (Io – Iobs) and Iobs is the observed emission following each addition of titrant with a resulting nucleotide concentration defined by [S]. The constant accounts for the fact that the saturating emission is not necessarily zero (i.e. the emission is not completely quenched). Corrections for the inner filter effect were made using the equation Icorr = Iobs·10A/2 (25Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 4406-4412Google Scholar), where Icorr represents the corrected emission intensity, Iobs is the observed intensity, and A is the absorbance at the excitation wave-length. This accounted for any change in emission intensity that results from nonbinding events such as absorption of light by the nucleotide, although such corrections were found to be minor. To confirm the requirement for a structured binding pocket to promote nucleotide binding, a control experiment was carried out. A mixture containing 150 μl of 10 μm Atm1-C in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.3, was titrated with ATP or ADP in reaction buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl and 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.3, and the variation in emission intensity was monitored at 330 and 340 nm as described earlier. ATPase Activity Assay—A 350-μl volume of a reaction mixture containing 30 μm of Atm1-C in an assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.3 or 10.0) was incubated with 2 mm ATP at 37 °C for 3 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 mm MgCl2 to a final concentration 2 mm. A 50-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken and placed in a tube containing 50 μl of 7.5% SDS. The amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined by a colorimetric assay, using Na2HPO4 as a standard and monitoring the absorbance change at 820 nm (26Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J.

Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The pH profile for the reaction displayed bell-shaped behavior and was fit by use of Equation 1, where Vmax represents the maximal activity under saturating conditions, Vopt represents the optimum initial velocity with respect to pH, and the pKa values represent the fitted ionization constants assuming two ionization events.Vmax=Vopt/(1+10-pH/10-pKa1+10-pKa2/10-pH)(Eq. 1) Influence of Phospholipid on ATPase Activity—Experiments to examine the phospholipid dependence of the reaction of Atm1-C were performed with 20 μm Atm1-C with 2 mm ATP in a pH 8.0 assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction was preincubated on ice for 30 min with 0.04, 0.2, and 1 mg/ml phosphatidylethanolamine or cardiolipin and initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Quantitation of the amount and rate of phosphate release has been described under “ATPase Activity Assay.” Metal Dependence of the ATPase Activity of Atm1-C—The metal dependence of the reaction was examined with 20 μm Atm1-C and 2 mm ATP in an assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+ to the desired concentration. Quantitation of the amount and rate of phosphate release has been described under “ATPase Activity Assay.” For Mg2+ and Co2+, which displayed inhibitory effects at higher [M2+], Equation 2 was used, whereas the simpler Equation 3 was used for Mn2+ that showed no inhibitory behavior, where kcat and KM are the standard Michaelis constants, KM2+ is the dissociation constant for metal promoted activity, KI is the inhibition constant, and other concentration terms are total enzyme, substrate, and metal ion concentrations. Equations 2 and 3 were readily derived from standard equations (28Fresht A. Enzyme Kinetics,2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1997: 107-109Google Scholar) by assuming a bound metal to be required for activity and a bound metal requirement for inhibition.V0=kcat·[Eo]·[So]·KI·KM2+·[Mg2+]/((1+KM2+·[Mg2+])·(KI·([S∘]+KM)+KM·[Mg2+]))(Eq. 2) V0=kcat·[Eo]·[So]·KM2+·[Mg2+]/((1+KM2+·[Mg2+])·([So]+KM))(Eq. 3) Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were measured on an Aviv model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired with a 0.3-mm path length cuvette. Concentration of Atm1-C was 10 μm in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 100 mm KCl. Spectra acquired at 20 °C were determined per 0.2 nm in triplicate and averaged. Secondary structure quantitation was determined via the self-consistent method (29Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar) with the Dicroprot version 2.5 version 5.0 package (30Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines (available on the World Wide Web at www.ibcp.fr). Buffer spectra were always subtracted. Modeling—The three-dimensional structure of Atm1-C was predicted by use of the SwissModel First Approach Mode. The input sequence of Atm1-C starts from Leu436 of Atm1 with an additional Met at the N terminus. The lower Blast P(N) limit for template selection was set to 0.00001. The three-dimensional structure of HisP was also used as the self-input template file for the tertiary structure prediction of Atm1-C. The final model output was a Swiss-PDB viewer project file (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9634) Google Scholar, 32Peitsch M.C. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4530) Google Scholar). Design and Cloning of the Truncated Atm1-C Gene—The amino acid sequence designation of the C-terminal soluble domain of Atm1, Atm1-C, was based both on the use of a tool to search for similar sequences (SWISS-MODEL) and on the structure of the sequence-related bacterial protein, HisP. The amino acid comparison of HisP and Atm1-C is shown in Fig. 1 (34Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5507) Google Scholar), and the predicted transmembrane-spanning region (22Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. Von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also provided important guidelines for construction of the nucleotide-binding domain of Atm1. Structural information is limited for ABC transporters, and HisP is the only representative of this family with a high resolution structure for the nucleotide-binding domain (7Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Characterization of Atm1-C Aggregation State—Purified Atm1-C was observed to form a white flurry during concentration by Amicon ultrafiltration, especially in the vicinity of the membrane surface. This most likely reflects contact by a membrane-associated domain remaining in this protein. The aggregation state of Atm1-C was determined by use of gel filtration chromatography. The FPLC elution profile (Fig. 2) showed that most of the expressed Atm1-C was formed as a high molecular weight aggregate with a small amount of dimer. A very low concentration of monomer was also detected in buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol during gel filtration chromatography. However, Fig. 2 shows that in buffer containing 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, the relative amounts of both the high molecular weight aggregate and the dimeric form were shown to dramatically decrease relative to the amount of monomer. This suggested formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds in Atm1-C as the principal reason for formation of the high molecular weight aggregate and dimer. By use of appropriate standards, the molecular mass of monomer was determined by gel filtration as 28.5 kDa, and the molecular mass of dimer was determined as 56.9 kDa. These are similar to the calculated masses of 26.9 and 58.9 kDa, respectively. The molecular mass of each eluted fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. ATP and ADP Binding to Atm1-C—There are six Tyr and one Trp in the sequence of Atm1-C. Both residues are electronically excited following excitation at 280 nm, whereas only Trp is stimulated by 295-nm excitation. Nucleotide binding to Atm1-C can and does result in a decrease in the combined emission intensity of both Tyr and Trp (Fig. 3) and the measured KD values are summarized in Table I. Control experiments with denatured Atm1-C (Fig. 3) demonstrate that the change in emission intensity is a consequence of binding rather than a reduction of energy input as a result of the absorption of light by nucleotide. Specifically, the experiments show that there is no binding for either ADP or ATP after accounting for the inner filter effect of the denaturant. Since nucleotide does not absorb at 295 nm, an additional control experiment was carried out by monitoring the weaker Trp emission following 295-nm excitation (data not shown). Within error, similar binding parameters were obtained, so we conclude that the binding affinity that is measured from the change in emission intensity indeed reflects the actual binding between the refolded Atm1-C domain and ATP or ADP. It is important to note, however, that these results do not suggest a specific mechanism for quenching, whether directly through energy transfer from specific Tyr or Trp residues, or as a result of conformational changes that influence the polarity and/or solvent accessibility of the environment around such residues.Table INucleotide binding affinity to Atm1-C measured by fluorescence quenchingATPADPConstantKDConstantKDμmμmpH 7.30.60970.4343pH 10.00.481020.4892 Open table in a new tab Our results from monitoring both Tyr and Trp emission indicate that ADP binds more tightly to Atm1-C than ATP binding at both pH 10.0 and 7.3. The binding affinity at pH 10.0 is lower than that at pH 7.3, consistent with more extensive deprotonation of residues in Atm1-C at higher pH with an increase in repulsion between Atm1-C and either ATP or ADP. Atm1-C ATPase Activity and Inhibition—The ATPase activity of Atm1-C was determined from the initial rate of phosphate release, which was linear with time over a period of at least 1 h. From the resulting Michaelis-Menten plot (Fig. 4) the Vmax, KM, and kcat of Atm1-C were measured as 1.822 μm min–1 (or 0.02 μmol min–1 mg–1), 512.85 μm, and 0.0552 min–1, respectively. When analyzed by the Hill equation (35Davidson A.L. Laghaeian S.S. Mannering D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the apparent Hill coefficient, napp, reflecting the number of substrate binding sites per unit of active enzyme, was equal to 1.1 ± 0.2. The dependence of ATPase activity on Atm1-C concentration was determined over a range of protein concentration with 2 mm ATP substrate in each reaction. Methods for quantifying the concentration of liberated phosphate were described under “Experimental Procedures.” A linear relationship between ATPase activity and Atm1-C concentration was observed, suggesting that each subunit of Atm1-C acted as an individual unit for ATP hydrolysis and consistent with the measured Hill coefficient napp ∼1.1. The pH dependence of the ATPase activity of Atm1-C was examined between pH 5.5 and 10.0. Fig. 5 shows the optimal pH for ATP activity to be around 8, indicative of two ionization events involving distinct residues that may influence ATPase activity. The pKa values of these two residues have been determined by use of Equation 1, and the values of pKa1 and pKa2 are determined to be 7.3 and 9.3, respectively. The results are consistent with involvement of specific amino acid residues in general acid and general base catalysis of ATP hydrolysis (36Scarborough G.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The influence of phospholipids on ATPase activity was measured by adding phosphatidylethanolamine or cardiolipin to final concentrations of 0.04, 0.2, and 1 mg/ml. Neither showed any significant effect on ATPase activity by comparison with control experiments. This result is also consistent with results from concentration dependence experiments that suggested each subunit of Atm1-C acts as an individual unit for ATP hydrolysis. Experiments to determine the inhibitory influence of several standard ATPase inhibitors were performed with 20 μm Atm1-C in the presence of 2 mm ATP. The reaction was preincubated with 2 mm inhibitor on ice for 30 min and initiated by the addition MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Vanadate, nitrate, and azide were used to test for P-type ATPase, V-type ATPase, and F-type ATPase inhibition, respectively. None of these showed any effect on enzymatic inhibition. Only ADP had an inhibitory effect on Atm1-C with an IC50 of 10 mm. This number is comparable with that obtained for HisP (∼2 mm) (26Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Metal Cofactor Promotion and Inhibition of Atm1-C Activity— The results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated that Mg2+ and Co2+ stimulate ATPase activity to similar extents. The optimum concentration of these two cations is 0.5 mm, although with increasing cation concentration, the ATPase activity was found to decrease. Manganous ion was found to best stimulate ATPase activity, especially at higher cation concentration. This result is generally in agreement with observations made with HisP (26Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although in the latter case each of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ were found to be inhibitory at higher concentrations, whereas only Mg2+ and Co2+ were inhibitory at higher concentrations for Atm1-C. The inhibitory influence of the metal ion dependence of ATPase activity was analyzed according to the saturation model that has been described in a previous study of metal cofactor-promoted ribonuclease H activity (37Black C.B. Cowan J.A. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 5805-5808Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this saturation model, metal ion bound substrate may become inhibitory at high metal ion concentrations, where either the nucleotide substrate or the enzyme may bind additional metal ions. For such a scenario, the metal binding constant (KM2+) and inhibition constant (KI) can be determined by Equation 2. The results are summarized in Table II, where it is seen that Co2+ shows the largest inhibitory effect on ATPase activity. Since Mn2+ shows no inhibitory influence over the concentration range used, a simpler hyperbolic binding equation (Equation 3) was used.Table IIMetal binding constants (KM2+) and inhibition constants (KI) for Atm1-C ATP hydrolysisMetal factorKM2+KImmMg2+0.51.4Co2+1.94.1Mn2+2.1 Open table"
https://openalex.org/W1984926939,"Abstract Expression of the bgl operon in Escherichia coli, induced by β-glucosides, is positively regulated by BglG, a transcriptional antiterminator. In the presence of inducer, BglG dimerizes and binds to the bgl transcript to prevent premature termination of transcription. The dimeric state of BglG is determined by BglF, a membrane-bound enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), which reversibly phosphorylates BglG according to β-glucoside availability. BglG is composed of an RNA-binding domain followed by two homologous PTS regulation domains (PRD1 and PRD2). The predicted structure of dimeric LicT, a BglG homologue from Bacillus subtilis, suggests that the two PRDs adopt a similar structure and that the interactions within the dimer are PRD1-PRD1 and PRD2-PRD2. We have shown recently that the PRD1 and PRD2 domains of BglG can form a stable heterodimer. We report here, based on in vitro and in vivo cross-linking experiments, that a fraction of BglG is present in the cell in a compact form in which PRD1 and PRD2 are in close proximity. The compact form is present mainly in the BglG monomers. Our results imply that the monomer-dimer transition involves a conformational change. The possible role of the compact form in preventing untimely induction of the bgl operon is discussed."
