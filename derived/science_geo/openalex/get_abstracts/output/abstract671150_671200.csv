https://openalex.org/W3148277587,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have arisen independently at multiple locations1,2 and may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines that target the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-23. Here, using a live-virus neutralization assay, we compared the neutralization of a non-VOC variant with the 501Y.V2 VOC (also known as B.1.351) using plasma collected from adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the two waves of infection in South Africa, the second wave of which was dominated by infections with the 501Y.V2 variant. Sequencing demonstrated that infections of plasma donors from the first wave were with viruses that did not contain the mutations associated with 501Y.V2, except for one infection that contained the E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain. The 501Y.V2 virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from individuals who were infected during the second wave. The first-wave virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from first-wave infections. However, the 501Y.V2 variant was poorly cross-neutralized by plasma from individuals with first-wave infections; the efficacy was reduced by 15.1-fold relative to neutralization of 501Y.V2 by plasma from individuals infected in the second wave. By contrast, cross-neutralization of first-wave virus variants using plasma from individuals with second-wave infections was more effective, showing only a 2.3-fold decrease relative to neutralization of first-wave virus variants by plasma from individuals infected in the first wave. Although we tested only one plasma sample from an individual infected with a SARS-CoV-2 variant with only the E484K substitution, this plasma sample potently neutralized both variants. The observed effective neutralization of first-wave virus by plasma from individuals infected with 501Y.V2 provides preliminary evidence that vaccines based on VOC sequences could retain activity against other circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages."
https://openalex.org/W3150351745,"Beyond their substantial protection of individual vaccinees, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines might reduce viral load in breakthrough infection and thereby further suppress onward transmission. In this analysis of a real-world dataset of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test results after inoculation with the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine, we found that the viral load was substantially reduced for infections occurring 12–37 d after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint at a potentially lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine effect on virus spread. Breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 occurring 12 or more days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine were associated with lower viral loads than those found in unvaccinated individuals, suggesting that the vaccine might reduce infectiousness."
https://openalex.org/W3150063851,"Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain cancers that recur as therapy-resistant tumors. Myeloid cells control glioblastoma malignancy, but their dynamics during disease progression remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing and CITE-seq to map the glioblastoma immune landscape in mouse tumors and in patients with newly diagnosed disease or recurrence. This revealed a large and diverse myeloid compartment, with dendritic cell and macrophage populations that were conserved across species and dynamic across disease stages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) consisted of microglia- or monocyte-derived populations, with both exhibiting additional heterogeneity, including subsets with conserved lipid and hypoxic signatures. Microglia- and monocyte-derived TAMs were self-renewing populations that competed for space and could be depleted via CSF1R blockade. Microglia-derived TAMs were predominant in newly diagnosed tumors, but were outnumbered by monocyte-derived TAMs following recurrence, especially in hypoxic tumor environments. Our results unravel the glioblastoma myeloid landscape and provide a framework for future therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3145026833,"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathology of and immune response to COVID-191-8. However, a thorough investigation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection has been lacking. Here we use high-parameter imaging mass cytometry9 that targets the expression of 36 proteins to investigate the cellular composition and spatial architecture of acute lung injury in humans (including injuries derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection) at single-cell resolution. These spatially resolved single-cell data unravel the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung, alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyperinflammatory cell state that is associated with lung damage. We leverage the temporal range of fatal outcomes of COVID-19 in relation to the onset of symptoms, which reveals increased macrophage extravasation and increased numbers of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses-possibly as a result of attempts to repair the damaged lung tissue. Our data enable us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. We use this landscape to characterize the pathophysiology of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell level, which provides an important basis for understanding COVID-19 and lung pathology in general."
https://openalex.org/W3135694162,"Vascular complications following solid organ transplantation may lead to graft ischemia, dysfunction or loss. Imaging approaches can provide intermittent assessments of graft perfusion, but require highly skilled practitioners and do not directly assess graft oxygenation. Existing systems for monitoring tissue oxygenation are limited by the need for wired connections, the inability to provide real-time data or operation restricted to surface tissues. Here, we present a minimally invasive system to monitor deep-tissue O2 that reports continuous real-time data from centimeter-scale depths in sheep and up to a 10-cm depth in ex vivo porcine tissue. The system is composed of a millimeter-sized, wireless, ultrasound-powered implantable luminescence O2 sensor and an external transceiver for bidirectional data transfer, enabling deep-tissue oxygenation monitoring for surgical or critical care indications."
https://openalex.org/W3147574308,"Almost all haplotype-based variant callers were designed specifically for detecting common germline variation in diploid populations, and give suboptimal results in other scenarios. Here we present Octopus, a variant caller that uses a polymorphic Bayesian genotyping model capable of modeling sequencing data from a range of experimental designs within a unified haplotype-aware framework. Octopus combines sequencing reads and prior information to phase-called genotypes of arbitrary ploidy, including those with somatic mutations. We show that Octopus accurately calls germline variants in individuals, including single nucleotide variants, indels and small complex replacements such as microinversions. Using a synthetic tumor data set derived from clean sequencing data from a sample with known germline haplotypes and observed mutations in a large cohort of tumor samples, we show that Octopus is more sensitive to low-frequency somatic variation, yet calls considerably fewer false positives than other methods. Octopus also outputs realigned evidence BAM files to aid validation and interpretation. Octopus detects germline and somatic variants with high sensitivity and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3150131477,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a critical immune signaling molecule and therapeutic target. We identified damaging monoallelic SYK variants in six patients with immune deficiency, multi-organ inflammatory disease such as colitis, arthritis and dermatitis, and diffuse large B cell lymphomas. The SYK variants increased phosphorylation and enhanced downstream signaling, indicating gain of function. A knock-in (SYK-Ser544Tyr) mouse model of a patient variant (p.Ser550Tyr) recapitulated aspects of the human disease that could be partially treated with a SYK inhibitor or transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type mice. Our studies demonstrate that SYK gain-of-function variants result in a potentially treatable form of inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W3143045855,"This paper presents a novel amplifier that satisfies both low distortion and high efficiency for high-frequency wireless ultrasound systems with limited battery life and size. While increasing the amplifier efficiency helps to address the problems for wireless ultrasound systems, it can cause signal distortion owing to harmonic components. Therefore, a new type of class F amplifier is designed to achieve high efficiency and low distortion. In the amplifier, the resonant circuit at each stage controls the harmonic components to reduce distortion and improve efficiency. Transformers with a large shunt resistor are also helpful to reduce the remaining noise in the input signal. The proposed class F amplifier is tested using simulations, and the voltage and current waveforms are analyzed to achieve correct operation with adequate efficiency and distortion. The measured performance of the class F amplifier has a gain of 23.2 dB and a power added efficiency (PAE) of 88.9% at 25 MHz. The measured DC current is 121 mA with a variance of less than 1% when the PA is operating. We measured the received echo signal through the pulse-echo response using a 25-MHz transducer owing to the compatibility of the designed class F amplifier with high- frequency transducers. The measured total harmonic distortion (THD) of the echo signal was obtained as 4.5% with a slightly low ring-down. The results show that the low THD and high PAE of the new high-efficiency and high-voltage amplifier may increase battery life and reduce the cooling fan size, thus providing a suitable environment for high-frequency wireless ultrasound systems."
https://openalex.org/W3150031743,"Ultraconserved enhancer sequences show perfect conservation between human and rodent genomes, suggesting that their functions are highly sensitive to mutation. However, current models of enhancer function do not sufficiently explain this extreme evolutionary constraint. We subjected 23 ultraconserved enhancers to different levels of mutagenesis, collectively introducing 1,547 mutations, and examined their activities in transgenic mouse reporter assays. Overall, we find that the regulatory properties of ultraconserved enhancers are robust to mutation. Upon mutagenesis, nearly all (19/23, 83%) still functioned as enhancers at one developmental stage, as did most of those tested again later in development (5/9, 56%). Replacement of endogenous enhancers with mutated alleles in mice corroborated results of transgenic assays, including the functional resilience of ultraconserved enhancers to mutation. Our findings show that the currently known activities of ultraconserved enhancers do not necessarily require the perfect conservation observed in evolution and suggest that additional regulatory or other functions contribute to their sequence constraint."
https://openalex.org/W3133863581,"Neural correlates of external variables provide potential internal codes that guide an animal’s behavior. Notably, first-order features of neural activity, such as single-neuron firing rates, have been implicated in encoding information. However, the extent to which higher-order features, such as multineuron coactivity, play primary roles in encoding information or secondary roles in supporting single-neuron codes remains unclear. Here, we show that millisecond-timescale coactivity among hippocampal CA1 neurons discriminates distinct, short-lived behavioral contingencies. This contingency discrimination was unrelated to the tuning of individual neurons, but was instead an emergent property of their coactivity. Contingency-discriminating patterns were reactivated offline after learning, and their reinstatement predicted trial-by-trial memory performance. Moreover, optogenetic suppression of inputs from the upstream CA3 region during learning impaired coactivity-based contingency information in the CA1 and subsequent dynamic memory retrieval. These findings identify millisecond-timescale coactivity as a primary feature of neural firing that encodes behaviorally relevant variables and supports memory retrieval. El-Gaby et al. combine multiunit recordings and optogenetic silencing in the mouse hippocampus and uncover a primary role for millisecond-timescale neural coactivity in encoding behavioral contingency information and supporting memory retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W3146832084,"Internal states such as arousal, attention and motivation modulate brain-wide neural activity, but how these processes interact with learning is not well understood. During learning, the brain modifies its neural activity to improve behavior. How do internal states affect this process? Using a brain-computer interface learning paradigm in monkeys, we identified large, abrupt fluctuations in neural population activity in motor cortex indicative of arousal-like internal state changes, which we term 'neural engagement.' In a brain-computer interface, the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior is known, allowing us to understand how neural engagement impacted behavioral performance for different task goals. We observed stereotyped changes in neural engagement that occurred regardless of how they impacted performance. This allowed us to predict how quickly different task goals were learned. These results suggest that changes in internal states, even those seemingly unrelated to goal-seeking behavior, can systematically influence how behavior improves with learning."
https://openalex.org/W3142610174,"Memories are supported by distributed hippocampal-thalamic-cortical networks, but the brain regions that contribute to network activity may vary with memory age. This process of reorganization is referred to as systems consolidation, and previous studies have examined the relationship between the activation of different hippocampal, thalamic, and cortical brain regions and memory age at the time of recall. While the activation of some brain regions increases with memory age, other regions become less active. In mice, here we show that the active disengagement of one such brain region, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, is necessary for recall at remote time-points and, in addition, which projection(s) mediate such inhibition. Specifically, we identified a sparse inhibitory projection from CA3 to the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus that becomes more active during systems consolidation, such that it is necessary for contextual fear memory retrieval at remote, but not recent, time-points post-learning."
https://openalex.org/W3149437330,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) harboring the P67L variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) often exhibit a typical CF phenotype, including severe respiratory compromise. This rare mutation (reported in <300 patients worldwide) responds robustly to CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor and tezacaftor, with rescue in model systems that far exceed what can be achieved for the archetypical CFTR mutant F508del. However, the specific molecular consequences of the P67L mutation are poorly characterized. In this study, we conducted biochemical measurements following low-temperature growth and/or intragenic suppression, which suggest a mechanism underlying P67L that (1) shares key pathogenic features with F508del, including off-pathway (non-native) folding intermediates, (2) is linked to folding stability of nucleotide-binding domains 1 and 2, and (3) demonstrates pharmacologic rescue that requires domains in the carboxyl half of the protein. We also investigated the ""lasso"" helices 1 and 2, which occur immediately upstream of P67. Based on limited proteolysis, pulse chase, and molecular dynamics analysis of full-length CFTR and a series of deletion constructs, we argue that P67L and other maturational processing (class 2) defects impair the integrity of the lasso motif and confer misfolding of downstream domains. Thus, amino-terminal missense variants elicit a conformational change throughout CFTR that abrogates maturation while providing a robust substrate for pharmacologic repair."
https://openalex.org/W3150412703,"Countries around the world have taken control measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including Korea. Social distancing is considered an essential strategy to reduce transmission in the absence of vaccination or treatment. While interventions have been successful in controlling COVID-19 in Korea, maintaining the current restrictions incurs great social costs. Thus, it is important to analyze the impact of different polices on the spread of the epidemic. To model the COVID-19 outbreak, we use an extended age-structured SEIR model with quarantine and isolation compartments. The model is calibrated to age-specific cumulative confirmed cases provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Four control measures—school closure, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation—are investigated. Because the infectiousness of the exposed has been controversial, we study two major scenarios, considering contributions to infection of the exposed, the quarantined, and the isolated. Assuming the transmission rate would increase more than 1.7 times after the end of social distancing, a second outbreak is expected in the first scenario. The epidemic threshold for increase of contacts between teenagers after school reopening is 3.3 times, which brings the net reproduction number to 1. The threshold values are higher in the second scenario. If the average time taken until isolation and quarantine reduces from three days to two, cumulative cases are reduced by 60% and 47% in the first scenario, respectively. Meanwhile, the reduction is 33% and 41%, respectively, for rapid isolation and quarantine in the second scenario. Without social distancing, a second wave is possible, irrespective of whether we assume risk of infection by the exposed. In the non-infectivity of the exposed scenario, early detection and isolation are significantly more effective than quarantine. Furthermore, quarantining the exposed is as important as isolating the infectious when we assume that the exposed also contribute to infection."
https://openalex.org/W3150453735,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a natural multifunctional phospholipid, is highly increased in plasma from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and mediates proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) by activating the Notch3 signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underpinning S1P-mediated induction of PASMCs proliferation remain unclear. In this study, using biochemical and molecular biology approaches, RNA interference and gene expression analyses, 5′-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we demonstrated that S1P promoted the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), and subsequently upregulated the expression of the microRNA miR-135b, which further reduced the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase β-transduction repeat-containing protein and led to a reduction in yes-associated protein (YAP) ubiquitinated degradation in PASMCs. YAP is the core effector of the Hippo pathway and mediates the expression of particular genes. The accumulation of YAP further increased the expression and activation of Notch3 and ultimately promoted the proliferation of PASMCs. In addition, we showed that preblocking S1PR2, prior silencing of STAT3, miR-135b, or YAP, and prior inhibition of Notch3 all attenuated S1P-induced PASMCs proliferation. Taken together, our study indicates that S1P stimulates PASMCs proliferation by activation of the S1PR2/STAT3/miR-135b/β-transduction repeat-containing protein/YAP/Notch3 pathway, and our data suggest that targeting this cascade might have potential value in ameliorating PASMCs hyperproliferation and benefit pulmonary arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3151061351,"Wheat has remarkable importance among cereals in Egypt. Salt stress affects plant growth, development, and crop productivity. Therefore, salinity tolerance is an essential trait that must be incorporated in crops. This research aimed to investigate molecular and biochemical indicators and defence responses in seedlings of 14 Egyptian wheat genotypes to distinguish the most contrasting salt-responsive genotypes. Analysis of ISSR and SCoT markers revealed high polymorphism and reproducible fingerprinting profiles for evaluating genetic variability within the studied genotypes. The HB-10 and SCoT 1 primers had the highest values for all the studied parameters. All the tested primers generated a set of 66 polymorphic bands among tolerant and sensitive genotypes. The transcript profiles of eight TaWRKY genes showed significant induction under the salinity treatments. Moreover, the expression of TaWRKY6 for genotypes Sids 14 and Sakha 93 sharply increased and recorded the highest expression, while the expression of TaWRKY20 for Misr 1 recorded the lowest expression. Under salt stress, the total sugar, proline, and phenolic contents increased significantly, while the chlorophyll content decreased significantly. Additionally, five peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase isoforms were observed in treated leaves and clustered into five different patterns. Some isoforms increased significantly as salinity levels increased. This increase was clearer in salt-tolerant than in salt-sensitive genotypes. Eighteen protein bands appeared, most of which were not affected by salinity compared with the control, and specific bands were rare. Generally, the Sids 14, Sakha 93, Sohag 4, and Gemmeiza 12 genotypes are considered salt tolerant in comparison to the other genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3143165618,"Inflammasomes are macromolecular complexes involved in the host response to external and endogenous danger signals. Inflammasome-mediated sterile inflammation plays a central role in several human conditions such as autoimmune diseases, type-2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, indicating inflammasomes could be appealing therapeutic targets. Previous work has demonstrated that inhibiting the ATPase activity of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), disrupts inflammasome assembly and function. However, there is a necessity to find new potent compounds with therapeutic potential. Here we combine computational modeling of the target and virtual screening to discover a group of novel compounds predicted to inhibit NLRP3. We characterized the best compounds and determined their potency, specificity, and ability to inhibit processes downstream from NLRP3 activation. Moreover, we analyzed in mice the competence of a lead candidate to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. We also validated the active pharmacophore shared among all the NLRP3 inhibitors, and through computational docking, we clarify key structural features for compound positioning within the inflammasome ATP-binding site. Our study sets the basis for rational design and optimization of inflammasome-targeting probes and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3148158340,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate in the changes in the percentage of adolescents who brush their teeth twice a day and the association with socio-economic status and health behaviors between 2006, 2010 and 2014 among adolescents from the French cross-sectional studies of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Methods Our sample included 18727 adolescents aged 11, 13 or 15 years old (y/o). The relationship between toothbrushing frequency (TBF) and eating habits, health and socio-economic status markers, family status, school perception, substance use, sedentary lifestyle and physical activity, together with their evolution over the 3 studies, were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Results The proportion of adolescents brushing twice a day increased from 68.8% in 2006 to 70.8% in 2010 and 78.8% in 2014 (p&lt;0.0001). Notable associated factors (p&lt;0.0001) were: being a girl (adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.5) and, even more, an older girl (aOR 1.5 for 15 y/o vs 11 y/o girls), having breakfast (aOR 1.4) and eating fruits daily (aOR 1.6), excellent perceived health (aOR 1.2), obesity or overweight (aOR 0.6), being bullied at school (aOR 0.8), and perceived family wealth (aOR 1.4 for High vs Low). No impact from any associated factor changed over the 3 studies. Conclusions Among French adolescents, TBF improved from 2006 to 2014. TBF was significantly associated with other health behaviors. These associations stayed similar in 2006, 2010 and 2010. This increase in TBF may be linked with global prevention programs developed during this time period. These programs should be maintained and associated with more specific ones targeting and adapted to disadvantaged populations, in order to reduce inequalities in oral hygiene and oral health."
https://openalex.org/W3140607877,"Ceramide-1-phosphate transfer proteins (CPTPs) are members of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily that shuttle ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) between membranes. CPTPs regulate cellular sphingolipid homeostasis in ways that impact programmed cell death and inflammation. CPTP downregulation specifically alters C1P levels in the plasma and trans-Golgi membranes, stimulating proinflammatory eicosanoid production and autophagy-dependent inflammasome-mediated cytokine release. However, the mechanisms used by CPTP to target the trans-Golgi and plasma membrane are not well understood. Here, we monitored C1P intervesicular transfer using fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and showed that certain phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI-(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P)) increased CPTP transfer activity, whereas others (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3P) and PI) did not. PIPs that stimulated CPTP did not stimulate GLTP, another superfamily member. Short-chain PI-(4,5)P2, which is soluble and does not remain membrane-embedded, failed to activate CPTP. CPTP stimulation by physiologically relevant PI-(4,5)P2 levels surpassed that of phosphatidylserine (PS), the only known non-PIP stimulator of CPTP, despite PI-(4,5)P2 increasing membrane equilibrium binding affinity less effectively than PS. Functional mapping of mutations that led to altered FRET lipid transfer and assessment of CPTP membrane interaction by surface plasmon resonance indicated that di-arginine motifs located in the α-6 helix and the α3-α4 helix regulatory loop of the membrane-interaction region serve as PI-(4,5)P2 headgroup-specific interaction sites. Haddock modeling revealed specific interactions involving the PI-(4,5)P2 headgroup that left the acyl chains oriented favorably for membrane embedding. We propose that PI-(4,5)P2 interaction sites enhance CPTP activity by serving as preferred membrane targeting/docking sites that favorably orient the protein for function."
https://openalex.org/W3140918691,"Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as the research area, this paper used OD cluster analysis based on Baidu migration data from January 11 to January 25 (before the sealing-off of Wuhan) and concluded that there is a significant correlation 1the migration level from Wuhan to the GBA and the epidemic severity index. This paper also analyzed the migration levels and diffusivity of the outer and inner cities of the GBA. Lastly, four evaluation indexes were selected to research the possibility of work resumption and the rating of epidemic prevention and control through kernel density estimation. According to the study, the amount of migration depends on the geographical proximity, relationship and economic development of the source region, and the severity of the epidemic depends mainly on the migration volume and the severity of the epidemic in the source region. The epidemic risk is related not only to the severity of the epidemic in the source region but also to the degree of urban traffic development and the degree of urban openness. After the resumption of work, the pressure of epidemic prevention and control has been concentrated mainly in Shenzhen and Canton; the further away a region is from the core cities, the lower the pressure in that region. The mass migration of the population makes it difficult to control the epidemic effectively. The study of the relationship between migration volume, epidemic severity and epidemic risk is helpful to further analyze transmission types and predict the trends of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3142279617,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the use of maize ( Zea mays L.) grain as an energy source in poultry feeds has become unsustainable due to competing demands and suboptimal growing conditions for the maize crop. Sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor Moench L.) and pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ) grains are potential sustainable alternatives, given their tolerance to local growing conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of total replacement of maize grain with whole or crushed sorghum and pearl millet grains on feed intake, and physiological and meat quality parameters of Jumbo quail. Five experimental diets were formulated by completely replacing crushed maize grain in a commercial grower diet (CON) with whole sorghum (WSG), crushed sorghum (CSG), whole millet (WMG), or crushed millet (CMG). Three hundred and fifty, two-week-old Jumbo quail chicks (74.7 ± 8.81 g live-weight) were evenly distributed into 35 replicate pens to which the experimental diets were allotted. Statistically similar ( P &gt; 0.05) weight gain and FCE values were observed between birds reared on the control and pearl millet-based diets. However, birds fed with sorghum-based diets had the lowest FCE and weight gain. Blood parameters fell within the normal ranges reported for healthy quail. Birds fed the whole sorghum grain diet had the least ( P &lt; 0.05) serum calcium and higher monocytes, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentrations compared to those reared on the control diet. Compared to the control, the whole sorghum-containing diet reduced ( P &lt; 0.05) carcass, breast, wing, thigh, drumstick, liver, gizzard, and large intestine weights of the birds. Complete replacement of maize grain with pearl millet grain (whole or crushed) did not compromise feed intake, growth performance, and meat quality traits of the Jumbo quail birds. However, whole sorghum grain reduced growth performance of the birds."
https://openalex.org/W3143248300,"While there is clear evidence that high levels of pollution are associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, the biological mechanisms that would explain this association are less understood. We examined the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants and risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated at place of residence for cohort members in the Western Australian Centre for Health and Ageing Health in Men Study. Blood samples and blood pressure measures were taken for a cohort of 4249 men aged 70 years and above between 2001 and 2004. We examined the association between 1-year average pollutant concentrations with blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and total homocysteine. Linear regression analyses were carried out, with adjustment for confounding, as well as an assessment of potential effect modification. The four pollutants examined were fine particulate matter, black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. We found that a 2.25 μg/m 3 higher exposure to fine particulate matter was associated with a 1.1 percent lower high-density cholesterol (95% confidence interval: -2.4 to 0.1) and 4.0 percent higher serum triglycerides (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 6.6). Effect modification of these associations by diabetes history was apparent. We found no evidence of an association between any of the remaining risk factors or biomarkers with measures of outdoor air pollution. These findings indicate that long-term PM 2.5 exposure is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol. This requires further investigation to determine the reasons for this association."
https://openalex.org/W3147020811,"Social media influencers play a role in the beauty industry by making it more accessible and diverse, engaging in cultural acceptance and diversity, and making their lives public through social media. Known as 'beauty gurus', these influencers use their makeup skills to work with cosmetics brands, in which they earn substantial remuneration by raising brand awareness among social media audiences. While work was conducted on social media influencers, there was no clear focus on how influencers engage with young millennials regarding the choice of cosmetics products and its use. Hence, this study analysed the beauty 'gurus' credibility in influencing young female millennials' cosmetics brands of choice. A survey method was used to collect data using a judgemental sampling from young females who have subscribed and observed makeup tutorials on social media platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook, among many others. Additionally, a total of 271 usable questionnaires were gathered and analysed using AMOS. Credibility traits, such as knowledge, attractiveness, and relatability, were the core elements of an influencer's capability to influence young millennials. Social media influencers were seen as a new and effective marketing tool in targeting a broad demographic and increasing brand awareness."
https://openalex.org/W3152117301,"The Nutrition Facts (NF) label was recently updated and now includes the added sugars content in an effort to reduce added sugars consumption. This study investigated whether consumers wanted to access or avoid the added sugars content using an online experiment and five product categories (yogurt, cereal, fruit juice, snack bar, ice cream). We recruited a sample of 490 U.S. adults (49% female; 73% White/Caucasian). Respondents were randomly assigned to an information treatment (simple or full) before making decisions on whether to access or avoid the added sugars content. The simple information treatment explained that added sugars information was now available on the NF label, while the full information treatment included additional details (e.g., how to interpret the added sugars content and associated diseases). After making the access or avoid decisions for each product category, respondents rated their likelihood of purchase for ten products (two per category). Rates of information avoidance were much lower than what has been observed in previous studies, and rates of avoidance did not vary by information treatment. The majority of respondents (75-87% across the five product categories) preferred to access the added sugars content. Still, we found some consumers preferred to avoid this information, with higher rates of avoidance for the ice cream product category. Additionally, we found significant differences in likelihood of purchase ratings between information accessors and avoiders. Respondents who chose to access the added sugars information exhibited healthier purchasing behaviors for all product categories; they were more likely to purchase low added sugars products and less likely to purchase high added sugars products relative to information avoiders. Given consumers' demonstrated interest in accessing the added sugars content, it is important that the new changes to the NF label be broadly communicated to promote healthy eating behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3152339234,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein produced primarily in the liver that plays a key role in both the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. Rapidly secreted SAA induces neutrophilia at inflammatory sites, initiating inflammation and inducing the secretion of various cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17. IL-17 is expressed in several inflammatory cells, including innate immune cells such as γδT cells, ILC3 cells, and neutrophils. Increased IL-17 levels exacerbate various inflammatory diseases. Among other roles, IL-17 induces bone loss by increasing receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) secretion, which stimulates osteoclast differentiation. Several studies have demonstrated that chronic inflammation induces bone loss, suggesting a role for SAA in bone health. To test this possibility, we observed an increase in IL-17-producing innate immune cells, neutrophils, and γδT cells in these mice. In 6-month-old animals, we detected increased osteoclast-related gene expression and IL-17 expression in bone lysates. We also observed an increase in neutrophils that secreted RANKL in the bone marrow of TG mice. Finally, we demonstrated decreased bone mineral density in these transgenic (TG) mice. Our results revealed that the TG mice have increased populations of IL-17-producing innate immune cells, γδT cells, and neutrophils in TG mice. We additionally detected increased RANKL and IL-17 expression in the bone marrow of 6-month-old TG mice. Furthermore, we confirmed significant increases in RANKL-expressing neutrophils in TG mice and decreased bone mineral density. Our results provide evidence that chronic inflammation induced by SAA1 causes bone loss via IL-17-secreting innate immune cells. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein produced primarily in the liver that plays a key role in both the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. Rapidly secreted SAA induces neutrophilia at inflammatory sites, initiating inflammation and inducing the secretion of various cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17. IL-17 is expressed in several inflammatory cells, including innate immune cells such as γδT cells, ILC3 cells, and neutrophils. Increased IL-17 levels exacerbate various inflammatory diseases. Among other roles, IL-17 induces bone loss by increasing receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) secretion, which stimulates osteoclast differentiation. Several studies have demonstrated that chronic inflammation induces bone loss, suggesting a role for SAA in bone health. To test this possibility, we observed an increase in IL-17-producing innate immune cells, neutrophils, and γδT cells in these mice. In 6-month-old animals, we detected increased osteoclast-related gene expression and IL-17 expression in bone lysates. We also observed an increase in neutrophils that secreted RANKL in the bone marrow of TG mice. Finally, we demonstrated decreased bone mineral density in these transgenic (TG) mice. Our results revealed that the TG mice have increased populations of IL-17-producing innate immune cells, γδT cells, and neutrophils in TG mice. We additionally detected increased RANKL and IL-17 expression in the bone marrow of 6-month-old TG mice. Furthermore, we confirmed significant increases in RANKL-expressing neutrophils in TG mice and decreased bone mineral density. Our results provide evidence that chronic inflammation induced by SAA1 causes bone loss via IL-17-secreting innate immune cells. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute-phase response protein produced primarily in the liver. Under acute-phase conditions, serum SAA levels can increase by up to 1000 fold. Secreted SAA also induces neutrophilia via increased granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion (1He R.L. Zhou J. Hanson C.Z. Chen J. Cheng N. Ye R.D. Serum amyloid A induces G-CSF expression and neutrophilia via Toll-like receptor 2.Blood. 2009; 113: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SAA-induced neutrophilia also initiates inflammation and increases immune responses via increased secretion of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17 (1He R.L. Zhou J. Hanson C.Z. Chen J. Cheng N. Ye R.D.

Metab. 2016; 41: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of the cytokines secreted by SAA signaling, IL-17 plays an important role in increasing inflammation by activating neutrophils and attracting inflammatory cells to sites of inflammation (10Cua D.J. Tato C.M. Innate IL-17-producing cells: The sentinels of the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Thus, increased IL-17 expression is associated with the exacerbation of inflammatory disease (11Shabgah A.G. Fattahi E. Shahneh F.Z. Interleukin-17 in human inflammatory diseases.Postepy Dermatol. Alergol. 2014; 31: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Various innate immune cells, including γδT cells, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), and neutrophils are also known to secrete IL-17 (10Cua D.J. Tato C.M. Innate IL-17-producing cells: The sentinels of the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Bone is maintained via a balance of osteoclast and osteoblast cell populations, the functions of which are to degrade old bone and generate new bone, respectively (12Chen X. Wang Z. Duan N. Zhu G. Schwarz E.M. Xie C. Osteoblast-osteoclast interactions.Connect Tissue Res. 2018; 59: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) is a signaling molecule that promotes osteoclast differentiation by binding to its receptor RANK, which is expressed in osteoclast precursors (13Srivastava R.K. Dar H.Y. Mishra P.K. Immunoporosis: Immunology of osteoporosis-role of T cells.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 657Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). IL-17 secretion increases the proportion of osteoclasts by increasing RANKL secretion from osteoblasts. Also, IL-17-producing cells, including Th17 cells and γδT cells, express RANKL themselves (14Gravallese E.M. Schett G. Effects of the IL-23-IL-17 pathway on bone in spondyloarthritis.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2018; 14: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Li J.Y. Yu M. Tyagi A.M. Vaccaro C. Hsu E. Adams J. Bellido T. Weitzmann M.N. Pacifici R.

Res. 2019; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported that neutrophils can also secrete RANKL (16Milanova V. Ivanovska N. Dimitrova P. TLR2 elicits IL-17-mediated RANKL expression, IL-17, and OPG production in neutrophils from arthritic mice.Mediators Inflamm. 2014; 2014: 643406Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Chakravarti A. Raquil M.A. Tessier P. Poubelle P.E. Surface RANKL of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated human neutrophils activates osteoclastic bone resorption.Blood. 2009; 114: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); therefore, IL-17 alters bone homeostasis in a direction that induces bone loss. Also increased IL-17-mediated bone loss has been reported in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis (18Hardy R. Cooper M.S. Bone loss in inflammatory disorders.J. Endocrinol. 2009; 201: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Uluckan O. Jimenez M. Karbach S. Jeschke A. Grana O. Keller J. Busse B. Croxford A.L. Finzel S. Koenders M. van den Berg W. Schinke T. Amling M. Waisman A. Schett G. et al.Chronic skin inflammation leads to bone loss by IL-17-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 330ra337Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine whether increased SAA induced bone loss via increased IL-17 signaling, using SAA1-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. We observed an increase in IL-17-producing innate immune cells, neutrophils, and γδT cells in these mice. In 6-month-old animals, we detected increased osteoclast-related gene expression and IL-17 expression in bone lysates. We also observed an increase in neutrophils that secreted RANKL in the bone marrow of TG mice. Finally, we demonstrated decreased bone mineral density in these TG mice. Therefore, we concluded that SAA induced bone loss upon chronic inflammation via IL-17-production in innate immune cells. The SAA1 TG mouse model may have additional value as a disease model for IL-17-mediated bone loss. In a previous study, we observed that SAA1 increased IL-17 expression via the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in γδT cells (20Choi M. Kim M.O. Lee J. Jeong J. Sung Y. Park S. Kwon W. Jang S. Park S.J. Kim H.S. Jang W.Y. Kim S.H. Lee S. Choi S.K. Ryoo Z.Y. Hepatic serum amyloid A1 upregulates interleukin-17 (IL-17) in gammadelta T cells through Toll-like receptor 2 and is associated with psoriatic symptoms in transgenic mice.Scand. J. Immunol. 2019; 89e12764Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine whether IL-17 was secreted by other immune cells, in addition to γδT cells in TG mice. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed the population of IL-17+γδTCR+ cells (IL-17-producing γδT cells, Fig. 1A), IL-17+CD4+ cells (IL-17-producing Th17 cells, Fig. 1B), and lineage−CD45+CD90.2+IL-17A+ cells (IL-17-producing ILC3, Fig. 1C) in lymph nodes. As observed, IL17+ γδTCR+ cells were significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice. However, the proportion of Th17 and ILC3 cells did not differ significantly between these mice. Therefore, we confirmed that SAA1 overexpression in mice led to an increased γδT cell population, but not Th17 or ILC3 cells. It was previously reported that SAA increased neutrophilia by increasing G-CSF (1He R.L. Zhou J. Hanson C.Z. Chen J. Cheng N. Ye R.D. Serum amyloid A induces G-CSF expression and neutrophilia via Toll-like receptor 2.Blood. 2009; 113: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Neutrophils themselves can express IL-17 (10Cua D.J. Tato C.M. Innate IL-17-producing cells: The sentinels of the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). To confirm this in our TG mice, we measured G-CSF expression by western blot of serum proteins. We observed increased G-CSF expression in TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A). We next measured neutrophil population via flow cytometry. We confirmed the presence of a circulating CD11b+ Ly6G+ population (neutrophils) in blood, and this was significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 2B). In addition, neutrophils in TG mice were found to secrete IL-17 (Fig. 2C). Consequently, SAA1 TG mice were confirmed as secreting IL-17 from neutrophils and γδT cells. As other studies have reported bone loss mediated by chronic inflammation (18Hardy R. Cooper M.S. Bone loss in inflammatory disorders.J. Endocrinol. 2009; 201: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Uluckan O. Jimenez M. Karbach S. Jeschke A. Grana O. Keller J. Busse B. Croxford A.L. Finzel S. Koenders M. van den Berg W. Schinke T. Amling M. Waisman A. Schett G. et al.Chronic skin inflammation leads to bone loss by IL-17-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 330ra337Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether bone loss occurred as a result of chronic inflammation induced by SAA1 and IL-17. First, we measured increased SAA1 expression in the serum of 6-month-old mice by western blot. We confirmed increased SAA1 secretion in 6-month-old TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3A). We investigated the expression of the following genes: those related to osteoclast activity; Ctsk, Tnfsf11, Nfatc1, and Acp5 (21Zhao Q. Shao J. Chen W. Li Y.P. Osteoclast differentiation and gene regulation.Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), osteoblast/osteocyte activity; Tnfrsf11b, Alpl, Bglap, and Runx2 (22Kirkham G.R.,C.S.H. Genes and proteins involved in the regulation of osteogenesis.Top Tissue Engineering. 2007; 3: 1-22Google Scholar), and Wnt signaling related genes required for proper osteoblast function (23Baron R. Kneissel M. WNT signaling in bone homeostasis and disease: From human mutations to treatments.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y. Li Y.P. Paulson C. Shao J.Z. Zhang X. Wu M. Chen W. Wnt and the Wnt signaling pathway in bone development and disease.Front. Biosci. (Landmark Ed.). 2014; 19: 379-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); Axin1 Ctnnb1, and Ccn4. No significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression of osteoclast and osteoblast-related markers in whole bone lysates from 7-week-old mice (data not shown). However, when we examined 6-month-old TG mice to confirm the effects of chronic inflammation on bone from increased SAA1 and IL-17, we observed that the osteoclast-related genes, Tnfsf11 and Ctsk were significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 3B). We observed no significant differences in osteoblast-associated gene levels between TG and WT mice; however, for Axin1 and Ctnnb1 genes associated with Wnt signaling, and Tnfrsf11b associated with osteoblast activity, these levels tended to decrease in TG mice (Fig. 3, C and D). We measured the expression levels of Il-17a and Il-23a mRNA in bone lysates and confirmed a 367-fold and 11-fold increase, respectively, in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 3E). Therefore, we concluded that chronic inflammation in 6-month-old TG mice induced an increase in osteoclast-related gene expression in relation to IL-17. A recent report suggested that osteocytes could also express RANKL (i.e., Tnfsf11) when stimulated by IL-17 (15Li J.Y. Yu M. Tyagi A.M. Vaccaro C. Hsu E. Adams J. Bellido T. Weitzmann M.N. Pacifici R. IL-17 receptor signaling in osteoblasts/osteocytes mediates PTH-induced bone loss and enhances osteocytic RANKL production.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2019; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate RANKL expression in osteocytes, we separated bone and bone marrow. As a result, bone that located osteocyte expressed Tnfsf11 mRNA in both WT and TG mice, and there was no significant difference (Fig. 4A). For bone marrow, Tnfsf11 mRNA expression was not detected by qPCR in WT mice. However, in TG mice we detected Tnfsf11 expression (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we confirmed that increased Tnfsf11 expression in TG mice was expressed by bone marrow cells. We sought to determine whether RANKL protein levels were also increased in TG mice and which bone marrow cells expressed these levels. Firstly, we measured RANKL expression in bone marrow using flow cytometry. Our results indicated that RANKL expression was significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 5A). RANKL is known to be expressed by osteoblasts derived from the mesenchymal stem cell lineage (CD45− cells) and inflammatory cells derived from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lineage (CD45+ cells). Therefore, we investigated CD45+RANKL+ cell and CD45−RANKL+ cell populations to identify the major RANKL-secreting cells between these lineage cells. In TG mice, we observed that RANKL expression increased in CD45+ cells, but not in CD45− cells. Therefore, we concluded that increased RANKL expression levels in TG mice were secreted from CD45+ inflammatory cells of the HSC lineage, rather than from osteoblasts. Furthermore, we observed that CD45− cells were significantly reduced in TG mice (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that RANKL expression was increased in inflammatory cells from SAA1 TG mice. IL-17-expressing cells themselves are known to be capable of expressing RANKL. Therefore, we ascertained whether IL-17-expressing innate immune cells were increased in TG mice. Bone marrow neutrophil and γδT cell populations were determined by flow cytometry. From these data, we observed that γδT cell and neutrophil populations were significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 6). Therefore, we examined RANKL expression in γδT cells and neutrophils in the bone marrow of TG mice using flow cytometry. We confirmed that γδT cells did not express RANKL (Fig. 7A). However, in neutrophils, RANKL expression was significantly increased in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 7B), indicating that IL-17-expressing neutrophils secreted RANKL and contributed to osteoclast differentiation in SAA1 TG mice.Figure 7Increased RANKL-expressing neutrophils in bone marrow from SAA1 TG mice.

Bone mineral density was measured using micro-computed tomography (μCT) in 6-month-old TG mice. We confirmed that bone mineral density, bone volume/total volume, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and cortical thickness were all significantly decreased in TG mice (Fig. 8A). Histological analysis was also performed using TRAP staining in mouse tibia sections; we detected increased TRAP-positive staining in TG mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 8B). Thus, we confirmed that bone mineral density decreases were correlated with increased osteoclasts in TG mice. It was reported that SAA signaling promotes increased IL-17 expression (4Sano T. Huang W.

Lee J. Jeong J. Sung Y. Park S. Kwon W. Jang S. Park S.J. Kim H.S. Jang W.Y. Kim S.H. Lee S. Choi S.K. Ryoo Z.Y.

Pathophysiology of psoriasis: Recent advances on IL-23 and Th17 cytokines.Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2007; 9: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that SAA stimulated γδT cells and neutrophils to secrete IL-17. Long-lasting inflammation in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, is related to bone loss (18Hardy R. Cooper M.S. Bone loss in inflammatory disorders.J. Endocrinol. 2009; 201: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Uluckan O. Jimenez M. Karbach S. Jeschke A. Grana O. Keller J. Busse B. Croxford A.L. Finzel S.

Med. 2016; 8: 330ra337Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether bone loss occurred in SAA1 TG mice, via chronic inflammation with IL-17. We observed that 6-month-old TG mice had decreased bone mineral density and increased RANKL expression, when compared with WT littermate controls. We also observed RANKL-producing neutrophils in these SAA1 TG mice, suggesting that chronic IL-17-secreting neutrophils contributed to decreasing bone mineral density via RANKL signaling in SAA1 TG mice. SAA induces neutrophilia by promoting G-CSF secretion (1He R.L. Zhou J. Hanson C.Z. Chen J. Cheng N. Ye R.D. Serum amyloid A induces G-CSF expression and neutrophilia via Toll-like receptor 2.Blood. 2009; 113: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Anthony D. Seow H.J. Uddin M. Thompson M.

Care Med. 2013; 188: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). IL-17 accelerates neutrophil infiltration at inflammation sites to both initiate and maintain inflammatory responses (10Cua D.J. Tato C.M. Innate IL-17-producing cells: The sentinels of the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that interactions between SAA and IL-17 result in neutrophilia in SAA1 TG mice. Despite their short life span, activated neutrophils can produce considerable protein and lipid levels, which participate in inflammatory responses (26Chen M. Lam B.K. Kanaoka Y. Nigrovic P.A. Audoly L.P. Austen K.F. Lee D.M. Neutrophil-derived leukotriene B4 is required for inflammatory arthritis.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Edwards S.W. Hallett M.B. Seeing the wood for the trees: The forgotten role of neutrophils in rheumatoid arthritis.Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Similarly, neutrophils also produce RANKL (16Milanova V. Ivanovska N. Dimitrova P. TLR2 elicits IL-17-mediated RANKL expression, IL-17, and OPG production in neutrophils from arthritic mice.Mediators Inflamm. 2014; 2014: 643406Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Chakravarti A. Raquil M.A. Tessier P. Poubelle P.E. Surface RANKL of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated human neutrophils activates osteoclastic bone resorption.Blood. 2009; 114: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is known that RANKL+ neutrophils interact directly with osteoclasts (17Chakravarti A. Raquil M.A. Tessier P. Poubelle P.E. Surface RANKL of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated human neutrophils activates osteoclastic bone resorption.Blood. 2009; 114: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, it was confirmed in vivo that RANKL+ neutrophils contributed to osteoclastogenesis (28Kim A.R. Kim J.H. Choi Y.H. Jeon Y.E. Cha J.H. Bak E.J. Yoo Y.J. The presence of neutrophils causes RANKL expression in periodontal tissue, giving rise to osteoclast formation.J. Periodontal Res. 2020; 55: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study, we were unable to demonstrate the direct effects of neutrophils on bone formation. However, data from previous studies have allowed us to speculate on the effects of RANKL+ neutrophils on bone homeostasis (17Chakravarti A. Raquil M.A. Tessier P. Poubelle P.E. Surface RANKL of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated human neutrophils activates osteoclastic bone resorption.Blood. 2009; 114: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Kim A.R. Kim J.H. Choi Y.H. Jeon Y.E. Cha J.H. Bak E.J. Yoo Y.J. The presence of neutrophils causes RANKL expression in periodontal tissue, giving rise to osteoclast formation.J. Periodontal Res. 2020; 55: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observations that increased numbers of neutrophils, as well as increased IL-17 and RANKL expression levels on surface membranes, suggested that neutrophils played a major role in bone loss in our TG mice. However, the precise role of IL-17 signaling in osteoclasts and osteoblasts is controversial. IL-17 was recently shown to reduce Wnt signaling when associated with osteoblast function; this decreased activity resulted from a relative increase in osteoclast function (19Uluckan O. Jimenez M. Karbach S. Jeschke A. Grana O. Keller J. Busse B. Croxford A.L. Finzel S. Koenders M. van den Berg W. Schinke T. Amling M. Waisman A. Schett G. et al.Chronic skin inflammation leads to bone loss by IL-17-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 330ra337Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that Tnfrsf11b mRNA expression, which is related to osteoblast function (22Kirkham G.R.,C.S.H. Genes and proteins involved in the regulation of osteogenesis.Top Tissue Engineering. 2007; 3: 1-22Google Scholar), and Axin1 and Ctnnb1, which are related to Wnt signaling (23Baron R. Kneissel M.

In addition, CD45− populations were significantly decreased in TG mice, suggesting that IL-17 may have decreased osteoblast populations via Wnt signaling, leading to a relative increase in osteoclast levels. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the effects of IL-17 on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In contrast with our data, several studies showed that SAA suppresses osteoclast differentiation (29Kim J. Yang J. Park O.J. Kang S.S. Yun C.H. Han S.H.

The inhibitory effects of SAA in osteoclastogenesis were discovered in vitro; however, our experimental data were collected in vivo. Also, several studies have shown that IL-17 induces osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, we speculate that the direct effects of SAA on osteoclastogenesis are weaker than any indirect effects of SAA interactions with IL-17 on osteoclast differentiation. In this study, we revealed that SAA induced bone loss via an increase in IL-17-producing innate immune cells. These data suggested that IL-17-mediated inflammatory responses and bone loss may decrease when SAA levels are reduced. Therefore, SAA appears to be a valuable therapeutic target for some diseases characterized by inflammatory responses and bone loss. In addition, we also demonstrated the value of SAA1-overexpressing TG mice as a potential disease model for bone loss caused by chronic IL-17 inflammation. SAA1 TG mice were previously generated in a C57BL/6 background (31Ji Y.R. Kim H.J. Bae K.B. Lee S. Kim M.O. Ryoo Z.Y.

Mice were raised and maintained under conventional conditions. They were given ad libitum access to food and water and housed under 12 h light/dark conditions. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation and with permission from the Animal Use and Care Committee of Kyungpook National University. To separate bone marrow from bone, the femur at both ends was severed with sterile scissors. Bone marrow was rinsed using a 23-gage needle and a 10 cc syringe filled with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Bone tissue was harvested and ground using a MagNA Lyser (Roche Diagnostics). A TaKaRa Mini-BEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa) was used to isolate RNA according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed at 60 °C for 1 h using a PrimeScript first strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara). Gapdh was used as an internal control for quantification.

Goat anti-mouse SAA1 antibody (Abcam) diluted at a ratio of 1:1000, Goat anti-G-CSF primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at a ratio of 1:2000 were used, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL Detection System (GE Healthcare). Intact tibia were dissected from mice, and muscle and soft tissues were removed. The bone was fixed in 10% formalin for 24–48 h and stored in 70% ethanol. A micro-CT scan was conducted using a Quantum GX2 micro-CT Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using the following parameters: 90 kV, 88 μA, and with a voxel size of 50 μm. Tibia tissues were decalcified in 0.25 M EDTA (pH 7.5) and 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 4 weeks. The solution was refreshed every week. Paraffin-embedded tibia were sectioned and stained using a TRAP staining kit (Takara) according to manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by methyl green counterstaining.

https://openalex.org/W3146657744,"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are well-established vectors for delivering therapeutic genes. However, previous reports have suggested that wild-type AAV is linked to hepatocellular carcinoma, raising concern with the safety of rAAVs. In addition, a recent long-term follow-up study in canines, which received rAAVs for factor VIII gene therapy, demonstrated vector integration into the genome of liver cells, reviving the uncertainty between AAV and cancer. To further explore this relationship, we performed large-scale molecular epidemiology of AAV in resected tumor samples and non-lesion tissues collected from 413 patients, reflecting nine carcinoma types: breast carcinoma, rectal cancer, pancreas carcinoma, brain tumor, hepatoid adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, lung squamous, and adenocarcinoma. We found that over 80% of patients were AAV-positive among all nine types of carcinoma examined. Importantly, the AAV sequences detected in patient-matched tumor and adjacent non-lesion tissues showed no significant difference in incidence, abundance, and variation. In addition, no specific AAV sequences predominated in tumor samples. Our data shows that AAV genomes are equally abundant in tumors and adjacent normal tissues, but lack clonality. The finding critically adds to the epidemiological profile of AAV in humans, and provides insights that may assist rAAV-based clinical studies and gene therapy strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3140170363,"Goal 17 of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) attracted attention to the importance of partnerships between governments, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations (NPOs) for sustainable development. This paper aims to analyze the processes of establishing and operating the partnerships between NPOs and other actors in terms of governance. The best practices for partnership governance were examined according to the partnering life cycle framework. A simple random sample of 184 NPOs in six regions of Saudi Arabia was selected for data collection. These organizations were analyzed according to their governance practices in 937 partnerships established during 2016–2018. The findings showed that the organizations had strongly implemented the phases of building and scoping and managing and maintaining, while their governance practices regarding phases of reviewing and revising and sustaining outcomes ranged between moderate and low levels. The results also revealed significant differences between the overall implementation of the partnering life cycle practices and the NPO’s year of establishment. It was concluded that analyzing the current situation of implementing the best practices of partnership governance is useful to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of partnerships between NPOs and other actors, as well as the existing policy gaps, so as to create and implement sustainable-oriented partnerships."
https://openalex.org/W3145065109,"Underweight and overweight constitute unhealthy bodyweight and their coexistence is symptomatic of the dual burden of malnutrition (DBM) of high public health concern in many sub-Saharan Africa countries. Little is known about DBM and its correlates in Malawi, a country undergoing urbanisation. The study examined net effects of urban residence on unhealthy weights amidst individual- and community-level factors among women in Malawi.Data on 7231 women aged 15-49 years nested within 850 communities extracted from 2015-16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey were analysed. Women's weight status measured by body mass index, operationally categorised as underweight, normal and overweight, was the outcome variable while urban-rural residence was the main explanatory variable. Multilevel multinomial logistic regression analysis was employed at 5% significant level; the relative-risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented.Urban residents had a significantly higher prevalence of overweight than rural (36.4% vs. 17.2%; p< 0.001) but a -non-significant lower prevalence of underweight (6.2% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.423). Having adjusted for both individual- and community-level covariates, compared to rural, living in urban (aRR = 1.25; CI: 1.02-1.53) accounted for about 25% higher risk of being overweight relative to normal weight. Higher education attainment, being married and belonging to Chewa, Lomwe or Mang'anja ethnic group significantly reduced the risk of being underweight but heightened the risk of being overweight. Being older and living in wealthier households respectively accounted for about 3- and 2-times higher likelihood of being overweight, while breastfeeding (aRR = 0.65; CI: 0.55-0.76) was protective against overweight. Living in communities with higher poverty and higher education levels reduced and increased the risk of being overweight, respectively. Evidence of community's variability in unhealthy weights was observed in that 11.1% and 3.0% respectively of the variance in the likelihood of being overweight and underweight occurred across communities.The study demonstrated association between urban residence and women overweight. Other important associated factors of overweight included breastfeeding, community education- and poverty-level, while education attainment, marital status and ethnicity were associated with the dual unhealthy weight. Thus, both individual- and community-level characteristics are important considerations for policy makers in designing interventions to address DBM in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W3148759003,"The expression and function of some xenobiotic transporters vary according to the time of the day, causing the dosing time-dependent changes in drug disposition and toxicity. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is highly expressed in the kidneys and functions in the renal elimination of various drugs. The elimination of several P-gp substrates was demonstrated to vary depending on administration time, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We found that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) was involved in the circadian regulation of P-gp expression in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). After synchronization of the cellular circadian clock by dexamethasone treatment, the expression of P-gp exhibited a significant 24-h oscillation in RPTECs, but this oscillation was disrupted by the downregulation of ADAR1. Although ADAR1 catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in double-stranded RNA substrates, no significant ADAR1-regulated editing sites were detected in the human ABCB1 transcripts in RPTECs. On the other hand, downregulation of ADAR1 induced alternative splicing in intron 27 of the human ABCB1 gene, resulting in the production of retained intron transcripts. The aberrant spliced transcript was sensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, leading to the decreased stability of ABCB1 mRNA and prevention of the 24-h oscillation of P-gp expression. These findings support the notion that ADAR1-mediated regulation of alternative splicing of the ABCB1 gene is a key mechanism of circadian expression of P-gp in RPTECs, and the regulatory mechanism may underlie the dosing time-dependent variations in the renal elimination of P-gp substrates."
https://openalex.org/W3141170351,"Faculty development programs (FD) prepare the faculty for their educational role and career tasks. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of FDP in advancing the quality of short-answer questions (SAQs). This was a quasi-experimental study, comprising 37 new faculty. The SAQs were examined on psychometric analysis and Bloom's cognitive levels for the two educational blocks of 1st medical year (i.e. Musculoskeletal (MSK) and Renal blocks). We found substantial improvement in the discrimination index values of SAQs prepared after the workshop (p = 0.04). A higher number of SAQs with moderate difficulty and higher discrimination were also observed. Flaws within the post-workshop questions were reduced (3.0%) when compared with pre-workshop (12.5%). The major incline was also reported within Bloom's cognitive levels when pre-workshop K2 questions (30%) were compared with post-workshop (45.5%) with a p-value = 0.05. The SAQs constructed by the faculty member without participating in FDP are generally of unsatisfactory quality. After the FDP the assessment items of two blocks improved for various parameters of student assessment. The current study advocates that newly joined faculty shall be provided with the FDP to be guided, trained and supported for improving the quality of assessment through SAQs items writing."
https://openalex.org/W3146341357,"Lung cancer (LC) generally lacks unique core symptoms or signs. However, there are a multitude of bodily sensations that are often non-specific, not easily understood, and many times initially not recognized as indicative of LC by the affected person, which often leads to late diagnosis. In this international qualitative study, we inductively analyzed retrospective accounts of 61 people diagnosed with LC in Denmark, England and Sweden. Using the bodily sensations they most commonly spoke about (tiredness, breathlessness, pain, and cough), we constructed four sensation-based cases to understand the pre-diagnostic processes of reasoning and practice triggered by these key indicators of LC. We thereafter critically applied Hay's model of sensations to symptoms transformation, examining its central concepts of duration, disability and vulnerability, to support understanding of these processes. We found that while duration and disability are clearly relevant, vulnerability is more implicitly expressed in relation to perceived threat. Tiredness, even when of long duration and causing disability, was often related to normal aging, rather than a health threat. Regardless of duration, breathlessness was disturbing and threatening enough to lead to care-seeking. Pain varied by location, duration and degree of disability, and thus also varied in degree of threat perceived. Preconceived, but unmet expectations of what LC-related cough and pain would entail could cause delays by misleading participants; if cough lasted long enough, it could trigger health care contact. Duration, disability, and sense of threat, rather than vulnerability, were found to be relevant concepts for understanding the trajectory to diagnosis for LC among these participants. The process by which an individual, their family and health care providers legitimize sensations, allowing them to be seen as potential symptoms of disease, is also an essential, but varying part of the diagnostic processes described here."
https://openalex.org/W3146540207,"Barbell hip thrust exercises have risen in popularity within the biomechanics and strength and conditioning literature over recent years, as a method of developing the hip extensor musculature. Biomechanical analysis of the hip thrust beyond electromyography is yet to be conducted. The aim of this study was therefore to perform the first comprehensive biomechanical analysis the barbell hip thrust. Nineteen resistance trained males performed three repetitions of the barbell hip thrust at 70% one-repetition maximum. Kinematic (250 Hz) and kinetic (1000 Hz) data were used to calculate angle, angular velocity, moment and power data at the ankle, knee, hip and pelvic-trunk joint during the lifting phase. Results highlighted that the hip thrust elicits significantly (p < 0.05) greater bilateral extensor demand at the hip joint in comparison with the knee and pelvic-trunk joints, whilst ankle joint kinetics were found to be negligible. Against contemporary belief, hip extensor moments were not found to be consistent throughout the repetition and instead diminished throughout the lifting phase. The current study provides unique insight to joint kinematics and kinetics of the barbell hip thrust, based on a novel approach, that offers a robust evidence base for practitioners to guide exercise selection."
https://openalex.org/W3148313831,"The chemical composition of otoliths (earbones) can provide valuable information about stock structure and connectivity patterns among marine fish. For that, chemical signatures must be sufficiently distinct to allow accurate classification of an unknown fish to their area of origin. Here we have examined the suitability of otolith microchemistry as a tool to better understand the spatial dynamics of skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), a highly valuable commercial species for which uncertainties remain regarding its stock structure in the Indian Ocean. For this aim, we have compared the early life otolith chemical composition of young-of-the-year (&lt;6 months) skipjack tuna captured from the three main nursery areas of the equatorial Indian Ocean (West, Central and East). Elemental (Li:Ca, Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Mg:Ca and Mn:Ca) and stable isotopic (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) signatures were used, from individuals captured in 2018 and 2019. Otolith Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Mg:Ca and δ 18 O significantly differed among fish from different nurseries, but, in general, the chemical signatures of the three nursery areas largely overlapped. Multivariate analyses of otolith chemical signatures revealed low geographic separation among Central and Eastern nurseries, achieving a maximum overall random forest cross validated classification success of 51%. Cohort effect on otolith trace element signatures was also detected, indicating that variations in chemical signatures associated with seasonal changes in oceanographic conditions must be well understood, particularly for species with several reproductive peaks throughout the year. Otolith microchemistry in conjunction with other techniques (e.g., genetics, particle tracking) should be further investigated to resolve skipjack stock structure, which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable management of this stock in the Indian Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W3151157718,"Using Twitter to implement public health awareness campaigns is on the rise, but campaign monitoring and evaluation are largely dependent on basic Twitter Analytics. To establish the potential of social network theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background. While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a ""bridging"" role between the public and the scientific community. Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go beyond traditional metrics."

The intrinsically disordered protein dehydrin is an important member of this repertoire of proteins, characterized by a canonical amphipathic K-segment. It can also contain other stress-mitigating noncanonical segments—a likely reflection of the extremely diverse nature of abiotic stress encountered by plants. Among plants, the poikilohydric mosses have no inbuilt mechanism to prevent desiccation and therefore are likely to contain unique noncanonical stress-responsive motifs in their dehydrins. Here we report the recurring occurrence of a novel amphipathic helix-forming segment (D-segment: EGφφD(R/K)AKDAφ, where φ represents a hydrophobic residue) in Physcomitrella patens dehydrin (PpDHNA), a poikilohydric moss.

PpDHNA activity was shown to be size as well as D-segment dependent from in vitro, in vivo, and in planta studies using PpDHNA and various deletion mutants.

Plants have developed multiple adaptive mechanisms to survive against various abiotic stresses. These include anatomical changes, production of osmolytes, and overproduction of stress-combating proteins. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a group of highly hydrophilic glycine-rich proteins that accumulate late during embryogenesis and also function under stress conditions (1Soulages J.L. Kim K. Arrese E.L. Walters C. Cushman J.C. Conformation of a group 2 late embryogenesis abundant protein from soybean. Evidence of poly (L-proline)-type II structure.Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Among the members of LEA proteins, dehydrins (DHNs) constitute a group of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) involved in combating stress conditions (2Hanin M. Brini F. Ebel C. Toda Y. Takeda S. Masmoudi K. Plant dehydrins and stress tolerance: Versatile proteins for complex mechanisms.Plant Signal. Behav. 2011; 6: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A conserved feature of all DHNs, sequenced till date, is the presence of a C-terminal K-segment, containing a lysine-rich 15-residue sequence stretch (EKKGIM(E/D)KIKEKLPG). Some DHNs also contain one or more Y-segments [(V/T)D(E/Q)YGNP]. In addition, DHNs may also contain a serine-rich S-segment [LHRSGS4-10(E/D3)] and/or a less conserved Φ-segment (3Close T.J. Dehydrins: A commonalty in the response of plants to dehydration and low temperature.Physiol. Plantarum. 1997; 100: 291-296Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the number and arrangement of the Y-, S-, and K-segments, DHNs are classified into different subclasses: YnSKn, YnKn, SKn, Kn, and KnS (4Close T.J. Dehydrins: Emergence of a biochemical role of a family of plant dehydration proteins.Physiol. Plantarum. 1996; 97: 795-803Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, a new amino acid stretch, called the F-segment (DRGLFDFLGKK), was identified in SKn-type DHNs across all seed plants (5Strimbeck G.R. Hiding in plain sight: the F segment and other conserved features of seed plant SKn dehydrins.Planta. 2017; 245: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DHN is unstructured in aqueous environment, forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules in addition to intramolecular hydrogen bonds (6Graether S.P. Boddington K.F. Disorder and function: A review of the dehydrin protein family.Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5: 576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A decrease in the hydration status of DHN leads to conformational changes. The formation of amphipathic α-helices, owing to the presence of K-segments in DHN molecules, is well known (7Tompa P. Intrinsically unstructured proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 8Koag M.C. Fenton R.D. Wilkens S. Close T.J.

The K-segment of maize DHN1 mediates binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles and concomitant structural changes.Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1503-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These changes have been found to occur maximally in the presence of phospholipid membranes. A recent study demonstrated that the conserved K-segment, present in Arabidopsis thaliana DHN Lti30 (a K6 DHN), which binds to the phospholipid membrane, is driven by electrostatics, where the disordered K-segments locally fold into α-helices on the membrane surface (10Eriksson S. Eremina N. Barth A. Danielsson J. Harryson P. Membrane-induced folding of the plant stress dehydrin Lti30.Plant Physiol. 2016; 171: 932-943PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gupta A. Marzinek J.K. Jefferies D.

Chem. 2019; 294: 6468-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). During abiotic stress conditions, when other cellular globular proteins tend to denature and aggregate, DHN, being an IDP, does not aggregate. Instead, it prevents other proteins from aggregation through macromolecular shielding (6Graether S.P. Boddington K.F. Disorder and function: A review of the dehydrin protein family.Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5: 576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Mouillon J.M. Gustafsson P. Harryson P. Structural investigation of disordered stress proteins. Comparison of full-length dehydrins with isolated peptides of their conserved segments.Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The amphipathic α-helical conformation of the K-segment is an important factor influencing the stress-protective activity of DHN. This is reflected in the fact that DHN partially loses its cryoprotective nature upon mutations in the hydrophobic amino acids of K-segments (13Hara M. Endo T. Kamiya K. Kameyama A. The role of hydrophobic amino acids of K-segments in the cryoprotection of lactate dehydrogenase by dehydrins.J. Plant Physiol. 2017; 210: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A study on wheat DHNs (WZY2 and DHN5) highlighted the crucial role of the canonical K-segments in stress tolerance in Escherichia coli cells (14Yang W. Zhang L. Lv H. Li H. Zhang Y. Xu Y. Yu J. The K-segments of wheat dehydrin WZY2 are essential for its protective functions under temperature stress.Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 6: 406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Drira M. Saibi W.

Biotech. 2015; 175: 3310-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis DHNs (ERD10 and ERD14) are also known to exhibit protection against thermal aggregation in vitro (16Kovacs D. Kalmar E. Torok Z. Tompa P. Chaperone activity of ERD10 and ERD14, two disordered stress-related plant proteins.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Elaborating on the details of the functional mechanism under heat stress, it was concluded that the protection was mainly achieved through protection of the cellular proteome owing to the chaperonic activity of ERD14 via multimer formation (17Murvai N. Kalmar L. Szalaine Agoston B. Szabo B. Tantos A. Csikos G. Micsonai A. Kardos J. Vertommen D. Nguyen P.N. Hristozova N. Lang A. Kovacs D. Buday L.

The chaperone-like property of DHNs against abiotic stress is thought to arise owing to multimeric bundle formation, mediated by the stress-induced amphipathic α-helices formed by the K-segments (18Cuevas-Velazquez C.L. Saab-Rincón G. Reyes J.L. Covarrubias A.A. The unstructured N-terminal region of Arabidopsis group 4 late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins is required for folding and for chaperone-like activity under water deficit.J. Biol.

The bundle, in turn, might interact with other proteins and phospholipid membrane surfaces under low hydration status (9Koag M.C. Wilkens S. Fenton R.D. Resnik J. Vo E. Close T.J.

Structure and function of a mitochondrial late embryogenesis abundant protein are revealed by desiccation.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The shielding effect, therefore, helps DHN to prevent denaturation of other cellular proteins, caused primarily due to the loss of water layer that envelopes folded proteins (2Hanin M. Brini F. Ebel C. Toda Y. Takeda S. Masmoudi K. Plant dehydrins and stress tolerance: Versatile proteins for complex mechanisms.Plant Signal. Behav. 2011; 6: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Multimeric DHNs with large hydrodynamic radii form molecular shields between neighboring protein molecules, thus preventing collisions between them. Size and degree of disorder are the two important factors that determine the stress-protective ability of DHNs (23Hughes S.L. Schart V. Malcolmson J. Hogarth K.A. Martynowicz D.M. Tralman-Baker E. Patel S.N. Graether S.P. The importance of size and disorder in the cryoprotective effects of dehydrins.Plant Physiol. 2013; 163: 1376-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Of interest, homodimeric and heterodimeric interactions have been shown to occur in studies performed on transformed plants overexpressing DHNs (24Hernández-Sánchez I.E. Maruri-López I. Graether S.P. Jiménez-Bremont J.F. In vivo evidence for homo-and heterodimeric interactions of Arabidopsis thaliana dehydrins AtCOR47, AtERD10, and AtRAB18.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transgenic plants have been extensively used to study the abiotic stress tolerance property of DHNs. Till date, numerous reports have shown that DHNs protect plants from desiccation, cold, salinity, and oxidative damage (2Hanin M. Brini F. Ebel C. Toda Y. Takeda S. Masmoudi K. Plant dehydrins and stress tolerance: Versatile proteins for complex mechanisms.Plant Signal. Behav. 2011; 6: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Halder T. Upadhyaya G. Basak C. Das A. Chakraborty C. Ray S. Dehydrins impart protection against oxidative stress in transgenic tobacco plants.Front. Plant Sci. 2018; 9: 136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recently, tolerance against high-temperature stress has been reported in transformed tobacco plants overexpressing Sorghum bicolor DHN1 protein (26Halder T. Upadhyaya G. Ray S. YSK2 type Dehydrin (SbDhn1) from Sorghum bicolor showed improved protection under high temperature and osmotic stress condition.Front. Plant Sci. 2017; 8: 918Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A recent study on the spliced variant of Vitis vinifera DHN1a reported that the K-segment stretch might play an important role in drought resistance (27Rosales R. Romero I. Escribano M.I. Merodio C. Sanchez-Ballesta M.T. The crucial role of Φ-and K-segments in the in vitro functionality of Vitis vinifera dehydrin DHN1a.Phytochemistry. 2014; 108: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in planta studies of the protective role of the amphipathic α-helices of DHN under abiotic stress conditions are scanty, although such studies might provide a detailed insight into the molecular mechanism of action of DHNs in plants. Physcomitrella patens, a member of the moss family, is a model organism and an excellent system to study many important aspects of plant biology. Specifically, its ability to tolerate desiccation stress has attracted scientific attention across the globe (28Rensing S.A. Goffinet B. Meyberg R. Wu S.Z. Bezanilla M. The moss Physcomitrium (Physcomitrella) patens: A model organism for non-seed plants.Plant Cell. 2020; 32: 1361-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The single-cell-layer thick organism is known to survive in almost 90% to 95% of water loss conditions (29Wang X.Q. Yang P.F. Liu Z. Liu W.Z. Hu Y. Chen H. Kuang T.Y. Pei Z.M. Shen S.H. He Y.K. Exploring the mechanism of Physcomitrella patens desiccation tolerance through a proteomic strategy.Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This typical poikilohydric nature of P. patens, along with the associated resurrection mechanism, has established it as a model organism for studying the underlying mechanisms of abiotic stress adaptation. The major DHN from P. patens (PpDHNA) has already been demonstrated as a key stress-responsive protein, for its abiotic stress (osmotic and salt) tolerance ability (30Saavedra L. Svensson J. Carballo V. Izmendi D. Welin B. Vidal S.

Plant Sci. 2017; 8: 1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DHNA-targeted knockout in P. patens further established its contribution to cellular protection under osmotic stress (31Ruibal C. Salamó I.P. Carballo V. Castro A. Bentancor M. Borsani O. Szabados L. Vidal S. Differential contribution of individual dehydrin genes from Physcomitrella patens to salt and osmotic stress tolerance.Plant Sci. 2012; 190: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we had reported that the Y11K-type DHN (PpDHNA) was able to protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and could rescue tobacco plants overexpressing PpDHNA from drought stress (33Agarwal T. Upadhyaya G. Halder T. Mukherjee A. Majumder A.L. Ray S. Different dehydrins perform separate functions in Physcomitrella patens.Planta. 2017; 245: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Of interest, earlier studies showed that PpDHNA renders an unusually high degree of stress protection. This compelled us to look carefully at the sequence of PpDHNA to identify the presence of any PpDHNA-specific sequence motif and, if present, establish their functional roles, if any. Here we report the presence of an amphipathic α-helix forming segment in PpDHNA that we term as the D-segment. The D-segment, with the sequence motif EGφφD(R/K)AKDAφ, where φ represents a hydrophobic residue, along with Y- and K-segments were analyzed for their role in rendering protection under high-temperature and desiccation stress. A number of deletion mutants of PpDHNA were generated and assayed for their protection ability under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. We show that the D-segments play a significant role for the observed abiotic stress mitigation by PpDHNA. We further demonstrated the presence of the D-segment in a stress-responsive protein in another poikilohydric plant Syntrichia ruralis. Finally, D-segment-mediated unique resurrection and stress abatement strategies employed by plant dehydrins are discussed. As shown in Figure 1, PpDHNA is a Y11K type of DHN with 11 Y-segments (shown in yellow) and 1 K-segment (shown in blue). Since the K- and the Y-segments are already known to form putative α-helical structures under suitable environment, it is expected that a protein disorder analysis along the sequence will indicate structural order at these points, despite PpDHNA being an IDP. Indeed, an analysis of structural disorder, using the DISOPRED3 server, showed sudden dips in disorder at sequence positions corresponding to the 11 Y-segments (Fig. 1A). Analysis of disorder using another server (Glob plot 2) confirmed this observation (Fig. S1). The latter method uses the slope of the cumulative disorder propensity to predict disordered (positive slope) as well as putative folded domains (negative slope). Although a canonical Y-segment typically extends over a stretch of six amino acid residues, interestingly, our analyses predicted a much longer stretch to be “ordered” at the 11 positions where putative Y-segments were identified. On closer inspection, a recurring stretch of amino acids, termed as the D-segment, was found to appear a few residues after the appearance of every Y-segment. The D-segment was associated with the sequence motif EGφφD(R/K)AKDAφ, where φ represents a hydrophobic residue (Fig. 1B). A LOGO representation of the D-segments is shown in Figure 1C. The Y-, D-, and K-segments along with their amino acid position in the PpDHNA protein sequence are shown in Tables S1 and S2. To investigate the reason behind the predicted order of the D-segments, all D-segments were analyzed for their propensity to form amphipathic α-helix using the program HeliQuest. All D-segments were found to form identical distribution patterns of amphipathic α-helical segments (Fig. 1D), where polar residues (E, D) occur on one side and nonpolar residues (I, V, L, F, M) occur on the other side. A similar analysis of the K-segment showed optimum amphipathic α-helical arrangement by a stretch of 11 amino acid residues (15 amino acid residues reported elsewhere). The calculated hydrophobicities and hydrophobic moments of the D-segments are enlisted in Table S2. We generated a series of deletion mutants (Y11D11, Y6D6, Y1K, K, and Y1) based on bioinformatics analysis to determine the role of different segments present in the PpDHNA protein as shown in Table S3 and schematically represented in Figure 1E. In addition, another mutant Y6DM6 was generated where the number of amino acids was the same as the Y6D6 deletion mutant. However, the amino acid sequences in the D-segments were shuffled in the Y6DM6 mutant, keeping the amino acid composition similar to Y6D6 (Fig. 1F). The shuffling of the amino acid sequence was done to disrupt the amphipathic α-helix associated with each D-segment (Fig. 1G). Loss of hydrophobic moment and hydrophobicity upon shuffling of the D-segments are shown in Table S4. The amplified PCR products of approximately 111 bp for Y1, 486 bp for K, 594 bp for Y1K, 666 bp for Y6D6, and 1263 bp for Y11D11 (shown in Fig. S2) were cloned and bacterially expressed for their corresponding proteins. The deletion mutants (Y11D11, Y6D6, Y6DM6, Y1K, K, and Y1) generated proteins of different sizes 50, 29, 29, 26, 43, and 30 kDa, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3, A–D. The deletion mutants (Y11D11, Y6D6, Y6DM6, and Y1K) were His-tag fused, whereas the K and Y1 were GST tagged. This accounts for the increase in size of K and Y1 against their original sizes of 17 and 4 kDa, respectively. Purified proteins with GST tags (Y1 and K) were immunoblotted with the corresponding anti-GST antibody, whereas, the His-tagged proteins (Y11D11, Y6D6, Y6DM6, and Y1K) were immunoblotted with the corresponding anti-HIS antibody as shown in Fig. S3E. The PpDHNA protein was prepared as reported previously (33Agarwal T. Upadhyaya G. Halder T. Mukherjee A. Majumder A.L. Ray S. Different dehydrins perform separate functions in Physcomitrella patens.Planta. 2017; 245: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopic analysis was carried out to probe the secondary structure of the proteins. The purified proteins (PpDHNA and deletion mutants Y11D11, Y6D6, Y6DM6, Y1K, K, and Y1) were analyzed by CD. As shown in Figure 2, A–G, all protein variants (the uppermost black curve in each panel) were found to be disordered in an aqueous buffer. We analyzed the protein in presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), a well-known helix-inducing solvent that is thought to mimic the membrane environment (18Cuevas-Velazquez C.L. Saab-Rincón G. Reyes J.L. Covarrubias A.A. The unstructured N-terminal region of Arabidopsis group 4 late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins is required for folding and for chaperone-like activity under water deficit.J.

Mimicking the plant cell interior under water stress by macromolecular crowding: Disordered dehydrin proteins are highly resistant to structural collapse.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The CD spectra for all proteins in the presence of TFE (10%–50%) were also recorded, as shown in Figure 2, A–G. Except for Y1, in all cases, the CD spectra showed a gradual transition from disordered to α-helical conformation (characterized by double minima: one at ∼222 nm associated with the nπ∗ transition and another at ∼208 nm associated with the ππ∗|| transition). Despite the similarity in TFE-induced changes, helix induction for Y6DM6 was found to be distinctly different from the rest, especially when the ratio between the two minima (R = intensity of ππ∗||/intensity of nπ∗) was considered. The ratio R reflects the degree of helix formation (∼1 for 100% helix, > 1 otherwise) (35Manning M.C. Woody R.W. Theoretical CD studies of polypeptide helices: Examination of important electronic and geometric factors.Biopolyn.: Original Res. Biomol. 1991; 31: 569-586Google Scholar). The CD spectra of all proteins (at 50% TFE) are compared in Figure 2J, where the 222-nm ellipticities (nπ∗ transition) are normalized so that the relative intensities of the lower wavelength π-π∗|| transition reflect the value of R. Clearly, the π-π∗|| transition for Y6DM6 is more intense than for others. Also, as shown in the inset of Figure 2J, Y6DM6 stands out from the others, both in terms of the peak ratio R and the position of the π-π∗|| peak (∼208 nm for 100% helicity and <208 otherwise). The loss of TFE-induced helix induction upon shuffling of the D-segment indicates the inherent ability of the D-segment to adopt a helical conformation under a suitable environment. To further confirm this, CD spectra for both the isolated D-segment (D1) and the corresponding shuffled version (DM1) were recorded as a function of added TFE (Fig. 2, H and I). Both peptides were found to be disordered in the absence of TFE. Although TFE induced helicity in both, 50% TFE induced less helicity in DM1 compared with D1 (Fig. 2J). Unlike CD spectroscopy, which reports the overall conformation of a polypeptide chain, NMR can provide residue-wise conformational bias in a peptide. Specifically, the chemical shifts δ (for both 1Hα and 13Cα) of amino acid residues can indicate such biases. A residue is considered to be biased toward α-helix if {δHα(obs) - δHα(random coil)} < 0 and {δCα(obs) - δCα(random coil)} > 0. We have performed NMR experiments on both D1 and DM1 and have obtained the chemical shift values of Hα and Cα of all residues. The differences between the observed and the random coil chemical shifts (36Wishart D.S. Case D.A. Use of chemical shifts in macromolecular structure determination.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 338: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y. Jardetzky O.

Random coil chemical shift for intrinsically disordered proteins: Effects of temperature and pH.J. Biomol. NMR. 2011; 49: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) were plotted along the sequence for both the peptides. As shown in Figure 2, K and L, chemical shift differences (negative for 1Hα and positive for 13Cα) indicated that the central part of D1 (DKVKN) is associated with a clear bias to form incipient α-helix in aqueous buffer. The shuffled helix DM1 also showed a slight tendency to form incipient α-helix in the aqueous buffer but consistently significantly less than D1 (throughout the sequence). In other words, NMR experiments confirmed the differential helix forming abilities of D1 and DM1 in the absence of TFE. Upon high-temperature treatment at 54 °C for 10 min, LDH lost most of its activity, retaining only about 5% of its initial activity (100%). However, the presence of a minimal concentration of ∼1250 nM of PpDHNA (1:4 molar ratio of LDH:additive protein) could restore its original activity. In comparison, a 1:4 molar ratio of all other deletion mutants (Y11D11, Y6D6, Y6DM6, Y1K, K, and Y1) showed a variable degree of protection (as shown in Fig. 3A). The protective activity of the additive proteins showed a positive correlation with the number of D-segments (amphipathic α-helix) and also the size of the proteins. The protective activity increased as the molar ratios of the additive proteins were increased (Fig. 3B). The relative activity of LDH, when incubated with PpDHNA, showed maximum protective activity (∼100%) compared with Y11D11 (77%) and Y6D6 (48%). This difference in the level of protection reflects the importance of the number of D-segments as well as the size of the protein for protection. Of interest, Y11D11 showed protection similar to a known protectant bovine serum albumin (BSA) (80%). The proteins with K-segment (Y1K and K) could retain about 25% to 30% of LDH activity (Fig. 3A) under stress. Of note, upon increasing the molar concentration (1:20), the maximum protection provided by Y1K and K was about 75% (Fig. 3B). However, Y6DM6, with disrupted amphipathic α-helices, could only restore 13% of LDH activity (Fig. 3A). Even on increasing the molar ratio to 1:22, the maximum restoration was 50% only (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the effect of Y6DM6 remained as an outlier when compared with other deletion mutants, in terms of the PD50 value (shown in Fig. 3C). The distribution of PD50 values of PpDHNA and its mutant proteins correlates well with their capacity of amphipathic α-helix formation as well as the size of the proteins. Finally, Y1 provides the least amount of protection, reaching a maximum of 36% at 1:40 molar ratio. Therefore, no PD50 value could be assigned to it (Fig. 3B). Our experiments are in close agreement with the previous reports showing that the K-segment (amphipathic α-helix), as well as the size of the protein, has a definite role i"

Eyes with conspicuous morphology can enhance gaze perception while eyes with camouflaged morphology may hinder gaze perception. While evidence suggests that conspicuous eye morphology enhances gaze perception, little is known about how environmental conditions affect this interaction. Thus, we investigated whether environmental light conditions affect gaze perception. Human subjects (Homo sapiens) were instructed to find direct-gaze faces within arrays of averted-gaze faces or to find averted-gaze faces within arrays of directed-gaze faces. The faces were displayed under conditions simulating nighttime or daytime conditions. Furthermore, the faces had naturally-colored sclera (white) or modified sclera (same color as the iris). Participants were fastest and most accurate in detecting faces during the daytime and nighttime conditions when the sclera were naturally-colored. Participants were worst at detecting faces with modified sclera during the nighttime conditions. These results suggest that eyes with conspicuous morphology enhance gaze perception during both daytime and nighttime conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3139551220,"One of the central challenges for cancer therapy is the identification of factors in the tumor microenvironment that increase tumor progression and prevent immune surveillance. One such element associated with breast cancer is stromal fibrosis, a histopathologic criterion for invasive cancer and poor survival. Fibrosis is caused by inflammatory factors and remodeling of the extracellular matrix that elicit an immune tolerant microenvironment. To address the role of fibrosis in tumorigenesis, we developed NeuT/ATTAC transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active NeuT/erbB2 transgene, and an inducible, fat-directed caspase-8 fusion protein, which upon activation results in selective and partial ablation of mammary fat and its replacement with fibrotic tissue. Induction of fibrosis in NeuT/ATTAC mice led to more rapid tumor development and an inflammatory and fibrotic stromal environment. In an effort to explore therapeutic options that could reduce fibrosis and immune tolerance, mice were treated with the oxysterol liver X receptor (LXR) pan agonist, N,N-dimethyl-3-β-hydroxy-cholenamide (DMHCA), an agent known to reduce fibrosis in non-malignant diseases. DMHCA reduced tumor progression, tumor multiplicity and fibrosis, and improved immune surveillance by reducing infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increasing CD4 and CD8 effector T cells. These effects were associated with downregulation of an LXR-dependent gene network related to reduced breast cancer survival that included Spp1, S100a9, Anxa1, Mfge8 and Cd14. These findings suggest that the use of DMHCA may be a potentially effective approach to reduce desmoplasia and immune tolerance and increase the efficacy of cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3141214099,"Here, we studied the expression pattern and putative function of four, previously identified serine protease inhibitors (serpins) of Myxobolus cerebralis, a pathogenic myxozoan species (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) causing whirling disease of salmonid fishes. The relative expression profiles of serpins were determined at different developmental stages both in fish and in annelid hosts using serpin-specific qPCR assays. The expression of serpin Mc-S1 was similar throughout the life cycle, whereas a significant decrease was detected in the relative expression of Mc-S3 and Mc-S5 during the development in fish, and then in the sporogonic stage in the worm host. A decreasing tendency could also be observed in the expression of Mc-S4 in fish, which was, however, upregulated in the worm host. For the first time, we predicted the function of M. cerebralis serpins by the use of several bioinformatics-based applications. Mc-S1 is putatively a chymotrypsin-like inhibitor that locates extracellularly and is capable of heparin binding. The other three serpins are caspase-like inhibitors, and they are probably involved in protease and cell degradation processes during the early stage of fish invasion."

https://openalex.org/W3143969365,"Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. The local anti-tumour immune response is particularly important for patients with stage II where the tumour-draining lymph nodes have not yet succumbed to tumour spread. The lymph nodes allow for the expansion and release of B cell compartments such as primary follicles and germinal centres. A variation in this anti-tumour immune response may influence the observed clinical heterogeneity in stage II patients.The aim of this study was to explore tumour-draining lymph node histomorphological changes and tumour pathological risk factors including the immunomodulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in a small cohort of stage II CRC.A total of 23 stage II colorectal cancer patients were included. Tumour and normal mucosa samples were analysed for miR-21 expression levels and B-cell compartments were quantified from Haematoxylin and Eosin slides of lymph nodes. These measures were compared to clinicopathological risk factors such as perforation, bowel obstruction, T4 stage and high-grade.We observed greater Follicle density in patients with a lower tumour T stage and higher germinal centre density in patients with higher pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Trends were also detected between tumours with deficiency in mismatch repair proteins, lymphatic invasion and both the density and size of B-cell compartments. Lastly, elevated tumour miR-21 was associated with decreased Follicle and germinal centre size.Variation in B-cell compartments of tumour-draining lymph nodes is associated with clinicopathological risk factors in stage II CRC patients."

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of adolescent fatherhood in Ethiopia based on the nationally representative survey.This study used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total weighted sample of 4455 adolescent men was included for the final analysis. For the associated factors, multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to consider the hierarchical nature of the EDHS data. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and deviance (-2LLR) were used for model comparison and for assessing model fitness. The model with the largest adjusted R2, lowest Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and the smallest cross-validation prediction error were considered as the best-fitted model. In the multivariable analysis, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported to declare the presence of statistically significant factors associated with adolescent fatherhood, and variables with p-value <0.05 were considered as a significant variable.The prevalence of adolescent fatherhood in Ethiopia was 6.79% [95%CI; 6.08%, 7.56%]. Adolescent men with contraceptive knowledge [AOR = 4.25; 95%CI = 1.23, 14.69], age in 20 to 24 years [AOR = 7.93; 95%CI = 3.66, 17.27] and being Muslim [AOR = 1.84; 95%CI = 1.02, 3.39] were significantly associated with Higher odds of adolescent fatherhood. Individuals who initiate sex lately [AOR = 0.35; 95%CI = 0.22, 0.54], being in female-headed family [AOR = 0.46; 95%CI; 0.26, 0.82] and being from Amhara region [AOR = 0.35; 95%CI = 0.14, 0.84] were significantly associated with lower odds of adolescent fatherhood.In this study, adolescent fatherhood was a common public health problem in Ethiopia as it is closely linked with poor quality of life and premature death (year of potential life lost). Age of respondent, knowledge of respondent about contraceptive methods, early initiation of sex, religion, sex of household head, and region were significantly associated with adolescent fatherhood. Therefore, program planners and decision-makers should give special attention to adolescent men through enhancing reproductive health services utilization and their knowledge towards it to decrease the incidence of adolescent fatherhood."

The endoscopic placement of stents is now a mainstay of its treatment, and bilateral stenting is effective for biliary decompression. This study aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of bilateral metal stent placement using large cell-type stents and the clinical predictors of stent dysfunction in patients with malignant hilar obstruction.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bilateral metal stent placement using two large cell-type stents at two academic teaching hospitals between September 2017 and February 2019. The primary outcome was stent dysfunction. Secondary outcomes included predictors related to stent dysfunction and overall survival.The study included 87 patients who underwent bilateral metal stent placement for malignant hilar obstruction. Technical success and clinical success were achieved in 80 patients (92.0%) and 83 patients (95.4%), respectively. During the follow-up period (median: 201, range: 18-671 days), stent dysfunction occurred in 42 patients (48.3%), and the median stent patency was 199 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 181-262). In univariate analysis, age, cholangitis before stent insertion, and subsequent chemotherapy were found to be associated with the cumulative risk of stent dysfunction. In multivariate analysis, cholangitis before stent insertion (hazards ratio [HR]: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.216-4.209, P = 0.010) and subsequent chemotherapy (HR: 0.250, 95% CI: 0.130-0.482, P<0.001) remained as statically significant factors associated with the cumulative risk of stent dysfunction. The median overall survival was 288 days (95% CI: 230-327).The bilateral placement of large cell-type stents for malignant hilar obstruction was effective with high technical and clinical success rates and acceptable patency. Cholangitis before stent insertion was associated with shorter patency, and subsequent chemotherapy was associated with longer stent patency."

From the ISP to the browser itself, many security systems act to defend the user from such content. However, most systems have at least one of three major limitations: 1) they are not personalized and do not account for the differences between users, 2) their defense mechanism is reactive and unable to predict upcoming attacks, and 3) they extensively track and use the user's activity, thereby invading her privacy in the process. We developed a methodological framework to predict future exposure to malicious content. Our framework accounts for three factors-the user's previous exposure history, her co-similarity to other users based on their previous exposures in a conceptual network, and how the network evolves. Utilizing over 20,000 users' browsing data, our approach succeeds in achieving accurate results on the infection-prone portion of the population, surpassing common methods, and doing so with as little as 1/1000 of the personal information it requires."
https://openalex.org/W3139714012,"In this paper, we use network approaches to analyze the relations between protein sequence features for the top hierarchical classes of CATH and SCOP. We use fundamental connectivity measures such as correlation (CR), normalized mutual information rate (nMIR), and transfer entropy (TE) to analyze the pairwise-relationships between the protein sequence features, and use centrality measures to analyze weighted networks constructed from the relationship matrices. In the centrality analysis, we find both commonalities and differences between the different protein 3D structural classes. Results show that all top hierarchical classes of CATH and SCOP present strong non-deterministic interactions for the composition and arrangement features of Cystine (C), Methionine (M), Tryptophan (W), and also for the arrangement features of Histidine (H). The different protein 3D structural classes present different preferences in terms of their centrality distributions and significant features."
https://openalex.org/W3141160503,"Tracheal suctioning is an important procedure to maintain airway patency by removing secretions. Today, suctioning operators include not only medical staff, but also family caregivers. The use of a simulation system has been noted to be the most effective way to learn the tracheal suctioning technique for operators. While the size of the trachea varies across different age groups, the artificial trachea model in the simulation system has only one fixed model. Thus, this study aimed to construct multiple removable trachea models according to different age groups. We enrolled 20 patients who had previously received proton beam therapy in our institution and acquired the treatment planning computed tomography (CT) image data. To construct the artificial trachea model for three age groups (children, adolescents and young adults, and adults), we analyzed the three-dimensional coordinates of the entire trachea, tracheal carina, and the end of the main bronchus. We also analyzed the diameter of the trachea and main bronchus. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the model by analyzing the difference between the constructed model and actual measurements. The trachea model was 8 cm long for children and 12 cm for adolescents and young adults, and for adults. The angle between the trachea and bed was about 20 degrees, regardless of age. The mean model accuracy was less than 0.4 cm. We constructed detachable artificial trachea models for three age groups for implementation in the endotracheal suctioning training environment simulator (ESTE-SIM) based on the treatment planning CT image. Our constructed artificial trachea models will be able to provide a simulation environment for various age groups in the ESTE-SIM."

https://openalex.org/W3145231036,"In a digital early literacy intervention RCT, children born late preterm fell behind peers when in a control condition, but outperformed them when assigned to the intervention. Results did however not replicate previous findings. Replication is often complicated by resource quality. Gold Standard measures are generally time-intensive and costly, while they closely align with, and are more sensitive to changes in, early literacy and language performance. A planned missing data approach, leaving these gold standard measures incomplete, might aid in addressing the origin(s) of non-replication.Participants after consent were 695 p Dutch primary school pupils of normal and late preterm birth. The high-quality measures, in additional to simpler but complete measures, were intentionally administered to a random subsample of children. Five definitions of gold standard alignment were evaluated.Two out of five gold standard levels improved precision compared to the original results. The lowest gold standard level did not lead to improvement: precision was actually diminished. In two gold standard definitions, an alphabetical factor and a writing-only factor the model estimates were comparable to the original results. Only the most precise definition of the gold standard level replicated the original results.Gold standard measures could only be used to improve model efficiency in RCT-designs under sufficiently high convergent validity."
https://openalex.org/W3151925306,"Area efficient and high speed forward error correcting codes decoder are the demand of many high speed next generation communication standards. This paper explores a low complexity decoding algorithm of low density parity check codes, called the min-sum iterative construction a posteriori probability (MS-IC-APP), for this purpose. We performed the error performance analysis of MS-IC-APP for a (648,1296) regular QC-LDPC code and proposed an area and throughput optimized hardware implementation of MS-IC-APP. We proposed to use the layered scheduling of MS-IC-APP and performed other optimizations at architecture level to reduce the area and to increase the throughput of the decoder. Synthesis results show 6.95 times less area and 4 times high throughput as compared to the standard min-sum decoder. The area and throughput are also comparable to the improved variants of hard-decision bit-flipping (BF) decoders, whereas, the simulation results show a coding gain of 2.5 over the best implementation of BF decoder in terms of error performance."
https://openalex.org/W3152217280,"Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a specialty widening in its scope. An objective analysis of the referral pattern can provide essential information to improve healthcare. This four-year retrospective study was implemented in Khartoum Teaching Dental Hospital. Data (age, sex, diagnosis, and type of treatment) were collected from patient records. Disease frequency, as well as the effect of sex and age, were analyzed for each group. The frequency of treatment types was also assessed. Data were collected from a total of 3,478 patients over the four-year study period. There was a male predominance with the third decade of life being the most common age group. Pathological diseases were the most common (37%) reason for referral, followed by trauma (31%). Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and dentoalveolar extraction were the least frequently observed. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most commonly performed procedure (28%). These data represent the epidemiology of oral and maxillofacial diseases in Sudan. Given that the third decade of life is the most represented age group, it is beneficial to learn the long-term consequences of these diseases in these young patients and to use modern surgical techniques to improve their lives."
