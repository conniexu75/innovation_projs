https://openalex.org/W2990249310,"The NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has been carried out over ten years and two phases to provide resources, methods, and discoveries that link interactions between humans and their microbiomes to health-related outcomes. The recently completed second phase, the Integrative Human Microbiome Project, comprised studies of dynamic changes in the microbiome and host under three conditions: pregnancy and preterm birth; inflammatory bowel diseases; and stressors that affect individuals with prediabetes. The associated research begins to elucidate mechanisms of host-microbiome interactions under these conditions, provides unique data resources (at the HMP Data Coordination Center), and represents a paradigm for future multi-omic studies of the human microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2947989913,"Cell-free DNA in the blood provides a non-invasive diagnostic avenue for patients with cancer1. However, characteristics of the origins and molecular features of cell-free DNA are poorly understood. Here we developed an approach to evaluate fragmentation patterns of cell-free DNA across the genome, and found that profiles of healthy individuals reflected nucleosomal patterns of white blood cells, whereas patients with cancer had altered fragmentation profiles. We used this method to analyse the fragmentation profiles of 236 patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric or bile duct cancer and 245 healthy individuals. A machine learning model that incorporated genome-wide fragmentation features had sensitivities of detection ranging from 57% to more than 99% among the seven cancer types at 98% specificity, with an overall area under the curve value of 0.94. Fragmentation profiles could be used to identify the tissue of origin of the cancers to a limited number of sites in 75% of cases. Combining our approach with mutation-based cell-free DNA analyses detected 91% of patients with cancer. The results of these analyses highlight important properties of cell-free DNA and provide a proof-of-principle approach for the screening, early detection and monitoring of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2947640277,"The incidence of preterm birth exceeds 10% worldwide. There are significant disparities in the frequency of preterm birth among populations within countries, and women of African ancestry disproportionately bear the burden of risk in the United States. In the present study, we report a community resource that includes 'omics' data from approximately 12,000 samples as part of the integrative Human Microbiome Project. Longitudinal analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and cytokine profiles from 45 preterm and 90 term birth controls identified harbingers of preterm birth in this cohort of women predominantly of African ancestry. Women who delivered preterm exhibited significantly lower vaginal levels of Lactobacillus crispatus and higher levels of BVAB1, Sneathia amnii, TM7-H1, a group of Prevotella species and nine additional taxa. The first representative genomes of BVAB1 and TM7-H1 are described. Preterm-birth-associated taxa were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in vaginal fluid. These findings highlight new opportunities for assessment of the risk of preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W2944564829,"The identification of lymphocyte subsets with non-overlapping effector functions has been pivotal to the development of targeted therapies in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs)1,2. However, it remains unclear whether fibroblast subclasses with non-overlapping functions also exist and are responsible for the wide variety of tissue-driven processes observed in IMIDs, such as inflammation and damage3-5. Here we identify and describe the biology of distinct subsets of fibroblasts responsible for mediating either inflammation or tissue damage in arthritis. We show that deletion of fibroblast activation protein-α (FAPα)+ fibroblasts suppressed both inflammation and bone erosions in mouse models of resolving and persistent arthritis. Single-cell transcriptional analysis identified two distinct fibroblast subsets within the FAPα+ population: FAPα+THY1+ immune effector fibroblasts located in the synovial sub-lining, and FAPα+THY1- destructive fibroblasts restricted to the synovial lining layer. When adoptively transferred into the joint, FAPα+THY1- fibroblasts selectively mediate bone and cartilage damage with little effect on inflammation, whereas transfer of FAPα+ THY1+ fibroblasts resulted in a more severe and persistent inflammatory arthritis, with minimal effect on bone and cartilage. Our findings describing anatomically discrete, functionally distinct fibroblast subsets with non-overlapping functions have important implications for cell-based therapies aimed at modulating inflammation and tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2948018512,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a growing health problem, but little is known about its early disease stages, its effects on biological processes or the transition to clinical T2D. To understand the earliest stages of T2D better, we obtained samples from 106 healthy individuals and individuals with prediabetes over approximately four years and performed deep profiling of transcriptomes, metabolomes, cytokines, and proteomes, as well as changes in the microbiome. This rich longitudinal data set revealed many insights: first, healthy profiles are distinct among individuals while displaying diverse patterns of intra- and/or inter-personal variability. Second, extensive host and microbial changes occur during respiratory viral infections and immunization, and immunization triggers potentially protective responses that are distinct from responses to respiratory viral infections. Moreover, during respiratory viral infections, insulin-resistant participants respond differently than insulin-sensitive participants. Third, global co-association analyses among the thousands of profiled molecules reveal specific host-microbe interactions that differ between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals. Last, we identified early personal molecular signatures in one individual that preceded the onset of T2D, including the inflammation markers interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) paired with xenobiotic-induced immune signalling. Our study reveals insights into pathways and responses that differ between glucose-dysregulated and healthy individuals during health and disease and provides an open-access data resource to enable further research into healthy, prediabetic and T2D states."
https://openalex.org/W2947312223,"There is increased appreciation that dopamine neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward1 and reward-predicting cues1,2, but also to other variables such as the distance to reward3, movements4–9 and behavioural choices10,11. An important question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of dopamine neurons. Whether individual dopamine neurons multiplex several variables, or whether there are subsets of neurons that are specialized in encoding specific behavioural variables remains unclear. This fundamental question has been difficult to resolve because recordings from large populations of individual dopamine neurons have not been performed in a behavioural task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. Here, to address this gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record the activity of more than 300 dopamine neurons from the ventral tegmental area of the mouse midbrain during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual-reality environment, dopamine neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioural variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, with neighbouring neurons more likely to be part of the same cluster. Together with the topography between dopamine neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by dopamine neurons. Two-photon calcium imaging of a large population of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area of mice performing a virtual-reality navigation task reveals the organization principles of the dopamine system."

Although substantial effort has been applied to identifying HSC maintenance factors through the characterization of the in vivo bone-marrow HSC microenvironment or niche3–5, stable ex vivo HSC expansion has previously been unattainable6,7. Here we describe the development of a defined, albumin-free culture system that supports the long-term ex vivo expansion of functional mouse HSCs. We used a systematic optimization approach, and found that high levels of thrombopoietin synergize with low levels of stem-cell factor and fibronectin to sustain HSC self-renewal. Serum albumin has long been recognized as a major source of biological contaminants in HSC cultures8; we identify polyvinyl alcohol as a functionally superior replacement for serum albumin that is compatible with good manufacturing practice. These conditions afford between 236- and 899-fold expansions of functional HSCs over 1 month, although analysis of clonally derived cultures suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the self-renewal capacity of HSCs ex vivo. Using this system, HSC cultures that are derived from only 50 cells robustly engraft in recipient mice without the normal requirement for toxic pre-conditioning (for example, radiation), which may be relevant for HSC transplantation in humans. These findings therefore have important implications for both basic HSC research and clinical haematology. An albumin-free culture system for the long-term ex vivo expansion of mouse haematopoietic stem cells produces 236- to 899-fold expansion, and generates cultures that robustly engraft in recipient mice without toxic pre-conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2946892453,"Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci in prokaryotes are composed of 30-40-base-pair repeats separated by equally short sequences of plasmid and bacteriophage origin known as spacers1-3. These loci are transcribed and processed into short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are used as guides by CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to recognize and destroy complementary sequences (known as protospacers) in foreign nucleic acids4,5. In contrast to most Cas nucleases, which destroy invader DNA4-7, the type VI effector nuclease Cas13 uses RNA guides to locate complementary transcripts and catalyse both sequence-specific cis- and non-specific trans-RNA cleavage8. Although it has been hypothesized that Cas13 naturally defends against RNA phages8, type VI spacer sequences have exclusively been found to match the genomes of double-stranded DNA phages9,10, suggesting that Cas13 can provide immunity against these invaders. However, whether and how Cas13 uses its cis- and/or trans-RNA cleavage activities to defend against double-stranded DNA phages is not understood. Here we show that trans-cleavage of transcripts halts the growth of the host cell and is sufficient to abort the infectious cycle. This depletes the phage population and provides herd immunity to uninfected bacteria. Phages that harbour target mutations, which easily evade DNA-targeting CRISPR systems11-13, are also neutralized when Cas13 is activated by wild-type phages. Thus, by acting on the host rather than directly targeting the virus, type VI CRISPR systems not only provide robust defence against DNA phages but also prevent outbreaks of CRISPR-resistant phage."
https://openalex.org/W2890508662,"We measure the correlation spectrum of the Hawking radiation emitted by an analogue black hole and find it to be thermal at the Hawking temperature implied by the analogue surface gravity. The Hawking radiation is in the regime of linear dispersion, in analogy with a real black hole. Furthermore, the radiation inside of the black hole is seen to be composed of negative-energy partners only. This work confirms the prediction of Hawking's theory regarding the value of the Hawking temperature, as well as the thermality of the spectrum. The thermality of Hawking radiation is the root of the information paradox. The correlations between the Hawking and partner particles imply that the analogue black hole has no analogue firewall."
https://openalex.org/W2947787281,"The microbiome of the female reproductive tract has implications for women's reproductive health. We examined the vaginal microbiome in two cohorts of women who experienced normal term births: a cross-sectionally sampled cohort of 613 pregnant and 1,969 non-pregnant women, focusing on 300 pregnant and 300 non-pregnant women of African, Hispanic or European ancestry case-matched for race, gestational age and household income; and a longitudinally sampled cohort of 90 pregnant women of African or non-African ancestry. In these women, the vaginal microbiome shifted during pregnancy toward Lactobacillus-dominated profiles at the expense of taxa often associated with vaginal dysbiosis. The shifts occurred early in pregnancy, followed predictable patterns, were associated with simplification of the metabolic capacity of the microbiome and were significant only in women of African or Hispanic ancestry. Both genomic and environmental factors are likely contributors to these trends, with socioeconomic status as a likely environmental influence."
https://openalex.org/W2947143566,"Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies protect against infection with HIV-1 in animal models, suggesting that a vaccine that elicits these antibodies would be protective in humans. However, it has not yet been possible to induce adequate serological responses by vaccination. Here, to activate B cells that express precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies within polyclonal repertoires, we developed an immunogen, RC1, that facilitates the recognition of the variable loop 3 (V3)-glycan patch on the envelope protein of HIV-1. RC1 conceals non-conserved immunodominant regions by the addition of glycans and/or multimerization on virus-like particles. Immunization of mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques with RC1 elicited serological responses that targeted the V3-glycan patch. Antibody cloning and cryo-electron microscopy structures of antibody-envelope complexes confirmed that immunization with RC1 expands clones of B cells that carry the anti-V3-glycan patch antibodies, which resemble precursors of human broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, RC1 may be a suitable priming immunogen for sequential vaccination strategies in the context of polyclonal repertoires."
https://openalex.org/W2947914011,"Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses that are prevalent in the human population and are responsible for diverse pathologies, including cold sores, birth defects and cancers. They are characterized by a highly pressurized pseudo-icosahedral capsid-with triangulation number (T) equal to 16-encapsidating a tightly packed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome1-3. A key process in the herpesvirus life cycle involves the recruitment of an ATP-driven terminase to a unique portal vertex to recognize, package and cleave concatemeric dsDNA, ultimately giving rise to a pressurized, genome-containing virion4,5. Although this process has been studied in dsDNA phages6-9-with which herpesviruses bear some similarities-a lack of high-resolution in situ structures of genome-packaging machinery has prevented the elucidation of how these multi-step reactions, which require close coordination among multiple actors, occur in an integrated environment. To better define the structural basis of genome packaging and organization in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), we developed sequential localized classification and symmetry relaxation methods to process cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of HSV-1 virions, which enabled us to decouple and reconstruct hetero-symmetric and asymmetric elements within the pseudo-icosahedral capsid. Here we present in situ structures of the unique portal vertex, genomic termini and ordered dsDNA coils in the capsid spooled around a disordered dsDNA core. We identify tentacle-like helices and a globular complex capping the portal vertex that is not observed in phages, indicative of herpesvirus-specific adaptations in the DNA-packaging process. Finally, our atomic models of portal vertex elements reveal how the fivefold-related capsid accommodates symmetry mismatch imparted by the dodecameric portal-a longstanding mystery in icosahedral viruses-and inform possible DNA-sequence recognition and headful-sensing pathways involved in genome packaging. This work showcases how to resolve symmetry-mismatched elements in a large eukaryotic virus and provides insights into the mechanisms of herpesvirus genome packaging."

https://openalex.org/W2947550142,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by fibrillar neuronal inclusions composed of aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn). These inclusions are associated with behavioral and pathological PD phenotypes. One strategy for therapeutic interventions is to prevent the formation of these inclusions to halt disease progression. α-Synuclein exists in multiple structural forms, including disordered, nonamyloid oligomers, ordered amyloid oligomers, and fibrils. It is critical to understand which conformers contribute to specific PD phenotypes. Here, we utilized a mouse model to explore the pathological effects of stable β-amyloid–sheet oligomers compared with those of fibrillar α-synuclein. We biophysically characterized these species with transmission EM, atomic-force microscopy, CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and thioflavin T assays. We then injected these different α-synuclein forms into the mouse striatum to determine their ability to induce PD-related phenotypes. We found that β-sheet oligomers produce a small but significant loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Injection of small β-sheet fibril fragments, however, produced the most robust phenotypes, including reduction of striatal dopamine terminals, SNc loss of dopamine neurons, and motor-behavior defects. We conclude that although the β-sheet oligomers cause some toxicity, the potent effects of the short fibrillar fragments can be attributed to their ability to recruit monomeric α-synuclein and spread in vivo and hence contribute to the development of PD-like phenotypes. These results suggest that strategies to reduce the formation and propagation of β-sheet fibrillar species could be an important route for therapeutic intervention in PD and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2947182341,"How the genomic features of a patient’s cancer relate to individual disease kinetics remains poorly understood. Here we used the indolent growth dynamics of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to analyse the growth rates and corresponding genomic patterns of leukaemia cells from 107 patients with CLL, spanning decades-long disease courses. We found that CLL commonly demonstrates not only exponential expansion but also logistic growth, which is sigmoidal and reaches a certain steady-state level. Each growth pattern was associated with marked differences in genetic composition, the pace of disease progression and the extent of clonal evolution. In a subset of patients, whose serial samples underwent next-generation sequencing, we found that dynamic changes in the disease course of CLL were shaped by the genetic events that were already present in the early slow-growing stages. Finally, by analysing the growth rates of subclones compared with their parental clones, we quantified the growth advantage conferred by putative CLL drivers in vivo. Analysis of growth dynamics in a dataset from 107 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) reveals both exponential and logistic patterns of growth, which are associated with differences in genetic attributes and clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2947339497,"Access to DNA packaged in nucleosomes is critical for gene regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) complex detects UV-light-induced pyrimidine dimers throughout the genome; however, it remains unknown how these lesions are recognized in chromatin, in which nucleosomes restrict access to DNA. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of UV-DDB bound to nucleosomes bearing a 6–4 pyrimidine–pyrimidone dimer or a DNA-damage mimic in various positions. We find that UV-DDB binds UV-damaged nucleosomes at lesions located in the solvent-facing minor groove without affecting the overall nucleosome architecture. In the case of buried lesions that face the histone core, UV-DDB changes the predominant translational register of the nucleosome and selectively binds the lesion in an accessible, exposed position. Our findings explain how UV-DDB detects occluded lesions in strongly positioned nucleosomes, and identify slide-assisted site exposure as a mechanism by which high-affinity DNA-binding proteins can access otherwise occluded sites in nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that the DNA-repair factor UV-DDB exposes inaccessible nucleosome lesions for binding by inducing a translational shift in the nucleosome position."
https://openalex.org/W2947988065,"Characterizing the genome of mature virions is pivotal to understanding the highly dynamic processes of virus assembly and infection. Owing to the different cellular fates of DNA and RNA, the life cycles of double-stranded (ds)DNA and dsRNA viruses are dissimilar. In terms of nucleic acid packing, dsDNA viruses, which lack genome segmentation and intra-capsid transcriptional machinery, predominantly display single-spooled genome organizations1-8. Because the release of dsRNA into the cytoplasm triggers host defence mechanisms9, dsRNA viruses retain their genomes within a core particle that contains the enzymes required for RNA replication and transcription10-12. The genomes of dsRNA viruses vary greatly in the degree of segmentation. In members of the Reoviridae family, genomes consist of 10-12 segments and exhibit a non-spooled arrangement mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases11-14. However, whether this arrangement is a general feature of dsRNA viruses remains unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the dsRNA genome structure of the tri-segmented bacteriophage ɸ6 of the Cystoviridae family, we show that dsRNA viruses can adopt a dsDNA-like single-spooled genome organization. We find that in this group of viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases do not direct genome ordering, and the dsRNA can adopt multiple conformations. We build a model that encompasses 90% of the genome, and use this to quantify variation in the packing density and to characterize the different liquid crystalline geometries that are exhibited by the tightly compacted nucleic acid. Our results demonstrate that the canonical model for the packing of dsDNA can be extended to dsRNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2947028185,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) regulates one-carbon transfer reactions that are essential for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and uses pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. Apo SHMT2 exists as a dimer with unknown functions, whereas PLP binding stabilizes the active tetrameric state. SHMT2 also promotes inflammatory cytokine signalling by interacting with the deubiquitylating BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC), although it is unclear whether this function relates to metabolism. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human BRISC-SHMT2 complex at a resolution of 3.8 Å. BRISC is a U-shaped dimer of four subunits, and SHMT2 sterically blocks the BRCC36 active site and inhibits deubiquitylase activity. Only the inactive SHMT2 dimer-and not the active PLP-bound tetramer-binds and inhibits BRISC. Mutations in BRISC that disrupt SHMT2 binding impair type I interferon signalling in response to inflammatory stimuli. Intracellular levels of PLP regulate the interaction between BRISC and SHMT2, as well as inflammatory cytokine responses. These data reveal a mechanism in which metabolites regulate deubiquitylase activity and inflammatory signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2947062743,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic pathologies associated with extensive gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from Daphne odora var with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of Treg cells and the reduced proinflammatory Th17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

https://openalex.org/W2947905010,"The utility of glypican-3 (GPC3) expression for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to identify associations between the presence of GPC3-positive CTCs and clinicopathological factors of these patients, furthermore, to evaluate whether CTC can predict microscopic portal vein invasion (mPVI). This study was done on 85 patients who underwent hepatectomy as the first-line treatment and whose preoperative imaging showed no evidence of macroscopic PVI and distant metastases. Peripheral blood was collected from all patients immediately before surgery. Cells were purified initially by density gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic positive enrichment based upon the expression of GPC3. The numbers of CTCs contained in the enriched samples were enumerated via flow cytometry. Protocol validation using HepG2 cells spiked into 8.0 mL of blood from a healthy volunteer indicated that we were able to recover 12.1% of the tumor cells. A median number of 3 CTCs (range: 0–27) was detected in the 8.0 mL of peripheral blood of the 85 analyzed HCC patients. Thirty-three patients had CTCs ≥5, and these patients had a higher incidence of mPVI (p < 0.001), a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.015), and a lower overall survival (p = 0.047) than those with CTCs <5. Multivariate analysis identified CTCs ≥5 as an independent predictor of mPVI (p < 0.001). In conclusion, preoperative GPC3-positive CTCs ≥5 was a risk factor of mPVI and poor prognosis, and therefore may be a useful biomarker for HCC patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2947988724,"Monopole-like electrostatic interactions are ubiquitous in biology and condensed matter, but they are often screened by counter-ions and cannot be switched from attractive to repulsive. In colloidal science, where the prime goal is to develop colloidal particles that mimic and exceed the diversity and length-scales of atomic and molecular assembly, electrostatically charged particles cannot change the sign of their surface charge or transform from monopoles to higher-order multipoles. In liquid-crystal colloids, elastic interactions between particles arise to minimize the free energy associated with elastic distortions in the long-range alignment of rod-like molecules around the particles. In dipolar, quadrupolar and hexadecapolar nematic colloids, the symmetries of such elastic distortions mimic both electrostatic multipoles and the outmost occupied electron shells of atoms. Electric and magnetic switching, spontaneous transformations and optical control of elastic multipoles, as well as their interactions with topological defects and surface boundary conditions, have been demonstrated in such colloids. However, it has long been understood that elastic monopoles should relax to uniform or higher-order multipole states because of the elastic torques that they induce. Here we develop nematic colloids with strong elastic monopole moments and with elastic torques balanced by optical torques exerted by ambient light. We demonstrate the monopole-to-quadrupole reconfiguration of these colloidal particles by unstructured light, which resembles the driving of atoms between the ground state and various excited states. We show that the sign of the elastic monopoles can be switched, and that like-charged monopoles attract whereas oppositely charged ones repel, unlike in electrostatics. We also demonstrate the out-of-equilibrium dynamic assembly of these colloidal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2947435538,"Regulation of circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels and delivery is crucial to maintain tissue homeostasis. Exosomes are nanomembranous vesicles that are released from diverse cell types and mediate intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules. Here, we sought to investigate the uptake of FFAs by circulating exosomes, the delivery of FFA-loaded exosomes to cardiac cells and the possible role of the FFA transporter CD36 in these processes. Circulating exosomes were purified from the serum of healthy donors after an overnight fast (F) or 20 minutes after a high caloric breakfast (postprandial, PP). Western blotting, Immunogold Electron Microscopy and FACS analysis of circulating exosomes showed that CD36 was expressed under both states, but was higher in postprandial-derived exosomes. Flow cytometry analysis showed that circulating exosomes were able to take-up FFA directly from serum. Importantly, preincubation of exosomes with a blocking CD36 antibody significantly impeded uptake of the FFA analogue BODIPY, pointing to the role of CD36 in FFA exosomal uptake. Finally, we found that circulating exosomes could delivery FFA analogue BODIPY into cardiac cells ex vivo and in vivo in a mice model. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism in which circulating exosomes can delivery FFAs from the bloodstream to cardiac tissue. Further studies will be necessary to understand this mechanism and, in particular, its potential involvement in metabolic pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2947302782,"This is a report on how 1H NMR-based metabonomics was employed to discriminate osteopenia from osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, identifying the main metabolites associated to the separation between the groups. The Assays were performed using seventy-eight samples, being twenty-eight healthy volunteers, twenty-six osteopenia patients and twenty-four osteoporosis patients. PCA, LDA, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA formalisms were used. PCA discriminated the samples from healthy volunteers from diseased patient samples. Osteopenia-osteoporosis discrimination was only obtained using Analysis Discriminants formalisms, as LDA, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA. The metabonomics model using LDA formalism presented 88.0% accuracy, 88.5% specificity and 88.0% sensitivity. Cross-Validation, however, presented some problems as the accuracy of modeling decreased. LOOCV resulted in 78.0% accuracy. The OPLS-DA based model was better: R2Y and Q2 values equal to 0.871 (p<0.001) and 0.415 (p<0.001). LDA and OPLS-DA indicated the important spectral regions for discrimination, making possible to assign the metabolites involved in the skeletal system homeostasis, as follows: VLDL, LDL, leucine, isoleucine, allantoin, taurine and unsaturated lipids. These results indicate that 1H NMR-based metabonomics can be used as a diagnosis tool to discriminate osteoporosis from osteopenia using a single serum sample."
https://openalex.org/W2946847904,"Arboreal folivores are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme climate change-driven heatwaves and droughts as they rely on leaf moisture to maintain hydration. During these increasingly frequent and intense weather events, leaf water content may not be enough to meet their moisture requirements, potentially leading to large-scale mortality due to dehydration. Water supplementation could be critical for the conservation of these animals. We tested artificial water stations for a threatened arboreal folivore, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), as a potential mitigation measure during hot and dry weather in New South Wales, Australia. We provided ground and tree drinkers to koalas and investigated changes in use with season, environmental conditions and foliar moisture. Our study provides first evidence of the regular use of free water by koalas. Koalas used supplemented water extensively throughout the year, even during cooler months. Time spent drinking varied with season and depended on days since last rain and temperature. The more days without rain, the more time koalas spent drinking. When temperature was high, visits to water stations were more frequent, indicating that in hot weather koalas need regular access to free water. Our results suggest that future changes in rainfall regimes and temperature in Australia have the potential to critically affect koala populations. Our conclusions can be applied to many other arboreal folivorous mammals worldwide which rely on leaves for their nutritional and water requirements. Artificial water stations may facilitate the resilience of vulnerable arboreal folivores during heat and drought events and may help mitigate the effects of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2947101346,"As the global population ages, and rates of dementia rise, understanding lifestyle factors that play a role in the development and acceleration of cognitive decline is vital to creating therapies and recommendations to improve quality of later life. Obesity has been shown to increase risk for dementia. However, the specific mechanisms for obesity-induced cognitive decline remain unclear. One potential contributor to diet-induced cognitive changes is neuroinflammation. Furthermore, a source of diet-induced inflammation to potentially increase neuroinflammation is via gut dysbiosis. We hypothesized that a high fat diet would cause gut microbe dysbiosis, and subsequently: neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Using 7-month old male Sprague Dawley rats, this study examined whether 8 weeks on a high fat diet could impact performance on the water radial arm maze, gut microbe diversity and abundance, and microgliosis. We found that a high fat diet altered gut microbe populations compared to a low fat, control diet. However, we did not observe any significant differences between dietary groups on maze performance (a measure of spatial working memory) or microgliosis. Our data reveal a significant change to the gut microbiome without subsequent effects to neuroinflammation (as measured by microglia characterization and counts in the cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) or cognitive performance under the parameters of our study. However, future studies that explore duration of the diet, composition of the diet, age of animal model, and strain of animal model, must be explored."

Material and methods Data on gene expressions were downloaded from TCGA and GEO database. Differentially expressed RNAs(DERNAs) were shown by DESeq2 package in R. Functional enrichment analysis of DEmRNAs was performed using clusterprofilers in R. PPI network was established by referring to String website. Survival analysis of DERNAs was carried out by survival package in R. Interactions among mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs were obtained from Starbase v3.0 and used to construct ceRNA network. Consensus Cluster Plus package was applied to identify molecular subtypes. All key genes were validated by comparing them with GEO microarray data. Statistical analyses of clinical features among different subtypes were performed using SPSS 22.0. Results A total of 2907 mRNAs (1366 up-regulated and 1541 down-regulated), 191miRNAs (98 up-regulated and 93 down-regulated) and 1831 lncRNAs (1151 up-regulated and 680 down-regulated) were identified from tumor and normal tissues. A ceRNA network was successfully constructed and 15 DEmRNAs, 1 DEmiRNA, 2 DElncRNAs associated with prognosis were employed. Furthermore, we firstly identified 2 molecular subtypes, basal and differentiated, and found that differentiated subtype consumed less alcohol and was related to a better overall survival. Conclusion The study constructed a ceRNA network and identified molecular subtypes of TSCC, and our findings provided a novel insight into this intractable cancer and potential therapeutic targets and prognostic indicators."

https://openalex.org/W2952654142,"Gram-negative pathogens resistant to amikacin and other aminoglycosides of clinical relevance usually harbor the 6’-N-acetyltransferase type Ib [AAC(6')-Ib], an enzyme that catalyzes inactivation of the antibiotic by acetylation using acetyl-CoA as donor substrate. Inhibition of the acetylating reaction could be a way to induce phenotypic conversion to susceptibility in these bacteria. We have previously observed that Zn2+ acts as an inhibitor of the enzymatic acetylation of aminoglycosides by AAC(6')-Ib, and in complex with ionophores it effectively reduced the levels of resistance in cellulo. We compared the activity of 8-hydroxyquinoline, three halogenated derivatives, and 5-[N-Methyl-N-Propargylaminomethyl]-8-Hydroxyquinoline in complex with Zn2+ to inhibit growth of amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in the presence of the antibiotic. Two of the compounds, clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) and 5,7-diiodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, showed robust inhibition of growth of the two A. baumannii clinical isolates that produce AAC(6')-Ib. However, none of the combinations had any activity on another amikacin-resistant A. baumannii strain that possesses a different, still unknown mechanism of resistance. Time-kill assays showed that the combination of clioquinol or 5,7-diiodo-8-hydroxyquinoline with Zn2+ and amikacin was bactericidal. Addition of 8-hydroxyquinoline, clioquinol, or 5,7-diiodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, alone or in combination with Zn2+, and amikacin to HEK293 cells did not result in significant toxicity. These results indicate that ionophores in complex with Zn2+ could be developed into potent adjuvants to be used in combination with aminoglycosides to treat Gram-negative pathogens in which resistance is mediated by AAC(6')-Ib and most probably other related aminoglycoside modifying enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2947040984,"Pasting properties of barley starch are important characteristics from a processing standpoint. The isolation of starch form barley grains is time consuming thus the whole grain flour is always used. To compare pasting properties of starch with those of the whole grain flour, we used a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) to measure pasting properties of three types of samples: grain flour and starches isolated using two different extraction methods. We also investigated compositional, morphological and structural properties of the two starch samples. Significant differences in pasting properties were found among the three sample types, but most of the parameters of pasting properties displayed significant correlations between flour and starch. No significant differences were found in amylose/amylopectin ratio, granule morphology, granule size distribution and crystal structure between starches extracted using two different methods. However, the starch isolated from water homogenization had a higher protein content and lower total starch, amylose and amylopectin contents than the starch extracted with homogenized extraction under alkaline conditions. We concluded that the whole grain flour can be used to predict the pasting properties in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2947706127,"Mosquitoes are significant vectors, responsible for transmitting serious infectious diseases, including the recent epidemics of global significance caused by, for example, Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The chemical insecticides in use for mosquito control are toxic and ineffective due to the development of resistance to them. The new approach to reduce mosquito population by releasing genetically modified males to cause female infertility is still under environmental safety evaluation. Photodynamic insecticides (PDI) have long been known as a safe and effective alternative by using dyes as the photosensitizers (PS) for activation with light to generate insecticidal singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species. This approach warrants re-examination with advances in the chemical synthesis of novel PS, e.g. phthalocyanines (PC). Nine PC were compared with five porphyrin derivatives and two classic PS of halogenated fluoresceins, i.e. cyanosine and rose bengal experimentally for photodynamic treatment (PDT) of the larvae of laboratory-reared Aedes mosquitoes and their cell lines. Groups of 2nd instar larvae were first exposed overnight to graded concentrations of each PS in the dark followed by their exposure to dim light for up to 7 hours. Larvae of both experimental and control groups were examined hourly for viability based on their motility. Monolayers of mosquito cells were similarly PS-sensitized and exposed briefly to light at the PS-specific excitation wavelengths. Cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assays. Of the 16 PS examined for photodynamic inactivation of the mosquito larvae, effective are three novel PC, i.e. amino-Si-PC1 and -PC2, anilinium Zn-PC3.4, pyridyloxy Si-PC14 and two porphyrin derivatives, i.e. TPPS2 and TMAP. Their EC50 values were determined, all falling in the nanomolar range lower than those of rose bengal and cyanosine. All PS effective in vivo were also found to dose-dependently inactivate mosquito cells photodynamically in vitro, providing cellular basis for their larvicidal activities. The present findings of novel PC with effective photodynamic larvicidal activities provide fresh impetus to the development of PDI with their established advantages in safety and efficacy. Toward that end, the insect cell lines are of value for rapid screening of new PC. The optimal excitability of PC with insect-invisible red light is inferred to have the potential to broaden the range of targetable insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2947195888,"Endobronchial stents are increasingly used to treat airway complications in multiple conditions including lung transplantation but little is known about the biofilms that form on these devices. We applied deep sequencing to profile luminal biofilms of 46 endobronchial stents removed from 20 subjects primarily with lung transplantation-associated airway compromise. Microbial communities were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker gene sequencing. Corynebacterium was the most common bacterial taxa across biofilm communities. Clustering analysis revealed three bacterial biofilm types: one low diversity and dominated by Corynebacterium; another was polymicrobial and characterized by Staphylococcus; and the third was polymicrobial and associated with Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Prevotella. Biofilm type was significantly correlated with stent material: covered metal with the Staphylococcus-type biofilm, silicone with the Corynebacterium-dominated biofilm, and uncovered metal with the polymicrobial biofilm. Subjects with sequential stents had frequent transitions between community types. Fungal analysis found Candida was most prevalent, Aspergillus was common and highly enriched in two of three stents associated with airway anastomotic dehiscence, and fungal taxa not typically considered pathogens were highly enriched in some stents. Thus, molecular analysis revealed a complex and dynamic endobronchial stent biofilm with three bacterial types that associate with stent material, a central role for Corynebacterium, and that both expected and unexpected fungi inhabit this unique niche. The current work provides a foundation for studies to investigate the relationship between stent biofilm composition and clinical outcomes, mechanisms of biofilm establishment, and strategies for improved stent technology and use in airway compromise."
https://openalex.org/W2948019194,"Low birth weight (LBW) and postnatal nutrition are risk factors for adult metabolic diseases. However, the interactions between LBW, diet, and intestinal lipid absorption and secretion leading to adult metabolic disease remain unclear. The current study determined the impact of LBW on intestinal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism under both control and Western diet (high fat, high fructose, and cholesterol) conditions in 5-wk-old LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) Landrace-Large White × Duroc pigs. A 2-step modified oral glucose and fat challenge test was performed. Mesenteric lymph, jejunal mucosal scrapings, and cecal digesta samples were also collected. LBW offspring were lower in weight and gained less weight per day. LBW pigs on either control or Western diets displayed increased triglyceride (TG) secretion into lymph (P = 0.0135). Western diet-fed LBW pigs developed fasting (P = 0.03) and postprandial (P < 0.05) hypertriglyceridemia, muscle steatosis (P = 0.0072), had higher insulin excursion (P < 0.01), increased jejunal stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 mRNA and increased hepatic fibrosis (P = 0.0017) compared with NBW piglets. Gut microbiota showed significant dysbiosis on Western diet independent of birth weight. In conclusion, LBW pigs fed a Western diet specifically up-regulate TG absorption and secretion, develop dyslipidemia, muscular steatosis, and display early signs of insulin resistance. Interestingly, this study does not provide evidence of altered intestinal microbiome in LBW pigs contributing to increased severity of metabolic diseases.-Fontaine, M. A., Diane, A., Singh, V.

https://openalex.org/W2947533673,"The high heat and mass transfer, and controlled mechanoenergy, in angled vortex fluidics has been applied in chemical and material sciences and allied fields, but its utility in food processing remains largely unexplored. Herein we report three models of food processing incorporating such vortex fluidics, including enzymatic hydrolysis, raw milk pasteurization and encapsulation. The processing times of enzymatic hydrolysis was reduced from about 2-3 hours to 20 minutes, with the processing time of raw milk pasteurization reduced from 30 to 10 minutes, and an encapsulated particle size reduced approximately 10-fold, from micro meters to hundreds of nanometers. These findings highlight exciting possibilities, in exploiting the value of vortex fluidic mediated processing in the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W2946919421,"Background Propofol is a widely used anaesthetic drug with advantageous operating conditions and recovery profile. However, propofol could have long term effects on neuronal cells and is associated with post-operative delirium (POD). In this context, one of the contributing factors to the pathogenesis of POD is a reduction of cholinesterase activity. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of propofol on the methylation, expression and activity of cholinergic genes and proteins in an in-vitro model. Results We found that propofol indeed reduced the activity of AChE / BChE in our in-vitro model, without affecting the protein levels. Furthermore, we could show that propofol reduced the methylation of a repressor region of the CHRNA7 gene without changing the secretion of pro–or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, propofol changed the expression patterns of genes responsible for maintaining the epigenetic status of the cell and accordingly reduced the tri-methylation of H3 K27. Conclusion In conclusion we found a possible functional link between propofol treatment and POD, due to a reduced cholinergic activity. In addition to this, propofol changed the expression of different maintenance genes of the epigenome that also affected histone methylation. Thus, propofol treatment may also induce strong, long lasting changes in the brain by potentially altering the epigenetic landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2947499682,"Proteases sustain hyperexcitability and pain by cleaving protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) on nociceptors through distinct mechanisms. Whereas trypsin induces PAR2 coupling to Gαq, Gαs, and β-arrestins, cathepsin-S (CS) and neutrophil elastase (NE) cleave PAR2 at distinct sites and activate it by biased mechanisms that induce coupling to Gαs, but not to Gαq or β-arrestins. Because proteases activate PAR2 by irreversible cleavage, and activated PAR2 is degraded in lysosomes, sustained extracellular protease-mediated signaling requires mobilization of intact PAR2 from the Golgi apparatus or de novo synthesis of new receptors by incompletely understood mechanisms. We found here that trypsin, CS, and NE stimulate PAR2-dependent activation of protein kinase D (PKD) in the Golgi of HEK293 cells, in which PKD regulates protein trafficking. The proteases stimulated translocation of the PKD activator Gβγ to the Golgi, coinciding with PAR2 mobilization from the Golgi. Proteases also induced translocation of a photoconverted PAR2-Kaede fusion protein from the Golgi to the plasma membrane of KNRK cells. After incubation of HEK293 cells and dorsal root ganglia neurons with CS, NE, or trypsin, PAR2 responsiveness initially declined, consistent with PAR2 cleavage and desensitization, and then gradually recovered. Inhibitors of PKD, Gβγ, and protein translation inhibited recovery of PAR2 responsiveness. PKD and Gβγ inhibitors also attenuated protease-evoked mechanical allodynia in mice. We conclude that proteases that activate PAR2 by canonical and biased mechanisms stimulate PKD in the Golgi; PAR2 mobilization and de novo synthesis repopulate the cell surface with intact receptors and sustain nociceptive signaling by extracellular proteases.

Sustained signaling by membrane-impermeant agonists in the extracellular environment requires the presence of functional receptors at the surface of cells. The level of functional receptors at the plasma membrane is a dynamic balance between processes that inactivate or remove receptors and those that reactivate or replenish receptors (1.Dong C.

Desensitization and endocytosis inactivate and remove functional receptors from the plasma membrane and thereby diminish cellular responsiveness. Recovery of responsiveness requires repopulation of the plasma membrane with functional receptors by mechanisms that include resensitization of receptors or membrane insertion of fresh receptors. However, in contrast to the mechanisms of receptor desensitization and endocytosis, which have been extensively studied (2.Smith J.S. Rajagopal S.

The mechanisms that attenuate plasma membrane signaling of GPCRs have been extensively studied. G protein–coupled receptor kinases and second messenger kinases can phosphorylate activated receptors, which then associate with β-arrestins. By uncoupling GPCRs from G proteins and coupling GPCRs to clathrin and adaptor protein 2, β-arrestins mediate receptor desensitization and endocytosis, which together attenuate plasma membrane signaling (4.Kang D.S.

CS- and NE-activated PAR2 fails to couple to Gαq and neither recruits β-arrestins nor internalizes. We recently reported that trypsin cleavage of PAR2 at the plasma membrane induces translocation of Gβγ to the Golgi apparatus, where Gβγ activates PKD (19.Jensen D.D. Zhao P. Jimenez-Vargas N.N.

PKD mediates the mobilization of PAR2 stores from the Golgi apparatus, which replenishes the plasma membrane with fresh receptors that are necessary for sustained trypsin signaling (19.Jensen D.D.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that underlie sustained signaling of proteases that activate PAR2 by biased mechanisms. By using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we have previously reported that trypsin activation of PAR2 leads to PKD phosphorylation (activation) in the Golgi apparatus (19.Jensen D.D. Zhao P. Jimenez-Vargas N.N. Lieu T. Gerges M. Yeatman H.R. Canals M. Vanner S.J. Poole D.P. Bunnett N.W.

To quantitatively assess PKD activation in live cells with high spatial and temporal fidelity, we expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells genetically encoded FRET biosensors for PKD that are targeted to the cytosol (Cyto-DKAR) or Golgi apparatus (Golgi-DKAR) (20.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. Calcium-dependent regulation of protein kinase D revealed by a genetically encoded kinase activity reporter.J. Biol.

We examined whether proteases that activate PAR2 by canonical or biased mechanisms can stimulate PKD activity in the cytosol or plasma membrane of HEK293 cells transiently expressing human PAR2 (hPAR2). To confirm that alterations in FRET were attributable to PKD activation, we expressed a T/A mutated PKD sensor (DKAR-T/A) in which the PKD phosphorylation site in the substrate domain is mutated. We first confirmed the expected subcellular localization of PKD FRET biosensors expressed in HEK293 cells by confocal microscopy. Cyto-DKAR was uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol, whereas Golgi-DKAR colocalized exclusively with immunoreactive TGN58K, a marker of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1A). Trypsin (10 nm), CS (100 nm), NE (100 nm), and the PAR2-selective agonist 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2, an analogue of the tethered ligand (10 μm), increased PKD activity in the cytosol and Golgi apparatus within 2 min, which was sustained for at least 20 min (Fig. 1, B–E). The PAR2 antagonist I-343 (18.Jimenez-Vargas N.N. Pattison L.A. Zhao P. Lieu T. Latorre R. Jensen D.D. Castro J. Aurelio L. Le G.T. Flynn B. Herenbrink C.K. Yeatman H.R. Edgington-Mitchell L.

I-343 did not inhibit activation of PKD in the Golgi apparatus in response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (200 nm) or thrombin (30 units/ml), a PAR1 agonist, and I-343 alone had no effect on PKD activity (Fig. 1I). These results show that proteases that activate PAR2 by canonical and biased mechanisms activate PKD in the cytosol and Golgi apparatus of HEK293 cells. These effects are mediated by PAR2. There was no effect of trypsin or 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2 on DKAR-T/A FRET (Fig. 1, B and E), although CS and NE caused a minor increase in DKAR-T/A FRET (Fig. 1, C and D). One possibility is that kinases other than PKD might phosphorylate DKAR-T/A, such as PKA, which is robustly activated by NE (13.Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Chung H. Renaux B. Lau C.S. Muruve D.A.

Gβγ subunits can activate PKD in the Golgi apparatus (21.Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Gβγ-mediated regulation of Golgi organization is through the direct activation of protein kinase D.Cell. 1999; 98 (10412981): 59-6810.1016/S0092-8674(00)80606-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Trypsin activation of PAR2 at the cell surface induces translocation of Gβγ subunits to the Golgi apparatus, where Gβγ activates PKD (19.Jensen D.D. Zhao P. Jimenez-Vargas N.N. Lieu T. Gerges M. Yeatman H.R. Canals M. Vanner S.J. Poole D.P. Bunnett N.W.

We used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to examine whether CS and NE, which activate PAR2 by biased mechanisms, also promote Gβγ trafficking to the Golgi apparatus. We transiently expressed in HEK293 cells Gγ2-Venus and Giantin-RLuc8, a Golgi-resident protein (22.Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Giantin, a novel conserved Golgi membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain of at least 350 kDa.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (7691276): 679-69310.1091/mbc.4.7.679Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which permitted measurement of the proximity between Gγ2-Venus and Giantin-RLuc8 using bystander BRET. We also expressed hPAR2, Gβ1, and either Gαq or Gαs, which allowed assessment of the requirement of different Gα subunits. We confirmed the expected subcellular localization of BRET biosensors expressed in HEK293 cells by confocal microscopy. In unstimulated cells, Gγ2-Venus was uniformly cytosolic, whereas Giantin-Venus colocalized exclusively with immunoreactive TGN58K in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2A). We were unable to localize Giantin-RLuc8 because of the lack of a suitable epitope tag or antibody, but we expect that it would have the identical localization as Giantin-Venus. Trypsin increased Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET in the presence of either Gαq or Gαs (Fig. 2, B–D). However, trypsin increased Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET with higher potency in cells expressing Gαq (pEC50 (negative logarithm of the EC50) - 12.74 ± 0.36) compared with Gαs (pEC50 = 9.75 ± 0.65). CS also increased Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET in the presence of either Gαq or Gαs (Fig. 2, E–G). In contrast to trypsin, CS increased BRET with higher potency in cells expressing Gαs (pEC50 = 11.90 ± 0.35) than Gαq (pEC50 = 10.35 ± 0.81). NE increased Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET only in the presence of Gαs (pEC50 = 11.84 ± 0.45), not Gαq (Fig. 2, H–J). Thus, proteases that activate PAR2 at the cell surface by canonical and biased mechanisms may evoke the rapid translocation of Gβγ to the Golgi apparatus. Although Gβγ subunits could originate from the plasma membrane, it is also possible that PAR2 activation evokes translocation of Gβγ from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus or may reveal Gβγ subunits already present in the Golgi apparatus. The effects of overexpression of Gα subunits on Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET are consistent with the capacity of trypsin-activated PAR2 to couple to Gαq or Gαs and for CS- and NE-activated PAR2 to couple preferentially to Gαs (13.Ramachandran R.

Studies with selective Gα inhibitors or with Gα-deficient HEK293 cells will be required to determine the absolute requirement of particular Gα subunits for protease-stimulated Gγ2-Venus/Giantin-RLuc8 BRET. To quantitatively examine whether PAR2 activation at the cell surface mobilizes receptors from the Golgi apparatus, we examined the proximity between PAR2-RLuc8 and TGN38-Venus, a Golgi-resident protein (23.Banting G. Ponnambalam S. TGN38 and its orthologues: roles in post-TGN vesicle formation and maintenance of TGN morphology.Biochim. Biophys.

PAR2-RLuc8 was prominently localized to the plasma membrane, and TGN38-Venus was confined to the Golgi apparatus, as confirmed by colocalization with immunoreactive TGN58K (Fig. 3A). Thus, BRET sensors have the expected subcellular localization. Trypsin (10 and 100 nm), CS (100 nm), and NE (100 nm) all induced a rapid decrease in PAR2-RLuc8/TGN38-Venus BRET within 2 min that was sustained for 20 min (Fig. 3, B–D). Gallein, which inhibits Gβγ activity (24.Bonacci T.M. Mathews J.L. Yuan C. Lehmann D.M. Malik S. Wu D. Font J.L. Bidlack J.M. Smrcka A.V.

To confirm involvement of Gβγ, we treated cells with a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2i), which inhibits Gβγ activity (25.Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M.

GRK2i (100 μm) attenuated the decrease in PAR2-RLuc8/TGN38-Venus BRET in cells exposed to trypsin, CS, and NE to a similar degree as gallein (Fig. 3, H–J).

Since body surface area and computed lean body mass are derivatives of body mass, normalizing for them may result in underestimation of left ventricular mass in overweight children. The aim of this study is to indicate which of the body size variables normalize left ventricular mass without underestimating it in overweight children. Methods Left ventricular mass assessed by echocardiography, height and body mass were collected for 464 healthy boys, 5–18 years old. Lean body mass and body surface area were calculated. Left ventricular mass z-scores computed based on reference data, developed for height, body surface area and lean body mass, were compared between overweight and non-overweight children. The next step was a comparison of paired samples of expected left ventricular mass, estimated for each normalizing variable based on two allometric equations—the first developed for overweight children, the second for children of normal body mass. Results The mean of left ventricular mass z-scores is higher in overweight children compared to non-overweight children for normative data based on height (0.36 vs. 0.00) and lower for normative data based on body surface area (-0.64 vs. 0.00). Left ventricular mass estimated normalizing for height, based on the equation for overweight children, is higher in overweight children (128.12 vs. 118.40); however, masses estimated normalizing for body surface area and lean body mass, based on equations for overweight children, are lower in overweight children (109.71 vs. 122.08 and 118.46 vs. 120.56, respectively). Conclusion Normalization for body surface area and for computed lean body mass, but not for height, underestimates left ventricular mass in overweight children."

We aimed to characterise and relate recent MenC isolates to the previously prevalent MenC:cc11 ET-15 clones, and also characterise and relate recent MenW isolates to the novel 'Hajj' clones.Using WGS we characterised invasive (n = 74, 1997/98 to 2016/17) and carried (n = 16, 2016/17) MenC isolates, and invasive (n = 18, 2010/11 to 2016/17) and carried (n = 15, 2016/17) MenW isolates. Genomes were assembled using VelvethOptimiser and stored on the PubMLST Neisseria Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database. Isolates were compared using the cgMLST approach.Most MenC and MenW isolates identified were cc11. A single MenC:cc11 sub-lineage contained the majority (68%, n = 19/28) of recent MenC:cc11 disease isolates and all carried MenC:cc11 isolates, which were interspersed and distinct from the historically significant ET-15 clones. MenW:cc11 study isolates clustered among international examples of both the original UK 2009 MenW:cc11, and novel 2013 MenW:cc11clones.We have shown that the majority of recent MenC disease incidence was caused by strain types distinct from the MenC:cc11 ET-15 clone of the late 1990s, which still circulate but have caused only sporadic disease in recent years. We have identified that the same aggressive MenW clone now established in several other European countries, is endemic in the RoI and responsible for the recent MenW incidence increases.

https://openalex.org/W2947543502,"Fat talk and citizen science Fat talk is a spontaneous verbal interaction in which interlocutors make self-disparaging comments about the body, usually as a request for assessment. Fat talk often reflects concerns about the self that stem from broader sociocultural factors. It is therefore an important target for sociocultural linguistics. However, real-time studies of fat talk are uncommon due to the resource and time burdens required to capture these fleeting utterances. This limits the scope of data produced using standard sociolinguistic methods. Citizen science may alleviate these burdens by producing a scale of social observation not afforded via traditional methods. Here we present a proof-of-concept for a novel methodology, citizen sociolinguistics. This research approach involves collaborations with citizen researchers to capture forms of conversational data that are typically inaccessible, including fat talk. Aims and outcomes This study had two primary aims. Aim 1 focused on scientific output, testing a novel research strategy wherein citizen sociolinguists captured fat talk data in a diverse metropolitan region (Southwestern United States). Results confirm that citizen sociolinguistic research teams captured forms of fat talk that mirrored the scripted responses previously reported. However, they also capture unique forms of fat talk, likely due to greater diversity in sample and sampling environments. Aim 2 focused on the method itself via reflective exercises shared by the citizen sociolinguists throughout the project. In addition to confirming that the citizen sociolinguistic method produces reliable, scientifically valid data, we contend that citizen sociolinguist inclusion has broader scientific benefits which include applied scientific training, fostering sustained relationships between professional researchers and the public, and producing novel, meaningful scientific output that advances professional discourse."
https://openalex.org/W2947338918,"Most papers on the physical condition of birds during spring migration focused on food availability preceding migratory take-off. Only a few studies examined the effect of climate conditions at the wintering grounds upon autumn arrival on bird physical condition later on. Here, we hypothesized that environmental conditions upon arrival at the wintering grounds, and not necessarily upon departure, have a crucial carry-over effect on bird spring migration. Using 29,000 observations of the lesser whitethroat, Sylvia curruca, and the eastern Bonelli's warbler, Phylloscopus orientalis, we found temperatures upon arrival at the African wintering grounds to be the only climatic variable correlated with birds' body state upon spring stopover in Israel, six months later. Two different mechanisms could explain these results. One possibility is that high temperatures create favorable conditions for insect activity, which allows rapid recovery from autumn migration and hence successful winter survival and maintenance. Another possible scenario is that harsh conditions, due to the heat and dry environment, cause high mortality, permitting survival of larger individuals which, then, enjoy reduced inter- and intra-specific competition. Whatever the mechanism is, our findings suggest that conditions upon autumn arrival, and not necessarily at the end of winter as traditionally thought, may have a major impact on migrating birds."

In the tumor microenvironment, this likely helps them evade therapies that target specific pathways. We must identify all possible states and utilize them in drug screening programs. One such state is characterized by expression of the transcription factor Hairy and Enhancer of Split 3 (HES3) and sensitivity to HES3 knockdown, and it can be modeled in vitro. Here, we cultured 3 primary human brain cancer cell lines under 3 different culture conditions that maintain low, medium, and high HES3 expression and characterized gene regulation and mechanical phenotype in these states. We assessed gene expression regulation following HES3 knockdown in the HES3-high conditions. We then employed a commonly used human brain tumor cell line to screen Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds that specifically target the HES3-high state. We report that cells from multiple patients behave similarly when placed under distinct culture conditions. We identified 37 FDA-approved compounds that specifically kill cancer cells in the high-HES3-expression conditions.

Materials and methods A field warming experiment (C: control; DW: daytime warming; NW: nighttime warming; DW+NW: daytime plus nighttime warming) was carried out in a naked barley ecological system. Results and discussion The DW, NW and DW+NW treatments dramatically increased soil temperature and decreased soil moisture but did not markedly modify Rs. The effects of DW and NW on soil respiration sensitivity (Q10) during the daytime and nighttime were different; they had no effects on daytime Q10 of Rs, but a significant inhibitory effect on nighttime Q10 of Rs. Conclusions A diurnal unsymmetrical rise in temperature brought about different results for the Q10 of Rs but did not cause changes in Rs under different experimental treatments in agroecological systems of the Lhasa."

However, using medical data and disease information of patients frequently raise privacy concerns. In this paper, based on single-layer perceptron, we propose a scheme of privacy-preserving clinical decision with cloud support (PPCD), which securely conducts disease model training and prediction for the patient. Each party learns nothing about the other's private information. In PPCD, a lightweight secure multiplication is presented and introduced to improve the model training. Security analysis and experimental results on real data confirm the high accuracy of disease prediction achieved by the proposed PPCD without the risk of privacy disclosure."
https://openalex.org/W2946861895,"This study was set out with the aim of assessing the effects of the most commonly available commercial disinfectants on embryogenesis of A. columbae eggs. In addition to the distilled water treatment as a control group, four disinfectants were tested that included formalin, povidone iodide, TH4, and Virkon-S, in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, an overnight incubation with the working concentration of disinfectants resulted in significant inhibition of 80%, 85%, and 98% of embryonic development at day 9 post-treatment with formalin, povidone iodide, and TH4, respectively. This inhibition was continued through days 12 and 15 with the three tested disinfectants. Virkon-S did not affect embryogenesis with larval development comparable to that of the control group. In the second more dissected experiment, contact times of 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes were set out for each disinfectant with embryogenesis inhibition results echoed that of the first experiment, with all disinfectants but Virkon-S inhibited larval development in significant proportions of eggs. Again, Virkon-S was very neutral in its effect on embryogenesis. When pigeon fecal matters were mixed with eggs and were subjected to disinfectants, discrepancies to results of the first two experiments were observed with only formalin inhibited embryogenesis in considerable proportion of eggs. Thus, and with the exception of Virkon-S, disinfectants tested at levels similar to those applicable in poultry in-houses and farms exhibited potent ovicidal activities on free eggs. To our knowledge, this is the first study involving the application of the commonly used in-poultry houses disinfectants to inactivate or delay the embryogenesis of bird Ascarids. The future perspective will potentially involve the in-field applications of the efficient disinfectants to eliminate or reduce the dissemination of infections with bird Ascarids in the chicken, turkey, pigeons, and other poultry houses."
https://openalex.org/W2947137285,"Affordability is a key barrier to access to medicines. Generic medicines policies can address this barrier and promote access. Successful uptake of generic medicines depends, in part, on ensuring that these products are interchangeable with reference products. Typically, bioequivalence certification is established in order to demonstrate such interchangeability.To study the implementation of the bioequivalence certification policy in Chile.We used Chilean Market Regulatory Authority data for analysis to study the number of products that obtained bioequivalence certification, the time until bioequivalence certification and associated factors to obtain bioequivalence.As of January 2017, out of 2,336 products with a valid market authorization containing at least one of the 167 APIs that required BE certification, 1,026 products actually have BE certification (1,026/2,336, 43.9% compliance). Where data were available, the time between submission of the market authorization as a bioequivalent product to final authorization by the national medicine regulatory authority for most products varied between 4-6 months. The fraction of all BE products containing a given API out of the total marketed products containing that API varies considerably, e.g. for the API olmesartan there was only a single BE product marketed, the API diclofenac had none.Although the implementation of Chile's bioequivalence policy increased the number of bioequivalent products, over 50% of generic products requiring bioequivalence that did not obtain this certification. Also for some of the API none or very few BE products are marketed which limits the success of a substitution policy. Further studies are required to identify the apparent lack of incentives to obtain bioequivalence certification. Studies of sales volumes and prices of the products are needed to identify whether generic products without bioequivalence certification either become bioequivalent or eventually exit the market."
https://openalex.org/W2947888461,"Gait-initiation onset (GI-onset) during sit-to-walk (STW) is commonly defined by mediolateral ground-reaction-force (xGRF) rising and crossing a threshold pre-determined from sit-to-stand peak xGRF. However, after stroke this method [xGRFthresh] lacks validity due to impaired STW performance. Instead, methodologies based upon instance of swing-limb maximum-vertical-GRF [vGRFmaxSWING], maximum-xGRF [xGRFmax], and swing-limb heel-off [firstHEELoff] can be applied, although their validity is unclear. Therefore, we determined these methodologies' validity by revealing the shortest transition-time (seat-off-GI-onset), their utility in routinely estimating GI-onset, and whether they exhibited satisfactory intra-subject reliability.Twenty community-dwelling stroke (60 (SD 14) years), and twenty-one age-matched healthy volunteers (63 (13) years) performed 5 standardised STW trials with 2 force-plates and optical motion-tracking. Transition-time differences across-methods were assessed using Friedman tests with post-hoc pairwise-comparisons. Within-method single-measure intra-subject reliability was determined using ICC3,1 and standard errors of measurement (SEMs).In the healthy group, median xGRFthresh transition-time was significantly shorter than xGRFmax (0.183s). In both the healthy and stroke groups, xGRFthresh transition-times (0.027s, 0.695s respectively) and vGRFmaxSWING (0.080s, 0.522s) were significantly shorter than firstHEELoff (0.293s, 1.085s) (p<0.001 in all cases). GI-onset failed to be estimated in 48% of stroke trials using xGRFthresh. Intra-subject variability was relatively high but was comparable across all estimation methods.The firstHEELoff method yielded significantly longer transition-times. The xGRFthresh method failed to routinely produce an estimation of GI-onset estimation. Thus, with all methods exhibiting low, yet comparable intra-subject repeatability, averaged xGRFmax or vGRFmaxSWING repeated-measures are recommended to estimate GI-onset for both healthy and community-dwelling stroke individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2946885414,"The goliath frog (Conraua goliath) is endemic to Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. It is an endangered species but little information is known about its parasites. To understand the impact of blood parasites on this species, we microscopically examined blood smears from 78 goliath frogs in February and November 2016 (dry and wet seasons) from six localities in Littoral Region of Cameroon, and we sequenced mitochondrial DNA from positive samples. Microfilariae were found in 33/78 (42.3%) goliath frogs at six locations. No other haemoparasite species was detected. Morphological characteristics of microfilariae were also described, and specimens from each frog species were similar. DNA sequencing data from the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidases sub unit I (COI) gene revealed a close relationship with Icosiella neglecta, a microfilaria documented in other European, Asian, and African frogs. However, sequences were sufficiently genetically distant (0.118) that they may define a new species of Icosiella. The infection burden of microfilariae varied by site, with season (65% in dry season to 23% in rainy season), and by sex, (male frogs had significantly higher parasite burdens than females (p < 0.0001)). However, this may have been confounded by size as the microfilaria intensity increased with frog weight (p < 0.0001), and males were larger than females. Microfilaria infection intensity varied from 1 to 120 per 50 μl of blood. Microfilaria induced a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the number of white blood cells (WBC) counted compared to uninfected frogs, but there was no statistically significant variation in red blood cell (RBC) count, plasma cholesterol level (p = 0.210) or plasma glucose level (p = 0.100)."
