https://openalex.org/W2119504728,"A Second Act for Antiandrogens Men with advanced prostate cancer are often treated with antiandrogens; drugs that inhibit the activity of male hormones, such as testosterone, that help drive tumor growth. Many of these drugs act by functionally disrupting the androgen receptor (AR), a transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation, but tumors eventually become resistant to the drugs by expressing higher levels of the AR. Tran et al. (p. 787 , published online 9 April) have developed a “second-generation” antiandrogen, a thiohydantoin called MDV3100, which binds the AR with high affinity. MDV3100 retains its anticancer activity in cell culture and in mouse models even when AR levels are elevated. The drug appears to act both by inhibiting translocation of the AR into the nucleus and by reducing its transcriptional activity. MDV3100 is being tested in patients with advanced prostate cancer, the first group of which have shown a decline in blood levels of a marker of cancer growth, prostate-specific antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2051242197,"Synonymous mutations do not alter the encoded protein, but they can influence gene expression. To investigate how, we engineered a synthetic library of 154 genes that varied randomly at synonymous sites, but all encoded the same green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed in Escherichia coli , GFP protein levels varied 250-fold across the library. GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, mRNA degradation patterns, and bacterial growth rates also varied, but codon bias did not correlate with gene expression. Rather, the stability of mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site explained more than half the variation in protein levels. In our analysis, mRNA folding and associated rates of translation initiation play a predominant role in shaping expression levels of individual genes, whereas codon bias influences global translation efficiency and cellular fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1964150693,"Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 ( IDH1 ) occur in certain human brain tumors, but their mechanistic role in tumor development is unknown. We have shown that tumor-derived IDH1 mutations impair the enzyme's affinity for its substrate and dominantly inhibit wild-type IDH1 activity through the formation of catalytically inactive heterodimers. Forced expression of mutant IDH1 in cultured cells reduces formation of the enzyme product, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and increases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor subunit HIF-1α, a transcription factor that facilitates tumor growth when oxygen is low and whose stability is regulated by α-KG. The rise in HIF-1α levels was reversible by an α-KG derivative. HIF-1α levels were higher in human gliomas harboring an IDH1 mutation than in tumors without a mutation. Thus, IDH1 appears to function as a tumor suppressor that, when mutationally inactivated, contributes to tumorigenesis in part through induction of the HIF-1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2111510713,"In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general."

So far, laser filamentation has been triggered with the use of ultrafast pulses with axially symmetric spatial beam profiles, thereby generating straight filaments. We report the experimental observation of curved plasma channels generated in air using femtosecond Airy beams. In this unusual propagation regime, the tightly confined main intensity feature of the axially nonsymmetric laser beam propagates along a bent trajectory, leaving a curved plasma channel behind. Secondary channels bifurcate from the primary bent channel at several locations along the beam path. The broadband radiation emanating from different longitudinal sections of the curved filament propagates along angularly resolved trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2162290777,"Picoeukaryotes are a taxonomically diverse group of organisms less than 2 micrometers in diameter. Photosynthetic marine picoeukaryotes in the genus Micromonas thrive in ecosystems ranging from tropical to polar and could serve as sentinel organisms for biogeochemical fluxes of modern oceans during climate change. These broadly distributed primary producers belong to an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas isolates have high 18 S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes from two isolates shared only 90% of their predicted genes. Their independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between the two isolates differently than the core genes. Analyses of the Micromonas genomes offer valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the dynamic nature of early plant evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4236140864,"Judson et al. show that microRNAs specific to mouse embryonic stem cells can substitute for the reprogramming factor cMyc in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. The development of reprogramming methods that do not rely on transgenes may facilitate clinical translation of this technology. This report demonstrates that introduction of microRNAs (miRNAs) specific to embryonic stem cells enhances the production of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The miRNAs miR-291-3p, miR-294 and miR-295 increase the efficiency of reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4, but not by these factors plus cMyc. cMyc binds the promoter of the miRNAs, suggesting that they are downstream effectors of cMyc during reprogramming. However, unlike cMyc, the miRNAs induce a homogeneous population of iPS cell colonies."
https://openalex.org/W1998463022,"The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor regulates cellular stress responses and the immune response to infection. NF-κB activation results in oscillations in nuclear NF-κB abundance. To define the function of these oscillations, we treated cells with repeated short pulses of tumor necrosis factor–α at various intervals to mimic pulsatile inflammatory signals. At all pulse intervals that were analyzed, we observed synchronous cycles of NF-κB nuclear translocation. Lower frequency stimulations gave repeated full-amplitude translocations, whereas higher frequency pulses gave reduced translocation, indicating a failure to reset. Deterministic and stochastic mathematical models predicted how negative feedback loops regulate both the resetting of the system and cellular heterogeneity. Altering the stimulation intervals gave different patterns of NF-κB–dependent gene expression, which supports the idea that oscillation frequency has a functional role."

https://openalex.org/W2049070043,"The fungal metabolite (+)-11,11′-dideoxyverticillin A, a cytotoxic alkaloid isolated from a marine Penicillium sp., belongs to a fascinating family of densely functionalized, stereochemically complex, and intricate dimeric epidithiodiketopiperazine natural products. Although the dimeric epidithiodiketopiperazines have been known for nearly 4 decades, none has succumbed to total synthesis. We report a concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-11,11′-dideoxyverticillin A via a strategy inspired by our biosynthetic hypothesis for this alkaloid. Highly stereo- and chemoselective advanced-stage tetrahydroxylation and tetrathiolation reactions, as well as a mild strategy for the introduction of the epidithiodiketopiperazine core in the final step, were developed to address this highly sensitive substructure. Our rapid functionalization of the advanced molecular framework aims to mimic plausible biosynthetic steps and offers an effective strategy for the chemical synthesis of other members of this family of alkaloids."
https://openalex.org/W2112338833,"Genetic exchange has not been shown to be a mechanism underlying the extensive diversity of Leishmania parasites. We report here evidence that the invertebrate stages of Leishmania are capable of having a sexual cycle consistent with a meiotic process like that described for African trypanosomes. Hybrid progeny were generated that bore full genomic complements from both parents, but kinetoplast DNA maxicircles from one parent. Mating occurred only in the sand fly vector, and hybrids were transmitted to the mammalian host by sand fly bite. Genetic exchange likely contributes to phenotypic diversity in natural populations, and analysis of hybrid progeny will be useful for positional cloning of the genes controlling traits such as virulence, tissue tropism, and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2118810801,"Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens have identified near-complete sets of genes involved in cellular processes. However, this methodology has not yet been used to study complex developmental processes in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report the use of a library of Drosophila strains expressing inducible hairpin RNAi constructs to study the Notch signalling pathway during external sensory organ development. We assigned putative loss-of-function phenotypes to 21.2% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes. Using secondary assays, we identified 6 new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and 23 novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway. By integrating our phenotypic results with protein interaction data, we constructed a genome-wide, functionally validated interaction network governing Notch signalling and asymmetric cell division. We used clustering algorithms to identify nuclear import pathways and the COP9 signallosome as Notch regulators. Our results show that complex developmental processes can be analysed on a genome-wide level and provide a unique resource for functional annotation of the Drosophila genome. The Notch pathway, a ubiquitous cell signalling system found in most multicellular organisms, is an important regulator in the embryo and remains active in many tissues in the adult. Now a genome-wide analysis using a library of transgenic Drosophila strains that express RNA interference (RNAi) constructs for almost every gene in the fly genome has been used to study one of the best understood morphogenetic events in fruitfly development: the formation of external sensory organs. Using RNAi screening, genes thought to be involved in Notch interactions can be inactivated in a tissue specific manner. The resulting data make it possible to assign putative functions to about 20% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes and to identify six new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and twenty-three novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway. Knoblich and colleagues use a library of Drosophila strains expressing inducible hairpin RNA interference constructs to study the Notch signalling pathway during external sensory organ development. They assign putative loss-of-function phenotypes to 21.2% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes, identify 6 new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and 23 novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2031927417,"Karen Steel and colleagues report that the mouse diminuendo mutant, which shows progressive hearing loss, carries a mutation in the seed region of mouse miR-96. In an accompanying paper, Miguel Moreno-Pelayo and colleagues report similar mutations in the seed region of human miR-96 segregating with progressive hearing loss in two families. Progressive hearing loss is common in the human population, but little is known about the molecular basis. We report a new N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU)-induced mouse mutant, diminuendo, with a single base change in the seed region of Mirn96. Heterozygotes show progressive loss of hearing and hair cell anomalies, whereas homozygotes have no cochlear responses. Most microRNAs are believed to downregulate target genes by binding to specific sites on their mRNAs, so mutation of the seed should lead to target gene upregulation. Microarray analysis revealed 96 transcripts with significantly altered expression in homozygotes; notably, Slc26a5, Ocm, Gfi1, Ptprq and Pitpnm1 were downregulated. Hypergeometric P-value analysis showed that hundreds of genes were upregulated in mutants. Different genes, with target sites complementary to the mutant seed, were downregulated. This is the first microRNA found associated with deafness, and diminuendo represents a model for understanding and potentially moderating progressive hair cell degeneration in hearing loss more generally."
https://openalex.org/W2023313934,"For almost two decades, it has been postulated that calcium-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs) play a role in airway epithelial Cl(-) secretion, but until recently, the molecular identity of the airway CaCC(s) was unknown. Recent studies have unequivocally identified TMEM16A as a glandular epithelial CaCC. We have studied the airway bioelectrics of neonatal mice homozygous for a null allele of Tmem16a (Tmem16a(-/-)) to investigate the role of this channel in Cl(-) secretion in airway surface epithelium. When compared with wild-type tracheas, the Tmem16a(-/-) tracheas exhibited a >60% reduction in purinoceptor (UTP)-regulated CaCC activity. Other members of the Tmem16 gene family, including Tmem16f and Tmem16k, were also detected by reverse transcription-PCR in neonatal tracheal epithelium, suggesting that other family members could be considered as contributing to the small residual UTP response. TMEM16A, however, appeared to contribute little to unstimulated Cl(-) secretion, whereas studies with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-deficient mice and wild-type littermates revealed that unstimulated Cl(-) secretion reflected approximately 50% CFTR activity and approximately 50% non-Tmem16a activity. Interestingly, the tracheas of both the Tmem16a(-/-) and the CFTR(-/-) mice exhibited similar congenital cartilaginous defects that may reflect a common Cl(-) secretory defect mediated by the molecularly distinct Cl(-) channels. Importantly, the residual CaCC activity in Tmem16a(-/-) mice appeared inadequate for normal airway hydration because Tmem16a(-/-) tracheas exhibited significant, neonatal, lumenal mucus accumulation. Our data suggest that TMEM16A CaCC-mediated Cl(-) secretion appears to be necessary for normal airway surface liquid homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2152887151,"Transition metals are essential enzyme cofactors that are required for a wide range of cellular processes. Paradoxically, whereas metal ions are essential for numerous cellular processes, they are also toxic. Therefore cells must tightly regulate metal accumulation, transport, distribution, and export.

We also develop methodology to calibrate the probes within the cellular environment. To identify both sources of and sinks for Zn2+, these sensors are genetically targeted to specific locations within the cell, including cytosol, plasma membrane, and mitochondria. Localized probes reveal that mitochondria contain an elevated pool of Zn2+ under resting conditions that can be released into the cytosol upon glutamate stimulation of hippocampal neurons.

Our results suggest that mitochondria serve as a source of and a sink for Zn2+ signals under different cellular conditions. Although mammalian cells are known to concentrate transition metals, it is now well established that under resting conditions, “free” (e.g. unbound) metals are maintained at extremely low levels. Estimates of the total Zn2+ concentration in mammalian cells typically range from 100 to 500 μm (1Eide D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar); yet free Zn2+ concentrations are tightly buffered by proteins such as metallothionein to maintain cytosolic Zn2+ concentrations in the picomolar to nanomolar range (2Maret W. Krezel A. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Thompson R.B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Frederickson C.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9183-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, there is emerging evidence that this static picture is dramatically altered by different cellular conditions, such as redox perturbations caused by oxidative stress (6Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 7Maret W. Neurochem.

Consequently, there is a pool of labile Zn2+ that, if mobilized by cellular signals, would result in the generation of transient Zn2+ signals. Recent studies suggest that these Zn2+ signals influence critical biological processes, such as mitochondrial function (7Maret W. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the sources and dynamics of these Zn2+ signals would greatly advance our understanding of the interplay between metal regulation and cellular function. There has been a huge effort in the past few years to develop sensitive and selective fluorescent probes to monitor Zn2+ in biological systems. The majority of this work has focused on the generation of small molecule fluorescent indicators (reviewed by Que et al. (11Que E.L. Domaille D.W. Chang C.J. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1517-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar)). Yet there are also examples of sensors based partially on Zn2+-binding proteins, such as carbonic anhydrase (12Bozym R.A. Thompson R.B. Stoddard A.K. Fierke C.A. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and metallothionein (13Hong S.H. Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and peptide scaffolds (14Walkup G.K. Imperiali B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3053-3054Crossref Google Scholar). Although many of these sensors have begun to provide insight into Zn2+ concentrations within cells, one limitation is that it is challenging to explicitly target them to subdomains within the cell. Localized probes are necessary to generate a complete picture of cellular Zn2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells. For this reason, sensors that are genetically encoded (i.e. generated by translation of a nucleic acid sequence) are attractive platforms for engineering metal-specific sensors. Encoded sensors provide additional benefits such as retention of the sensor over days to weeks permitting long term imaging and the ability to systematically vary the sensor concentration to evaluate the extent to which the sensor perturbs resting Zn2+ concentrations. Here we present genetically encoded sensors designed with a “Zn2+-sensing domain” sandwiched between two fluorescent proteins. The fluorescent proteins are chosen so that they are capable of undergoing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). 2The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTPENN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine. Because the mechanism of FRET involves dipole-dipole coupling, it is exquisitely dependent on the distance and orientation of the fluorophores with respect to one another. Therefore, if the binding of Zn2+ induces a conformational change in the sensor, it will alter the energy transfer between the two fluorescent proteins. The advantage of using FRET as the optical readout is that the donor emission will decrease and the acceptor emission will increase upon Zn2+ binding. Hence, by taking the ratio of the acceptor to the donor emission, we can create a ratiometric sensor. These sensors are targeted to the cytosol, mitochondria, and plasma membrane by attachment of signal sequences and fusion to other proteins. These sensors reveal differences in the spatial distribution of Zn2+ and highlight the power and utility of localized probes. fluorescence resonance energy transfer cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine. Details of sensor construction, protein purification, and buffered metal solutions are presented in the supplemental text. Purified sensor protein (0.5 μm) was buffer exchanged into 10 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl (pH 6.8) and titrated with Zn2+ to obtain the apparent dissociation constant, K′d. We determined the K′d using two approaches. In one approach, the fluorescence intensity at 529 nm (emission maximum of YFP) was plotted as a function of Zn2+, and in the second approach, the change in FRET ratio (R − Rmin) was plotted as a function of Zn2+, where the FRET ratio (R) is defined as the emission maximum of YFP divided by the emission maximum of CFP upon excitation of CFP, and Rmin is the minimum FRET ratio observed under Zn2+-free conditions. These measurements yielded K′d values within experimental error of one another. It should be noted that we measure the apparent Kd because we are monitoring the conformational change that leads to FRET as opposed to directly measuring the Zn2+ binding event. Mixed metal buffer solutions (15Walkup G.K. Burdette S.C. Lippard S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5644-5645Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar) were used to buffer Zn2+ from 9 nm to 1.3 μm (Zn2+/Sr2+/EGTA) and 2–134 μm (Zn2+/Ca2+/EGTA). The Cys2His2 sensor was purified and maintained under anaerobic conditions (see supplemental text for more details). A standard Ellman's assay (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) was used to quantify the percentage of reduced Cys. The observed FRET ratio change (R − Rmin) for the Cys2His2 sensor varied with the percentage of reduced Cys (typically between 50 and 80% of Cys were reduced). The lack of complete Cys reduction likely resulted from our inability to maintain a completely anoxic environment. Normalization to the amount of active, reduced protein yielded the maximal dynamic range for the Cys2His2 sensor of 2.2-fold. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Safire-II fluorescence plate reader (Tecan). FRET ratios (R) were calculated for each titration point by dividing the YFP intensity (λmax = 529 nm) by CFP intensity (λmax = 475 nm) upon CFP excitation at 420 nm. The emission bandwidth was 10 nm. The His4 sensor was targeted to the extracellular surface of mammalian cells using pDisplay (Invitrogen). The Cys2His2 sensor was targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, referred to as mito-Cys2His2, by attaching four tandem repeats of the cytochrome c oxidase signal sequence (MSVLTPLLLRGLTGSARRLPVPRAKIHSLGDP) to the N terminus of the sensor (17Palmer A.E. Giacomello M. Kortemme T. Hires S.A. Lev-Ram V. Baker D. Tsien R.Y. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Sensor constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using TransIt (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions and imaged 48 h post-transfection. The imaging experiments were performed on an Axiovert 200M inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with a Cascade 512B CCD camera (Roper scientific), and equipped with CFP (430/24 excitation, 455 dichroic, 470/24 emission), YFP (495/10 excitation, 515 dichroic, 535/25 emission), and YFP FRET (430/24 excitation, 455 dichroic, 535/25 emission) filters controlled by a Lambda 10-3 filter changer (Sutter Instruments) and analyzed using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging). Experiments on cytosolically expressed sensors were collected at 40× magnification, whereas mitochondrial experiments were collected at 100× magnification. The cells were imaged in phosphate-free HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution. To determine the in situ K′d values, the cells were treated with 150 μm TPEN to obtain the minimum FRET ratio (Rmin) followed by a wash and the addition of increasing concentrations of a well defined Zn2+ solution (Zn2+/Sr2+/EGTA- or Zn2+/Ca2+/EGTA-buffered solutions). For intracellularly expressed sensors (cytosol and mitochondria), the cells were treated with 150 μm TPEN to obtain the minimum FRET ratio (Rmin) followed by a wash and the addition of 15 μm digitonin (Calbiochem) and a saturating Zn2+ solution (1.5 mm) to establish the maximum FRET ratio (Rmax). The digitonin was used to permeabilize the plasma membrane and facilitate Zn2+ entry into the cell. The Rmax treatment was generally toxic to cells and therefore was always performed at the end of an experiment. For mitochondrial calibrations, the Zn2+ ionophore pyrithione (25 μm) was included along with digitonin to facilitate Zn2+ entry across the mitochondrial membrane. Because for the Cys2His2 sensor, the sensor concentration was similar in magnitude to the K′d, and the FRET ratio versus [Zn2+]total was fit with the following expression (18Wilkinson K.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 15-32PubMed Google Scholar),FRET ratio=([Zn2+]T+[ sensor ]T+Kd)−(−[Zn2+]T−[ sensor ]T−Kd)2−4[Zn2+]T[sensor]T2[ sensor ]T(Eq. 1) where [sensor]T was taken to be 6 μm. This sensor concentration was determined experimentally as described below. Still, [sensor]T was varied from 0.5 to 10 μm in the above fits with no change in the calculated Kd. For the His4 sensor, the data were fit to a one site binding equation. Citrine YFP intensity was converted to sensor protein concentration using an established method (19Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Briefly, a protein standard curve was generated by measuring the citrine intensities of purified sensor protein of known concentrations in a 50-μm-tall rectangular glass capillary (VitroCom) using identical settings as the imaging experiments. The FRET ratio (R) was calculated from background corrected FRET and CFP fluorescence images and corrected for photobleaching if necessary. The FRET ratios were converted to Zn2+ concentrations using the following equation (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) along with experimentally derived Rmin, Rmax, and in situ K′d values.[Zn2+]=Kd′(R−Rmin)(Rmax−R)(Eq. 2) It should be noted that Rmin and Rmax are obtained in each experiment and in each individual cell. Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from postnatal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rats, with slight modifications (21Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were dissociated and plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Invitrogen) and grown in neurobasal A supplemented with B27 and Glutamax medium (Invitrogen). The neurons were transfected prior to plating by Amaxa nucleofection at 2,000,000 cells/transfection with 2 μg of DNA/manufacturer's recommendations (Amaxa) and grown to 9 days in vitro. The neurons were imaged at 9 days in vitro as above using 100× magnification in a modified Tyrode's salts solution. The sensor design consists of two fluorescent proteins and a “sensing domain” that undergoes a conformational change upon Zn2+ binding. A sensor schematic is presented in Fig. 1A. Binding of Zn2+ to the sensing domain changes the distance and orientation between the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the citrine fluorescent protein (YFP), leading to increased FRET from CFP to YFP. The Zn2+-sensing domain is a canonical Cys2His2 zinc finger from the mammalian transcription factor, Zif268. The zinc finger was selected because extensive structural data indicates that these domains are largely unstructured in the absence of metal ion and fold into a compact structure upon Zn2+ binding (22Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Three sensor variants were generated: a wild type zinc finger (Cys2His2), a mutant zinc finger containing four histidines (His4), and a mutant zinc finger containing four alanines (Ala4) to abrogate Zn2+ binding. To characterize the sensors in vitro, the sensor protein was purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Fig. 1B demonstrates that Zn2+ binding to the His4 sensor causes a decrease in CFP and an increase in YFP emission upon CFP excitation caused by an increase in FRET. The same spectral changes were observed for the Cys2His2 sensor (data not shown). As expected, the sensor is ratiometric, and therefore the sensor response is presented as the FRET ratio (R). The dynamic range of the sensor is defined as Rmax/Rmin and was 4-fold for the His4 sensor and 2.2-fold for the Cys2His2 sensor, making these some of the more sensitive FRET sensors based on conformational change. For comparison, redesigned sensors for Ca2+ exhibit a 5-fold ratio change (17Palmer A.E. Giacomello M. Kortemme T. Hires S.A. Lev-Ram V. Baker D. Tsien R.Y. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 23Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), kinase sensors typically exhibit a 0.2–0.6-fold ratio change (24Zhang J. Allen M.D. Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and glutamate sensors exhibit a 0.25-fold ratio change (25Hires S.A. Zhu Y. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008; 105: 4411-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We suspect that the difference in the dynamic range between the His4 and Cys2His2 sensors results from slight variation in the overall geometry and hence orientation of the fluorescent proteins with respect to one another. There is some precedence for this because a systematic analysis of analogous Ca2+ sensors revealed large changes in the dynamic range for sensors with different orientations but similar distances between the two fluorescent proteins (23Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent dissociation constant for Zn2+ (K′d), the FRET intensity and FRET ratio for each sensor were measured as a function of Zn2+ concentration. These measurements yielded identical K′d values. The FRET ratio (R) binding curves are presented in Fig. 1 (C and D). The in vitro zinc affinities for the Cys2His2 and His4 sensors were determined to be 1.7 ± 0.2 and 160 ± 4 μm, respectively. The Cys2His2 sensor exhibited a lower Zn2+ affinity than the isolated zinc finger (1.7 μm versus 10 nm). We suspect that this is because attachment of the fluorescent proteins alters the apparent zinc affinity. As expected, mutation of Cys2His2 to His4 led to a reduction in Zn2+ affinity, enabling us to generate both a high and low affinity sensor. Proteolytic removal of the His6 tag did not alter the K′d of either sensor, indicating that the His tag does not participate in Zn2+ binding. Mutation of Cys2His2 to Ala4 abrogates the sensor response, indicating that Zn2+ binding to the Zn2+ finger portion of the sensor is required for the observed FRET ratio change (Fig. 1D). Although the cellular environment is generally reducing, cellular compartments may be oxidizing, or the cell may experience transient changes in redox potentials. The cysteines of the Cys2His2 sensor are sensitive to oxidization. To test the effects of oxidation on the FRET ratio, we measured the in vitro FRET ratios of the reduced and oxidized Cys2His2 sensor. Rmin was not affected by Cys2His2 sensor oxidization; however, the oxidized form of the sensor was unable to achieve the maximum FRET ratio with the addition of saturating Zn2+ (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that artificial increases in FRET would not be generated by sensor oxidation, but that upon oxidation, the sensor will be less sensitive to Zn2, resulting in a decreased dynamic range. For sensors to report Zn2+ dynamics accurately within the complex environment of the cell, it is important that they be specific for Zn2+ over other abundant divalent ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and biologically relevant transition metals (Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Ni2+). To determine the metal specificity, we examined whether other metals could elicit a FRET ratio change in the Cys2His2 and His4 sensors and/or interfere with the Zn2+ response (supplemental Fig. S2). The majority of metals did not elicit a FRET change and did not interfere with the Zn2+ response. The two exceptions were Fe2+ and Cu2+. Fe2+ caused a small perturbation of Zn2+ binding to both sensors but only at the highest concentration tested (250 μm). Fe2+ itself did not cause an artificial FRET change. Cu2+ interfered with Zn2+ binding to the His4 sensor such that the maximum Zn2+ response could only be achieved at the lowest Cu2+ concentration (5 μm). The 5 μm Cu2+ level is still significantly higher than the estimated cytosolic free copper concentration of less than 10−18m or attomolar (26Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Cu2+ only bound to and elicited a FRET change at the highest concentration tested (250 μm), suggesting that Cu2+ signals would be unlikely to give false FRET increases. The metal specificity results suggest that metal cross-reactivity will not be a problem in the cellular environment. However, given that copper ions pose the greatest potential for interference, we further experimentally verified Zn2+ selectivity over copper in cells (see below). Although genetically encoded FRET-based sensors for Zn2+ have been reported previously, they have either not been demonstrated to function in cells (27vanDongen E.M.W.M. Evers T.H. Dekkers L.M.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) or were not used explicitly to measure cellular Zn2+ (30Qiao W. Mooney M. Bird A.J. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006; 103: 8674-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore we sought to express our Cys2His2 and His4 sensors in mammalian cells and characterize the in situ response. We chose to target the low affinity His4 sensor to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane and the higher affinity Cys2His2 sensor to both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Fig. 2A presents pseudo color FRET ratio images of HeLa cells expressing the cytosolic Cys2His2 sensor. The addition of TPEN, a Zn2+-specific chelator, results in a decrease in the FRET ratio, whereas an addition of Zn2+ results in an increase. Fig. 2 (B and C) demonstrates sensors targeted to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the sensors generated. To measure the apparent dissociation constant in situ, the cells were treated with TPEN to establish the minimum FRET ratio in zero Zn2+ (Rmin) followed by membrane permeabilization with digitonin and the addition of known concentrations of Zn2+. Fig. 2D presents a representative trace illustrating a Zn2+ titration, and Fig. 2E reports the full binding curves. The in situ Zn2+ affinity of each sensor was comparable with that observed in vitro (K′d = 1.5 ± 0.2 μm in situ versus 1.7 ± 0.2 μm in vitro for Cys2His2; and 200 ± 10 μm in situ versus 160 ± 4 μm in vitro for His4). As expected, the cytosolic Ala4 sensor showed no significant FRET ratio change upon addition of Zn2+ to cells. The dynamic range of both sensors was reduced in cells as compared with in vitro (0.25-fold in situ versus 2.2-fold for Cys2His2 and 4-fold for His4 in vitro), even though the affinity for Zn2+ was unchanged. The dynamic range for Cys2His2 was identical in the cytosol and mitochondria, suggesting that possible redox differences in these locations do not affect the sensor functionality and Zn2+ measurements. We speculate that the reduced dynamic range in situ may be due to molecular crowding in the cellular environment, causing the fluorophores of the sensor to be closer together in the absence of Zn2+, resulting in an overall higher Rmin. This is supported by our observation that Rmin is generally higher in cells (∼4) than in purified protein (Rmin = ∼1.5) when measured under the same experimental conditions on the microscope. Although the dynamic range was reduced in cells, the sensors still yielded robust responses to changes in Zn2+ levels and enabled visualization of Zn2+ dynamics in neurons.TABLE 1Summary of sensors developed in this workSensorIn situ K′dTargeted locationsCys2His21.5 μmCytosol and mitochondriaHis4200 μmCytosol, mitochondria, and plasma membraneAla4Control; does not bind Zn2+Cytosol Open table in a new tab Next, we determined whether cellular Cu1+ or Cu2+ ions interfered with Zn2+ measurements in cells. Resting FRET ratios were not affected by the addition of either neocuproine hydrochloride monohydrate (a Cu+1 specific chelator) or bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt (a Cu+1/+2 chelator) but decreased to a minimum FRET ratio upon addition of TPEN, indicating that the in situ resting ratios were specific to Zn2+ and not influenced by Cu1+ or Cu2+ (supplemental Fig. S3). The mitochondrially targeted sensor (mito-Cys2His2) exhibited a marked improvement in localization over the small molecule probe RhodZin-3 (Invitrogen; supplemental Fig. S4). Moreover, mito-Cys2His2 stayed localized within mitochondria upon membrane depolarization, whereas RhodZin-3 leaked out into the cytosol under these conditions. The first step in characterizing cellular Zn2+ homeostasis is to define the levels of Zn2+ in different locations within the cell. There has been some controversy over whether mitochondria contain a labile pool of Zn2+ that is elevated over the cytosol (9Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 31Malaiyandi L.M. Vergun O. Dineley K.E. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To address this, we measured resting Zn2+ concentrations in the cytosol and mitochondria using our Cys2His2 sensor. Because the addition of a sensor may perturb cellular Zn2+ levels, determinations of the “free” Zn2+ concentrations should be conducted over a range of sensor concentrations, enabling mathematical extrapolation to the “free” [Zn2+] at zero [sensor]. This variation in sensor concentrations is a natural consequence of transient transfection where the numbers of gene copies can vary from cell to cell. Tighter control of sensor expression will likely be possible with the use of inducible promoters, and the establishment of stably transfected cell lines. Fig. 3 (A and B) presents the concentration of Zn2+ as a function of sensor concentration in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. For the cytosolic sensor citrine YFP intensity was converted to protein concentration using a protein standard curve (19Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S5). In mitochondria, the citrine intensity was not converted to a protein concentration because of the uncertainty in predicting mitochondrial volume. We observe a direct correlation between sensor protein expression and the calculated Zn2+ values in the cytosol, where higher sensor concentrations give rise to higher estimated Zn2+ levels. A simple saturation model yields the best fit and projects a resting cytosolic Zn2+ concentration of 180 nm when extrapolated to zero sensor concentration. For all of the subsequent experiments, we imaged cells with low (<5 μm) expression levels to minimize perturbation of cellular Zn2+ levels. We did not observe a strong correlation between citrine intensity and Zn2+ levels within mitochondria. This is likely because the sensor expression was naturally low (hundreds of fluorescence counts instead of thousands), and the expression level did not vary significantly. The average Zn2+ level within mitochondria was found to be 680 ± 140 nm. Fig. 3C depicts representative time course experiments from both cytosol and mitochondria and directly illustrates the elevated resting Zn2+ within mitochondria. These data support the hypothesis that mitochondria contain a pool of Zn2+ that serve as a source of Zn2+ signals, as suggested by Sensi et al. (9Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A requisite feature of a useful sensor is the ability to observe dynamic fluctuations in living cells. Glutamate and Zn2+ colocalize in presynaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons, yet the physiological function of this vesicular Zn2+ remains unclear (11Que E.L. Domaille D.W. Chang C.J. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1517-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Nolan et al. (32Nolan E.M. Ryu J.W. Jaworski J. Feazell R.P. Sheng M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1995659333,"Submillimetre galaxies at redshifts of 1< z > 4 are thought to be precursors of the giant elliptical galaxies in the present-day Universe, as they are the only known objects with sufficiently massive star formation rates. A new extra-galactic survey from the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (BLAST) team, at 250, 350 and 500 µm has resulted in a 20-fold increase in the total number of galaxies observed in this wavelength range. The survey shows that the entire far infrared background derives from individual galaxies, with 70% of it from galaxies at z ≤ 1.2. These exploits are the subject of the documentary BLAST! ( http://www.blastthemovie.com ), being screened around the world as part of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 programme. Submillimetre surveys have discovered a population of luminous, high-redshift, dusty starburst galaxies, which go through a phase of very rapid star formation, resulting in approximately equal extragalactic optical and far infrared backgrounds (FIRB). Devlin et al. report an extragalactic survey at 250, 350 and 500 µm; they determine that all of the FIRB comes from individual galaxies, with galaxies at redshift z ≥ 1.2 accounting for 70 per cent of it. Submillimetre surveys during the past decade have discovered a population of luminous, high-redshift, dusty starburst galaxies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. In the redshift range 1 ≤ z ≤ 4, these massive submillimetre galaxies go through a phase characterized by optically obscured star formation at rates several hundred times that in the local Universe. Half of the starlight from this highly energetic process is absorbed and thermally re-radiated by clouds of dust at temperatures near 30 K with spectral energy distributions peaking at 100 μm in the rest frame9. At 1 ≤ z ≤ 4, the peak is redshifted to wavelengths between 200 and 500 μm. The cumulative effect of these galaxies is to yield extragalactic optical and far-infrared backgrounds with approximately equal energy densities. Since the initial detection of the far-infrared background (FIRB)10, higher-resolution experiments have sought to decompose this integrated radiation into the contributions from individual galaxies. Here we report the results of an extragalactic survey at 250, 350 and 500 μm. Combining our results at 500 μm with those at 24 μm, we determine that all of the FIRB comes from individual galaxies, with galaxies at z ≥ 1.2 accounting for 70% of it. As expected, at the longest wavelengths the signal is dominated by ultraluminous galaxies at z > 1."

https://openalex.org/W2049056185,"Background Heparanase, a mammalian endo-β-D-glucuronidase, specifically degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans ubiquitously associated with the cell surface and extracellular matrix. This single gene encoded enzyme is over-expressed in most human cancers, promoting tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Principal Findings We report that targeted disruption of the murine heparanase gene eliminated heparanase enzymatic activity, resulting in accumulation of long heparan sulfate chains. Unexpectedly, the heparanase knockout (Hpse-KO) mice were fertile, exhibited a normal life span and did not show prominent pathological alterations. The lack of major abnormalities is attributed to a marked elevation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, for example, MMP2 and MMP14 in the Hpse-KO liver and kidney. Co-regulation of heparanase and MMPs was also noted by a marked decrease in MMP (primarily MMP-2,-9 and 14) expression following transfection and over-expression of the heparanase gene in cultured human mammary carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells. Immunostaining (kidney tissue) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Hpse-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts) suggest that the newly discovered co-regulation of heparanase and MMPs is mediated by stabilization and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Conclusions/Significance The lack of heparanase expression and activity was accompanied by alterations in the expression level of MMP family members, primarily MMP-2 and MMP-14. It is conceivable that MMP-2 and MMP-14, which exert some of the effects elicited by heparanase (i.e., over branching of mammary glands, enhanced angiogenic response) can compensate for its absence, in spite of their different enzymatic substrate. Generation of viable Hpse-KO mice lacking significant abnormalities may provide a promising indication for the use of heparanase as a target for drug development."

Specifically, proteins equipped with not only the LPXTG motif but also N-terminal glycine residues yielded covalently closed circular polypeptides (Fig. 1). Similar reactivity using sortase has been described in two previous cases; however, rigorous characterization of the circular polypeptides was absent (16.Parthasarathy R. Subramanian S. Boder E.T. Bioconjugate Chem. 2007; 18: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20.Mao H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The circular proteins in these reports were observed as minor components of more complex reaction mixtures, and the cyclization reaction itself was not optimized.Here we describe our efforts toward applying sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation to the synthesis of circular and oligomeric proteins. This method has general applicability, as illustrated by successful intramolecular reactions with three structurally unrelated proteins. In addition to circularization of individual protein units, the multiprotein complex AAA-ATPase p97/VCP/CDC48, with six identical subunits containing the LPXTG motif and an N-terminal glycine, was found to preferentially react in daisy chain fashion to yield linear protein fusions. The reaction exploited here shows remarkable similarities to the mechanisms proposed for circularization of cyclotides, small circular proteins that have been isolated from plants (21.Gillon A.D.

Although some cyclic protein derivatives occur naturally, methods for generating cyclic proteins in the laboratory provide a means for accessing cyclic versions of proteins that only occur in linear form. Intramolecular sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation provides a straightforward method for accessing these types of cyclic proteins. The transpeptidation reaction described here bears a remarkable resemblance to the proposed biosynthesis of the largest class of naturally occurring cyclic proteins, the cyclotides (21.Gillon A.D.

In both cases, linear protein precursors are cleaved by cysteine proteases to generate an acyl-enzyme intermediate that is subsequently resolved by nucleophilic attack from the N terminus of the linear proteins to generate the cyclic product.In this work we have explored transpeptidation reactions using four structurally diverse protein substrates. Cyclization has been confirmed for three proteins, including an example (UCHL3) utilizing an LPXTG sequence positioned in a flexible internal loop rather than near the C terminus of the protein. Cyclization and oligomerization via sortase-mediated transpeptidation have been previously suggested to occur for an eGFP construct modified in a manner similar to that used here (16.Parthasarathy R. Subramanian S. Boder E.T. Bioconjugate Chem. 2007; 18: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and for a by-product from a protein purification system where the substrate circularized appears to be sortase A itself (20.Mao H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In both cases, the identity of the circular products was not rigorously confirmed. Our data identify the circular or oligomeric products unambiguously by MS/MS for all substrates studied. We also find that our eGFP derivative strongly favors cyclization over oligomerization, showing little evidence for the formation of higher order structures that might be expected by the head-to-tail ligation of termini from separate eGFP monomers. Subtle differences in the structure of the eGFP constructs cannot be overlooked as a potential cause for the observed results. For example, our eGFP is extended at the N terminus by only five glycine residues, whereas the construct studied by Parthasarathy et al. (16.Parthasarathy R. Subramanian S. Boder E.T. Bioconjugate Chem. 2007; 18: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) contains an additional 17 residues, including 3 N-terminal glycines. Future work will be required to thoroughly characterize the effect of distance relationships between protein termini on favoring intra- versus intermolecular transpeptidation.With respect to protein cyclization, sortase-mediated circularization is efficient despite the potential for competing reaction pathways. In the absence of added oligoglycine nucleophile, these include hydrolysis of the acyl enzyme intermediate, reattachment of the C-terminal protein fragment that is lost upon initial cleavage of the protein substrate by sortase, or, as mentioned above, oligomerization of protein monomers in head-to-tail fashion. Even when oligoglycine nucleophile is added with the intent of blocking the cyclization pathway, millimolar concentrations are necessary to efficiently compete with cyclization. One factor that certainly must contribute to this observed preference for cyclization is the distance between protein termini. Inspection of the data base of PDB shows that nearly one-third of proteins with known structures have their termini in rather close apposition (within 20 Å) (40.Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The LPXTG sequence itself spans roughly 15 Å in an extended conformation, suggesting that circularization via sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation might be amenable to a significant fraction of proteins using the LPXTG sequence alone to bridge the gap between N and C termini. Larger distances could simply be covered by inserting flexible amino acid spacers at either termini. We also consider it likely that the circularized version of a protein will show more restricted mobility in the segment that corresponds to the newly established LPXTG connection between its termini. This fact alone may render the circular product a comparatively worse substrate for sortase and therefore assist in driving the transpeptidation reaction toward cyclization. As evidence for this point, we have observed previously that sortase fails to cleave LPXTG motifs placed in structured loops of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules (14.Popp M.W. Antos J.M. Grotenbreg G.M. Spooner E. Ploegh H.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation provides an attractive alternative to existing methods for peptide and protein circularization. Chemical synthesis can provide access to circular polypeptides of modest size, with circularization of linear precursors having been achieved using native chemical ligation (41.Camarero J.A. Muir T.W. Chem. Commun. 1997; : 1369-1370Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42.Camarero J.A. Pavel J. Muir T.W. Angew. Chem.-Int. Ed.

Soc. 1996; 118: 43-50Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). For larger proteins beyond the technical capabilities of solid-phase synthesis, cyclization is most often accomplished using native chemical ligation, typically in conjunction with split-intein expression constructs (35.Iwai H. Lingel A. Pluckthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 36.Iwai H. Plückthun A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When compared with the split-intein approach, the modest modification necessary to render proteins amenable to cyclization or oligomerization is certainly an attractive feature of the sortase-catalyzed process. Proteins must simply possess a sortase recognition sequence (LPXTG) either near the C terminus or in a flexible loop and an N-terminal glycine residue to act as the nucleophile. These modifications are not anticipated to have a significant impact on protein expression or function. In contrast, protein circularization by split-intein methods requires more extensive modifications of the expression construct, a necessity that may reduce protein expression or affect protein solubility. It should be noted, however, that the number of extra amino acid residues at the site of N- to-C-terminal ligation following excision of the large intein domains can be less than the five residues (LPXTG) that remain after circularization using sortase A.The sortase-catalyzed approach also provides additional levels of control over the ensuing transpeptidation reaction. This may be particularly useful for oligomeric species, such as the p97 example described here. Specifically, our modified p97 protein (G-His6-p97-LPSTG-XX) is produced in a form that is by itself unreactive. This allows protein expression and the subsequent assembly and purification of the hexamer to be completed first, without complications caused by premature covalent oligomerization. Cross-linking is then induced by the addition of sortase after the individual subunits have been correctly positioned in the hexameric ring. The extent of transpeptidation can be further controlled by inclusion of synthetic oligoglycine nucleophiles, either during the transpeptidation reaction or after transpeptidation is complete. The latter scenario even allows cyclization to be completely reversed. Incubating circular protein products with sortase in the presence of an oligoglycine nucleophile restores linearity to the protein product, because in the course of the initial cyclization reaction, the LPXTG motif is restored. An equilibrium between closed and open forms is thus established and can be driven toward the linear state by adding a large excess of the oligoglycine nucleophile.The implications of protein cyclization or oligomerization for protein engineering are numerous. In the case of protein oligomerization, the ability to link protein subunits held in a defined geometry might be exploited to explore subtle changes in intersubunit interactions upon substrate engagement or recruitment of binding partners. A more detailed examination of the reaction kinetics would be required to determine, for example, whether all subunits in the hexameric ring of p97 are equally good substrates or whether subunits that lie along the 3-fold axis preferentially cross-link to yield dimers. Although in the crystal structure (28.Davies J.M. Brunger A.T. Weis W.I. Structure. 2008; 16: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) all of the individual subunits appear identical, it remains to be determined whether this equivalency applies in solution as well. For cyclic proteins, there is compelling evidence that demonstrates improved stability of circularized proteins when compared with their linear counterparts (35.Iwai H. Lingel A. Pluckthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 36.Iwai H. Plückthun A.

The extension of protein cyclization to proteins of therapeutic value to improve the in vivo half-life has already been suggested (16.Parthasarathy R. Subramanian S. Boder E.T.

Science. 2006; 311: 1563-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and remains an exciting avenue for further research. Covalent closure of a protein through sortase-mediated circularization may also facilitate structural analysis of proteins whose flexible termini may interfere with crystallization. Sortases are bacterial enzymes that predominantly catalyze the attachment of surface proteins to the bacterial cell wall (1.Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 2.Paterson G.K. Mitchell T.J. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Other sortases polymerize pilin subunits for the construction of the covalently stabilized and covalently anchored pilus of the Gram-positive bacterium (3.Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P.

The reaction catalyzed by sortase involves the recognition of short 5-residue sequence motifs, which are cleaved by the enzyme with the concomitant formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate between the active site cysteine of sortase and the carboxylate at the newly generated C terminus of the substrate (1.Marraffini L.A.

In many bacteria, this covalent intermediate can be resolved by nucleophilic attack from the pentaglycine side chain in a peptidoglycan precursor, resulting in the formation of an amide bond between the pentaglycine side chain and the carboxylate at the cleavage site in the substrate (9.Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 10.Ton-That H. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

In pilus construction, alternative nucleophiles such as lysine residues or diaminopimelic acid participate in the transpeptidation reaction (3.Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P.

Using real-time in situ surface electron microscopy, we found that these droplets spontaneously run across the crystal surface. Running droplets have been seen in many systems, but they typically require special surface preparation or gradient forces. In contrast, we show that noncongruent evaporation automatically provides a driving force for running droplets. The motion is predicted and observed to slow and stop near a characteristic temperature, with the speed increasing both below and above this temperature.

Increasing iron content further enhances the anisotropy. This leads to at least 50% stronger elastic shear anisotropy of (Mg,Fe)O in the lowermost mantle compared to MgO, which is typically used in geodynamic modeling. Our results imply that ferropericlase is the dominant cause of seismic shear anisotropy in the lower mantle."

We investigated the S phase response at forks encountering a broken template (termed the terminal fork). We show that double-strand break (DSB) formation can locally trigger dormant origin firing. Irreversible fork resolution at the break does not impede progression of the other fork in the same replicon (termed the sister fork). The Mre11-Tel1/ATM response acts at terminal forks, preventing accumulation of cruciform DNA intermediates that tether sister chromatids and can undergo nucleolytic processing. We conclude that sister forks can be uncoupled during replication and that, after DSB-induced fork termination, replication is rescued by dormant origin firing or adjacent replicons. We have uncovered a Tel1/ATM- and Mre11-dependent response controlling terminal fork integrity. Our findings have implications for those genome instability syndromes that accumulate DNA breaks during S phase and for forks encountering eroding telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2050263063,"Numerous post-translational modifications have been identified in histones. Most of these occur within the histone tails, but a few have been identified within the histone core sequences. Histone core post-translational modifications have the potential to directly modulate nucleosome structure and consequently DNA accessibility. Here, we identify threonine 45 of histone H3 (H3T45) as a site of phosphorylation in vivo. We find that phosphorylation of H3T45 (H3T45ph) increases dramatically in apoptotic cells, around the time of DNA nicking. To further explore this connection, we analyzed human neutrophil cells because they are short-lived cells that undergo apoptosis in vivo. Freshly isolated neutrophils contain very little H3T45ph, whereas cells cultured for 20 h possess significant amounts; the kinetics of H3T45ph induction closely parallel those of caspase-3 activation. Cytokine inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis leads to reduced levels of H3T45ph. We identify protein kinase C-delta as the kinase responsible for H3T45ph in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2034298085,"Cholera toxin (CT) is a potent vaccine adjuvant, which promotes mucosal immunity to protein antigen given by nasal route. It has been suggested that CT promotes T helper type 2 (Th2) response and suppresses Th1 response. We here report the induction of Th17-dominated responses in mice by intranasal delivery of CT. This dramatic Th17-driving effect of CT, which was dependent on the B subunit, was observed even in Th1 or Th2-favored conditions of respiratory virus infection. These dominating Th17 responses resulted in the significant neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of mice given CT. Both in vitro and in vivo treatment of CT induced strongly augmented IL-6 production, and Th17-driving ability of CT was completely abolished in IL-6 knockout mice, indicating a role of this cytokine in the Th17-dominated T-cell responses by CT. These data demonstrate a novel Th17-driving activity of CT, and help understand the mechanisms of CT adjuvanticity to demarcate T helper responses."
https://openalex.org/W2059289119,"Estradiol may fulfill a plethora of functions in neurons, in which much of its activity is associated with its capacity to directly bind and dimerize estrogen receptors. This hormone-protein complex can either bind directly to estrogen response elements (ERE's) in gene promoters, or it may act as a cofactor at non-ERE sites interacting with other DNA-binding elements such as AP-1 or c-Jun. Many of the neuroprotective effects described for estrogen have been associated with this mode of action. However, recent evidence suggests that in addition to these ""genomic effects"", estrogen may also act as a more general ""trophic factor"" triggering cytoplasmic signals and extending the potential activity of this hormone. We demonstrated that estrogen receptor alpha associates with beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 in the brain and in neurons, which has since been confirmed by others. Here, we show that the action of estradiol activates beta-catenin transcription in neuroblastoma cells and in primary cortical neurons. This activation is time and concentration-dependent, and it may be abolished by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780. The transcriptional activation of beta-catenin is dependent on lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF-1) and a truncated-mutant of LEF-1 almost completely blocks estradiol TCF-mediated transcription. Transcription of a TCF-reporter in a transgenic mouse model is enhanced by estradiol in a similar fashion to that produced by Wnt3a. In addition, activation of a luciferase reporter driven by the engrailed promoter with three LEF-1 repeats was mediated by estradiol. We established a cell line that constitutively expresses a dominant-negative LEF-1 and it was used in a gene expression microarray analysis. In this way, genes that respond to estradiol or Wnt3a, sensitive to LEF-1, could be identified and validated. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of a new signaling pathway controlled by estradiol in neurons. This pathway shares some elements of the insulin-like growth factor-1/Insulin and Wnt signaling pathways, however, our data strongly suggest that it is different from that of both these ligands. These findings may reveal a set of new physiological roles for estrogens, at least in the Central Nervous System (CNS)."
https://openalex.org/W2078152971,"Recent studies have ascribed many non-pumping functions to the Na/K-ATPase. We show here that graded knockdown of cellular Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit produces a parallel decrease in both caveolin-1 and cholesterol in light fractions of LLC-PK1 cell lysates. This observation is further substantiated by imaging analyses, showing redistribution of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments in the knockdown cells. Moreover, this regulation is confirmed in α1+/– mouse liver. Functionally, the knockdown-induced redistribution appears to affect the cholesterol sensing in the endoplasmic reticulum, because it activates the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway and increases expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein receptor in the liver. Consistently, we detect a modest increase in hepatic cholesterol as well as a reduction in the plasma cholesterol. Mechanistically, α1+/– livers show increases in cellular Src and ERK activity and redistribution of caveolin-1. Although activation of Src is not required in Na/K-ATPase-mediated regulation of cholesterol distribution, the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and caveolin-1 is important for this regulation. Taken together, our new findings demonstrate a novel function of the Na/K-ATPase in control of the plasma membrane cholesterol distribution. Moreover, the data also suggest that the plasma membrane Na/K-ATPase-caveolin-1 interaction may represent an important sensing mechanism by which the cells regulate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway.

Moreover, the data also suggest that the plasma membrane Na/K-ATPase-caveolin-1 interaction may represent an important sensing mechanism by which the cells regulate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway. The Na/K-ATPase, also called the sodium pump, is an ion transporter that mediates active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP (1Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 2Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional sodium pump is mainly composed of α and β subunits. The α subunit is the catalytic component of the holoenzyme; it contains both the nucleotide and the cation binding sites (3James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A.

So far, four isoforms of α subunit have been discovered, and each one shows a distinct tissue distribution pattern (4Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, we have demonstrated that more than half of the Na/K-ATPase may actually perform cellular functions other than ion pumping at least in LLC-PK1 cells (11Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Moreover, the non-pumping pool of Na/K-ATPase mainly resides in caveolae and interacts with a variety of proteins such as Src, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and caveolin-1 (12Tian J. Cai T.

While the interaction between Na/K-ATPase and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor facilitates Ca2+ signaling (13Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) the dynamic association between Na/K-ATPase and Src appears to be an essential step for ouabain to stimulate cellular kinases (15Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). More recently, we report that the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and caveolin-1 plays an important role for the membrane trafficking of caveolin-1. Knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase leads to altered subcellular distribution of caveolin-1 and increases the mobility of caveolin-1-containing vesicles (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Caveolin is a protein marker for caveolae (17Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Caveolae are flask-shaped vesicular invaginations of plasma membrane and are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sphingomyelin (18Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). There are three genes and six isoforms of caveolin. Caveolin-1 is a 22-kDa protein and is expressed in many types of cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells. In addition to their role in biogenesis of caveolae (19Parton R.G. Hanzal-Bayer M. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), accumulating evidence has implicated caveolin proteins in cellular cholesterol homeostasis (20Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). For instance, caveolin-1 directly binds to cholesterol in a 1:1 ratio (21Murata M. Peranen J.

It was also found to be an integral member of the intracellular cholesterol trafficking machinery between internal membranes and plasma membrane (22Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knockout of caveolin-1 significantly affected cholesterol metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse peritoneal macrophages (25Frank P.G. Cheung M.W. Pavlides S. Llaverias G. Park D.S. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because we found that the Na/K-ATPase regulates cellular distribution of caveolin-1, we propose that it may also affect intracellular cholesterol distribution and metabolism. To test our hypothesis, we have investigated whether sodium pump α1 knockdown affects cholesterol distribution and metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that sodium pump α1 expression level plays a role in the proper distribution of intracellular cholesterol. Down-regulation of sodium pump α1 not only redistributes cholesterol between the plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments, but also alters cholesterol metabolism in mice.

The relative level of Na/K-ATPase α1 in control, α1 knockdown, and rescued cell lines is listed in Table 1. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 1 μg/ml puromycin in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. After cells reached 90% confluence, they were serum-starved for 12 h and used for experiments unless indicated otherwise.TABLE 1Sodium pump expression level in different LLC-PK1 derived cell linesCell lineNa+/K+-ATPase α1 subunitContent (%)P-11100 ← negative control cellA4-1140 ← knockdown cellPY-1710 ← knockdown cellAAC-19100 ← rescued cell Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—The rat α1 pump-null mutant (D371N) was generated as previously described (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When the Na/K-ATPase α1 knockdown cells reached ∼70% confluence, they were transfected with the plasmid or an empty vector by Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 6 h after transfection. Experimental Animal—Na/K-ATPase α1+/+ and α1+/– mice were generated as previously described (3James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was obtained from tail biopsies and used for PCR-based genotyping. Adult mice at 16∼20 weeks were used for the study. All mice were kept in a 12-h dark/light cycle and fed standard chow ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Toledo, Health Science Campus. Phenotypic Analysis—Following a 4-h fast, mice were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg). The animal was weighed before the abdominal cavity was opened, and whole liver organ was carefully dissected and weighed. The live weight/body weight ratio was calculated. Subsequently, liver tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for cholesterol assay and Western blot analysis. Meanwhile, blood was drawn from the inferior vena cava, stored on ice for 20∼30 min, and centrifuged at 2800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (plasma) was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and sent to the University Medical Center immediately for plasma lipid profile analysis. Purification of Caveolin-rich Membrane Fractions—Caveolin-rich membrane fractions were obtained via sucrose gradient fractionation as described previously (14Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The cell lysates were homogenized by a Polytron tissue grinder (three 6-s bursts) and subjected to sonication (three 40-s bursts). The homogenates were then adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm Mes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5) and placed at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes. The ultracentrifuge tubes were then loaded with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Twelve gradient fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top to the bottom. Among the fractions, fraction 4 and 5 were combined and diluted with 4 ml of MBS, then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman type 65 rotor for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of MBS and is considered as caveolin-enriched caveolar fraction. Separation of Cytosol and Cellular Membrane—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 2 ml of sucrose buffer A (30 mm histidine, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA-Na, pH 7.4). The cell lysates were homogenized by a Polytron tissue grinder (three 6-s bursts) and subjected to sonication (three 40-s bursts). Then cell lysates were transferred to a 15-ml Falcon centrifuge tube and subjected to centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and were centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman type 65 rotor for 1 h. The supernatants (taken as cytosol fraction), were collected in the Eppendorf tubes. The pellets, taken as the membrane fraction, were resuspended in 250 μl of buffer A. Western Blot Analysis and Immunostaining of Caveolin-1—Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured by Protein Assay Kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Cell lysates with equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto the gel and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Optitran membrane, and probed with corresponding antibodies. Protein signals were detected with an ECL kit and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. Immunostaining of caveolin-1 was performed as previously described (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cholesterol Assay—Cholesterol was measured by Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the signals were detected by a microplate spectrofluorometer (excitation: 560 nm; cut off: 570 nm; emission: 590 nm). Filipin Staining—Filipin staining was performed as described before (28Carozzi A.J. Ikonen E. Lindsay M.R. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Filipin signals were viewed by a fluorescence microscope with a UV filter. Data Analysis—Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase α1 Redistributes Both Caveolin-1 and Cholesterol—We previously reported that the Na/K-ATPase α1 was concentrated in caveolae and interacted dynamically with caveolin-1 in LLC-PK1 cells (14Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, knockdown of the α1 increased the mobility of caveolin-1, resulting in decreases in the number of caveolae and the amount of caveolin-1 in the plasma membrane (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because cholesterol plays an important role in regulation of the mobility of caveolin-1 and the formation of caveolae, we reasoned that knockdown of the α1 might also alter the membrane distribution of cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, cell lysates were fractionated using a detergent-free and carbonate-based density gradient fractionation procedure (14Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The low density fractions 4/5 prepared from the control LLC-PK1 cells contained ∼50% of caveolin-1, and the Na/K-ATPase α1 and was taken as caveolin-1-enriched caveolar fraction (Fig. 1A) (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consistent with what was reported in the literature (30Sampson L.J. Hayabuchi Y. Standen N.B. Dart C. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), this caveolar fraction also contained >50% of total cellular cholesterol (Fig. 1B). When caveolin-1, Na/K-ATPase α1, and cholesterol content were measured in this fraction prepared from different cell lines, we found that the Na/K-ATPase knockdown caused an α1 amount-dependent decrease in both caveolin-1 and cholesterol (Fig. 1C). Although cholesterol in A4–11 cells showed a 20% reduction in comparison to that in control cells, a 35% decrease was recorded in PY-17 cells. Moreover, when PY-17 cells were rescued by knocking in a rat α1, we found that expression of rat α1 was sufficient to restore both caveolin-1 and cholesterol content (Fig. 1C). Finally, when total cellular cholesterol was measured in different cell lines, we found no difference among these cell lines (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that the Na/K-ATPase plays an important role in maintaining the plasma membrane pool of both caveolin-1 and cholesterol in LLC-PK1 cells and that knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase likely redistributes cholesterol from the plasma membrane to other cellular compartments. Knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase α1 Redistributes Cholesterol from the Plasma Membrane to the Cytosolic Compartments—To further confirm the above observation, we investigated cellular distribution of cholesterol using a fluorescent cholesterol probe, filipin, in both control (P-11) and the knockdown (PY-17) cells. In P-11 cells, a majority of filipin signals (which labels non-esterified cholesterol) were detected in the plasma membrane. Weak signals were also detected in the perinuclear region and in the form of intracellular vesicles (as indicated by arrows) (Fig. 2A). These findings are consistent with what has been reported in the literature (31Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When compared, PY-17 cells exhibited weaker plasma membrane filipin signals. This is in accordance with the results depicted in Fig. 1. Concomitantly, increases in filipin labeling were noted in the perinuclear region in PY-17 cells. Moreover, PY-17 cells contained many vesicles that were strongly labeled with filipin (as indicated by the arrows) (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the above studies indicate that knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase redistributed cholesterol from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles as well as the perinuclear region. To test whether cholesterol is redistributed from light caveolar fraction (fraction 4/5) to higher density membrane fractions, we fractionated the cell lysates as in Fig. 1. Afterward, the caveolar fraction (4/5) and non-caveolar fractions (6Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

The membrane pellets were collected and subjected to cholesterol measurement. Interestingly, no changes in cholesterol content were detected in the combined non-caveolar fractions in the α1 knockdown cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that the plasma membrane cholesterol must be redistributed to cellular compartments (e.g. vesicles) that are too light to be pelleted down by 100,000 × g × 60 min. To further test this postulate, we separated the cell lysates from the control and Na/K-ATPase knockdown cells into two fractions, namely the crude membrane pellet and the cytosol fraction obtained after 100,000 × g × 60-min centrifugation. When cholesterol was measured in these two fractions, we detected a decrease in cholesterol in the membrane faction (Fig. 3A) and a concomitant increase in the cytosol cholesterol (Fig. 3B) in cell lysates prepared from the knockdown cells. As expected, the differences in cholesterol distribution among these cells became more obvious when ratios of cytosol over membrane cholesterol were calculated and compared, especially in the case of A4–11 cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the findings depicted in Fig. 1, knocking in a rat α1 was sufficient to restore the cytosol and membrane cholesterol to a level comparable to that in the control P-11 cells (Fig. 3). Taken together, these studies provided further support to the notion that knockdown of cellular Na/K-ATPase redistributed cholesterol from the plasma membrane to other cellular compartments. The findings also demonstrated that this centrifugation analysis can be used to detect the Na/K-ATPase-mediated cholesterol redistribution. The Interaction between Na/K-ATPase and Caveolin-1, but Not Src, Is Involved in Control of Plasma Membrane Cholesterol Distribution—The Na/K-ATPase interacts and keeps Src in an inactive state and knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase increases basal Src activity and consequently the activity of ERK1/2 (26Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is known that Src and ERK1/2 play an important role in regulation of cholesterol synthesis (32Sun Y. Ma Y.C. Huang J. Chen K.Y. McGarrigle D.K. Huang X.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14455-14462Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Abidi P. Zhang F. Li C. Liu J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 16: 779-785PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Src is involved in regulation of caveolin-1 trafficking (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether inhibition of Src by PP2 would restore the normal cellular distribution of cholesterol. As previously reported, exposure of PY-17 cells to 1 μm PP2 for 2 h was sufficient to restore cellular Src and reduce the mobility of caveolin-1 vesicle (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, it failed to change intracellular cholesterol distribution in either control P-11 cells or PY-17 cells when the cytosol/membrane ratios were calculated and compared (Fig. 4A). It is known that caveolin-1 directly binds cholesterol and affects cholesterol trafficking. Because the Na/K-ATPase knockdown changes cellular distribution of caveolin-1, we reasoned that the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and caveolin-1 could be important for cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane. To test this postulation, we first determined the effect of caveolin-1 knockdown on intracellular cholesterol distribution. Caveolin-1 knockdown cell line C2–9 was generated as previously described using small interference RNA (14Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 4B, these cells express ∼20% of caveolin-1 in comparison to that in control P-11 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of caveolin-1, like Na/K-ATPase knockdown, significantly increased the cytosol/membrane ratio of cholesterol (Fig. 4C). In accordance, filipin staining showed an accumulation of cytosolic cholesterol vesicles with a concomitant decrease in the plasma membrane cholesterol in C2–9 cells (Fig. 2C). To further test the role of Na/K-ATPase-caveolin-1 interaction, we repeated the above experiments in PY-17 cells rescued by a caveolin-binding motif mutant (mCBM) rat α1. The α1 subunit contains a highly conserved caveolin-binding motif at the N terminus. The mCBM rat α1 was generated by mutating two of the aromatic amino acid residues in the binding motif to Ala (F97A and F100A). We showed previously that these mutations abolished the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and caveolin-1 (16Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2, expression of mCBM rat α1 (Fig. 2E), unlike the expression of wild-type rat α1 (Fig. 2D), failed to reduce the vesicular cholesterol staining. Consistently, it also did not restore the cytosol/membrane cholesterol ratio (Fig. 4C). To seek further support and test whether the N terminus of α1 can function as a dominant negative mutant, we transfected LLC-PK1 cells with a YFP-tagged N terminus (amino acids 1–160) of α1 (NT-YFP) and generated a stable cell line (27Chen Y.

Site-directed mutagenesis of surface-located lysine residues (SENK252 + 255A, SENK304A, SENK334A, SENK344E, SENK435L, and SENΔ434–435) was used to examine their roles in maintaining structural integrity, enzymatic function, and plasminogen binding. Structural integrity of the GAS SEN octamer was retained for all mutants except SENK344E, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and MS. However, ion mobility MS revealed distinct differences in the stability of several mutant octamers in comparison with wild type. Enzymatic analysis indicated that SENK344E had lost α-enolase activity, which was also reduced in SENK334A and SENΔ434–435. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that the capacity to bind human plasminogen was abolished in SENK252 + 255A, SENK435L, and SENΔ434–435.

The plasminogen activation system in humans is an important and highly regulated process that is responsible for breakdown of extracellular matrix components, dissolution of blood clots, and cell migration (20Parry M.A. Zhang X.C.

Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Plasminogen is a 92-kDa zymogen that circulates in human plasma at a concentration of 2 μm (22Danø K. Andreasen P.A. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). It consists of a binding region of five homologous triple loop kringle domains and an N-terminal serine protease domain that flank the Arg561–Val562 site (23Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), where it is cleaved by tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator to yield the active protease plasmin (20Parry M.A. Zhang X.C.

Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). GAS also has the ability to activate human plasminogen by secreting the virulence determinant streptokinase. Streptokinase forms stable complexes with plasminogen or plasmin, both of which exhibit plasmin activity (20Parry M.A. Zhang X.C. Bode I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Reddy K.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of plasminogen by the plasmin(ogen)-streptokinase complex circumvents regulation by the host plasminogen activation inhibitors, α2-antiplasmin and α2-macroglobulin (11Kuusela P. Ullberg M.

GAS can bind the plasmin(ogen)-streptokinase complex and/or plasmin(ogen) directly via plasmin(ogen) receptors at the bacterial cell surface (6Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These receptors include the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM) (25Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol.

Interactions with these GAS receptors occurs via lysine-binding sites within the kringle domains of plasminogen (6Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to bind human plasminogen, SEN is primarily the glycolytic enzyme that converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (27Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14503-14515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Pancholi V. Cell. Mol.

SEN is abundantly expressed in the cytosol of most bacterial species but has also been identified as a surface-located protein in GAS and other bacteria including pneumococci, despite lacking classical cell surface protein motifs such as a signal sequence, membrane-spanning domain, or cell-wall anchor motif (27Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14503-14515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Pancholi V. Cell. Mol.

The interaction between SEN and plasminogen is reported to be facilitated by the two C-terminal lysine residues at positions 434 and 435 (27Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14503-14515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 32Derbise A. Song Y.P. Parikh S. Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, an internal binding motif containing lysines at positions 252 and 255 in the closely related α-enolase of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to play a pivotal role in the acquisition of plasminogen in this bacterial species (33Bergmann S. Wild D. Diekmann O. Frank R. Bracht D. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The octameric pneumococcal α-enolase structure consists of a tetramer of dimers. Hence, potential binding sites could be buried in the interface between subunits. In fact, the crystal structure of S. pneumoniae α-enolase revealed that the two C-terminal lysine residues are significantly less exposed than the internal plasminogen-binding motif (34Ehinger S. Schubert W.D. Bergmann S. Hammerschmidt S. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed an in silico model of GAS SEN, based on the pneumococcal octameric α-enolase crystal structure, and validated this model using ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry (MS). Site-directed mutagenesis followed by structural and functional analyses revealed that Lys344 plays a crucial role in structural integrity and enzymatic function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the plasminogen-binding motif residues Lys252 and Lys255 and the C-terminal Lys434 and Lys435 residues are located adjacently in the GAS SEN structure and play a concerted role in the binding of human plasminogen. The pET14bSEN expression vector encoding an N-terminal His6-tagged SEN cloned from the M6 GAS strain D471 (32Derbise A. Song Y.P. Parikh S. Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used to construct site-directed mutants. Mutants SENK435Land SENΔ434–435 were as described previously (32Derbise A. Song Y.P. Parikh S. Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lysine residues of interest within SEN were substituted with either alanine or glutamic acid by QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), using primers listed in supplemental Table S1 and methods previously described (8Sanderson-Smith M.L. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis was used to confirm introduced mutations using primers given in supplemental Table S1, and sequence reactions were performed using Terminator-ready reaction mix (Applied Biosystems) and methods described elsewhere (8Sanderson-Smith M.L. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and sequence data were analyzed using Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing analysis software v 5.2 (Applied Biosystems). pET14bSEN and SEN mutant constructs were transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 STAR (DE3) cells and grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6. Expression was conducted as described previously (35Cole J.N. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Cork A.J. Henningham A. Conlan F. Ranson M. McArthur J.D. Walker M.J. Hakenbeck R. Chhatwal G.S.

The pure proteins were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, and protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Mass spectra were acquired on a Waters Q-ToF Ultima mass spectrometer, which had been modified for high mass operation (36Benesch J.L. Ruotolo B.T. Sobott F. Wildgoose J. Gilbert A. Bateman R. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using a nanoESI source. 2 μl of a solution of each protein in 200 mm NH4OAc (concentrations ranged from 3 to 8 μm, as monomer) were electrosprayed from gold-coated glass capillaries prepared in-house. Q-ToF instrument conditions included a capillary potential of 1.5 kV; cone, 140 V; radio frequency lens 1, 80 V; collision cell, 4 V; transport and aperture, 5 V, and the microchannel plate detector was set to 1,750 V. Collision cell gas pressure was adjusted to 3 × 10−2 mbar to provide sufficient collisional cooling to preserve non-covalent interactions and maintain the proteins in their native conformation. All spectra were externally calibrated using a cesium iodide spectrum and reference file and processed using MassLynxTM software. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry was performed on a Synapt HDMSTM system (Waters) (37Pringle S.D. Giles K. Wildgoose J.L. Williams J.P. Slade S.E. Thalassinos K. Bateman R.H. Bowers M.T. Scrivens J.H. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 261: 1-12Crossref Scopus (652) Google Scholar), fitted with a 32,000 m/z quadrupole. Nanoelectrospray spectra were acquired using previously described protocols (38Ruotolo B.T. Benesch J.L. Sandercock A.M. Hyung S.J. Robinson C.V. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The following voltages were used: capillary, 1.65 kV; sample cone, 40 V, “trap collision energy,” 10 V; “transfer collision energy,” 10 V; and a 0–30-V wave-height ramp in the drift cell. The gases used were nitrogen and argon in the T-Wave IM separator and collision cells, respectively. The pressures in the various stages were the following: backing, 4.5 mbar; trap, 6.2 × 10−2 mbar; IM, 0.44 mbar; and ToF, 1.6 × 10−6 mbar. Data were processed using MassLynx software, and the MS dimension was calibrated externally. All spectra are shown here with minimal smoothing, linear intensity scales, and no background subtraction. The collision cross-section for wild-type protein was measured using a previously described approach (39Giles K. Wildgoose J. Langridge D. 56th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry, Denver, Colorado, June 1–5, 2008. American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM2008Google Scholar). Sequence searches using BLAST (40Johnson M. Zaretskaya I. Raytselis Y. Merezhuk Y. McGinnis S. Madden T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W5-W9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) identified α-enolase from S. pneumoniae as the protein with a known three-dimensional structure most closely related to GAS SEN (93% identity at the amino acid level). The octameric biological unit of S. pneumoniae α-enolase was constructed using crystal symmetry operators with the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). This octameric structure was then used to model the structure of GAS SEN with the program Modeler (41Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; 2 (Unit 2.9)PubMed Google Scholar). The model with the best Modeler objective function was selected. The model presented comprises eight copies of GAS SEN residues 1–435. Theoretical collision cross-sections were calculated as described previously (38Ruotolo B.T. Benesch J.L. Sandercock A.M. Hyung S.J. Robinson C.V. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) using the projection approximation of Mobcal software (42Mesleh M.F. Hunter J.M. Shvartsburg A.A. Schatz G.C. Jarrold M.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 16082-16086Crossref Scopus (857) Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained on a JASCO J-810 CD spectropolarimeter at room temperature as described previously (43Morris A.M. Treweek T.M. Aquilina J.A. Carver J.A. Walker M.J. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 5885-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of the spectra to estimate secondary structure was achieved using the CDSSTR program (44Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar) in the DICHROWEB Online Circular Dichroism Analysis suite (45Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Data from the 240–190-nm region with a data interval of 1 nm were used with Reference Set 4 optimized for this region. The catalytic activity of the SEN mutants was compared with the wild-type protein by measuring the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The reaction was performed essentially as described previously (32Derbise A. Song Y.P. Parikh S. Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The circulating form of human plasminogen (Glu-plasminogen) was purified from human plasma using lysine-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as described previously (46Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glu-plasminogen was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, and protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The binding of recombinant wild-type and mutant SEN proteins to Glu-plasminogen was measured using a BIAcore T100 optical biosensor (GE Healthcare). Glu-plasminogen (14.93 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) was coupled at 10 μl min−1 (7 min) onto N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide-activated CM5 sensor chips to yield 10,200 response units of bound protein. Binding of SEN proteins was done at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P20, using a flow rate of 30 μl min−1. Association and dissociation times were 500 and 600 s, respectively. Affinity surfaces were regenerated between SEN injections with 10 mm glycine·HCl, pH 1.5 (60 s at 10 μl min−1) followed by 4 m MgCl2 (60 s at 5 μl min−1). Kinetic models could not suitably fit the data using the Biacore T100 evaluation software, likely due to the large molecular size of the SEN analytes and consequent mass transfer rate limitations, so the relative abilities of SEN variants to bind plasminogen were assessed qualitatively. Binding was assayed in quadruplicate, through two different flow cells and on two independently prepared sensor chips; relative binding responses for mutant and wild-type SENs were consistently observed. Ligand blot analysis of recombinant SEN proteins incubated with human Glu-plasminogen (5 μg ml−1) was performed as described previously (46Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human plasminogen diluted 1:500 and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:1000 were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The structure of wild-type SEN was examined by means of in silico modeling, MS, and far-UV CD spectroscopy. We first constructed an in silico model of octameric GAS SEN (Fig. 1A) based on the known crystal structure of S. pneumoniae α-enolase (34Ehinger S. Schubert W.D. Bergmann S. Hammerschmidt S. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The theoretical collision cross-section for this homology-modeled octamer was calculated to be 12,100 Å2. This was achieved by using Mobcal software (42Mesleh M.F. Hunter J.M. Shvartsburg A.A. Schatz G.C. Jarrold M.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 16082-16086Crossref Scopus (857) Google Scholar), modified for modeling large protein assemblies (38Ruotolo B.T. Benesch J.L. Sandercock A.M. Hyung S.J. Robinson C.V. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Briefly, this approach uses the atomic structure without coarse graining and assumes free tumbling of the protein in the gas phase, thereby resulting in a rotationally averaged collision cross-section. To characterize GAS α-enolase, we expressed and purified the wild-type protein utilizing a His6 tag at the N terminus. MS of SEN under conditions where preservation of the native state non-covalent assembly is favored (48Benesch J.L. Robinson C.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) exhibited a series of peaks in the range 8,600–10,200 m/z, corresponding to 46+ through 39+ charge states of SEN. Transformation to a mass scale (Fig. 1B, inset) gave an estimated mass of 395.9 kDa, corresponding well with the predicted mass of the octamer (394.9 kDa). IM-MS data for wild-type SEN were acquired using traveling wave-based separation and revealed drift times for the three major ions of 14.8 (44+), 15.7 (43+), and 16.9 ms (42+) (Fig. 1C). Determining collision cross-sections for such traveling wave IM-MS data is not currently possible without calibration; therefore, we employed an alternative strategy based on measuring the minimum wave height at which ions are pushed the length of the cell by the first wave (39Giles K. Wildgoose J. Langridge D. 56th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry, Denver, Colorado, June 1–5, 2008. American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM2008Google Scholar). From this direct measurement of collision cross-section, we obtained a value of 12,800 ± 580 Å2 for octameric wild-type SEN (mean of the four principal charge states, ±two standard deviations). A CD spectrum of wild-type SEN showed minima at 222 and 209 nm, indicating a primarily α-helical secondary structure (Fig. 1D). Deconvolution of the CD spectrum suggested that the structure contains ∼48% α-helix, which correlates well with the 42% helical content of the in silico model (Fig. 1A). We next undertook functional analysis of purified SEN to determine the enzymatic activity and ability to bind human plasminogen. The α-enolase activity of SEN (conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate) was measured spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. The initial rate of phosphoenolpyruvate formation for wild-type SEN was 0.123 μmol min−1 μg−1 of recombinant protein (Fig. 1E). Surface plasmon resonance was used to demonstrate the plasminogen binding ability of SEN in a qualitative way. Human Glu-plasminogen was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip using amine-coupling chemistry, and 100 nm SEN (as monomer) was made to flow over the surface. As expected for such a large analyte molecule, SEN binding occurred at a slow rate that was limited by mass transfer and made to dissociate slowly (Fig. 1F). Site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken to examine the role of selected lysine residues in the structural integrity and function of GAS SEN. Lysine residues for analysis were chosen based on their known role in plasminogen binding by GAS SEN (SENK435L and SENΔ434–435) (32Derbise A. Song Y.P. Parikh S. Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or S. pneumoniae α-enolase (SENK252 + 255A) (33Bergmann S. Wild D. Diekmann O. Frank R. Bracht D. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), on their implication in α-enolase secretion (SENK344E) (49Boël G. Pichereau V. Mijakovic I. Mazé A. Poncet S. Gillet S. Giard J.C. Hartke A. Auffray Y. Deutscher J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or on being otherwise located in the C-terminal domain of the GAS SEN monomer (SENK304A and SENK334A). Each of these lysine residues was predicted to be surface-exposed in the structural model of the GAS SEN monomer (supplemental Fig. S1). All of the purified mutant proteins except for SENK344E were found to retain the full α-helical content of the wild-type protein, as deduced from the intensities of minima at 222 and 209 nm in their CD spectra (Fig. 2A). ESI-MS spectra showed that aside from minor shifts in the charge state distributions due to the replacement or removal of lysine residues, all mutants retained the octameric structural characteristic of wild-type SEN (Fig. 2, B and C). SENK344E however, was clearly present in two additional multimeric forms, as evidenced by the peak series interspersed within those arising from the octamer, as well as a pair of charge states at considerably lower values of 3,800–4,200 m/z. A careful examination of these charge state series revealed that the SENK344E octamer was partially dissociated in solution into heptamers, hexamers, and monomers. Significantly, this appeared to be a sol"
https://openalex.org/W2017481021,"On 1 April 2007 a great, tsunamigenic earthquake (moment magnitude 8.1) ruptured the Solomon Islands subduction zone at the triple junction where the Australia and Solomon Sea-Woodlark Basin plates simultaneously underthrust the Pacific plate with different slip directions. The associated abrupt change in slip direction during the great earthquake drove convergent anelastic deformation of the upper Pacific plate, which generated localized uplift in the forearc above the subducting Simbo fault, potentially amplifying local tsunami amplitude. Elastic deformation during the seismic cycle appears to be primarily accommodated by the overriding Pacific forearc. This earthquake demonstrates the seismogenic potential of extremely young subducting oceanic lithosphere, the ability of ruptures to traverse substantial geologic boundaries, and the consequences of complex coseismic slip for uplift and tsunamigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027797460,"LINGO-1 is a component of the tripartite receptor complexes, which act as a convergent mediator of the intracellular signaling in response to myelin-associated inhibitors and lead to collapse of growth cone and inhibition of neurite extension. Although the function of LINGO-1 has been intensively studied, its downstream signaling remains elusive. In the present study, a novel interaction between LINGO-1 and a serine-threonine kinase WNK1 was identified by yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction was further validated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, and this interaction was intensified by Nogo66 treatment. Morphological evidences showed that WNK1 and LINGO-1 were co-localized in cortical neurons. Furthermore, either suppressing WNK1 expression by RNA interference or overexpression of WNK1-(123-510) attenuated Nogo66-induced inhibition of neurite extension and inhibited the activation of RhoA. Moreover, WNK1 was identified to interact with Rho-GDI1, and this interaction was attenuated by Nogo66 treatment, further indicating its regulatory effect on RhoA activation. Taken together, our results suggest that WNK1 is a novel signaling molecule involved in regulation of LINGO-1 mediated inhibition of neurite extension."

A common function of Cdc48 is the ATP-coupled disassembly of protein complexes and segregation of proteins from their binding partners (14Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem.

An example is the extraction of misfolded polyubiquitinated proteins from the cytosolic side of the ER membrane to deliver them to the proteasome for degradation (ERAD) (2Kostova Z. Wolf D.H.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In yeast, Npl4 does not contain a zinc finger domain, leaving Ufd1 as the ubiquitin-binding protein (21Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Npl4 binds Cdc48 via a UBX-related UBD domain, whereas Ufd1 binds Cdc48 via a BS1 domain (21Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only one protomer of the homohexameric AAA ATPase Cdc48 is occupied by Ufd1-Npl4 (16Pye V.E. Beuron F. Keetch C.A. McKeown C. Robinson C.V. Meyer H.H. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Proc.

Unoccupied protomers of Cdc48 can bind additional cofactors like Ubx2, an ER membrane protein facing both termini to the cytosol (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Ubx2 contains an N-terminal UBA domain and a C-terminal UBX domain, which recruits the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex to the ER membrane. Thereby it links the Cdc48 complex to E3 ligases and misfolded substrates that appear on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. The UBX domain is a general motif that binds to the N-terminal domain of Cdc48 (24Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Shp1 (Ubx1) is another UBX protein that functions together with Cdc48 in membrane fusion disassembling SNARE complexes (25Latterich M. Fröhlich K.U. Schekman R.

The function of the additional five UBX domain-containing proteins in yeast (Ubx3-Ubx7) is not well characterized. Ubx4, Ubx6, and Ubx7 as well as Shp1 (Ubx1) and Ubx2 are known to be involved in the degradation of the artificial substrate ubiquitin-proline-β-galactosidase (27Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M.

Ubx4, Ubx6, and Ubx7 were also found to function in meiosis (27Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the function of the protein Ubx4. We show that Ubx4 is required for the continuous degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins of the ERAD pathway. With truncated forms of Ubx4 we identified the UBX domain to be crucial for this degradation event. In addition, in a UBX4-deleted strain, we found increased amounts of polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins bound to the Cdc48 complex in the cytoplasm and at membranes. Our data indicate a function of Ubx4 in the release of polyubiquitinated material from the Cdc48 complex. endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated degradation dithiothreitol hemagglutinin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.

Epitope tagging of YSA14, YCR14, YSA27, YSA28, and YSA29 with Myc9 or HA3 tags was done as described (33Gauss R. Trautwein M. Sommer T. Spang A.

Cells were then diluted to 1 OD600 in the same medium, and dilution series of each culture (1:10) was prepared in a 96-well plate. 4 μl of cell culture were then spotted onto plates with a 48-prong replica-plating device. Plates were incubated for 2–4 days at 30 °C or as indicated. For precipitation of CPY* in pulse-chase analysis, polyclonal anti-CPY antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) was used, and for immunodetection monoclonal CPY antibody (Molecular Probes) was used. c-Myc was detected using specific antibody (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ubiquitin and HA epitopes were detected using specific antibodies (clone P4G7 and clone 16B12, Covance). Antibody against Pgk1 was from Molecular Probes. Der3/Hrd1 was detected using a polyclonal antibody, which was described (37Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Sec61 and Cdc48 antibody were gifts from T. Sommer. Pulse-chase experiments of CPY* and Ste6*-HA were carried out essentially as described (36Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Buschhorn B.A. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Diagrams represent data of up to five independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the respective S.E. The procedure to perform cycloheximide chase experiments was described previously (36Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed according to standard protocols (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). 60 OD cells (OD600 = 1.0) were spheroblasted in sorbitol buffer (1 m sorbitol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) with 20 μl of Oxalyticase (stock, 5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroblasted cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm Pipes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) in a Wheaton homogenizer. After preclearing at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the cell extract was incubated with lysis buffer or lysis buffer containing 0.6 m KOAc, 2 m urea, 1% Triton X-100 or 0.5% SDS, respectively. After incubation for 30 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate them into a pellet (P) and a soluble (S) fraction. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were essentially performed as described (23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 39Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) except for the following treatments. For cell lysis 150 OD of cells were taken. The lysates of the digitonin-solubilized membranes of the washed pellet fractions were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation. Standard methods for SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodecoration were used (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Cdc48 has functions in a variety of different cellular processes like cell cycle regulation, activation of transcription factors, and homotypic membrane fusion. As Cdc48 is also a central component of the ERAD machinery, we were interested whether additional Ubx proteins other than Ubx2 play a role in the ERAD pathway. We constructed yeast strains in the W303 prc1-1 background expressing CPY* and deleted for UBX1 to UBX7, respectively. In these strains we looked for sensitivity toward different stress situations. Shp1 (Ubx1) is required for growth of cells at elevated temperature (28Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown for Shp1, a strain deleted in UBX4 also exhibits a sensitivity toward elevated temperature (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we observed hypersensitivity of the Δubx4 strain toward cycloheximide and dithiothreitol (DTT) that was even stronger than for the Δshp1 strain (Fig. 1A). Only when exposed to heat stress at 37 °C was the growth of the Δshp1 strain more disturbed than for the Δubx4 strain. These data indicate a strong link of UBX4 to stress tolerance and proteasomal degradation. In particular, the sensitivity of the Δubx4 strain to the reducing agent DTT points to a disturbed degradation of misfolded proteins of the ER. A multitude of newly synthesized secretory proteins receive disulfide bonds in the ER and are therefore structurally highly sensitive to reducing agents such as DTT. Indeed, the hypersensitivity of strains deleted in UBX2 for DTT (Fig. 1A) underlines the discovered function of Ubx2 in the degradation of misfolded proteins of the ER (ERAD) (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed DTT sensitivity of Δubx4 mutants also points to a participation of Ubx4 in ERAD (Fig. 1A). A double deletion mutant defective in UBX2 and UBX4 shows a somewhat stronger growth phenotype on all media tested. For analysis of which of the Ubx-cofactor proteins of Cdc48 has a function in the degradation of ERAD substrates, we employed the previously elaborated growth test of cells for detection of a malfunctioning ERAD (36Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Buschhorn B.A. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We expressed the membrane-anchored ERAD substrate CTL* from a plasmid in the yeast strains of the W303 prc1-1 background deleted for UBX1 to UBX7, respectively, containing a leucine auxotrophy (Fig. 1B) (36Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Buschhorn B.A. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CTL* consists of misfolded ER-luminal CPY*, a transmembrane domain and the Leu2 domain located in the cytosol. In wild type cells the misfolded CPY* domain induces complete degradation of CTL*. Because of a defective leucine biosynthetic pathway, these cells cannot grow on medium lacking leucine. In contrast, cells with a defect in a gene essential for ERAD such as DER3/HRD1 are unable to degrade CTL*, therefore allowing growth due to the presence of the Leu2 protein (Fig. 1C). When testing the different UBX deletion strains in this growth assay, we observed growth of the Δubx2 strain and, interestingly, of the Δubx4 strain (Fig. 1C). This indicates that Ubx4 influences degradation of misfolded substrates of the ER. No growth was observed for the Δshp1 (Δubx1), Δubx3, Δubx5, Δubx6, and Δubx7 strains, indicating the presence of a wild type ERAD system in these mutant cells. The Δubx2Δubx4 double deletion strain exhibits a somewhat stronger growth indicating an increased half-life of CTL* (Fig. 1C). To confirm a possible function of Ubx4 in elimination of substrates of the ERAD pathway, we tested the degradation of two well known ERAD substrates, luminal CPY* (1Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and the polytopic transmembrane protein Ste6*-HA (35Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) by pulse-chase analysis. CPY* is defined as an ERAD-L substrate carrying a misfolded domain localized in the ER lumen, which is polyubiquitinated via the Der3/Hrd1 ligase. Ste6*-HA, on the other hand, is defined as an ERAD-C substrate carrying a C-terminal truncation in the cytoplasm. This misfolded protein is mainly polyubiquitinated via the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (35Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 40Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Degradation of the two misfolded ERAD substrates is significantly disturbed in a Δubx4 strain (Fig. 2, A and B). Cells deleted in UBX2 show a similar disturbance of CPY* degradation as known from the literature (Fig. 2C) (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast, a UBX6-deleted strain does not show a disturbed degradation of CPY* (Fig. 2C) or Ste6*-HA (data not shown). Obviously, the function of Ubx4 is required for the elimination of misfolded proteins of both ERAD pathways, ERAD-L and ERAD-C. Cdc48 and Ubx4 have been shown to mainly localize to the cytosol and the nucleus, whereas a considerable fraction is also found at membranes of the ER and the nuclear envelope (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Schuberth C. UBX Domain Proteins as a New Family of Cofactors of the AAA ATPase Cdc48. Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich2006Google Scholar). For analysis of Ubx4 via immunological detection, we generated an N-terminal Myc9-tagged version of the protein. This fusion protein is fully functional regarding degradation of CPY* (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2E, Myc9-Ubx4 and Cdc48 are partly associated with the membrane fraction, most likely the ER membrane. This association can be completely abolished by the treatment with 2 m urea, indicating that both proteins are not membrane-integrated but might associate via a linker molecule in the membrane. The putative mammalian orthologue of Ubx4 TUG (ASPCR1/UBXD9) contains a UBL domain near the N terminus and a UBX domain located close to the C terminus (15Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The UBX domain of Ubx4 in yeast was already published (28Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In an alignment we compared the UBL domains of different yeast proteins with the N terminus of Ubx4 (supplemental Fig. 1). In most yeast proteins the UBL domain is usually about 80 amino acids long. One exception is the UBL domain of Usa1, which consists of about 60 amino acids. Interestingly, Ubx4 contains a longer variant of the UBL domain of about 108 amino acids (supplemental Fig. 1). As Ubx4 contains both domains, a UBL and a UBX domain, it is unique among the Ubx proteins in yeast. Both domains share high similarity to ubiquitin (24Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We tested if both domains are required for degradation of ERAD substrates. Therefore, N-terminally Myc9-tagged truncations of Ubx4 were created (Fig. 3A). As can be seen from Fig. 3, B and C, deletion of the UBX domain of UBX4 (amino acids 269–416 or 171–416) leads to similar growth phenotypes as found for the Δubx4 deletion strain. The corresponding degradation assays of the UBX domain deleted UBX4 strains resulted in a comparable delay of CPY* degradation as found for the UBX4 deletion (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, a deletion of the UBL domain has no effect on CPY* elimination (Fig. 3D). Immunoprecipitation of soluble Myc9-Ubx4 (S) and membrane solubilized Myc9-Ubx4 (P) showed clearly that the deletion of the UBX domain abrogates the interaction of Ubx4 with Cdc48 (Fig. 3E). This indicates that only the UBX domain is required for Ubx4 cofactor interaction with the AAA ATPase Cdc48. The complex of Cdc48-Ubx4 exists in both fractions. One is found in the soluble, cytoplasmic fraction (S), the other one is membrane-associated (P) (Fig. 3E). The amount of Cdc48 at the ER membrane is identical in wild type and mutant cells, whereas the amount of Cdc48 in the supernatant of Δubx4 mutant cells is always somewhat lower than in the wild type (Fig. 3, E and F). Therefore, we tested if Ubx4 has a role in the degradation of Cdc48. In a cycloheximide chase experiment, no difference in the degradation of Cdc48 between a Δubx4 strain and a wild type strain could be observed (data not shown). We wanted to know whether the Ubx4-containing Cdc48 complex also binds the heterodimeric cofactor Ufd1-Npl4. The binding of Ufd1 to Cdc48 is necessary and a prerequisite for the interaction of Cdc48 with Npl4 (21Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We tagged Npl4 at the C terminus with an HA3 epitope and immunoprecipitated cytosolic Myc9-Ubx4 (S) and membrane-associated Myc9-Ubx4 (P) via their Myc tags. Myc9-Ubx4 coimmunoprecipitates with Cdc48 and Npl4-HA3 of both, the cytosolic and the membrane bound complex, indicating that Ubx4 is indeed a component of the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (Fig. 4A). To get more insight into the function of Ubx4, we tested whether the absence of Ubx4 has any influence on the binding of Cdc48 to the ER membrane via the known recruiting cofactor Ubx2. When immunoprecipitating membrane-solubilized Ubx2-HA3 isolated from wild type cells and the Δubx4 deletion strain, we observed equal amounts of Cdc48 coprecipitated with Ubx2-HA3 (Fig. 4B (P)). As expected, no Cdc48-Ubx2-HA3 complex was found in the fractions (S) containing soluble proteins because Ubx2 is a membrane protein. This shows that the absence of Ubx4 has no influence on the Cdc48-Ubx2 interaction. A part of Ubx4 is localized together with the Cdc48 complex at membranes (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we analyzed whether this Cdc48-Ubx4 complex is also linked via Ubx2 to the ER membrane. For this purpose we precipitated soluble and membrane-solubilized Myc9-Ubx4. Astonishingly, no Ubx2-HA3 protein was found in the membrane-associated Cdc48-Ubx4 complex (Fig. 4C). This indicates that binding of Ubx4 to the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex excludes concomitant binding of Ubx2. Pulse-chase experiments in the deletion mutants of UBX2, UBX4, or both showed a delayed degradation of CPY* compared with wild type cells. The degradation kinetics are similar in all three mutant strains (Fig. 4D) and may suggest that Ubx2 and Ubx4 act in the same pathway. It has been shown that the function of the Cdc48 complex in the ERAD pathway resides in its capacity to remove polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins from the ER and deliver them to the proteasome (7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 8Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Fröhlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 12: 4114-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Considering this, the delayed degradation of ERAD substrates in a Δubx4 strain may be due to the inability of the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex to deliver polyubiquitinated substrates properly to proteasomal proteolysis. To address this question, we analyzed the amount of the misfolded substrate CPY* bound to the Cdc48 complex (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation with Cdc48 antibodies resulted in a considerable increased amount of CPY* bound to the Cdc48 complex in a Δubx4 strain compared with wild type in both the soluble (S) and membrane-solubilized (P) fractions (Fig. 5). In addition, the total amount of coimmunoprecipitated polyubiquitinated proteins bound to the Cdc48 complex is remarkably increased in a Δubx4 deletion strain as compared with wild type. This difference was especially striking in the precipitates isolated from membrane-solubilized proteins of Δubx4 cells (Fig. 5). The amount of the ubiquitin ligase Der3/Hrd1 coprecipitated with the Cdc48 complex is enhanced in the Δubx4 deletion strain (Fig. 5). Obviously, in the absence of Ubx4 the Cdc48 complex binds stronger or longer to membrane components of the ER and accumulates misfolded CPY* and polyubiquitinated material. This indicates a disturbance in the release of misfolded proteins from Cdc48 when Ubx4 is missing. We identified Ubx4, a UBX domain containing cofactor of Cdc48, as a novel member influencing the ERAD pathway in yeast. First hints for an influence of Ubx4 on protein degradation came from a study by Decottignies et al. (27Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The authors showed that a Δubx4Δubx6Δubx7 triple knock-out strain stabilizes Ub-P-βGal, suggesting a redundant role of the proteins Ubx4, Ubx6, and Ubx7 on the degradation of cytosolic substrates. Additional hints link Ubx4 to proteasomal degradation and showed that the deletion of UBX4 and RPN4, a transcription factor for proteasomal genes, leads to synthetic lethality (42Pan X. Ye P. Yuan D.S. Wang X. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A link to the ERAD pathway came from the study of Travers et al. (43Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The authors found that the expression of Ubx4 is up-regulated during the unfolded protein response (43Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). This up-regulation is comparable with the ones found for the known ERAD components Der1, Ubx2, and Hrd3. The hypersensitivity toward DTT and the disturbed degradation of the ERAD substrate CTL* show for the first time that the ERAD pathway is affected in a Δubx4 knock-out strain (Fig. 1, A and C). Furthermore, our pulse-chase experiments with mutants deleted in UBX4 show a defective degradation of a luminal (ERAD-L) and a polytopic membrane (ERAD-C) substrate, CPY* and Ste6*-HA, respectively (Fig. 2). Only one of the two domains of Ubx4, the UBX domain, is required for binding to Cdc48 and subsequently for ERAD (Fig. 3). Deletion of the UBL domain of Ubx4 does not affect binding to Cdc48 nor degradation of CPY*. Up to now the function of the UBL domain of Ubx4 remains unknown. We show that Ubx4 binds to the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (Fig. 4A), which is the molecular unit pulling polyubiquitinated proteins away from the ER membrane (9Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Binding of these two cofactors, Ubx4 and Ufd1-Npl4, to Cdc48 at the same time is not mutually exclusive, in contrast to the well established exclusive binding of either Ufd1-Npl4 or Shp1 to Cdc48 (44Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). For proper ERAD function the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is bound to the ER membrane via the UBX domain containing protein Ubx2 (22Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This interaction is not disturbed in a Δubx4 strain (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the membrane linker Ubx2 seems to be excluded from the membrane-associated Cdc48-Ubx4 complex (Fig. 4C). These data indicate the existence of a Ubx2-independent Cdc48-Ubx4 complex and of further unknown factors for Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 recruitment to the ER membrane. Such an unknown membrane-recruiting factor has also been suggested by Neuber et al. (23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The authors reported that cells lacking Ubx2 exhibit no major reduction in the amount of membrane-bound Cdc48 (23Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our data show that the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex exists in different physiological states. The Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex bound to Ubx2 at the ER membrane defines one state, the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex bound to Ubx4 at the membrane and in the cytosol define novel additional states. Our data indicate that these different states of Cdc48 complexes exert a function affecting the ER-associated degradation pathway. In the absence of Ubx4, the membrane-bound Cdc48 complex as well as the soluble Cdc48 complex carry more misfolded CPY* and polyubiquitinated proteins, indicating that they are unable to release and deliver them properly to the downstream components (Fig. 5). We suggest that both fractions of this complex, one bound to the membrane and the other located in the cytosol, are involved in the delivery of the polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the downstream components and to the proteasome. Absence of Ubx4 might also affect other proteolytic pathways that depend on the pulling function of the Cdc48 complex. The altered growth of a UBX4-deleted strain under stress conditions of higher temperature or of toxic agents like cycloheximide and dithiothreitol might underline this conclusion. Increased levels of misfolded polyubiquitinated proteins at Cdc48 in the absence of Ubx4 could also affect different cellular processes that require a functional Cdc48 system.

https://openalex.org/W2071597460,"Proinflammatory responses induced by Plasmodium falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are thought to be involved in malaria pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-12, two of the major inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages stimulated with GPIs. We show that MK2 differentially regulates the GPI-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-12. Although TNF-alpha production was markedly decreased, IL-12 expression was increased by 2-3-fold in GPI-stimulated MK2(-/-) macrophages compared with wild type (WT) cells. MK2(-/-) macrophages produced markedly decreased levels of TNF-alpha than WT macrophages mainly because of lower mRNA stability and translation. In the case of IL-12, mRNA was substantially higher in MK2(-/-) macrophages than WT. This enhanced production is due to increased NF-kappaB binding to the gene promoter, a markedly lower level expression of the transcriptional repressor factor c-Maf, and a decreased binding of GAP-12 to the gene promoter in MK2(-/-) macrophages. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time the role of MK2 in the transcriptional regulation of IL-12. Using the protein kinase inhibitors SB203580 and U0126, we also show that the ERK and p38 pathways regulate TNF-alpha and IL-12 production, and that both inhibitors can reduce phosphorylation of MK2 in response to GPIs and other toll-like receptor ligands. These results may have important implications for developing therapeutics for malaria and other infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2089440250,"Despite decades of research in defining sleep-wake properties in mammals, little is known about the nature or identity of genes that regulate sleep, a fundamental behaviour that in humans occupies about one-third of the entire lifespan. While genome-wide association studies in humans and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in mice have identified candidate genes for an increasing number of complex traits and genetic diseases, the resources and time-consuming process necessary for obtaining detailed quantitative data have made sleep seemingly intractable to similar large-scale genomic approaches. Here we describe analysis of 20 sleep-wake traits from 269 mice from a genetically segregating population that reveals 52 significant QTL representing a minimum of 20 genomic loci. While many (28) QTL affected a particular sleep-wake trait (e.g., amount of wake) across the full 24-hr day, other loci only affected a trait in the light or dark period while some loci had opposite effects on the trait during the light vs. dark. Analysis of a dataset for multiple sleep-wake traits led to previously undetected interactions (including the differential genetic control of number and duration of REM bouts), as well as possible shared genetic regulatory mechanisms for seemingly different unrelated sleep-wake traits (e.g., number of arousals and REM latency). Construction of a Bayesian network for sleep-wake traits and loci led to the identification of sub-networks of linkage not detectable in smaller data sets or limited single-trait analyses. For example, the network analyses revealed a novel chain of causal relationships between the chromosome 17@29cM QTL, total amount of wake, and duration of wake bouts in both light and dark periods that implies a mechanism whereby overall sleep need, mediated by this locus, in turn determines the length of each wake bout. Taken together, the present results reveal a complex genetic landscape underlying multiple sleep-wake traits and emphasize the need for a systems biology approach for elucidating the full extent of the genetic regulatory mechanisms of this complex and universal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2099197940,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rmt3 is a member of the protein-arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family and is the homolog of human PRMT3. We previously characterized Rmt3 as a ribosomal protein methyltransferase based on the identification of the 40 S Rps2 (ribosomal protein S2) as a substrate of Rmt3. RMT3-null cells produce nonmethylated Rps2 and show mis-regulation of the 40 S/60 S ribosomal subunit ratio due to a small subunit deficit. For this study, we have generated a series of RMT3 alleles that express various amino acid substitutions to characterize the functional domains of Rmt3 in Rps2 binding, Rps2 arginine methylation, and small ribosomal subunit production. Notably, catalytically inactive versions of Rmt3 restored the ribosomal subunit imbalance detected in RMT3-null cells. Consistent with a methyltransferase-independent function for Rmt3 in small ribosomal subunit production, the expression of an Rps2 variant in which the identified methylarginine residues were substituted with lysines showed normal levels of 40 S subunit. Importantly, substitutions within the zinc finger domain of Rmt3 that abolished Rps2 binding did not rescue the 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit of RMT3-null cells. Our findings suggest that the Rmt3-Rps2 interaction, rather than Rps2 methylation, is important for the function of Rmt3 in the regulation of small ribosomal subunit production.

Protein arginine methylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). 2The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein-arginine methyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CR1 and -2, conserved region 1 and 2, respectively; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase.2The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein-arginine methyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CR1 and -2, conserved region 1 and 2, respectively; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase. Although protein-arginine methyltransferase activity has never been demonstrated in prokaryotic organisms, genes encoding PRMTs have been identified in a variety of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes (1Bachand F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In humans, 10 PRMTs have so far been identified (3Bedford M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4243-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Most PRMTs are divided in two major classes, depending of the type of dimethylarginine they produce. Whereas both type I and II PRMTs use S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a cofactor for the monomethylation of specific arginines within substrate proteins, type I and type II enzymes can also produce asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine and symmetric NG,N′G-dimethylarginine, respectively (1Bachand F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, protein arginine methylation is often found within arginine-glycine (RG)-rich regions of nucleic acid-binding proteins (4Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional role of PRMTs is likely to be mediated by the modification of substrate proteins. Accordingly, proteins involved in specific steps of gene expression, including transcription (5Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Prajapati S. Park K.J. Surabhi R.M. Miller B. Gehrig P. Gaynor R.B. Mol.

Methylation of specific arginine residues within the N-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones is also important for gene regulation and chromatin remodeling (14Pal S. Sif S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Coonrod S. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), thereby influencing biological processes, such as cell fate determination (16Torres-Padilla M.E. Parfitt D.E. Kouzarides T. Zernicka-Goetz M. Nature. 2007; 445: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and oncogenesis (17Cheung N. Chan L.C. Thompson A. Cleary M.L. So C.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As yet, however, the biological role of most PRMTs remains poorly understood. The ribosome is the macromolecular complex responsible for protein synthesis in all living cells. In eukaryotes, the 80 S ribosome is composed of a small (40 S) and a large (60 S) ribosomal subunit; the 40 S subunit is composed of the 18 S rRNA and roughly 30 ribosomal proteins, whereas the 60 S subunit contains three rRNAs (25, 5.8, and 5 S) and ∼50 ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosomal proteins are substrates of arginine methylation (18Kruiswijk T. Kunst A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Lhoest J. Lobet Y. Costers E. Colson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Polevoda B.

Proteomic approaches corroborate these findings and indicate that ribosomal proteins contain a variety of covalent modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation of lysines and arginines, and neddylation (22Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinović S. Pasa-Tolić L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Louie D.F.

Shen L. Botting C. Hay R.T. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Notably, asymmetric dimethylarginine is the predominant methylated amino acid in both the eukaryotic 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits (26Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Chang C.N. Dancis B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although evidence for the methylation of ribosomal proteins was demonstrated more than 30 years ago, mechanisms by which this modification regulates the synthesis and/or the function of ribosomes remain elusive. We and others have previously characterized the PRMT3 enzyme as a ribosomal protein methyltransferase (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PRMT3 modifies the RG-rich region of the 40 S Rps2 (ribosomal protein S2) via asymmetric dimethylation of as yet unidentified arginine residues. Deletion of the genomic copy of the RMT3 gene (homolog of human PRMT3) in fission yeast results in the expression of unmethylated Rps2 and a 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit that appears to be caused by defects beyond pre-rRNA processing (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, mice with a targeted disruption of the PRMT3 gene that results in a 10-fold reduction in PRMT3 expression were generated (27Swiercz R. Cheng D. Kim D. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was found that PRMT3-deficient embryos have reduced levels of Rps2 methylation and are small in size. Such a phenotype is similar to Drosophila Minute mutants that are often attributable to ribosomal proteins insufficiency and that have a wide panorama of phenotypes, including slow development and small body size (28Lambertsson A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 69-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Marygold S.J. Roote J. Reuter G. Lambertsson A. Ashburner M. Millburn G.H. Harrison P.M. Yu Z. Kenmochi N. Kaufman T.C. Leevers S.J. Cook K.R. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R216Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the absence of Rmt3 expression results in a 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit and whether this reduction is directly linked to Rps2 methylation are unknown. In this study, we identified substitutions in fission yeast Rmt3 that prevent Rps2 methylation but not binding to Rps2. Unexpectedly, such catalytically inactive alleles of RMT3 fully rescued the ribosomal subunit imbalance of RMT3-null cells. Consistently, a methylation-deficient allele of RPS2, in which the identified methylarginines were substituted with lysine residues, was functional and showed no reduction in small ribosomal subunit levels. Notably, expression of Rmt3 variants that were impaired in binding Rps2 showed a small ribosomal subunit deficit similar to RMT3-null cells. Our findings reveal that the association between Rps2 and Rmt3, but not Rps2 methylation, is important for the function of Rmt3 in ribosomal subunit homeostasis. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Strain genotypes are listed in Table 1. Cells were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract medium with amino acid supplements and Edinburgh minimal medium containing appropriate amino acid supplements. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells were transformed with plasmids and PCR products by the lithium acetate method. nmt1+-dependent gene expression was repressed by the addition of 60 μm thiamine to the growth medium.

Lackner D.H. Bähler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using PstI-EcoRI restriction enzymes. The PstI-EcoRI fragment was subsequently cloned into PstI-EcoRI-digested pJK148 and pJK210, creating plasmids pFB48 and pFB227, respectively. Construction of the of the arginine-to-alanine (Arg → Ala) and arginine-to-lysine (Arg → Lys) alleles of RPS2 were carried out by simultaneous site-directed mutagenesis of Arg7, Arg11, Arg14, Arg17, Arg19, Arg21, Arg23, and Arg24 using 136-nucleotide complementary oligonucleotides that changed these arginine codons to either alanine or lysine. The cDNA carrying wild-type RMT3 plus upstream (RMT3) and downstream (NMT1) regulatory sequences was cloned into pJK148. Construction of the different RMT3 alleles was by site-directed mutagenesis. The construct that expresses glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to wild-type Rmt3 was previously described (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All Rmt3 variants were subcloned into EcoRI-XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-2. All of the constructs used in this study were verified by automated sequencing at the University of Calgary DNA Core Facility. Protein Analysis—For the Rmt3 copurification experiments shown in Fig. 2, 50 ml of midlog phase cells grown in Edinburgh minimal medium were used. Cells were lysed with a Fastprep FP120 (Thermo Electro Corp.) using 0.5-mm glass beads in ice-cold polysome buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl) containing a mixture of protease and RNase inhibitors. Clarified lysates were normalized for total protein concentration, and 1 mg of total proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Immunopurified proteins were competitively eluted from the beads in polysome buffer supplemented with 200 ng/ml FLAG peptide. Eluted proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to S. pombe Rmt3 (8Perreault A. Lemieux C. Bachand F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7552-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to the FLAG epitope (Sigma). Membranes were then probed with goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 680 (Molecular Probes) and IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals), respectively. Linear detection of the proteins was performed and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). The percentage Rps2 binding for the different variants of Rmt3 was established as follows: (signal ratio of copurified Rmt3 over purified Rps2-FLAG)/(signal ratio of input Rmt3 over input Rps2). The corresponding values from this calculation were normalized to wild-type Rmt3, which was arbitrarily set to 100%. Purification of FLAG-tagged Rps2 for the identification of methylated arginines by mass spectrometry was as described above except that 250 ml of yeast cultures were used. Eluted proteins were also trichloroacetic acid-precipitated before being subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For the evaluation of the level of Rps2 methylation catalyzed by the different Rmt3 substitutions, total cell extracts prepared in polysome lysis buffer were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to Rmt3 and Rps2 (32Perreault A. Bellemer C. Bachand F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6132-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as using a methylarginine-specific polyclonal antibody (33Duan P. Xu Y. Birkaya B. Myers J. Pelletier M. Read L.K. Guarnaccia C. Pongor S. Denman R.B. Aletta J.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 320: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Linear detection of the proteins was performed and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR) as described above. In Vitro Methylation Assays—Purification of GST and GST-Rmt3 fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli was as previously described (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The substrate for the in vitro methylation assays was unmethylated Rps2 that was immunopurified from extracts of RMT3-null as described above except that 20 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl were added to the purification buffer to reduce the level of coprecipitating proteins. In vitro methylation activity assays were performed as 30-μl reactions in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and terminated by the addition of 1 volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequent incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorography (Enhance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ribosome Profiles—Ribosome profiles and the relative ratios of free 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits were as previously described (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradients were fractionated by upward displacement with 55% (w/w) sucrose using a gradient fractionator (Brandel Inc.) connected to a UA-6 UV monitor (Teledyne Isco) for continuous measurement of the absorbance at 254 nm. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry analysis of Rps2 was carried out at the Southern Alberta Mass Spectrometry Centre for Proteomics of the University of Calgary. Peptide separation was achieved with a Zorbax 300 SB-C18 analytical column (75-μm inner diameter × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, 100 Å; Agilent Technologies) using an Agilent 1100 nano-LC system. A 2-pmol digest was loaded onto an enrichment column (Zorbax 300 SB-C18; 5 μm, 5 × 0.3 mm) for 5 min using an Agilent binary pump with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The analytical column was equilibrated for 5 min with 97% mobile phase A (0.2% formic acid in water), and peptides were eluted using a linear gradient from 3 to 90% mobile phase B (0.2% formic acid, 10% water in acetonitrile) over 50 min with a constant flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. The column was washed for 10 min with 90% B and re-equilibrated with 3% B for 15 min prior to subsequent sample loading. The analytical column was connected online to a QSTAR XL quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (AB/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) fitted with an 8-μm nanospray tip (New Objective). The ion spray voltage was set at 1500 V, and the interface heater temperature was 150 °C. Precursor ion scanning experiments were carried out as previously described (34Rappsilber J. Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Dreyfuss G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) for methylated peptide detection, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) experiments were performed in positive ion mode over an m/z range of 400–1500 for charged state identification. S. pombe Rmt3 is a cytosolic type I arginine methyltransferase that harbors a C2H2 zinc finger domain, N-terminal conserved regions 1 and 2, conserved methyltransferase motifs, and a poorly characterized C-terminal domain (Fig. 1) (1Bachand F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether the methyltransferase activity of Rmt3 is required for small ribosomal subunit production, variants of Rmt3 that can bind but not methylate Rps2 were needed. We therefore generated a series of RMT3 alleles that express single and double amino acid substitutions to characterize the functional domains of Rmt3 in Rps2 binding, Rps2 arginine methylation, and ribosomal subunit homeostasis. Substitutions were introduced at evolutionarily conserved residues within various domains of S. pombe Rmt3 (Fig. 1). Substitutions of critical cysteine and histidine residues of the zinc finger (Cys63 with His76 and Cys60 with His81) were introduced because the substrate specificity and/or the enzymatic activity of Rmt3 are likely to be regulated by the zinc finger (13Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To create a catalytically inactive Rmt3 variant, a conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu338) shown to be required for PRMT1 catalysis (36Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was modified. Alignment of Rmt3 sequences from diverse organisms revealed the presence of two conserved stretches of amino acids in the N-terminal region that were called conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and -2) (Fig. 1) (1Bachand F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions at evolutionarily conserved residues within the CR1 (Asn104 and Ile106) and CR2 (Tyr130) motifs were thus introduced to begin to characterize the functional roles of these conserved regions. A cysteine residue (Cys475) specific to fission yeast Rmt3 was also deleted, and a tryptophan (Trp488) residue within the conserved C-terminal THW motif of Rmt3 was modified (Fig. 1). The THW motif is found in most PRMTs and is predicted to form a loop structure near the active site, as determined by x-ray crystallography (37Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To prevent overexpression, the different RMT3 alleles were chromosomally integrated as single copy into RMT3-null cells and expressed from their endogenous promoter. The Zinc Finger Motif of Rmt3 Is Critical for Binding Rps2—Fission yeast and human Rmt3 directly interact with Rps2 (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A copurification assay was thus used to define regions of Rmt3 necessary for Rps2 association. The RMT3 alleles described above were expressed in RMT3-null cells that also expressed a functional FLAG-tagged version of Rps2 (31Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bähler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using the FLAG epitope as an affinity tag, FLAG immunoprecipitates were prepared to isolate complexes between Rmt3 and Rps2. Eluted proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for the ability of the different Rmt3 variants to copurify with Rps2 by Western blotting. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, wild-type Rmt3 was recovered in FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from extracts of cells that expressed Rps2-FLAG (lane 1) but not from extracts of control cells that expressed an untagged version of Rps2 (lane 2), demonstrating the specificity of our copurification assay. The level of Rmt3 binding to Rps2 was quantified (see “Materials and Methods”) for the different Rmt3 variants and normalized to wild-type Rmt3 (Fig. 2B). Notably, amino acid substitutions of critical cysteine and histidine residues within the zinc finger region of Rmt3 abolished the interaction between Rmt3 and Rps2 (Fig. 2, A (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1) and B), consistent with an earlier study (13Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Substitution of the conserved glutamic acid residue 338 within motif II of the methyltransferase domain as well as of tyrosine 130 within CR2 (see Fig. 1) both slightly increased the association between Rmt3 and Rps2 (Fig. 2, A and B). The Rmt3-Rps2 association was reduced by 40% when asparagine 104 within CR1 was substituted to an aspartic acid residue (Fig. 2B). Alterations within the carboxyl-terminal region of Rmt3 (C475Δ and W488A) did not perturb the ability of Rmt3 to bind Rps2 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the zinc finger domain is the primary determinant of Rmt3 required for the interaction with Rps2 in fission yeast. Identification of Catalytically Inactive Versions of Rmt3—We have previously demonstrated that Rps2 is modified by asymmetric dimethylation of arginine in an Rmt3-dependent fashion (11Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To define functional domains of Rmt3 required for arginine methylation of Rps2, we determined the levels of Rps2 methylation catalyzed by the different Rmt3 variants shown in Fig. 1. A methylarginine-specific antibody (33Duan P. Xu Y. Birkaya B. Myers J. Pelletier M. Read L.K. Guarnaccia C. Pongor S. Denman R.B. Aletta J.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 320: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was used to assess the status of Rps2 methylation. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, this antibody recognized arginine methylated Rps2 from extracts of wild-type cells (lane 1) but not unmethylated Rps2 from extracts of RMT3-null cells (lane 2). Longer exposures of membranes blotted with the methylarginine-specific antibody did not show additional Rmt3-dependent substrates (data not shown). To confirm that the protein recognized by the methylarginine-specific antibody was Rps2, an RPS2-null strain that expressed a GFP-tagged version of Rps2 was used. As expected, only the GFP-tagged version of Rps2 was detected when an Rps2-specific antibody was used to analyze extracts from this strain (Fig. 3A, lane 3, top). An equivalent size shift was seen when the methylarginine-specific antibody was used to analyze the same extract from the strain expressing rpS2-GFP (Fig. 3A, lane 3, bottom). These results clearly establish that the 28 kDa band detected by the methylarginine-specific antibody in extracts of wild-type (lane 1) but not RMT3-null cells (lane 2)is endogenous Rps2. The methylarginine-specific antibody was thus used to assess the ability of the different Rmt3 variants to catalyze arginine methylation of Rps2. Extracts of yeast that expressed RMT3 alleles with substitutions of critical cysteine and histidine residues within the zinc finger contained mostly unmethylated Rps2 (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with the inability of the Rmt3 zinc finger mutants to bind Rps2 (Fig. 2). Variant N104D within the CR1 motif of Rmt3 that showed a 40% reduction in Rps2 binding (Fig. 2) resulted in roughly 35% of arginine methylated Rps2 (Fig. 3, B and C). Importantly, variants of Rmt3 that bound Rps2 but that did not catalyze its methylation were identified. First, substitution E338Q near motif II of the Rmt3 methyltransferase domain (Fig. 1) completely abolished Rps2 methylation (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with an analogous substitution in rat PRMT1 (36Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Substitution W488A within the conserved THW loop also resulted in a catalytically inactive version of Rmt3 (F"

However, access to quality services and misconceptions associated with contraceptive methods may impact on their effective use in developing countries. We describe the pattern of contraceptive use in a multi-site phase I/IIa HIV Vaccine trial in East Africa (Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) and factors that may have influenced their use during the trial. Methods Pregnancy prevention counseling was provided to female participants during informed consent process and at each study visit. Participants' methods of contraception used were documented. Methods of contraceptives were provided on site. Pregnancy testing was done at designated visits during the trial. Obstacles to contraceptive use were identified and addressed at each visit. Results Overall, 103 (31.8%) of a total of 324 enrolled volunteers were females. Female participants were generally young with a mean age of 29(±7.2), married (49.5%) and had less than high school education (62.1%). Hormonal contraceptives were the most common method of contraception (58.3%) followed by condom use (22.3%). The distribution of methods of contraception among the three sites was similar except for more condom use and less abstinence in Uganda. The majority of women (85.4%) reported to contraceptive use prior to screening. The reasons for not using contraception included access to quality services, insufficient knowledge of certain methods, and misconceptions. Conclusion Although hormonal contraceptives were frequently used by females participating in the vaccine trial, misconceptions and their incorrect use might have led to inconsistent use resulting in undesired pregnancies. The study underscores the need for an integrated approach to pregnancy prevention counseling during HIV vaccine trials. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00123968"

Resistance to INH is a global health problem most often associated with mutations in the katG gene. The origin of INH resistance caused by the KatG[S315G] mutant enzyme is examined here. Overexpressed KatG[S315G] was characterized by optical, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy and by studies of the INH activation mechanism in vitro. Catalase activity and peroxidase activity with artificial substrates were moderately reduced (50 and 35%, respectively), whereas the rates of formation of oxyferryl heme:porphyrin π-cation radical and the decay of heme intermediates were ∼2-fold faster in KatG[S315G] compared with WT enzyme. The INH binding affinity for the resting enzyme was unchanged, whereas INH activation, measured by the rate of formation of an acyl-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adduct considered to be a bactericidal molecule, was reduced by 30% compared with WT KatG. INH resistance is suggested to arise from a redirection of catalytic intermediates into nonproductive reactions that interfere with oxidation of INH. In the resting mutant enzyme, a rapid evolution of 5-c heme to 6-c species occurred in contrast with the behavior of WT KatG and KatG[S315T] and consistent with greater flexibility at the heme edge in the absence of the hydroxyl of residue 315.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the replacement of serine by threonine leads to a structurally modified substrate access channel. This channel leads from the surface of the enzyme to the heme edge at the propionate of pyrrole IV. Residues Asp137 and Ser315 delimit the narrowest region of the channel, which is reduced in width from 6 to 4.7 Å. The methyl group of threonine effectively restricts accessibility to the heme pocket and apparently interferes with specific interactions required for binding and activation of the drug. Although a binding site for INH in KatG is not specifically defined by x-ray crystallography at this time, a recently reported CCP-INH structure (yeast CCP is a homologous Class I peroxidase) presents what should be an excellent model of drug binding in KatG (34Metcalfe C. Macdonald I.K. Murphy E.J. Brown K.A. Raven E.L. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6193-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds between the backbone carbonyl of Ser185 (Ser315 in M. tuberculosis KatG), a water molecule, and the pyridine nitrogen of the drug are found in the CCP-INH complex. Thus, it is reasonable that mutations at residue 315 in KatG have an impact on drug binding and activation but little impact on catalase or peroxidase activity with substrates that may not require the same specific interactions as high affinity INH binding. Beyond these studies, there is a substantial gap in the knowledge of the relationship between INH resistance due to the numerous other mutations in the katG gene and the lost drug activation function of the mutant enzymes. The main goal of the present study was to examine KatG[S315G] in vitro. We report the generation, overexpression, purification, and characterization of this enzyme found in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis having low level INH resistance with MIC values up to 40-fold higher than WT strains (8 μg/μl versus 0.05 μg/μl) (22Cardoso R.F. Cooksey R.C. Morlock G.P. Barco P. Cecon L. Forestiero F. Leite C.Q. Sato D.N. Shikama Mde L. Mamizuka E.M. Hirata R.D. Hirata M.H. Antimicrob.

Driscoll J. Zickas G. Taber H.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2218-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of the problem is that in KatG[S315T], a steric influence on INH binding strongly interferes with activation, whereas resistance is still present with the glycine replacement of serine 315, which would not be assumed to interfere with substrate access or binding at the same locus. The application of optical stopped-flow spectrophotometry, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), optical titration, EPR spectroscopy, and rapid freeze-quench EPR (RFQ-EPR) allowed us to probe the functional and structural consequences of the mutation on INH activation. Our results strongly suggest that resistance is due to catalytic changes rather than major changes in specific interactions between the enzyme and INH. Importantly, the results demonstrate the validity of an in vitro INH activation approach used here, since we find a correlation between our observations and the in vivo behavior of INH-resistant M. tuberculosis strains for both KatG[S315T] and KatG[S315G]. All standard chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. INH was recrystallized from methanol before use. PAA (32%) was diluted to 10 mm in potassium phosphate buffer and was incubated with 780 units/ml bovine catalase (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 37 °C to degrade hydrogen peroxide. After treatment, catalase was removed by ultrafiltration. The plasmid pKAT II was used as an overexpression vector for KatG (35Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as well as a mutagenesis template. Escherichia coli strain UM262 (36Loewen P.C. Stauffer G.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression. UM262 and pKAT II were both gifts from Stewart Cole (Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pairs of complementary primers (synthesized and purified by Operon Biotechnologies, Inc.) were designed to introduce the S315G mutation. The oligonucleotide pairs (mutated codons are in boldface type) were 5′-925GGTAAGGACGCGATCACCGGCGGCATCGAGGTCG958-3′ and 5′-958CGACCTCGATGCCGCCGGTGATCGCGTCCTTACC925-3′. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reaction products were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain for selection purposes. The presence of the mutated 315 codon in the katG gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Gene Wiz, Inc.), and the mutated plasmid was electroporated into E. coli strain UM262 for protein overexpression. KatG[S315G] was purified as previously described for WT KatG (37Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The pure enzyme had an optical purity ratio (A405/A280) of ∼0.45. The proportion of heme-deficient enzyme, which is a catalytically active dimer containing only one heme, represented more than half of the total overexpressed enzyme isolated in these experiments. In the case of WT KatG, only a small percentage of total enzyme is found as heme-deficient dimer (37Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The overexpression conditions are such that polypeptide synthesis outpaces the availability of heme despite supplementation of the medium with the heme precursor δ-ALA. The unknown conditions in M. tuberculosis carrying KatG[S315G] precludes commenting on the physiological significance of these observations. Here, we have focused only on the properties of the holoenzymes. Protein concentration was determined using a heme extinction coefficient of ∼85 mm−1 cm−1 at 405 nm for the mutant enzyme and 100 mm−1 for WT KatG catalase, and peroxidase activities were determined at 25 °C according to published procedures (31Saint-Joanis B. Souchon H. Wilming M. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Cole S.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 38Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, respectively. Spectrophotometric measurements were obtained using an NT14 UV-visible spectrophotometer interfaced to a personal computer (Aviv Associates). A rapid scanning diode array stopped-flow apparatus (HiTech Scientific model SF-61DX2) was used for kinetics measurements. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using the Kinet-Asyst software package (HiTech Scientific). All reactions were carried out at 25 °C in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. For calculation of second order rates for conversion of resting enzyme into the catalytic intermediate oxyferryl heme:porphyrin π-cation radical (Fe(IV)=OPor+·), the change in absorbance in the Soret region upon reaction with varying concentrations of PAA was followed for 2 s, and data were fit to a single exponential decay function. Observed rates (kobs) were used to calculate second order rate constants from the plot of kobs versus PAA concentration. Double mixing stopped-flow experiments were performed as previously reported (30Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to follow the reaction of Fe(IV) = OPor+· after it was preformed with a small excess of PAA, with INH, or with additional PAA as reducing substrates added in the second mixing step. The interaction of INH with ferric KatG was analyzed using optical difference spectroscopy in the Soret region, similar to published procedures (32Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S. Yu L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Zhao X. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The change in the difference in absorbance evaluated between 378 and 411 nm was plotted against free isoniazid concentration for titrations conducted at 25 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Data were fit to a single site saturation curve using Sigma Plot version 8.0 software. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a MicroCal VP ITC calorimeter. Data analysis was performed using ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument. KatG[S315G] and titrant (INH) solutions were prepared in the same 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to ensure minimal background from buffer mismatch. Reliable titration data were obtained using 20 μm enzyme in the sample cell (1.4 ml) and an INH concentration in the ligand delivery syringe that gave an INH/heme ratio of ∼0.15:1 per injection. A total of 16 injections (10 μl/injection) were made at 10-min intervals because of a very slow equilibration period, and the heat of reaction per injection (microcalories/s) was determined by integration of the peak areas. The software provided the best fit values for ΔH, ΔS, the stoichiometry of binding (n)/mol of heme, and the dissociation constant (Kd) from plots of heat evolved/mol of substrate injected versus the drug/heme molar ratio. (ITC titrations of KatG with INH and other hydrazide ligands may overestimate the affinity based on heat released because of background reactions (39Zhao X. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The rate of IN-NAD adduct generation catalyzed by KatG[S315G] was examined in a spectrophotometric assay as a function of INH concentration according to a previously published method (33Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this method, KatG (0.5 μm), NAD+ (50 μm), glucose oxidase (10 milliunits/ml), and glucose (5 mm) were incubated in the presence of varying amounts of INH (10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 μm), and the increase in absorbance at 326 nm due to IN-NAD adduct (ϵ326 nm = 6900 m−1 cm−1 (40Ranguelova K. Girotto S. Gerfen G.J. Yu S. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6255-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) was recorded for 20 min. The reference cuvette contained all components except NAD+ to correct for background. X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker E500 ElexSys EPR spectrometer with data acquisition and manipulation performed using XeprView and WinEPR software (Bruker). Low temperature spectra were recorded using an Oxford Spectrostat continuous flow cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller. The spectra of KatG[S315G] (100 μm) were recorded at 4 K in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Experimental parameters are given in the figure legends. The RFQ-EPR samples (aerobic) were prepared using an Update Instrument, Inc. model 1000 chemical-freeze-quench apparatus, as described previously (41Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Solutions of enzyme (typically 100 μm heme) and peroxyacetic acid (300 μm) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated time periods followed by freeze-quenching in isopentane at ∼−130 °C. PAA solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment from H2O2-free stock solutions stored at −80 °C. EPR samples were maintained in liquid nitrogen after removal of isopentane, and spectra were recorded at 77 K using a finger Dewar flask held in the EPR cavity. Samples were also prepared anaerobically by thoroughly degassing enzyme and peroxide solutions and filling syringes for the apparatus under continuous argon purging. Purified mutant enzyme from multiple preparations consistently showed a reduced optical purity ratio (A405/A280 = 0.40–0.45) compared with that of WT KatG (0.50–0.55) but similar to that of KatG[S315T] (30Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although a significantly higher amount of heme-deficient KatG[S315G] enzyme was consistently found during purification, this form of the enzyme resolves completely from the holoenzyme upon hydrophobic chromatography; therefore, contamination of the holoenzyme with heme-deficient enzyme is not the origin of the low ratio. Another factor that would reduce the optical purity ratio is the presence of a high proportion of 5-c heme versus 6-c heme. The blue-shifted Soret peak and red-shifted CT1 band (>640 nm) in the optical spectrum of the freshly isolated mutant enzyme compared with these bands in WT KatG confirm the high proportion of 5-c heme (Fig. 1). The accumulation of six-coordinate KatG during storage of purified enzymes leads to a Soret extinction coefficient ∼30% higher than that of the freshly isolated enzyme and a blue-shifted CT1 band (42Chouchane S. Girotto S. Kapetanaki S. Schelvis J.P. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8154-8162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although KatG[S315G] samples contained a greater proportion of 5-c heme than was typically found for WT KatG immediately after purification, the conversion to 6-c heme was notably faster than in the WT enzyme. For example, after 1 week of storage at 4 °C, the 6-c heme content in the mutant protein doubled, according to resonance Raman spectroscopy (not shown); for WT KatG, similar changes require more than 3 weeks, and the proportion of 6-c heme in WT KatG has not been found to reach the levels in the mutant even after long term storage. This so-called “aging” of M. tuberculosis KatG has been previously described, although specific structural differences between the 5-c and 6-c enzyme forms have not been defined beyond the change in heme iron coordination number (42Chouchane S. Girotto S. Kapetanaki S. Schelvis J.P. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8154-8162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Low temperature EPR spectra provided additional evidence for the rapid evolution of 6-c heme in KatG[S315G]. The EPR spectrum of KatG[S315G] frozen immediately after purification has two rhombic signals that account for nearly all of the intensity; signal r1 (g1 = 6.3, g2 = 5.1, g3 ∼ 2.00) was previously assigned to a 5-c heme species in freshly isolated WT KatG and in KatG[S315T], whereas signal r2 (g1 = 6.04, g2 = 5.54, g3 ∼ 2.00) assigned to 6-c heme becomes predominant after short term storage; in KatG[S315T], the latter signal only develops after very long term storage (Fig. 2) (30Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 43Ranguelova K. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Yu S. Brejt S.Z. Brejt S.Z. Zhao L. Schelvis J.P. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12583-12592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An axial signal (g⊥ = 5.83), probably from another 6-c species, also becomes evident in spectra of the S315G mutant. Little change was observed in the intensity of a second 5-c heme signal (r3; g1 = 6.60, g2 = 5.01, g3 ∼ 2.00 shown in Fig. 2B but present in all three examples) (42Chouchane S. Girotto S. Kapetanaki S. Schelvis J.P. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8154-8162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with conversion of 5-c heme species into 6-c heme more rapidly in KatG[S315G] than in either WT KatG or KatG[S315T]. The low temperature EPR spectra in general show a greater abundance of 6-c heme relative to 5-c heme than the estimated amounts of these species from room temperature resonance Raman spectra, but this type of quantification is difficult, and its temperature and pH dependence are not yet understood. The coordination number has been previously addressed based on EPR, optical, and resonance Raman spectra and on the presence of 6-c heme in the x-ray crystal structure of WT KatG (44Bertrand T. Eady N.A. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M. Jamart-Grégoire B. Raven E.L. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38991-38999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the assumption here is that 6-c species contain a water molecule associated with heme iron in the sixth coordination position. As a first step to assess the possible altered function of this mutant responsible for low level isoniazid resistance, we proceeded to study catalytic mechanisms. The catalase- and peroxidase-specific activities of KatG[S315G] were lower by ∼46% (2039 ± 461 IU/mg) and ∼33% (0.61 ± 0.15 IU/mg), compared with WT KatG (Table 1). Similar reductions in the activities of other KatG mutants, including enzymes from INH-resistant isolates, have been reported based on assays with artificial substrates (30Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Saint-Joanis B. Souchon H. Wilming M. Joh"
https://openalex.org/W1996187338,"The GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1) has three current-generating modes: GABA-coupled current, Li+-induced leak current, and Na+-dependent transient currents. We earlier hypothesized that Li+ is able to substitute for the first Na+ in the transport cycle and thereby induce a distinct conformation in GAT-1 and that the onset of the Li+-induced leak current at membrane potentials more negative than −50 mV was due to a voltage-dependent conformational change of the Li+-bound transporter. In this study, we set out to verify this hypothesis and seek insight into the structural dynamics underlying the leak current, as well as the sodium-dependent transient currents, by applying voltage clamp fluorometry to tetramethylrhodamine 6-maleimide-labeled GAT-1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. MTSET accessibility studies demonstrated the presence of two distinct conformations of GAT-1 in the presence of Na+ or Li+. The voltage-dependent fluorescence intensity changes obtained in Li+ buffer correlated with the Li+-induced leak currents, i.e. both were highly voltage-dependent and only present at hyperpolarized potentials (<−50 mV). The transient currents correlated directly with the voltage-dependent fluorescence data obtained in sodium buffer and the associated conformational changes were distinct from those associated with the Li+-induced leak current. The inhibitor potency of SKF89976A of the Li+- versus Na+-bound transporter confirmed the cationic dependence of the conformational occupancy.

Continuous GABAergic neurotransmission is efficiently prevented by a GABA re-uptake system that transports GABA back into the synaptic processes via the GABA transporters (GAT). Four isoforms of the mammalian GAT have been found: GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1 (betaine transporter-1) (1Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These membrane proteins couple the transport of one GABA molecule to the transport of two Na+ and one Cl− (2Radian R. Kanner B.I.

Accordingly, the transport process is electrogenic and the transport activity can therefore be monitored by electrophysiological methods. GAT-1 has also been shown to generate: (i) an inwardly rectifying leak current in the presence of Li+ (and in complete absence of Na+) when the membrane potential is more negative than −50 mV (4Mager S.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).GAT-1 is strictly dependent on external Na+ to drive the transport of GABA (7Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and external GABA does not affect the Li+-induced leak current (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that Li+ cannot induce the same conformation in GAT-1 as Na+ is capable of inducing: namely the conformation that is required for the binding and translocation of GABA. This is in contrast to, e.g. the related serotonin transporter and dopamine transporter in which substrate inhibits the Li+-induced leak current (9Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) where Li+ is able to sustain substrate transport (11Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2110-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have in an earlier study shown that Li+ is able to bind to the first low apparent affinity cation-binding site in the transport cycle (and replace Na+) but not to the second high apparent affinity cation-binding site (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This finding was later confirmed by Kanner and co-workers (12Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), who were able to identify the cation-binding site with which Li+ interacts and is able to replace Na+. According to our model, the transporter in the presence of Li+ is “stalled” in the conformation in which only the first cation-binding site is occupied, in contrast to the presence of Na+, where both cation-binding sites are occupied.An unresolved question on the Li+-induced leak current for GAT-1 is the mechanism of the prominent inward rectification. The electrochemical driving force for Li+ predicts a Li+-induced inward current originating at much more positive membrane potentials, but this current is not detected unless the membrane potential is more negative than −50 mV. We previously hypothesized that the Li+-induced leak mode would commence only at the hyperpolarized membrane potentials due to a voltage-dependent conformational change in the Li+-bound GABA transporter (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to test this hypothesis by introduction of a fluorescent probe in GAT-1 to monitor voltage-dependent local conformational changes and relate these to the different current-generating modes of GAT-1.We expressed GAT-1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and used simultaneous electrical and optical measurements (voltage clamp fluorometry) (13Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to monitor the currents and conformational changes of the transporter in the presence of Li+ and Na+ in response to step changes in membrane potential. By labeling Cys74 at the external end of transmembrane helix (TM) I of rat GAT-1 (see Fig. 1) with the cysteine-reactive fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine 6-maleimide (TMR6M), we were able to correlate the voltage dependence of the Li+-induced leak current and the Li+- and voltage-dependent changes in conformations observed by fluorescence intensity changes. The voltage dependence of the Li+-induced conformational changes appeared distinct from the Na+-induced conformational changes associated with the Na+-dependent transient currents. We also explored differences in the inhibitor potency of the GAT-1-specific inhibitor SKF89976A (14Borden L.A. Murali Dhar T.G. Smith K.E. Weinshank R.L. Branchek T.A. Gluchowski C. Eur. J.

Finally, we prepared a homology model of GAT-1 (Fig. 1) by using the bacterial leucine transporter, LeuTAa (15Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), as a template and dock the TMR6M into the model to provide a framework for interpreting the putative conformational rearrangements that may explain the observed changes in fluorescence intensity.Altogether, the present data support that local conformational changes taking place at the external surface of TM1 to mirror the global conformational changes taking place during the current-generating modes of the GABA transporter. Moreover, our data demonstrate that voltage dependence of the conformational changes associated with the Li+-induced leak current is different from the Na+-dependent conformational changes required for GABA transport.DISCUSSIONWe have in the present paper employed voltage clamp fluorometry to investigate the conformational changes associated with the Li+-induced leak mode and the Na+-dependent transient currents in the rat GABA transporter-1. The voltage-dependent fluorescence changes of the TRM6M-labeled Cys74 in the external end of TM1 mirrored the global conformational changes that give rise to the Li+-induced leak currents as well as the Na+-dependent transient currents. We have shown here that the time course and voltage dependence of the Li+-induced conformational changes are indeed distinct from those of the Na+-induced conformational changes.Cys74 is located at the external end of TM1, which is one of the transmembrane domains that are proposed to play a key role in the conformational changes associated with coordination of the first cation (Na2 in LeuTAa) and Na+/substrate transport according to a model derived from the crystal structure of the bacterial homologue LeuTAa (15Yamashita A.

Mutational studies of residues in TM1 prior to the publication of the crystal structure and sequence alignment of GAT-1 to LeuTAa have identified amino acids in TM1 that are involved in Na+ binding (the high-affinity Na+-binding site), interactions with the substrate, as well as conformational transitions (4Mager S.

Our observations of the close relationship between current (global conformational changes and overall function) and fluorescence (local conformational changes) are consistent with this hypothesis.The Li+-induced Leak CurrentThe GAT-1 as well as related transport proteins such as serotonin transporter, dopamine transporter, and the noradrenalin transporter from the SLC6 family as well as the more distantly related SGLT1 from the SLC5 family have been shown to support cationic uncoupled leak currents in the absence of substrate (4Mager S.

The GAT-1 is unique among this group as it does not conduct Na+-induced leak currents; but rather supports an inwardly rectifying Li+-induced leak current (4Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we have earlier proposed a model in which Li+ is able to bind to the first “low apparent affinity” cation-binding site and thereby partly substitute for Na+ in the transport cycle (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Asp395 was recently shown to be the coordinating residue for the Li+ interaction at this first cation-binding site and mutation of this residue abolished the Li+-induced leak current as well as the stimulating effect of Li+ on the Na+-dependent GABA transport (12Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Li+ is, however, not able to substitute for Na+ in the second “high apparent affinity” cation-binding site and therefore GABA transport does not take place in a Li+ buffer (7Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It follows that binding of the second cation (Na+) drives the transporter into a conformation in which GABA is able to bind and in which there is no leak current.In our model (Fig. 7), this is depicted as the C1 state with one Na+ or one Li+ bound to the first cation-binding site being different from the C2 state, which is occupied by two Na+. We hypothesize that the conformation of the transporter would be similar when only one cation was bound at the first cation-binding site (independent on whether it was Na+ or Li+), although we have no experimental evidence to base this on. Li+ has been suggested to introduce a distinct conformation in GAT-1 based on the transporter-specific different passive water permeabilities in the presence of Li+ or Na+ (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the different level of MTSEA inhibition of GAT-1 (24Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Li+ has likewise been shown to induce the formation of a distinct conformation in the related serotonin transporter (35Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G.

The presence of a distinct Li+-bound conformation of GAT-1 was further verified in the present work by the different MTSET accessibilities to Cys74 in the presence of either Li+ or Na+, although a putative difference in their KD values and the effect on the MTSET accessibility cannot be ruled out.FIGURE 7Illustration of GAT-1 transport model (modified from Ref. 8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C6 and C0 states represent the empty transporters with the binding sites facing the intracellular and extracellular sites, respectively. In NaCl buffer, the transporter binds the two ions sequentially, states C1Na and C2Na2. The Na+-dependent transient currents are thought to be due to the partial reactions: C6 ↔ C0 ↔ C1Na ↔ C2Na2. In LiCl buffer, the transporter binds one lithium ion (C1Li) and membrane potentials more negative than −50 mV lead to opening of the conducting mode of the protein (C1LiO). SKF89976A binding to the protein is described by the IC50 values: in C1Li (for the leak current), the SKF89976A IC50 is higher than for the inhibition of the GABA-coupled current, whereas in C2Na2 (for the transient currents) the IC50 is lower, as indicated by the arrows. The gray illustrations show the GABA transport modes of the transporter are not dealt with in this study and the Cl− is omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Li+-induced leak current is strongly rectifying; the current does not commence until the membrane potential of the GAT-1 expressing oocyte has been hyperpolarized to a value more negative than −50 mV, although the electrochemical potential for Li+ would dictate an inward current arising at a much more positive potential. We previously hypothesized that the Li+-occupied transporter in the face of a hyperpolarized potential (more negative than −50 mV) would change into a “leaky” conformation, in which the transporter acts as a channel (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To verify this hypothesis experimentally we employed the voltage clamp fluorometry method in the present study. By labeling Cys74 of the GAT-1-expressing oocytes with a fluorescent dye, TRM6M, we have shown that the Li+-bound transporter undergoes voltage-dependent conformational changes that reflect the voltage dependence of the Li+-induced leak current. We therefore propose that the leak state arises at membrane potentials more negative than −50 mV due to a voltage-dependent conformational change from a Li+-bound “tight” conformation to a leaky conformation (Fig. 7, C1Li ↔ C1LiO). This conformational change occurs in two steps: a very quick voltage-dependent opening of the Li+ conductance pathway followed by a slower conformational change (monitored by fluorescence with a time constant of 25–50 ms, Fig. 4B). The parameters describing these two processes are not identical as revealed by the small displacement of the V0.5 values for GLi and ΔFLi (seen in Fig. 4A).Earlier findings of a Li+-induced increase in open probability of single-channel activity in the related serotonin transporter (38Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the lack of water co-transport in the Li+-induced leak mode of GAT-1 (8MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), taken together with saturation of the voltage-dependent fluorescence changes associated with the conversion from one conformation to another (as opposed to a continuous transport cycle mode) points to the Li+-induced leak current as a channel mode of operation. The lack of a Na+-induced leak current in the GABA transporter is, according to the model, explained by the specificity and high apparent Na+ affinity of the second cation-binding site: with Na+ present (even a few millimolar), the transporter will primarily occupy the C2 state, in which the transporter does not exhibit leakage (Fig. 7). As mentioned above, the lack of a Na+-induced leak current is specific to GAT-1 as related transporters, such as serotonin transporter (9Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), display Na+-dependent transient currents upon step jumps in membrane potential (4Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These capacitive transient currents are thought to reflect the transport protein altering its conformational equilibrium between the inward-facing empty transporter (C6), the outward facing empty transporter (C0), and the Na+-bound transporter (C1 and C2) (4Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As we are not able to resolve the individual steps, the resulting time constants could reflect any of the three transitions or a combination thereof. In the present study we have shown that the Na+-dependent fluorescence changes upon voltage jumps reflect the voltage dependence and the time constant of the Na+-dependent transient currents. Thus the local conformational changes at the external surface of TM1 follow a similar time course and voltage sensitivity of the conformational changes associated with the transient currents.In addition, we have shown that the conformational changes (detected by changes in fluorescence intensity) in the absence of cations such as Na+ and Li+ can be driven by voltage. The accompanying charge movement is very small or very fast, if any, and beyond the resolution of the current measurements. We assign these conformational changes to the empty transporter alternating between the inward-facing C6 and the outward-facing C0 (16Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 40Bicho A. Grewer C. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 211-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). But given the large voltage-dependent fluorescence intensity changes in the presence of Na+ and Li+ as compared with NMDG, the local environment of the fluorophore experiences the largest changes in the steps involving cation interaction. The time constant of the fluorescence change in NMDG-Cl buffer was around 80 ms and independent of membrane potential. This is compatible with the overall transport rate, estimated to be 5–10 s−1 (4Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Liu Y. Eckstein-Ludwig U. Fei J. Schwarz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1415: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this distinct C6 ↔ C0 transition rate might very well be highly dependent on the concentration of extracellular Na+ (as the apparent Na+ affinity of the first cation binding site is highly voltage dependent (42Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) and therefore be much faster during GABA-transport.Inhibition by SKF89976AIf GAT-1 does indeed occupy two distinct conformations in the presence of Na+ and Li+, one could speculate that the GAT-1-specific inhibitor SKF89976A would interact differently with those conformations, resulting in different IC50 values. It has previously been shown for the serotonin transporter that replacing external Na+ with Li+ induced a distinct conformation as well as a change in KD for cocaine (36Ni Y.G. Chen J.G.

The GAT-1-specific inhibitor SKF89976A has been shown to completely inhibit the GABA-coupled current as well as the transient currents in the micromolar range (7Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C.

New therapeutics targeting the toxin are required to reduce systemic anthrax-related fatalities. In particular, new insights into the LF catalytic mechanism will be useful for the development of LF inhibitors. We evaluated the minimal length required for formation of bona fide LF substrates using substrate phage display. Phage-based selection yielded a substrate that is cleaved seven times more efficiently by LF than the peptide targeted in the protein kinase MKK6. Site-directed mutagenesis within the metal-binding site in the LF active center and within phage-selected substrates revealed a complex pattern of LF-substrate interactions. The elementary steps of LF-mediated proteolysis were resolved by the stopped-flow technique. Pre-steady-state kinetics of LF proteolysis followed a four-step mechanism as follows: initial substrate binding, rearrangement of the enzyme-substrate complex, a rate-limiting cleavage step, and product release. Examination of LF interactions with metal ions revealed an unexpected activation of the protease by Ca(2+) and Mn(2+). Based on the available structural and kinetic data, we propose a model for LF-substrate interaction. Resolution of the kinetic and structural parameters governing LF activity may be exploited to design new LF inhibitors."

Consequently, a globular substrate must be unfolded by the associated ATPase complex to be translocated and digested within the 20 S particle. PAN and the six ATPases found at the base of the 19 S particle are members of the AAA+ superfamily of multimeric ATPases which also includes the ATP-dependent proteases Lon and FtsH and the regulatory components of the bacterial ATP-dependent proteases ClpAP, ClpXP, and HslUV (8Baumeister W.

Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For mechanistic studies of the roles of ATP, the simpler archaeal PAN-20 S system offers many technical advantages over the much more complex 26 S proteasome. For example, prior studies of PAN (17Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated that unfolding of globular substrates (e.g. green fluorescent protein-ssrA) requires ATP hydrolysis. The same was also shown for the Escherichia coli ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP (23Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and ClpAP (24Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We have also shown that unfolding by PAN can take place on the surface of the ATPase ring in the absence of translocation (15Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, unfolding seems to proceed independently from protein translocation into the 20 S proteolytic particle. It is noteworthy that other studies suggest that proteins are unfolded by energy-dependent translocation through the ATPase ring (25Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 26Matouschek A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that the translocation of an unfolded polypeptide from the ATPase into the 20 S core is an active process that is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. A key to underline a detailed molecular mechanism for substrate binding, unfolding, and translocation by the proteasome regulatory ATPase complex is improved understanding of its architecture and the nucleotide-dependent structural transitions that afford these functions. To date we and others have failed to generate micrographs suitable for three-dimensional reconstruction of PAN using single-particle EM analysis. Likewise, structural information regarding the three-dimensional architecture and subunit organization within the 19 S particle is very limited. In fact, high resolution three-dimensional information on the 19 S complex is not yet available. Most knowledge available is based on cross-linking experiments (11Hendil K.B. Hartmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Hartmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. Hendil K.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as EM structural analysis (7Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct.

Chem. 2008; 283: 23305-23314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which provided a three-dimensional model outline of the general architecture of the 26 S complex. Unlike the 19 S complex, the structure of the 20 S subcomplex was determined by x-ray crystallography (18Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 19Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). In contrast to the highly homogenous structure of the 20 S complex, the structural heterogeneity and flexibility of the 19 S subcomplex is presumably reflected in multiple conformations, which in turn also contribute to the difficulty in generating a high resolution three-dimensional structural model of the 26 S proteasome. Accordingly, the initial goal of this study was to generate a three-dimensional model of PAN that will allow us to determine its general architecture and to correlate unique conformational transitions within this ATPase with the nucleotide state of the complex (i.e. in the presence of ATPγS, ADP, or in the absence of nucleotides). Smith et al. (27Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol.

Based on side-view projections of that complex, these authors proposed that PAN assumes an overall structure similar to E. coli HslU (28Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Müller S.A. Huang H.C.

We realized that although PAN appears heterogeneous in electron micrographs, it does not occupy all possible orientations when adsorbed to carbon-coated electron microscopy (EM) grids, a prerequisite for single particle analysis. This problem was overcome by applying electron tomography in conjunction with a three-dimensional averaging procedure that accounts for the missing wedge in the Fourier space of electron tomograms (31Beck M.

Baumeister W. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4729-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional model generated revealed an unexpected architecture leading to a possible molecular mechanism describing the function of PAN and presumably the 19 S ATPases. PAN was purified according to Navon and Goldberg (15Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits of the MJ 20 S proteasome were cloned into the pET22 plasmid downstream of the T7 promoter. The MJ 20 S complex was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by heating the resuspended bacterial pellet (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and removing the aggregated E. coli proteins by centrifugation. The cleared lysate was loaded onto an anion exchange column (Mono Q), and PAN-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. For electron tomography, an aliquot of PAN was diluted into buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm MgCl2) to a final protein concentration of 25 μg/ml. When stated, the mixture was also complemented with 50 μm ATPγS, ADP, or no nucleotide. A 5-μl drop was applied onto 200 mesh carbon-coated copper grids. The specimens were transferred into a Phillips CM 200 FEG microscope equipped with a 2k TVIPS CCD camera. Data were collected in a fully automated manner using TVIPS tomography software. Tilt series were collected, typically covering an angular range from −60° to 60°, and sampled at 2° tilt increments with a 2-μm underfocus. The pixel size was 0.41 nm at the specimen level, which corresponds to a magnification of ×27,500. All image processing operations were carried out with the EM package (33Harauz G. Cicicopol C. Hegerl R. Cejka Z. Goldie K. Santarius U. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the TOM- and av3-toolbox (32Förster F. Medalia O.

Baumeister W. Plitzko J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) for Matlab (MathWorks). A total number of 500 single particle-containing sub-tomograms of PAN-ATPγS volumes, 450 of PAN-ADP, 500 of PAN without nucleotide, and 250 of PAN Δ1–73 volumes were selected. The sub-tomograms containing particle volumes were extracted in silico and subjected to a three-dimensional averaging procedure (32Förster F. Medalia O. Zauberman N. Baumeister W. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4729-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The resolutions of the different PAN structures were determined by Fourier shell correlation with 0.5 criteria. After a few iterations, the 6-fold symmetry of the structure became apparent. Therefore, imposed 6-fold symmetry was used in the refinement iterations. The PAN-ATPγS structure was resolved to 2.0-nm resolution, whereas the structures of PAN-ADP and PAN without nucleotide were resolved to 2.3 nm each. The PAN Δ1–73 structure was resolved to 2.5 nm. Three-dimensional surface-rendered visualizations were created with Amira 3.1 (TGS). Electron micrographs were recorded digitally using a FEI Polara microscope equipped with a GIF energy filter (Gatan), a CCD camera at 1.5 μm underfocus, and a pixel size of 0.41 nm. A set of 1157 images of negatively stained proteasomes were aligned and averaged using the single particle procedures of the EM software package (33Harauz G. Cicicopol C. Hegerl R. Cejka Z. Goldie K. Santarius U. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded as above. A set of 7000 images of negatively stained complexes were analyzed with the EMAN package (35Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The images were low pass-filtered at 1.7 nm (below the first zero of the contrast transfer function). The structure was resolved to 2 nm of resolution, determined by Fourier shell correlation with 0.5 criteria. The unfolding and degradation of YFP-ssrA was monitored by recording fluorescence over time. The reactions were performed in buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 30 mm KCl) at 45 °C. YFP-ssrA was excited at 485 nm, and fluorescence emission was recorded at 529 nm. Unless stated differently, the final concentration of YFP-ssrA in a typical reaction was 10 μm, and PAN-20 S complexes were present at a final concentration of 16 nm. To gain insight into how substrates interact with PAN and how the conformation of PAN is affected by ATP binding and hydrolysis, we undertook an integrative approach combining biochemistry and structural analysis. Three-dimensional reconstruction of PAN (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1 and movie (PAN ATPγS.mpg)) indicated that the hexameric complex assumes a two-ring structure with a large cavity in its center. Fig. 1A depicts successive 0.4-nm-thick slices through the reconstructed volume of the PAN complex in the presence of ATPγS. The two rings have similar thicknesses of about 3 nm each, with connecting stems that converge in the mid-plane of the complex to form six symmetrical protruding “spikes” (Fig. 1Bc). Overall, the complex has a diameter of 14.5 nm and a height of 9.5 nm. It is noteworthy that two-dimensional projection of our three-dimensional model (see Fig. 7B) resembles the view seen by Smith et al. (27Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Three-dimensional model of the MJ PAN-20 S complex.

B, projection view through the PAN-20 S complex demonstrating spatial interactions between the MJ 20 S proteasome and PAN. The dimensions of the pseudo-ring and the cavity in the C-terminal ring of PAN allow direct interaction between the N-terminal region of the α-ring and the C-terminal residues of PAN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the structure depicted in Fig. 1B represents the architecture of a single hexameric PAN complex rather than that of a dodecamer (a dimer of hexamers), we determined the molecular weight of the complex by mass spectrometry. The detected mass of 294,570 ± 23 Da agrees with the predicted molecular mass of a single hexameric complex (36Medalia N. Sharon M. Martinez-Arias R. Mihalache O. Robinson C.V. Medalia O. Zwickl P. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, to verify this result and localize the N and the C domains of the subunits in the complex, we engineered a mutant of PAN in which each of the subunits lacks the first 73 residues (PAN Δ1–73). We reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of this deletion mutant under similar conditions as employed with wild type PAN (supplemental movie PAN Δ1–73.mpg). As depicted in Fig. 1C, the bottom ring did not change, maintaining the same dimensions as in wild type PAN (compare Fig. 1, Bb to Cb). By contrast, the top ring was altered in response to the N-terminal deletions, with the “shoulders” supporting the connecting stems between the two rings being contracted and the protruding spikes becoming less pronounced. Thus, the sequence of PAN encodes for a protein, which upon oligomerization forms a structure comprising two rings. One ring, reminiscent in structure of the classical AAA domain (37Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), depicted in Fig. 1Bb, is presumably formed by the C-terminal domains of the six PAN monomers (residues 160–430, based on homology models). An additional ring (Fig. 1Ba) is assembled by the N-terminal domains of the monomers (residues 1–160, based on the predicated N-terminal coiled-coil sequence and N-terminal deletion mutants). In addition, the data also demonstrate that the coiled-coil region (or at least part of it) contributes to the formation of the spikes seen in the side view of the PAN complex (Fig. 1Bc) and appear to be trimmed in the ΔN mutant (Fig. 1Cc). Despite the critical roles and conserved structural motifs shared by members of the AAA superfamily of ATPases, their mode of action is not well understood. In particular, the link between the ATPase catalytic cycle and the conformational changes responsible for the biological activity of these proteins has yet to be elucidated. Likewise, it is still unclear how nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and release by PAN promote substrate binding, unfolding, and translocation into the 20 S proteasome. To address these outstanding questions, we generated a three-dimensional model of PAN in the presence of ADP and in the absence of nucleotides. In the presence of ATPγS, PAN is presumably locked in a conformation similar to that of the ATP-bound state. The ADP-bound form simulates the conformation that PAN assumes upon nucleotide hydrolysis. The structure realized in the absence of nucleotide represents the conformation of the complex upon nucleotide release, before reloading with ATP. As shown in Fig. 2, although the overall structural character of PAN did not change, the size of the internal cavity of the complex contracted upon nucleotide hydrolysis (as reflected in the structure of PAN preincubated with ADP) and became even smaller in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 2B). In addition, the size and orientation of the spikes were also affected (Fig. 2C). As presented in Fig. 2C, the shoulders connecting the spikes to the top ring change their orientation and move inward upon ATP hydrolysis (i.e. the ADP state) and release (i.e. the no nucleotide state). We measured the dimensions of the upper ring by calculating the projection of these elements from averaged structures. The measured difference in radius between the ATPγS state and the “no nucleotide” state is about 2 nm (Fig. 2C), whereas in the presence of ADP the complex adopts an intermediate state. Together these data suggest that upon nucleotide binding (i.e. the ATPγS-bound state), PAN assumes a conformation in which the internal cavity is more accessible. Upon nucleotide hydrolysis, which probably occurs after or concomitantly with substrate entry into the internal chamber of the complex, the spikes change their conformation, presumably to exclude binding of additional substrate molecules. The expansion and contraction that are associated with nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and release may promote the unfolding of the globular domain trapped (or partially trapped) within the internal chamber of PAN. In the chaperonin GroEL, structural transitions are linked with direct nucleotide-dependent modulation of the hydrophobic character of the complex. To directly assess the hydrophobicity of the PAN complex in the various nucleotide-related states, we made use of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS). ANS is essentially non-fluorescent in water, only becoming appreciably fluorescent when bound to membranes (quantum yield ∼0.25) or proteins (quantum yield ∼0.7). These properties make ANS a sensitive indicator of conformational changes that modify the exposure of the probe to water (38Arighi C.N. Rossi J.P. Delfino J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16802-16814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39Raha T. Chattopadhyay D. Chattopadhyay D. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2110-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, this probe was previously used to correlate the hydrophobicity of the GroEL complex with specific nucleotide-associated conformations (40Smoot A.L. Panda M. Brazil B.T. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Kusmierczyk A.R. Martin J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 276: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We, thus, incubated PAN (1 μm) in the presence of ATPγS or ADP or in the absence of nucleotides in standard reaction buffer complemented with ANS (5 μm). Fluorescence emission spectra (400–600 nm) were then recorded. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity of a reaction mixture containing PAN and ATPγS was about 50% (±8%) higher than that of PAN incubated in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3, left panel). Although the no nucleotide conformation appeared reproducibly to be about 5–10% more fluorescent than was the ADP-associated conformation, these differences were not statistically significant. Our findings, thus, predict that incubating PAN with ATP and ANS should initially confer a conformation similar to that of PAN in the presence of ATPγS, reflected by high ANS fluorescence. Over time, as ATP is being hydrolyzed, the conformation would shift into the ADP-bound state, and ANS fluorescence intensity should drop accordingly. Indeed, as observed in Fig. 3 (right panel), the initial fluorescent intensity of ANS incubated with PAN and ATP was reduced over time, whereas the intensity of fluorescence of a similar sample incubated with ADP (or ATPγS) remained unchanged. Thus, the hydrophobic character of PAN increases as the internal cavity of PAN expands in response to nucleotide binding (i.e. the ATPγS state) and decreases upon nucleotide hydrolysis, with the associated reduction of PAN internal chamber volume (i.e. the ADP state). Our structural analysis reveals that the opening in the C-terminal portion of the PAN complex is gated, as density is detected at the center of the bottom ring (Fig. 1Bb). However, we cannot exclude the existence of a low density region at the center of the bottom ring. Such an opening would have been revealed only through higher resolution structural det"
