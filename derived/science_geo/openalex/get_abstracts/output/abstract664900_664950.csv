https://openalex.org/W3110811149,"Background Characterizing the prevalence and persistence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection following hospitalization and their impact is essential to planning post-acute community-based clinical services. This study seeks to identify persistent COVID-19 symptoms in patients 35 days post-hospitalization and their impact on quality of life, health, physical, mental, and psychosocial function. Methods and findings This prospective cohort study used the PROMIS® Instruments to identify symptoms and quality of life parameters in consecutively enrolled patients between March 22 and April 16, 2020, in New Jersey. The 183 patients (median age 57 years; 61.5% male, 54.1% white) reported persistent symptoms at 35 days, including fatigue (55.0%), dyspnea (45.3%), muscular pain (51%), associated with a lower odds rating general health (41.5%, OR 0.093 [95% CI: 0.026, 0.329], p = 0.0002), quality of life (39.8%; OR 0.116 [95% CI: 0.038, 0.364], p = 0.0002), physical health (38.7%, OR 0.055 [95% CI: 0.016, 0.193], p &lt;0.0001), mental health (43.7%, OR 0.093 [95% CI: 0.021, 0.418], p = 0.0019) and social active role (38.7%, OR 0.095 [95% CI: 0.031, 0.291], p&lt;0.0001), as very good/excellent, particularly adults aged 65 to 75 years (OR 8·666 [95% CI: 2·216, 33·884], p = 0·0019). Conclusions COVID-19 symptoms commonly persist to 35 days, impacting quality of life, health, physical and mental function. Early post-acute evaluation of symptoms and their impact on function is necessary to plan community-based services."
https://openalex.org/W3112989088,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earth’s social-ecological systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples’ relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking, jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as “Nurture and Recreation values” and “Inspiration and Nourishment values.” Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents’ preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are statistically associated with some demographic characteristics, including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and associated values that people perceive as most important may vary between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises."
https://openalex.org/W3111421574,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent infectious pathogen causing an acute respiratory disease called corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Virus transmission may occur by contact, droplet, airborne or via contaminated surfaces. In efforts to effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak, the world health organization (WHO) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) have advised the public to practice protective measures to reduce transmission of the virus and reduce incidence of infection. These measures include hand washing, wearing masks and gloves and avoidance of touching the face with unwashed hands. The current study aimed to investigate knowledge and adherence of the Saudi population to these protective actions during the pandemic. After determining the required sample size using power analysis, a cross-sectional online self-reported survey of 5105 Saudi residents was conducted between 25 th March to 17 th April 2020 to evaluate public knowledge of COVID-19. Participants were all aged 18 years or above, Arabic speakers and residents of Saudi Arabia. Scores were calculated based on knowledge and adherence of the individuals to protective measures. About 90% of participants exhibited a high level of knowledge (scored 2/2) and practice (scored &gt; 3/6) in relation to hand hygiene and wearing gloves and masks. Practice scores were positively associated with females and individuals with high income. Lower practice scores were linked to youth and residents of the northern and western regions of the Kingdom. Over two thirds of participants preferred hand washing to alcohol disinfection, and the frequency and performance of hand washing improved during the pandemic for more than half of respondents. Overall, the findings reflected high public knowledge of SARS-CoV2 transmission routes and adherence to personal protective measures. However, public awareness campaigns with an emphasis on the youth and individuals with low education and income are required to improve overall practice."
https://openalex.org/W3112968517,"Background On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, many changes have been implicated in university medical students. We are cognizant that pandemic can be controlled with dedicated contributions from all involved in the healthcare profession. Therefore, it is important to know the pandemic and application of knowledge by the medical students to formulate a further line of management in Pakistan. Objective We aimed toinvestigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 and its impact on medical students of Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020 by a validated self—administered questionnaire. The survey instrument was tailored from a published questionnaire comprised of questions on demographics (6), knowledge (14), attitudes (4), and practices (6). Results Of the 1474 medical students in the study, 576(39.1%) were males, and 898(60.1%) were females. Two-thirds of the participants 1057(71.7%) had adequate knowledge, and almost all the students had positive attitudes (1363(92.5%), and good practices 1406(95.4%) to COVID-19. Two-thirds of the medical students 1023(69%) believed that the COVID-19 outbreak had affected their social, mental, and psychological well-being. One-quarter of the medical students 391(26%) become more religious, 597(40%) realized the importance of life, and 1140(77%) became careless because of the pandemic. The female medical students were 2.545 times (p &lt; .001) and 4.414 times (p &lt; .001) more likely to have positive attitudes and good practices toward COVID-19 as compared to males. Conclusion Medical students, especially females and senior year scholars, were well-versed with desired levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preventive measures toward COVID-19. Most of them recognized COVID 19, is shaping their social, mental, and psychological well-being and encroaching on the healthcare system and economy. The information acquired by the KAP study may help to devise effective preventive strategies for future events."
https://openalex.org/W3110704279,"Introduction Respiratory tract diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of 5 years, constituting the highest rate of hospitalization in this age group. Objectives To determine the prevalence of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in childhood in the last 5 years and to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 on the seasonal behavior of these diseases. Methods A cross-sectional clinical study was carried out, with a survey of all patients aged 0 to 17 years who were admitted with a diagnosis of respiratory diseases between January 2015 and July 2020. The database was delivered to the researchers anonymized. The variables used for analysis were date of admission, date of discharge, length of stay, age, sex and diagnosis. In order to make the analysis possible, the diagnoses were grouped into upper respiratory infection (URI), asthma / bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Results 2236 admissions were included in the study. Children under 5 years old account for 81% of hospitalizations for respiratory disease in our population. In the adjusted model, an average reduction of 38 hospitalizations was observed in the period of social isolation (coefficient: -37.66; 95% CI (- 68.17; -7.15); p = 0.016). Conclusion The social isolation measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically interfered with the seasonality of childhood respiratory diseases. This was reflected in the unexpected reduction in the number of hospitalizations in the pediatric population during this period."
https://openalex.org/W3112608185,"The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey comprised of 1222 participants was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% took medicines, 57.6% took herbal foods/products, and 11.2% took both medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measure against Covid-19. Arsenicum album, vitamin supplements, and zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal foods/products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, paracetamol, antihistamines, antibiotics, and mineral (zinc and calcium) supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of certain drugs was identified."
https://openalex.org/W3112680699,"Introduction Influenza morbidity and mortality are significant in the countries of South America, yet influenza vaccination is as low as 56.7% among pregnant women, reaching 76.7% of adults with chronic diseases. This article measures the relative values for the vaccination hesitancy indicators of confidence, complacency and convenience by risk-groups in urban areas of five countries of South America with contrasting vaccination rates, analyzing their association with sociodemographic variables and self-reported immunization status. Methods An exit survey was applied to 640 individuals per country in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, distributed equally across risk groups of older adults, adults with risk factors, children ≤6 and pregnant women. Indicators were constructed for vaccine confidence, complacency and convenience. Analysis of variance and multiple logistic analysis was undertaken. Results Adults with risk factors are somewhat more confident of the influenza vaccine yet also more complacent. Convenience is higher for mothers of minors. Children and older adults report higher levels of vaccination. The 3Cs are more different across countries than across risk groups, with values for Chile higher for confidence and those for Uruguay the lowest. Complacency is lower in Brazil and higher in Uruguay. Results suggest that confidence and complacency affect vaccination rates across risk groups and countries. Conclusions Influenza vaccine confidence, complacency and convenience have to be bolstered to improve effective coverage across all risk groups in the urban areas of the countries studied. The role played by country contextual and national vaccination programs has to be further researched in relation to effective coverage of influenza vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3111393583,"Background Dioscorea bulbifera L. (Dioscoreaceae) has been traditionally used in Thai folk medicine as a diuretic and anthelmintic, for longevity preparations, and for wound and inflammation treatment. This plant is also commonly used in traditional Indian and Chinese medicines in the treatment of sore throat, gastric cancer, rectal carcinoma and goiters. However, the wound healing effects of the active compounds in this plant have not been investigated. Objective This study aimed to identify compounds responsible for the wound healing activity of D . bulbifera and determine their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Methods Crude extracts of D . bulbifera bulbils, their derived fractions and eleven purified compounds were tested for anti-inflammatory activity against LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 macrophages. The wound healing effects were evaluated via cell proliferation and migration assays using human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and the antioxidant effects were determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical ( • OH) scavenging activity assays. Results 15,16-Epoxy-6α- O -acetyl-8β-hydroxy-19-nor-clero-13(16),14-diene-17,12;18,2-diolide ( 2 ), (+)-catechin ( 5 ), quercetin ( 6 ) and myricetin ( 11 ) exhibited significantly potent wound healing effects and promoted marked cell proliferation, resulting in % viabilities of 107.4–137.6, 121.1–151.9, 98.0–131.9, 90.9–115.9, respectively. Among them, (+)-catechin produced the highest % cell migration, resulting in 100.0% wound closure sooner (at day 2) than the other compounds. In addition, 1 μg/ml (+)-catechin significantly increased fibroblast migration by 2.4-fold compared to that in the control after 24 h. Regarding anti-inflammatory properties, kaempferol ( 7 ) and quercetin ( 6 ) decreased ( p &lt; 0.005) NO production, with IC 50 values of 46.6 and 56.2 μM, respectively. In addition, the crude extracts, solvent fractions and flavonoid compounds were also found to possess marked antioxidant activity in both DPPH and • OH radical scavenging assays. Conclusions These findings provide more evidence to support the traditional use of D . bulbifera for the treatment of wounds and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3110831965,"Purpose To quantitatively assess choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits in eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR) using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). Methods Diabetic subjects with different stages of DR and age-matched healthy subjects were recruited and imaged with SS-OCTA. The en face CC blood flow images were generated using previously published and validated algorithms. The percentage of CC flow deficits (FD%) and the mean CC flow deficit size were calculated in a 5-mm-diameter circle centered on the fovea from the 6×6-mm scans. Results Forty-five diabetic subjects and 27 control subjects were included in the study. The CC FD% in diabetic eyes was on average 1.4-fold greater than in control eyes (12.34±4.14% vs 8.82±2.61%, P &lt; 0.001). The mean CC FD size in diabetic eyes was on average 1.4-fold larger than in control eyes (2151.3± 650.8μm 2 vs 1574.4±255.0 μm 2 , P &lt; 0.001). No significant difference in CC FD% or mean CC FD size was observed between eyes with nonproliferative DR and eyes with proliferative DR ( P = 1.000 and P = 1.000, respectively). Conclusions CC perfusion in DR can be objectively and quantitatively assessed with FD% and FD size. In the macular region, both CC FD% and CC FD size are increased in eyes with DR. SS-OCTA provides new insights for the investigations of CC perfusion status in diabetes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3112326024,"Online education has grown rapidly in recent years with many universities now offering fully online degree programs even in STEM disciplines. These programs have the potential to broaden access to STEM degrees for people with social identities currently underrepresented in STEM. Here, we ask to what extent is that potential realized in terms of student enrollment and grades for a fully online degree program. Our analysis of data from more than 10,000 course-enrollments compares student demographics and course grades in a fully online biology degree program to demographics and grades in an equivalent in-person biology degree program at the same university. We find that women, first-generation to college students and students eligible for federal Pell grants constitute a larger proportion of students in the online program compared to the in-person mode. However, the online mode of instruction is associated with lower course grades relative to the in-person mode. Moreover, African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, and Pacific Islander students as well as federal Pell grant eligible students earned lower grades than white students and non-Pell grant eligible students, respectively, but the grade disparities were similar among both in-person and online student groups. Finally, we find that grade disparities between men and women are larger online compared to in-person, but that for first-generation to college women, the online mode of instruction is associated with little to no grade gap compared to continuing generation women. Our findings indicate that although this online degree program broadens access for some student populations, inequities in the experience remain and need to be addressed in order for online education to achieve its inclusive mission."
https://openalex.org/W3113276559,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the globe. In the absence of a vaccine, a small number of countries have managed to control the diffusion of viruses by early detection and early quarantine. South Korea, one of the countries which have kept the epidemics well-controlled, has opened the infected patients’ trajectory to the public. Such a reaction has been regarded as an effective method, however, serious privacy breach cases have been issued in South Korea. Furthermore, some suspected contacts have refused to take infection tests because they are afraid of being exposed. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving contact tracing method based on spatio-temporal trajectory which can be practically used in many quarantine systems. In addition, we develop a system to visualize the contact tracing workflow."
https://openalex.org/W3111894284,"Some children are more susceptible to viral and bacterial respiratory infections in the first few years of life than others. However, the factors contributing to this susceptibility are incompletely understood. In a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 358 children we sought associations between physician-attended illness visits and bacterial colonization in the first five years of life. A subset of children was identified by unsupervised clustering analysis as infection and allergy prone (IAP). Several respiratory infection- and allergy-mediated illnesses co-occurred at higher rates in IAP children, while the rates of other illnesses were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses of nasopharyngeal (NP) pathobionts and microbiota commensals showed that early age of first colonization with pathobionts Streptococcus pneumonia , non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis was associated with IAP children, and particularly Moraxella abundance was negatively associated with NP microbiome diversity. We conclude that mucosal pathobiont exposures in early life can influence susceptibility to respiratory illnesses in children."
https://openalex.org/W3111831773,"Knife crime is a source of concern for the police in England and Wales, however little published research exists on this crime type. Who are the offenders who use knives to commit crime, when and why? Who are their victims, and is there a victim-offender overlap? What is the social network formation for people who are exposed to knife crime? Using a multidimensional approach, our aim is to answer these questions about one of England and Wales’ largest jurisdictions: Thames Valley. We first provide a state-of-the-art narrative review of the knife crime literature, followed by an analysis of population-level data on central tendency and dispersion of knife crimes reported to the police (2015–2019), on offences, offenders, victims, victim-offender overlaps and gang-related assaults. Social network analysis was used to explore the formations of offender-victim networks. Our findings show that knife crime represents a small proportion of crime (1.86%) and is associated largely with violence offenses. 16–34 year-old white males are at greatest risk of being the victims, offenders or victim-offenders of knife crime, with similar relative risks between these three categories. Both knife offenders and victims are likely to have a criminal record. Knife crimes are usually not gang-related (less than 20%), and experienced mostly between strangers, with the altercation often a non-retaliatory ‘one-off event’. Even gang-related knife crimes do not follow ‘tit-for-tat’ relationships—except when the individuals involved have extensive offending histories and then are likely to retaliate instantaneously. We conclude that while rare, an incident of knife crime remains predicable, as a substantial ratio of offenders and victims of future knife crime can be found in police records. Prevention strategies should not be focused on gang-related criminals, but on either prolific violent offenders or repeat victims who are known to the police—and therefore more susceptible to knife crime exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3113288900,"Coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) naturally growing in southern Oregon and northern California is one of the few conifer tree species that are polyploid. Despite its unique ecological and economic importance, its population genetic structure is still insufficiently studied. To obtain additional data on its population genetic structure we genotyped 317 samples collected from populations in California (data set C) and 144 trees growing in a provenance trial in France (data set F) using 12 nuclear (five random nuclear genomic nSSRs and seven expressed sequence tag EST-SSRs) and six chloroplast (cpSSRs) microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, respectively. These data sets were also used as reference to infer the origin of 147 coast redwood trees growing in Germany (data set G). Coast redwood was introduced to Europe, including Germany as an ornamental species, decades ago. Due to its fast growth and high timber quality, it could be considered as a potential commercial timber species, especially in perspective to climate warming that makes more regions in Germany suitable for its growing. The well performing trees in colder Germany could be potential frost resistant genotypes, but their genetic properties and origin are mostly unknown. Within the natural range in southern Oregon and northern California, only two relatively weak clusters were identified, one northern and one southern, separated by the San Francisco Bay. High genetic diversity, but low differentiation was found based on the 12 nuclear SSR markers for all three data sets F, C and G. We found that investigated 147 German trees represented only 37 different genotypes. They showed genetic diversity at the level less than diversity observed within the natural range in the northern or southern cluster, but more similar to the diversity observed in the southern cluster. It was difficult to assign German trees to the original single native populations using the six cpSSR markers, but rather to either the northern or southern cluster. The high number of haplotypes found in the data sets based on six cpSSR markers and low genetic differentiation based on 12 nuclear SSRs found in this study helps us study and better understand population genetic structure of this complex polyploid tree and supports the selection of potential genotypes for German forestry."
https://openalex.org/W3112221996,"Demographic factors, such as population aging and shrinkage, and non-demographic factors, such as hospitalization rate and length of hospital stay, generate challenges for inpatient care. This paper used decomposition analysis to assess how changes in these factors affected the number of hospital treatment days from 2000 to 2015 in Germany. Demographic aging was linked to increases in the number of treatment days for women (+10.0%) and men (+19.2%) and in hospitalization rates for women +6.0% and men +5.4%. However, these increases were offset by decreases in the number of hospital days (women: 16.5%; men: 7.3%) and length of stay (women: -27.4%; men -26.3%). For the projection up to 2040, 12 scenarios were developed (six for women and six for men) using three variants for future population demographics and two variants for future length of stay and hospitalization rates. One of the two variants for future length of stay and hospitalization rates provides for a constant value for the year 2015. For the second of these two variants variant, a logarithmic model was estimated on the basis of values from 2000 to 2015. and the trends were extrapolated using this model until 2040. The strongest overall predicted increase was 18.4% between 2015 and 2040, including a 22.4% increase for men. In two scenarios for women, only slight declines were predicted. All results, both for the decomposition analysis and projection, indicated a moderate but sustained effect of demographic aging on the number of hospital treatment days, leading to a significant increase in hospital treatment days over the study period. Non-demographic factors also had strong influences, especially in shorter time periods, but these effects offset each other over time. The change in the population size in the period under study had very little effect on the number of hospital treatment days."
https://openalex.org/W3112237375,"Malaria still continues to be the most important parasitic disease worldwide, affecting 228 million people and causing 405,000 deaths each year. In this retrospective study during 2013 to 2018, we documented the incidence of imported malaria infection and evaluated the impact of malaria preventive measures in Kuwait, a non-endemic country. The epidemiologic and demographic data of all malaria cases was collected from the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Kuwait where all suspected cases of malaria are referred for confirmation and therapeutic intervention. The diagnosis of malaria infection was done by microscopy of Giemsa stained blood films. Selected samples were retested with BinaxNOW ® Malaria rapid test and molecular assay to reconfirm the Plasmodium spp. or mixed infection. Overall, 1913 (25.9%) malaria cases were detected, 81.5% of which were among male subjects. Male subjects had higher incidence of P . vivax malaria (113; 91.1%) and mixed infection with P . falciparum and P . vivax (1245; 90.0%) compared to females who had higher rate of P . falciparum infection (52.4%). An overwhelming majority of malaria cases (1895; 99.1%) were detected among expatriates from malaria-endemic countries; India (1012; 52.9%), Pakistan (390; 20.4%), Afghanistan (94; 4.9%) and African countries (313; 16.3%). Only 18 cases involved Kuwaiti nationals, all with a history of travel to African countries. The majority of malaria cases were detected during the summer and fall months (May-October). Our data showed that the incidence rate of imported malaria cases was stable during 2013 to 2018, however, the incidence of total malaria cases showed a declining trend over the years. This study confirms that the preventive program has been successful in reducing the incidence of imported malaria infections in Kuwait. The most striking finding of this study was high incidence of mixed infection with P . falciparum and P . vivax , with almost all (97%) cases among workers from India."
https://openalex.org/W3113200690,"Purpose To assess the feasibility of the combined sorafenib (SOR) and doxorubicin-loaded microbubble-albumin nanoparticle complex (DOX-MAC) treatment effect in an orthotopic rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods Sixty-two rats with N1-S1 hepatoma were divided into four groups according to the treatment methods, i.e. G1 (SOR and DOX-MAC; n = 12), G2 (SOR; n = 15), G3 (DOX-MAC; n = 12), G4 (DOX; n = 11), and G5 (normal saline; n = 12). We performed the theragnostic, contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination and treatment at the baseline, one-week, and two-weeks. Tumor volume and perfusion parameters were compared at each time point and the differences between all of the groups over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. We also analyzed the apoptotic index and microvessel density (MVD) per each tumor specimen in all of the groups. Results The tumors increased from the beginning in all of the groups to the final follow-up, whereas the tumor growth in the G1 group and the G2 group was inhibited during the treatment period compared to the baseline tumor volume ( P = 0.016 and P = 0.031). The G1 group resulted in tumor growth inhibition compared to the control group ( P = 0.008). The G1 group showed that the peak enhancement and wash-in area under the curve were lower than that of the G4 group ( P = 0.010 and 0.022). However, there was no difference in perfusion parameters in the other treated group compared to control group. The MVD of the G1 group tumor was lower than that of the G4 group ( P = .016). Conclusion Our results suggest that the combination therapy of SOR and DOX-MAC can cause inhibition of tumor growth after treatment and that this therapy can be adequately monitored using the theragnostic DOX-MAC agent."
https://openalex.org/W3110780815,"This study aimed to develop a new computerized assessment battery for cognition (C-ABC) to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We performed C-ABC in subjects with dementia ( n = 422), MCI ( n = 145), and normal cognition (NC; n = 574), and analyzed by age stratum (50s, 60s, and 70–85 years). To distinguish MCI from NC, the C-ABC total combined score, which were calculated by dividing the C-ABC total score by the C-ABC required time, revealed the best area under the curves (AUC) at 0.838 and 0.735 in the 50s and 60s age groups, respectively; notably, this entire procedure took approximately 5 min. To distinguish dementia from NC and MCI, the partial items of C-ABC (items 3 + 6 combined score) revealed the best AUCs at 0.910, 0.874, and 0.882 in the 50s, 60s, and 70–85 age groups, respectively. Furthermore, the items 3 + 6 combined score established the best AUC at 0.794 in the 70–85 age group to distinguish MCI from NC; this entire procedure took around 2 min. Hence, this study suggests that C-ABC could be a useful tool for detecting dementia or MCI in a short time."
https://openalex.org/W3110927728,"Background The limited knowledge on aetiology, epidemiology and risk factors for multimorbidity especially evident from low and middle-income countries curtail the development and implementation of sustainable healthcare models. Sri Lanka, boasting for one of South Asia’s most efficient public health systems that is accessible free-of-charge by the citizens is presently transitioning from lower-middle to upper-middle-income tier. Faced with the triple burden of disease, it is imperative for Sri Lanka to incorporate an integrated model to manage multimorbidity. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in medical clinics of a tertiary care hospital and a University primary care department. Data were extracted on to a form from the clinical records of patients over the age of 20 years with at least one non-communicable disease (NCD) and analysed. Results Multimorbidity was present among 64.1% of patients (n = 1600). Nearly 44.44% of the patients aged 20–35 years have a minimum of two disorders, and by the time they reach 50 years, nearly 64% of the patients have two or more non-communicable diseases. Nearly 7% of those aged over 65 years were diagnosed with four or more disorders. A fourth of the sample was affected by co-morbid diabetes mellitus and hypertension, whereas the combinations of coronary heart disease with hypertension and diabetes mellitus were also found to be significantly prevalent. A salient revelation of the binomial logistic regression analysis was that the number of disorders was positively correlated to the presence of mental disorders 7.25 (95% CI = 5.82–8.68). Conclusion Multimorbidity is highly prevalent among this population and seemingly has a detrimental effect on the psychological wellbeing of those affected. Therefore, the need for horizontal integration of all primary to tertiary care disciplines, including mental health, to manage multimorbidity by policymakers is emphasized as a priority task."
https://openalex.org/W3111202673,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat in humans and animals, and antimicrobial usage (AMU) has been identified as a main trigger of AMR. The purpose of this work was to compare data on AMR in clinical and non-clinical isolates of Escherichia coli in German broilers and turkeys between 2014 and 2017. Furthermore, we investigated AMR changes over time and the association of changes in AMU with changes in AMR. Data on clinical and non-clinical isolates together with data on therapy frequency of broilers and turkeys were collected from German monitoring systems. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the explanatory factors (AMU, year and isolate type) and the dependent variable (AMR). In broilers, the analysis showed lower resistance proportions of clinical isolates of E . coli to ampicillin and colistin (ampicillin: Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44 (0.3–0.64), p &lt;0.001; colistin: OR and 95% CI = 0.75 (0.73–0.76), p &lt;0.001) but higher proportions for cefotaxime (OR and 95% CI = 4.58 (1.56–15.1), p = 0.007). Resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and tetracycline was less frequent in clinical isolates in turkeys (ampicillin: OR and 95% CI = 0.4 (0.29–0.53), p &lt;0.001; gentamicin: OR and 95% CI = 0.5 (0.26–0.94), p = 0.035; tetracycline: OR and 95% CI = 0.4 (0.29–0.55), p &lt;0.001). The analysis found decreasing associations of AMU with resistance to tetracycline in turkeys and to colistin in broilers. Year was associated with a decrease in resistance to colistin in broilers and to tetracycline in turkeys. Differences in resistance found in this study between clinical and non-clinical isolates might play an important role in resistance prevalence. This study indicated that further data analyses over longer time intervals are required to clarify the differences found between clinical and non-clinical isolates and to assess the long-term effects of changes in AMU on the prevalence of AMR."
https://openalex.org/W3113363809,"In this study, we investigated the changes in the distribution and regulation of endogenous hormones in Phyllostachys edulis ‘Pachyloen’ during bamboo shooting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the mass fractions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), zeatin riboside (ZR), and abscisic acid (ABA) in rhizomes, shoots, and maternal bamboo organs during shoot sprouting, shoot growth, and new-bamboo formation. Measurements were compared among bamboo parts and developmental periods. The overall mass fractions of IAA and ABA were significantly higher than those of ZR and GA, driven by differences among bamboo parts and developmental periods. The abundance of each endogenous hormone varied among bamboo parts and developmental periods. During bamboo shooting, ABA had the highest mass fraction in all bamboo parts sampled, followed by IAA, GA, and ZR. Among bamboo parts, rhizomes had more IAA, ZR, and GA than the other parts, but significantly less ABA. Winter shoots had higher ZR: IAA and GA: IAA ratios than rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs. During shoot growth, ABA was the most abundant hormone in rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs, followed by IAA, ZR, and GA. In contrast, IAA was the most abundant hormone in spring shoots, followed by ABA, ZR, and GA. Maternal bamboo organs had a significantly higher ZR: GA ratio, and significantly lower IAA: ABA, ZR: ABA, and GA: ABA ratios than rhizomes. Spring shoots had significantly higher IAA: ABA, ZR: ABA, and GA: ABA ratios than rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs; significantly higher ZR mass fractions, and ZR: GA and ZR: IAA ratios and significantly lower ABA mass fractions than rhizomes; and significantly higher GA: IAA ratio than maternal bamboo organs. During new-bamboo formation, ABA was the most abundant hormone in rhizomes, winter shoots, and maternal bamboo organs, followed by IAA, ZR, and GA. Maternal bamboo organs had significantly lower IAA mass fractions and significantly higher ABA mass fractions than rhizomes and new bamboo tissue. IAA and ABA abundances exhibited an inverse relationship in rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs. GA: ABA and GA: IAA ratios decreased gradually and other hormone ratios exhibited parabolic trends over the bamboo-shooting period, with the highest ratios observed in new bamboo tissues. Overall, the coordination or antagonism among endogenous hormones plays a key regulatory role in bamboo shoot growth. The formation of thick walls in P . edulis ‘Pachyloen’, one of its major traits, may be partially attributed to the relatively high IAA and ZR and low GA mass fractions."

Data deficiency often hinders understanding of their spatial distribution and habitat use, which is critical for species conservation planning. We used sign surveys covering the entire potential red panda habitat over 22,453 km 2 along the mid-hills and high mountains encompassing six conservation complexes in Nepal. To estimate red panda distribution using an occupancy framework, we walked 1,451 km along 446 sampled grid cells out of 4,631 grid cells in the wet season of 2016. We used single-species, single-season models to make inferences regarding covariates influencing detection and occupancy. We estimated the probability of detection and occupancy based on model-averaging techniques and drew predictive maps showing site-specific occupancy estimates. We observed red panda in 213 grid cells and found covariates such as elevation, distance to water sources, and bamboo cover influencing the occupancy.

https://openalex.org/W3112480332,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious issue prevalent in various agriculture-related foodborne pathogens including Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) Typhimurium. Class I integrons have been detected in Salmonella spp. strains isolated from food producing animals and humans and likely play a critical role in transmitting antimicrobial resistance within and between livestock and human populations.The main objective of our study was to characterize class I integron presence to identify possible integron diversity among and between antimicrobial resistant Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from various host species, including humans, cattle, swine, and poultry.An association between integron presence with multidrug resistance was evaluated. One hundred and eighty-three S. Typhimurium isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Class I integrons were detected and sequenced. Similarity of AMR patterns between host species was also studied within each integron type.One hundred seventy-four (95.1%) of 183 S.Typhimurium isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 82 (44.8%) were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobials. The majority of isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial was from humans (45.9%), followed by swine (19.1%) and then bovine (16.9%) isolates; poultry showed the lowest number (13.1%) of resistant isolates. Our study has demonstrated high occurrence of class I integrons in S. Typhimurium across different host species. Only one integron size was detected in poultry isolates. There was a significant association between integron presence of any size and specific multidrug resistance pattern among the isolates from human, bovine and swine.Our study has demonstrated a high occurrence of class I integrons of different sizes in Salmonella Typhimurium across various host species and their association with multidrug resistance. This demonstration indicates that multidrug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium is of significant public health occurrence and reflects on the importance of judicious use of antimicrobials among livestock and poultry."
https://openalex.org/W3110856917,"Since the last medical reform in 2009, China’s public hospitals have been facing the changes in the institutional environment. However, the effects of reforms have not been received enough attention to deliver evidence-based implications. In this paper, we first assess the efficiency of regional public hospitals from 2011 to 2018, employing a proposed method based on an additive indicator and an aggregate directional distance function (DDF). The method applied allows for decomposing total factor productivity (TFP) indicator into three components, including technical efficiency change (TEC), total productivity (TP) and scale efficiency change (SEC). Second, following the efficiency assessment, we carry post-efficiency analysis to identify the determinants of efficiency of the public hospitals. The results show that annual average TFP growth rate is 1.38%, which is driven mainly by TEC. Regional disparities of public hospitals’ performance are expanding. Almost 75% of the regions considered show a positive TFP growth. The regression results show that the significant determinants of efficiency of regional public hospitals include the price of and demand for health services."
https://openalex.org/W3110984944,"As climate change adaptation is becoming a recognized policy issue, the need is growing for quantitative economic evaluation of adaptation-related public investment, particularly in the context of climate finance. Funds are meant to be allocated not to any types of beneficial investments with or without climate change but to projects regarded as effective for climate change adaptation based on some metrics. But attempts at such project-specific evaluation of adaptation effects are few, in part because such assessments require an integration of various types of simulation analyses. Against this background, we conduct a case study of a Kenyan irrigation development project using a combination of downscaled climate data, runoff simulations, yield forecasting, and local socioeconomic projections to examine the effects of interventions specifically attributable to climate change adaptation, i.e., how much irrigation development can reduce the negative effects of climate change in the future. The results show that despite the uncertainties in precipitation trends, increased temperatures due to climate change have a general tendency to reduce rice yields, and that irrigation development will mitigate income impacts from the yield loss–for example, for the median scenario, the household income loss of 6% in 2050 due to climate change without irrigation development is flipped to become positive with the project. This means that the irrigation development project will likely be effective as a means for climate change adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3111575170,"Background The comparison of hepatic steatosis animal models has allowed the understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We investigated the changes in serum levels of trace elements and inflammation markers in fatty livers using two rat models of NAFLD, the methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet model and Obese-Zucker rats. Material and methods NAFLD was induced in male Wistar rats by 3-week MCD diet administration, after which, blood samples were collected. 12-week old Obese (fa/fa) and Lean (fa/-) male Zucker rats were also used. Serum levels of hepatic enzymes, Urea, Uric acid, Ca 2+, Cl, Fe, K, Na, Mg and Zn were quantified, as well as the inflammation markers TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. Results In MCD rats, a serum increase in Cl, Mg and Na and a decrease in Ca 2+, Zn were detected in comparison with control rats. An increase in only serum Ca 2+ was found in Obese-Zucker rats. In MCD rat serum, Zn was inversely correlated with IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Urea and Uric Acid; Ca 2+ was inversely correlated with IL-1beta, IL-6 and Urea; Cl and Mg were directly correlated with Uric Acid and Urea, respectively. In Obese-Zucker rats, Cl and IL-1beta were inversely correlated, whereas Ca 2+ and Urea where directly correlated, as well Fe and TNF-alpha. Conclusions The serum concentrations of trace elements change significantly only in MCD rats, which spontaneously progress to NASH. The causes of these changes may be a result of defense strategies of the organism, which is regulated by immunoregulatory cytokines. These results might suggest that the impairment of trace element status should be taken into account when the effectiveness of a pharmacological treatment is under evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3112166219,"Pathogen identification is a critical step during diagnosis of infectious diseases. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has become the gold standard for identification of microorganisms cultured on solid media in microbiology laboratories. Direct identification of microbes from liquid specimen, circumventing the need for the additional overnight cultivation step, has been successfully established for blood culture, urine and liquor. Here, we evaluate the ability of MALDI-TOF MS for direct identification of pathogens in synovial fluid after liquid enrichment in BacT/Alert blood culture bottles. Influence of synovial specimen quality on direct species identification with the MALDI BioTyper/Sepsityper was tested with samples inoculated from pretested native synovia with concomitant inoculation of blood or pus, or highly viscous fluid. Here, we achieved &gt;90% concordance with culture on solid medium, and only mixed-species samples posed significant problems. Performance in routine diagnostics was tested prospectively on bottles inoculated by treating physicians on ward. There, we achieved &gt;70% concordance with culture on solid media. The major contributors to test failure were the absence of a measurable mass signal and mixed-specimen samples. The Sepsityper workflow worked well on samples derived from BacT/Alert blood culture bottles inoculated with synovial fluid, giving concordant results to identification from solid media. Host remnant material in the inoculum, such as blood or pus, had no detrimental effect on identification score values of the BioTyper system after processing with the Sepsityper workflow, and neither had the initial viscosity of the synovial sample."
https://openalex.org/W3112565507,"Knowledge about fish behavior is crucial to be able to influence the capture process and catch species composition. The rapid expansion of the use of underwater cameras has facilitated unprecedented opportunities for studying the behavior of species interacting with fishing gears in their natural environment. This technological advance would greatly benefit from the parallel development of dedicated methodologies accounting for right-censored observations and variable observation periods between individuals related to instrumental, environmental and behavioral events. In this paper we proposed a methodological framework, based on a parametric Weibull mixture model, to describe the process of escapement attempts through time, test effects of covariates and estimate the probability that a fish will attempt to escape. We additionally proposed to better examine the escapement process at the individual level with regard to the temporal dynamics of escapement over time. Our approach was used to analyze gadoids swimming and escapement behaviors collected using a video set up in front of a selective device known to improve selectivity on gadoids in the extension of a bottom trawl. Comparison of the fit of models indicates that i) the instantaneous rate of escape attempts is constant over time and that the escapement process can be modelled using an exponential law; ii) the mean time before attempting to escape increases with the increasing number of attempts; iii) more than 80% of the gadoids attempted to escape through the selective device; and iv) the estimated probability of success was around 15%. Effects of covariates on the probability of success were investigated using binomial regression but none of them were significant. The data set collected is insufficient to make general statements, and further observations are required to properly investigate the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors governing gadoids behavior in trawls. This methodology could be used to better characterize the underlying behavioral process of fish in other parts of a bottom trawl or in relation to other fishing gears."
https://openalex.org/W3112760022,"Background Despite recent advances in management and preventive strategies, high rates of first line antibiotics treatment failure and case fatality for Severe Community Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) continue to occur in children in low and middle-income countries. This study aimed to identify the predictors and outcome of first line antibiotics treatment failure among children under-five years of age with SCAP admitted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods The study involved under-five children admitted with SCAP, treated with first line antibiotics as recommended by WHO. Patients with treatment failure at 48 hours were shifted to second line of antibiotics treatment and followed up for 7 days. Generalized linear model was used to determine predictors of first line antibiotics treatment failure for SCAP. Results A total of 250 children with SCAP with a median age of 18 [IQR 9–36] months were enrolled, 8.4% had HIV infection and 28% had acute malnutrition. The percentage of first line antibiotics treatment failure for the children with SCAP was 50.4%. Predictors of first line treatment failure were; presentation with convulsion (RR 1.55; 95% CI [1.11–2.16]; p-value 0.009), central cyanosis (RR 1.55; 95% CI [1.16–2.07]; p-value 0.003), low oxygen saturation (RR 1.28; 95% CI [1.01–1.62]; p-value 0.04), abnormal chest X-ray (RR 1.71; 95% CI [1.28–2.29]; p-value &lt;0.001), HIV infection (RR 1.80; 95% CI [1.42–2.27]; p-value 0.001), moderate acute malnutrition (RR 1.48; 95% CI [1.04–2.12]; p-value = 0.030) and severe acute malnutrition (RR 2.02; 95% CI [1.56–2.61]; p-value&lt;0.001). Mortality in children who failed first line treatment was 4.8%. Conclusion Half of the children with SCAP at this tertiary center had first line antibiotics treatment failure. HIV infection, acute malnutrition, low oxygen saturation, convulsions, central cyanosis, and abnormal chest X-ray were independently predictive of first line treatment failure. We recommend consideration of second line treatment and clinical trials for patients with SCAP to reduce associated morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3113122226,"Background B7-H3 is a member of the B7 family of immune-regulatory ligands and is a costimulatory molecule promoting the T cell response in vitro. We herein investigated the clinical utility of serum soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Methods We analyzed 555 patients in whom NMIBC was diagnosed at Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center between 2008 and 2013. We measured the serum sB7-H3 (sB7-H3) level using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and evaluated the utility of sB7-H3 as a prognostic biomarker for NMIBC. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with the sB7-H3 level. Results We detected high levels of sB7-H3 in the sera of 47% of patients with NMIBC versus only 8% in healthy donors. The increase of sB7-H3 was significantly associated with poor RFS and PFS. Multivariate analysis showed that elevated sB7-H3 was an independent prognostic factor of RFS and PFS. According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), in intermediate-low and intermediate-high risk groups, the presence of sB7-H3 significantly determined the rate of recurrence and progression. Conclusions Our data suggested that evaluating serum sB7-H3 expression is a useful tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with NMIBC."
https://openalex.org/W3111607077,"Background Women with chronic-energy malnutrition persists in many developing countries, including Ethiopia. To avert this problem identifying the predictor variables for a high magnitude of underweight is paramount. Consequently, this study aimed to assess the factors associated with chronic energy malnutrition among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Methods We used the 2016 Ethiopia demographic health survey data. The survey was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted from January 18 to June 27, 2016. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was employed to select Participants. A total of 13,451 reproductive-age group women (age 15–49 years and who were not pregnant and &lt; 2 months of postpartum) were included in the analysis. Both descriptive and analytical analyses were performed. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results About 22.6% (95%CI: 21.5%-23.6%) of reproductive-age women were underweight. The magnitude of underweight is highest in the Afar region (39.6%) and lowest in Addis Ababa city administration (13.5%). Women who lived in the rural area (AOR = 1.59; 95%CI: 1.19–2.12), those who did not attend formal education (AOR = 1.23; 95%CI: 1.01–1.50), unemployed women (AOR = 1.28; 95%CI:1.13–1.44), women who belong to the poorest household wealth index (AOR = 1.42; 95%CI:1.04–1.94), women who were not married (AOR = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.18–2.69), women who lived in Tigray and the pastoral regions have higher odds of underweight. On the other hand, women who lived in southern nations nationalities and people’s region, and women whose age group 25–34 years had lower odds of underweight. Conclusions Chronic-energy malnutrition among reproductive-age women is high in Ethiopia. Improving the food security of rural, never married, and unemployed women would reduce the magnitude of underweight. Moreover, strengthening girls’ education, creating employment opportunities for women, and enhancing household income can further reduce the problem of chronic energy malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3111684492,"Maternal undernutrition remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Yet, most interventional programmes are focused on infant and child nutrition outcomes and not on maternal nutrition‐related outcomes. Evidence suggests that the integration of household environmental interventions into nutrition actions can make a difference in reducing the burden of maternal undernutrition. This study examined the influence of household environmental conditions (HHEC) on the nutritional status of women of childbearing age in Nigeria using secondary data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The original sample of 38,948 women age 15–49 years was selected using multi-stage probability sampling. The sample for the current analysis was 23,344 after exclusion of women due to health status or provision of incomplete information. The dependent and main independent variables were undernutrition (defined as Body Mass Index below 18.5) and HHEC (generated from cooking fuel, toilet type, source of drinking water, and housing materials) respectively. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and logistic regression model at 5% level of significance. The prevalence of undernutrition among women living in houses with unimproved and improved HHEC was 17.2% and 7.2% respectively. The adjusted odds of undernutrition was significantly higher among women who lived in houses with unimproved HHEC (aOR = 2.02, C.I = 1.37–2.97, p &lt;0.001). The odds of undernutrition are greater in young women (aOR = 2.38, C.I. = 1.88–3.00, p &lt;0.001) compared to older, and those of lower wealth status (aOR = 2.14, CI = 1.69–2.71, p &lt;0.001) compared to higher. Other predictors of undernutrition in women of reproductive age in Nigeria include the level of education, marital status, and working status. Living in a house with unimproved environmental conditions is a predictor of undernutrition in women. The integration of environmental and nutrition programmes could assist in addressing this burden in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3111800353,"Objectives Although elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with survival in some liver cancers, its prognostic relevance has not been studied in the context of combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma CHCC-CC, a rare primary liver cancer. We investigated whether elevated NLR and a predominance of cholangiocarcinoma might predict poor prognosis in patients with resectable CHCC-CC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data of forty-two patients with CHCC-CC receiving hepatectomies at our hospital. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression to analyze survival. Results Two-year disease-free survival and five-year overall survival rates were 43.2% and 32.9%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that patients with NLR ≥3 had significantly worse 2-year DFS and 5-year OS rates. Univariant Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also associated these rates with a predominance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, AJCC tumor stage, pathological T stage and lymph-vascular invasion. However, our multivariate analysis found NLR ≥3 to be the only independent predictor of disease recurrence and poorer survival. Conclusions Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was the most important independent predictor of poorer survival in patients with resectable CHCC-CC. Predominance of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, advanced AJCC tumor stage and pathological T stage, and lymph-vascular invasion also may affect poor prognosis in patients receiving complete tumor resections."
https://openalex.org/W3111952529,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical effects of a newly developed interspinous process device (IPD), called TAU. This device was compared with another IPD (SPIRE) and the pedicle screw fixation (PSF) technique at the surgical and adjacent levels of the lumbar spine. Materials and methods A three-dimensional finite element model analysis of the L1-S1 segments was performed to assess the biomechanical effects of the proposed IPD combined with an interbody cage. Three surgical models—two IPD models (TAU and SPIRE) and one PSF model—were developed. The biomechanical effects, such as range of motion (ROM), intradiscal pressure (IDP), disc stress, and facet loads during extension were analyzed at surgical (L3-L4) and adjacent levels (L2-L3 and L4-L5). The study analyzed biomechanical parameters assuming that the implants were perfectly fused with the lumbar spine. Results The TAU model resulted in a 45%, 49%, 65%, and 51% decrease in the ROM at the surgical level in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, respectively, when compared to the intact model. Compared to the SPIRE model, TAU demonstrated advantages in stabilizing the surgical level, in all directions. In addition, the TAU model increased IDP at the L2-L3 and L4-L5 levels by 118.0% and 78.5% in flexion, 92.6% and 65.5% in extension, 84.4% and 82.3% in lateral bending, and 125.8% and 218.8% in axial rotation, respectively. Further, the TAU model exhibited less compensation at adjacent levels than the PSF model in terms of ROM, IDP, disc stress, and facet loads, which may lower the incidence of the adjacent segment disease (ASD). Conclusion The TAU model demonstrated more stabilization at the surgical level than SPIRE but less stabilization than the PSF model. Further, the TAU model demonstrated less compensation at adjacent levels than the PSF model, which may lower the incidence of ASD in the long term. The TAU device can be used as an alternative system for treating degenerative lumbar disease while maintaining the physiological properties of the lumbar spine and minimizing the degeneration of adjacent segments."
https://openalex.org/W3112776231,"Impression of helpers can vary as a function of the magnitude of helping (amount of help) and of situational and motivational aspects (type of help). Over three studies conducted in Sweden and the US, we manipulated both the amount and the type of help in ten diverse vignettes and measured participants’ impressions of the described helpers. Impressions were almost unaffected when increasing the amount of help by 500%, but clearly affected by several type of help-manipulations. Particularly, helpers were less positively evaluated if they had mixed motives for helping, did not experience intense emotions or empathy, or if helping involved no personal sacrifice. In line with the person-centered theory of moral judgment, people seem to form impressions of helpers primarily based on the presumed underlying processes and motives of prosociality rather than its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3111131208,"Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, by reducing the cost and increasing the throughput of sequencing, have opened doors to generate genomic data in a range of previously poorly studied species. In this study, we propose a method for the rapid development of a large-scale molecular resources for orphan species. We studied as an example the true lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), a perennial sub-shrub plant native from the Mediterranean region and whose essential oil have numerous applications in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and alternative medicines. The heterozygous clone “Maillette” was used as a reference for DNA and RNA sequencing. We first built a reference Unigene, compound of coding sequences, thanks to de novo RNA-seq assembly. Then, we reconstructed the complete genes sequences (with introns and exons) using an Unigene-guided DNA-seq assembly approach. This aimed to maximize the possibilities of finding polymorphism between genetically close individuals despite the lack of a reference genome. Finally, we used these resources for SNP mining within a collection of 16 commercial lavender clones and tested the SNP within the scope of a genetic distance analysis. We obtained a cleaned reference of 8, 030 functionally in silico annotated genes. We found 359K polymorphic sites and observed a high SNP frequency (mean of 1 SNP per 90 bp) and a high level of heterozygosity (more than 60% of heterozygous SNP per genotype). On overall, we found similar genetic distances between pairs of clones, which is probably related to the out-crossing nature of the species and the restricted area of cultivation. The proposed method is transferable to other orphan species, requires little bioinformatics resources and can be realized within a year. This is also the first reported large-scale SNP development on Lavandula angustifolia . All the genomics resources developed herein are publicly available and provide a rich pool of molecular resources to explore and exploit lavender genetic diversity in breeding programs."

https://openalex.org/W3111650407,"The preponderance of evidence from recent studies in human subjects supports a negative effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on motor outcomes and motor recovery. However prior studies have generally reported the effect of the Met allele in older stroke patients, while potential effects in younger stroke patients have remained essentially unexamined. The lack of research in younger patients is significant since aging effects on CNS repair and functional recovery after stroke are known to interact with the effects of genetic polymorphisms. Here we present a study of first-ever ischemic stroke patients aged 15-49 years that examines the effect of Met carrier status on functional disability.829 patients with a first ischemic stroke (Average age = 41.4 years, SD = 6.9) were recruited from the Baltimore-Washington region. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington. Our sample contained 165 Met carriers and 664 non-Met carriers. Modified Rankin scores as recorded at discharge were obtained from the hospital records by study personnel blinded to genotype, and binarized into ""Good"" versus ""Poor"" outcomes (mRS 0-2 vs. 3+), with mRS scores 3+ reflecting a degree of disability that causes loss of independence.Our analysis showed that the Met allele conveyed a proportionally greater risk for poor outcomes and disability-related loss of independence with mRS scores 3+ (adjusted OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.13-2.64, p = 0.01).The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was negatively associated with functional outcomes at discharge in our sample of 829 young stroke patients. This finding stands in contrast to what would be predicted under the tenets of the resource modulation hypothesis (i.e. that younger patients would be spared from the negative effect of the Met allele on recovery since it is posited to arise as a manifestation of age-related decline in physiologic resources)."
https://openalex.org/W3111881738,"Background To compare health, educational and employment outcomes of schoolchildren receiving medication for a skin disorder with peers. Methods This retrospective population cohort study linked eight Scotland-wide databases, covering dispensed prescriptions, hospital admissions, maternity records, death certificates, annual pupil census, school examinations, school absences/exclusions and unemployment to investigate educational (absence, exclusion, special educational need, academic attainment), employment, and health (admissions and mortality) outcomes of 766,244 children attending local authority run primary, secondary and special schools in Scotland between 2009 and 2013. Results After adjusting for sociodemographic and maternity confounders the 130,087 (17.0%) children treated for a skin disorder had increased hospitalisation, particularly within one year of commencing treatment (IRR 1.38, 95% CI 1.35–1.41, p&lt;0.001) and mortality (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18–1.90, p&lt;0.001). They had greater special educational need (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.17–1.21, p&lt;0.001) and more frequent absences from school (IRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.08, p&lt;0.001) but did not exhibit poorer exam attainment or increased post-school unemployment. The associations remained after further adjustment for comorbid chronic conditions. Conclusions Despite increased hospitalisation, school absenteeism, and special educational need, children treated for a skin disorder did not have poorer exam attainment or employment outcomes. Whilst findings relating to educational and employment outcomes are reassuring, the association with increased risk of mortality is alarming and merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3112111821,"Background The systemic responses to infection and its progression to sepsis remains poorly understood. Progress in the field has been stifled by the shortcomings of experimental models which include poor replication of the human condition. To address these challenges, we developed and piloted a novel large animal model of severe infection that is capable of generating multi-system clinically relevant data. Methods Male swine (n = 5) were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and serial blood sampling. Animals were inoculated with uropathogenic E . coli by direct injection into the renal parenchyma and were maintained until a priori endpoints were met. The natural history of the infection was studied. Animals were not resuscitated. Multi-system data were collected hourly to 6 hours; all animals were euthanized at predetermined physiologic endpoints. Results Core body temperature progressively increased from mean (SD) 37.9(0.8)°C at baseline to 43.0(1.2)°C at experiment termination (p = 0.006). Mean arterial pressure did not begin to decline until 6h post inoculation, dropping from 86(9) mmHg at baseline to 28(5) mmHg (p = 0.005) at termination. Blood glucose progressively declined but lactate levels did not elevate until the last hours of the experiment. There were also temporal changes in whole blood concentrations of a number of metabolites including increases in the catecholamine precursors, tyrosine (p = 0.005) and phenylalanine (p = 0.005). Lung, liver, and kidney function parameters worsened as infection progressed and at study termination there was histopathological evidence of injury in these end-organs. Conclusion We demonstrate a versatile, multi-system, longitudinal, swine model of infection that could be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie infection-induced multi-organ dysfunction and failure, optimize resuscitation protocols and test therapeutic interventions. Such a model could improve translation of findings from the bench to the bedside, circumventing a significant obstacle in sepsis research."
https://openalex.org/W3112641854,"Accurate calculation of the water-filled rut depth is critical for assessing hydroplaning potential. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty in collecting and calculating the water-filled rut depth, most transportation agencies do not use i, especially in the case of lateral slopes, although water-filled rut depth is a key parameter that impacts driving safety. Contributions of this paper are development of a methodology to reliably compute the water-filled rut depth and quantitatively evaluate the influence of lateral slope on the water-filled rut depth. The proposed method include: 1) acquisition of the high-resolution 3D point cloud data of rut, 2) smooth processing of rut profile through moving average method with Matlab programming, 3) water-filled rut depth computation at different lateral slopes with the assistance of key points based on rut sections. With the variation of water-filled rut depth (ΔWD), its change rate (δWD), and the calculation error between the rut depth and the water-filled rut depth (Δ n ) as evaluation indexes, the variation law of water-filled rut depth under different lateral slopes is analyzed when considering the severity level and rut shape of the rut profile. Results show that: 1) the increase in lateral slope leads to the reduction of water-filled rut depth; 2) the water-filled rut depth is affected by the rut shape, including rut side wall’s slope and the key points’ elevation. The accurate calculation of the water-filled rut depth can provide reliable suggestions for safe driving."
https://openalex.org/W3112879523,"Introduction Serum creatinine (SCr) testing has been the mainstay of kidney function assessment for decades despite known limitations. Cystatin C (CysC) is an alternative biomarker that is generally less affected than SCr by pertinent non-renal factors in hospitalized patients, such as muscle mass. Despite its potential advantages, the adoption of CysC for inpatient care is not widespread. At one hospital with CysC testing, we demonstrated a significant rise in non-protocolized use over the last decade. This study uses qualitative methods to provide the first report of how clinicians understand, approach, and apply CysC testing in inpatient care. Methods Fifteen clinicians from various disciplines were interviewed about their experience with inpatient CysC testing. The semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using a phenomenological approach. Results Knowledge and confidence with CysC varied greatly. Clinicians reported first learning about the test from colleagues on consulting services or multidisciplinary teams. The majority believed CysC to provide a more accurate measure of kidney function than SCr. Common scenarios for CysC ordering included medication dosing, evaluation of acute kidney injury, and a thorough evaluation of kidney function in patients with risk factors for an altered SCr. Facilitators for ordering CysC included the availability of rapid results turnaround and the automated calculation of glomerular filtration rate based on the biomarker. Barriers to use included a lack of education about CysC, and the absence of an institutional protocol for use. Discussion Clinicians at our site decided independent of institutional guidance whether and when CysC added value to patient care. While the majority of study participants indicated advantages to rapid turnaround CysC testing, its use depended not just on the features of the specific case but on clinician familiarity and personal preference. Findings from this research can guide the implementation and expansion of CysC testing."
https://openalex.org/W3111125423,"A reliable identification and delimitation of species is an essential pre-requisite for many fields of science and conservation. The Neotropical herpetofauna is the world’s most diverse, including many taxa of uncertain or debated taxonomy. Here we tackle one such species complex, by evaluating the taxonomic status of species currently allocated in the snake genus Xenopholis ( X . scalaris , X . undulatus , and X . werdingorum ). We base our conclusions on concordance between quantitative (meristic and morphometric) and qualitative (color pattern, hemipenes and skull features) analyses of morphological characters, in combination with ecological niche modeling. We recognize all three taxa as valid species and improve their respective diagnosis, including new data on color in life, pholidosis, bony morphology, and male genitalia. We find low overlap among the niches of each species, corroborating the independent source of phenotypic evidence. Even though all three species occur in the leaf litter of distinct forested habitats, Xenopholis undulatus is found in the elevated areas of the Brazilian Shield (Caatinga, Cerrado and Chaco), whereas X . scalaris occurs in the Amazon and Atlantic rainforests, and X . werdingorum in the Chiquitanos forest and Pantanal wetlands. We discuss the disjunct distribution between Amazonian and Atlantic Forest snake species in the light of available natural history and ecological aspects. This study shows the advantages of combining multiple data sources for reliable identification and circumscription of ecologically similar species."
https://openalex.org/W3111298740,"Purpose Thinning of the inner layers of the retina occurs in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The mechanism for such thinning may be partially due to proteolysis by a calcium-activated protease called calpain. Calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945 ameliorated the proteolysis in a past series of model experiments. The purposes of the present retrospective study were to: 1) use segmentation analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images to mathematically model the loss of specific retinal layers in CRAO patients, and 2) predict the number of patients and days of observation needed for clinical trials of inhibitors against CRAO. Methods A retrospective case control study was conducted by computer-aided search for CRAO (ICD10 H43.1) with at least one OCT procedure (CPT: 92134) in the OHSU Epic patient data base. Results After initial swelling, thinning of the inner retinal layers, especially the ganglion cell (GCL) layer followed exponential decay curves. Using sample size statistics and GCL thickness as a marker in a 30-day clinical trial, 19 eyes/group could theoretically detect a 20% beneficial effect of an inhibitor against CRAO. Other markers, such as the whole retinal thickness and combined inner layers could also be used as less-specific markers. Conclusions Using thickness changes in the GCL layer to monitor the efficacy of potential inhibitors against CRAO is practical in human trials requiring a reasonable number of patients and relatively short trial period. Translational relevance Measurement of GCL thickness would be a useful indicator of CRAO progression in a clinical trial of putative inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3111548853,"Measurements on physical systems result from the systems’ activity being converted into sensor measurements by a forward model. In a number of cases, inversion of the forward model is extremely sensitive to perturbations such as sensor noise or numerical errors in the forward model. Regularization is then required, which introduces bias in the reconstruction of the systems’ activity. One domain in which this is particularly problematic is the reconstruction of interactions in spatially-extended complex systems such as the human brain. Brain interactions can be reconstructed from non-invasive measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), whose forward models are linear and instantaneous, but have large null-spaces and high condition numbers. This leads to incomplete unmixing of the forward models and hence to spurious interactions. This motivated the development of interaction measures that are exclusively sensitive to lagged, i.e. delayed interactions. The drawback of such measures is that they only detect interactions that have sufficiently large lags and this introduces bias in reconstructed brain networks. We introduce three estimators for linear interactions in spatially-extended systems that are uniformly sensitive to all lags. We derive some basic properties of and relationships between the estimators and evaluate their performance using numerical simulations from a simple benchmark model."
https://openalex.org/W3112907269,"Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease in Western nations, with high heritability. A recent study of Japanese patients with the disease suggested that TLL1 rs17047200 is associated with fibrosis; whether a similar association is observed in Caucasian patients with MAFLD is unknown. We investigated the association of the TLL1 rs17047200 polymorphism with liver fibrosis in a cohort of Caucasian patients with MAFLD (n = 728). We also investigated whether TLL1 expression is altered during liver injury in humans, in murine models of fibrosis, and in in-vitro . While TLL1 expression is upregulated in the liver of humans with MAFLD and in mice, the rs17047200 variant was not associated with fibrosis or any other histological features, or with hepatic TLL1 expression. In conclusion, the TLL1 rs17047200 variant is not a risk variant for fibrosis in Caucasian patients with MAFLD. However, TLL1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3110794830,"When evaluating symptomatic patients for tuberculosis (TB) without access to same-day diagnostic test results, clinicians often make empiric decisions about starting treatment. The number of TB symptoms and/or underweight status could help identify patients at highest risk for a positive result. We sought to evaluate the usefulness of BMI assessment and a count of characteristic TB symptoms for identifying patients at highest risk for TB.We enrolled adult patients receiving pulmonary TB diagnoses and a representative sample with negative TB evaluations at four outpatient health facilities in Kampala, Uganda. We asked patients about symptoms of chronic cough, night sweats, chest pain, fever, hemoptysis, or weight loss; measured height and weight; and collected sputum for mycobacterial culture. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy (for culture-positive TB) of two simple scoring systems: (a) number of TB symptoms, and (b) number of TB symptoms plus one or more additional points for underweight status (body mass index [BMI] ≤ 18.5 kg/m2).We included 121 patients with culture-positive TB and 370 patients with negative culture results (44 of whom had been recommended for TB treatment by evaluating clinicians). Of the six symptoms assessed, the median number of symptoms that patients reported was two (interquartile range [IQR]: 1, 3). The median BMI was 20.9 kg/m2 (IQR: 18.6, 24.0), and 118 (24%) patients were underweight. Counting the number of symptoms provided an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (c-statistic) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.72, 0.81) for identifying culture-positive TB; adding two points for underweight status increased the c-statistic to 0.81 (95%CI: 0.76, 0.85). A cutoff of ≥3 symptoms had sensitivity and specificity of 65% and 74%, whereas a score of ≥4 on the combined score (≥2 symptoms if underweight, ≥4 symptoms if not underweight) gave higher sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 81% respectively. A sensitivity analysis defining TB by Xpert MTB/RIF status produced similar results.A count of patients' TB symptoms may be useful in clinical decision-making about TB diagnosis. Consideration of underweight status adds additional diagnostic value."
https://openalex.org/W3111470535,"Background Pre-school aged children (PSAC) are highly affected by soil-transmitted helminths (STH), particularly in areas where water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are inadequate. Context-specific evidence on determinants of STH infections in PSAC has not been well established in the study area. This study, therefore, aimed to fill these gaps in Gamo Gofa zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based unmatched case-control study, nested in a cross-sectional survey, was conducted in January 2019. Cases and controls were identified based on any STH infection status using the Kato-Katz technique in stool sample examination. Data on social, demographic, economic, behavioral, and WASH related variables were collected from primary caregivers of children using pre-tested questionnaire. Determinants of STH infections were identified using multivariable logistic regression model using SPSS version 25. Results A total of 1206 PSAC (402 cases and 804 controls) participated in this study. Our study showed that the odds of STH infection were lowest among PSAC living in urban areas (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.39–0.79), among those from households with safe water source (AOR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47–0.0.93), and in those PSAC from households with shorter distance from water source (&lt;30 minutes) (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.39–0.67). On the other hand, the odds of STH infection were highest among PSAC from households that had no functional hand washing facility (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.04–1.77), in those PSAC from households that had unclean latrine (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.19–2.78), and among those PSAC under caregivers who had lower score (≤5) on knowledge related to STH transmission (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.13–3.01). Conclusions Given efforts required eliminating STH by 2030; the existing preventive chemotherapy intervention should be substantially strengthened with WASH and behavioral interventions. Thus, an urgent call for action is required to integrate context-specific interventions, particularly in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3113290926,"This paper analyzes the perception and behavior of active tourism companies that provide outdoor physical sports activities in emerging tourist destinations in Cordoba, an inland province of southern Spain. The active tourism supply of registered businesses was analyzed using fieldwork data and more than 30 variables including training and qualification of human resources, business vision of demand, marketing and promotion strategies, and perceptions of supply trends. To this end, a quantitative-qualitative empirical study was performed together with in-depth interviews of key stakeholders. Official registry sources were also used to complement the data. The results show a fragmented network of micro-SMEs that are functionally isolated from the rest of the tourism supply and display an intuitive and poor market-oriented behavior due to the inadequate management of their client portfolio. Such management models make it difficult for these businesses to take advantage of key strategic assets to increase profitability and achieve a competitive and sustainable advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3111491167,"Protected Areas (PAs) are essential to maintaining biodiversity, while effective management plans (MPs) are essential for the management of these areas. Thus, MPs must have relevant data analyses and diagnoses to evaluate ecological conditions of PAs. We evaluated the environmental diagnoses of 126 Brazilian federal PAs, the methods used to collect data and defined the diagnostic level of PMs according to the type and number of analyzes performed for each PA category. We found a low level of diagnosis in MPs. Primary field data or research programs resulted in environmental diagnostics of higher levels. Participatory workshops and secondary data, most used in Extractive Reserves, were related to low levels of diagnoses. The most frequent analysis was the identification of threats (97% of MPs), while the least frequent were the definition of conservation targets and future scenarios for management (1.6% of MPs). Our results show that the diagnoses of the MPs need to be more analytical to generate useful information for decision-making. MPs should prioritize data analysis and specific management studies, focused on the use of natural resources, the status of conservation targets, future scenarios, and key information to planning."
