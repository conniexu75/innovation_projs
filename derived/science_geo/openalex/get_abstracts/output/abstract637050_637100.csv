https://openalex.org/W2963600298,"Cutaneous TRPV1+ neurons directly sense noxious stimuli, inflammatory cytokines, and pathogen-associated molecules and are required for innate immunity against some skin pathogens. Important unanswered questions are whether TRPV1+ neuron activation in isolation is sufficient to initiate innate immune responses and what is the biological function for TRPV1+ neuron-initiated immune responses. We used TRPV1-Ai32 optogenetic mice and cutaneous light stimulation to activate cutaneous neurons in the absence of tissue damage or pathogen-associated products. We found that TRPV1+ neuron activation was sufficient to elicit a local type 17 immune response that augmented host defense to C. albicans and S. aureus. Moreover, local neuron activation elicited type 17 responses and augmented host defense at adjacent, unstimulated skin through a nerve reflex arc. These data show the sufficiency of TRPV1+ neuron activation for host defense and demonstrate the existence of functional anticipatory innate immunity at sites adjacent to infection that depends on antidromic neuron activation."

https://openalex.org/W2963870305,"Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels initiate action potentials in nerve, muscle, and other electrically excitable cells. The structural basis of voltage gating is uncertain because the resting state exists only at deeply negative membrane potentials. To stabilize the resting conformation, we inserted voltage-shifting mutations and introduced a disulfide crosslink in the VS of the ancestral bacterial sodium channel NaVAb. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the resting state and a complete voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The S4 segment of the VS is drawn intracellularly, with three gating charges passing through the transmembrane electric field. This movement forms an elbow connecting S4 to the S4-S5 linker, tightens the collar around the S6 activation gate, and prevents its opening. Our structure supports the classical ""sliding helix"" mechanism of voltage sensing and provides a complete gating mechanism for voltage sensor function, pore opening, and activation-gate closure based on high-resolution structures of a single sodium channel protein."

Fulvestrant is unique among approved ER therapeutics due to its capacity for full ER antagonism, thought to be achieved through ER degradation. The clinical potential of fulvestrant is limited by poor physicochemical features, spurring attempts to generate ER degraders with improved drug-like properties. We show that optimization of ER degradation does not guarantee full ER antagonism in breast cancer cells; ER “degraders” exhibit a spectrum of transcriptional activities and anti-proliferative potential. Mechanistically, we find that fulvestrant-like antagonists suppress ER transcriptional activity not by ER elimination, but by markedly slowing the intra-nuclear mobility of ER. Increased ER turnover occurs as a consequence of ER immobilization. These findings provide proof-of-concept that small molecule perturbation of transcription factor mobility may enable therapeutic targeting of this challenging target class.

Despite the clinical benefit of endocrine agents, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women, with ∼50% of mortalities arising from estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors (Siegel et al., 2018Siegel R.L.

This persistent ER dependence has reignited efforts to further optimize ER targeting (Metcalfe et al., 2018Metcalfe C. Friedman L.S. Hager J.H. Hormone-Targeted Therapy and Resistance.Annu. Rev.

ER is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that contains a central DNA binding domain, an intrinsically disordered N-terminal activation function 1 (AF1) domain and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (Métivier et al., 2001Métivier R. Penot G. Flouriot G. Pakdel F.

Estrogen (17β-estradiol [E2]) binding results in LBD-mediated recruitment of co-factors and chromatin modifying enzymes to specific chromatin sites, activating transcription (Nagy and Schwabe, 2004Nagy L.

Tamoxifen (active metabolite 4-OH tamoxifen [4-OHT]), the first clinically approved ER-targeted agent, competes with E2 for ER binding and prevents LBD-mediated co-activator recruitment. Although 4-OHT counteracts the effects of E2 on the LBD, it can promote activation of the AF1 domain, resulting in weak transcriptional activation in hormone-deprived conditions, and an incomplete block of signaling in E2-stimulated conditions (Liu et al., 2001Liu H.

Tamoxifen has thus been classified as a selective ER modulator (SERM) because it modulates but does not fully suppress ER transcriptional activity. Fulvestrant was designed to overcome the agonistic effects of SERMs, with the rationale that full antagonism of ER might drive superior clinical outcomes (Bowler et al., 1989Bowler J. Lilley T.J.

However, exposure constraints, reflecting poor physicochemical properties and the need for administration by intramuscular injection, limit the clinical potential of fulvestrant (Robertson, 2007Robertson J.F.

There is thus considerable impetus to develop full ER antagonists with improved oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic features. Prospective optimization of ER degradation emerged as the predominant strategy to identify molecules that parallel fulvestrant’s mechanistic features and has yielded a number of new clinical candidates, including GDC-0810 (NCT01823835, NCT02569801), AZD9496 (NCT02248090, NCT03236974), AZD9833 (NCT03616586), SAR439859 (NCT03284957), and GDC-0927 (NCT02316509) (De Savi et al., 2015De Savi C.

The potential of these molecules to transform the therapeutic landscape of ER+ breast cancer compelled us to investigate their mechanisms of action. We thus studied a subset of these clinical candidates, together with approved benchmark ligands, with an emphasis on addressing the relationship between ER turnover and pathway suppression. We find that prospective optimization of ER degradation does not guarantee a full antagonist profile across breast cancer cell lines; GDC-0810 can weakly activate ER transcription, which impacts its efficacy. Counter to the prevailing paradigm, we find that loss of ER protein is not the primary driver of the mechanistic divergence between SERDs and SERMs, since differences in chromatin accessibility occur prior to differential ER turnover. Live cell imaging revealed profound suppression of intranuclear ER mobility specifically by full ER antagonists, co-occurring with a suppressive chromatin phenotype and preceding ER turnover. These data reinforce the central, functional role of transcription factor dynamics in transactivation, and reveal live-cell imaging of protein dynamics as a potential drug discovery tool. We evaluated how ER ligands impact ER protein levels in multiple breast cancer cell lines, comparing fulvestrant with clinical candidates GDC-0810, AZD9496, and GDC-0927, which emerged from strategies to optimize ER degradation, and GNE-274, a non-degrader structurally similar to GDC-0927 (De Savi et al., 2015De Savi C.

Performing a dose titration enabled the determination of maximal ER depletion capacity (depletion plateau, Emax) and EC50 values (ligand concentration required for half-maximal ER depletion). Fulvestrant, GDC-0810, AZD9496, and GDC-0927 displayed similar Emax values (∼85%) in MCF7 cells (Figures 1B and S1A). However, analyzing additional cell lines uncovered ligand differences: Emax values for GDC-0810 and AZD9496 were 15%–25% lower compared to fulvestrant in 7 ER+ breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1B). GDC-0927 exhibited greater capacity for ER degradation versus GDC-0810 and AZD9496, being similar to fulvestrant, with the exception of EFM-19 and T-47D cells in which fulvestrant achieved greater reduction of ER protein (Figures 1B and S1A). GNE-274 failed to trigger increased ER turnover in any cell line evaluated (Figure S1A). In MCF7 cells, ER protein depletion occurred in the absence of decreased ESR1 transcript, and ER protein levels were partially or fully restored by co-treating with inhibitors of the ubiquitin activating (E1) enzymes (MLN7243) or proteasome (MG132) (Figures S1C and S1D). In HCC1500 cells, GDC-0810, GDC-0927, and fulvestrant modestly decreased ESR1 transcript levels; however, only GDC-0927 and fulvestrant cause a meaningful decrease in ER protein, which is restored by co-treatment with MLN7243 or MG132 (Figures S1C and S1D). These data are consistent with the mechanism previously ascribed to both fulvestrant and GDC-0810, whereby ER protein depletion results primarily from increased proteasome-mediated turnover (Dauvois et al., 1992Dauvois S.

Focusing next on viability of ER+ HER2-negative cell lines, we found that GDC-0927 and GNE-274 potently inhibited cellular proliferation, based on IC50 values, exhibiting greater potency than fulvestrant, 4-OHT, AZD9496, and GDC-0810 across all cell lines evaluated (Figure S1E). Fulvestrant, GDC-0927, GDC-0810, and AZD9496 showed similar maximal anti-proliferative capacity in MCF7, EFM-19, and T-47D cells, however, fulvestrant and GDC-0927 achieved greater anti-proliferative activity than the other compounds in HCC1500 and CAMA-1 cells (Figure 1C). MDA-MB-134-VI cells exhibit a continuum of responses: fulvestrant exhibited the greatest activity and 4-OHT the weakest. GNE-274 failed to achieve the same degree of anti-proliferative activity as GDC-0927, its structurally similar analog. Overall, the weaker ER degradation induced by GDC-0810 and AZD9496, particularly in HCC1500 and CAMA-1 cells, and by GNE-274 in all cell lines, correlates with sub-optimal anti-proliferative activity, while the more consistent degradation activity of fulvestrant and GDC-0927 associates with superior anti-proliferative capacity. We next compared how the ligands impacted the ER LBD. Ligand binding regulates co-factor recruitment via re-positioning of LBD helix 12; thus, differential co-factor peptide binding can assay agonist versus antagonist conformations of the LBD (Iannone et al., 2004Iannone M.A. Simmons C.A.

USA. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). GDC-0810 and AZD9496 potently outcompete E2 from the LBD, similar to other ligands, however, they are considerably less potent versus the other ligands in dissociating the co-activator peptide PGC1α from E2-stimulated ER LBD (Figure 1D), suggesting that GDC-0810 and AZD9496 may enable residual PGC1α binding. We therefore systematically explored how a larger series of ER ligands impact LBD conformation by testing binding of 154 co-factor peptides implicated in nuclear receptor signaling at a single saturating dose (Wang et al., 2013Wang S. Houtman R. Melchers D. Aarts J. Peijnenburg A. van Beuningen R. Rietjens I. Bovee T.F. A 155-plex high-throughput in vitro coregulator binding assay for (anti-)estrogenicity testing evaluated with 23 reference compounds.ALTEX. 2013; 30: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All ligands profoundly modulate recruitment of co-factor peptides to the LBD, in a manner consistent with antagonism (Figure S1F). The majority of ligands displayed a highly similar profile, displacing a common set of peptides. However, GDC-0810 and AZD9496 co-factor binding profiles differed, suggesting that GDC-0810 and AZD9496 drive a distinct LBD conformation (hierarchical clustering in Figure S1F). Additional dose-response experiments confirmed these unique co-factor binding profiles, illustrating that GDC-0810 and AZD9496 fail to fully displace some peptides (e.g., NRIP1), while uniquely inducing binding of others (e.g., CBP) (Figures 1E and 1F). These data demonstrate that the impact of antagonist ligands on the LBD (determined by co-factor binding) is not sufficient to dictate anti-proliferative capacity. For example, while both GNE-274 and 4-OHT induce an LBD antagonist conformation similar to GDC-0927, neither promotes the degree of anti-proliferative activity achieved by GDC-0927 (Figure 1). Thus, domains outside the LBD influence overall ER signaling, in line with previous observations that the AF1 domain contributes to ER signaling (Tzukerman et al., 1994Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P.

To compare the impact of ER ligands on transcription, we evaluated gene expression upon ligand treatment in 8 ER+ breast cancer cell lines. To reveal potential ER agonist activity, cells were hormone-deprived prior to treatment, and we compared changes in expression to that of E2-stimulation. In MCF7 cells, we found that 4-OHT promotes transcriptional activation of ER, with 13% of the genes induced by E2 also being upregulated by 4-OHT (>2-fold, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05), and 3% of E2-induced genes being suppressed (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S1). GDC-0927, GDC-0810, and fulvestrant all exhibit suppressive behavior in MCF7 cells (i.e., inverse agonism) decreasing the expression of 43%, 27%, and 21% of E2-target genes, respectively, relative to the hormone-depleted control (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S1). GNE-274 is likewise dominated by a suppressive behavior in MCF7 cells, with 24% of E2-induced genes being downregulated and 5% upregulat"

Thus, many lines of converging research support a phasic ACh release model as a necessary and sufficient condition for ACx receptive field plasticity related to auditory fear learning, in which selective enhancement of the CS frequency requires a temporal handshake between bottom-up CS-evoked sensory activity and US-evoked ACh release. One potential challenge to the phasic ACh release model for ACx receptive field plasticity is that it has only been extensively tested with protocols where the CS and US overlap in time. In the real world, robust sensory learning occurs even with delayed behavioral reinforcement. This has been studied in the laboratory with trace conditioning protocols in which the CS is separated from the US by a silent gap ranging from milliseconds to hours (Garcia et al., 1966Garcia J.

Models of trace conditioning posit that temporal overlap between a CS and delayed US is achieved by extending the CS-evoked response in time until the US arrives (Raybuck and Lattal, 2014Raybuck J.D. Lattal K.M. Bridging the interval: theory and neurobiology of trace conditioning.Behav. Processes. 2014; 101: 103-111Google Scholar).

Oscillations synchronize amygdala-to-prefrontal primate circuits during aversive learning.Neuron. 2018; 97: 291-298.e3Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the phasic release model for ACx plasticity that supports auditory fear learning only applies to the narrow condition where sound and aversive stimuli overlap in time. Here we demonstrate that conditioning mice with an auditory CS and a delayed aversive US induces a robust, rapid, and selective plasticity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) that is blocked by local cholinergic antagonists. Temporal alignment of CS and US inputs was not achieved by extending the CS-evoked response throughout the 5-s trace period until the US arrived. Instead, we identify a plasticity within the cholinergic basal forebrain itself that coordinated the temporal alignment of the CS and delayed US by scaling up CS+-evoked responses during the sensory and trace periods. Rather than acting strictly as a gating signal that promotes reorganization of cortical circuits, our findings identify a surprising malleability in the timing and response amplitude of the cholinergic basal forebrain input to the sensory cortex that may support learned associations between sounds and delayed consequences. Local circuit plasticity in the ACx that supports auditory fear learning arises from the temporal convergence of a bottom-up sensory trace evoked by the CS and a ACh surge from the basal forebrain evoked by the US (Figure 1A; Bakin and Weinberger, 1996Bakin J.S. Weinberger N.M. Induction of a physiological memory in the cerebral cortex by stimulation of the nucleus basalis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11219-11224Google Scholar, Froemke et al., 2007Froemke R.C. Merzenich M.M. Schreiner C.E.

Lüthi A. A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex.Nature. 2011; 480: 331-335Google Scholar). To test the prediction that phasic ACh release from basal forebrain neurons is sufficient to enhance ACx spiking responses to co-occurring sound frequencies, we optogenetically activated cholinergic basal forebrain neurons that project to the ACx by pulsing blue light on the ACx surface of awake, head-fixed ChAT-Cre × Ai32 mice that express channelrhodopsin2 in cholinergic neurons. Extracellular recordings of regular spiking (RS) and fast spiking (FS) units were made from the A1 of awake, head-fixed mice with multi-channel silicon probes (Figure 1B). Single-unit recordings were held for approximately 80 min, during which time auditory receptive fields were characterized with tone pips of varying frequency (test blocks) interspersed with six sound and laser conditioning blocks comprised of 10 pairing trials each (Figure 1C). In support of the phasic ACh release model, pairing narrow-band noise (NBN) bursts with simultaneous optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons rapidly enhanced spiking of RS units at the paired frequency (n = 57 units, ANOVA main effect for conditioning stage F = 9.74, p < 0.005, one-sample t tests against a population mean of zero, p < 0.025 for all conditioning stages; Figures 1D, 1E, and 1G). Rapid enhancement of spiking at the paired frequency was not observed for FS units, perhaps reflecting earlier observations that A1 inhibitory frequency-receptive fields are slower to reorganize with basal forebrain pairing protocols (Froemke et al., 2007Froemke R.C. Merzenich M.M. Schreiner C.E. A synaptic memory trace for cortical receptive field plasticity.Nature. 2007; 450: 425-429Google Scholar). Plasticity index values for all individual RS and FS units are reported in Figure S1. A second prediction of the phasic ACh model is that receptive field plasticity would fail to occur when the cholinergic surge arrives after a long delay following the offset of auditory stimulation. We tested this by repeating the same experiment, only with a 5-s delay separating the offset of the NBN burst and the laser onset. In contrast to the receptive field plasticity observed with simultaneous presentation of sound and cholinergic basal forebrain activation, we did not observe selective enhancement of the paired frequency when a 5-s gap separated sound offset and the laser onset (n = 34 RS units, ANOVA main effect for conditioning stage F = 0.58, p = 0.44, one-sample t tests against a population mean of zero, p > 0.07 for all conditioning stages; Figures 1F and 1G). Electrophysiological representations of sounds fade away within a few hundred milliseconds following offset. Presumably, A1 receptive fields did not reorganize when the NBN and laser stimuli were separated by a 5-s silent gap because the cholinergic surge arrived in the ACx long after the sensory trace had expired (Metherate and Ashe, 1991Metherate R. Ashe J.H. Basal forebrain stimulation modifies auditory cortex responsiveness by an action at muscarinic receptors.Brain Res. 1991; 559: 163-167Google Scholar). However, behaviorally, associative trace learning can occur when the US begins several seconds, minutes, or even hours after the CS ends (Davis et al., 1989Davis M. Schlesinger L.S. Sorenson C.A.

Process. 1989; 15: 295-310Google Scholar, Garcia et al., 1966Garcia J. Ervin F.R. Koelling R.A. Learning with prolonged delay of reinforcement.Psychon.

Lattal K.M. Bridging the interval: theory and neurobiology of trace conditioning.Behav. Processes. 2014; 101: 103-111Google Scholar). To determine whether behavioral indications of auditory fear learning could form in spite of a 5-s gap separating the CS and US, we conditioned mice over five consecutive days either with a 16-kHz NBN CS+ followed 5 s later by a foot shock (N= 4) or a no-shock control condition (N = 4) (Figure 2A). On day 6, both groups of mice were introduced to a novel sensory context and presented with interleaved trials of the CS+ frequency or a CS-control (CSc) frequency that was never paired with shock. We found that mice conditioned with a 5-s gap between the CS and US exhibited auditory fear learning that appeared to be virtually identical to previous descriptions with temporally overlapping sounds and foot shocks (Letzkus et al., 2011Letzkus J.J. Wolff S.B.E. Meyer E.M.M. Tovote P. Courtin J. Herry C. Lüthi A. A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex.Nature. 2011; 480: 331-335Google Scholar) (ANOVA group × frequency interaction, F = 32.3, p < 0.0001; Figure 2B). These findings demonstrate that auditory fear learning was robust to a 5-s silent gap separating the CS and US even though activating cholinergic axons 5 s after sound offset did not induce A1 receptive field reorganization. There are many possible reasons for this discrepancy. The most straightforward explanation is that ACx receptive field reorganization may not occur when the CS and US are separated by longer temporal gaps. Instead, the critical locus of plasticity could shift to other brain areas, such as the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, or prefrontal cortex (Raybuck and Lattal, 2014Raybuck J.D. Lattal K.M. Bridging the interval: theory and neurobiology of trace conditioning.Behav. Processes. 2014; 101: 103-111Google Scholar). We addressed this possibility by quantifying tonotopic maps of best frequency (BF) from multiunit recordings in the A1 and the anterior auditory field (AAF) from the same eight mice that underwent behavioral testing (Figure 2C). We found that tonotopic receptive field maps were distorted in mice conditioned with a 5-s CS-US delay (n = 130 recording sites) so that the 16-kHz CS+ frequency was over-represented at the expense of neighboring frequencies compared with the smooth BF gradients measured in no-shock control mice that heard the same sounds without the US (n = 118 recording sites, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.02; Figure 2D). These findings demonstrate that auditory fear learning and associative ACx plasticity can occur with several days of auditory trace conditioning but leaves open the question of why A1 receptive field reorganization did not occur when cortical ACh neurons were optogenetically activated 5 s after sound offset. One explanation is that cortical changes linked to trace learning might take days to consolidate and would not be expected to develop over the short timescale of a single conditioning session. To test this idea, we returned to the awake head-fixed single-unit recording preparation. Mice either underwent CS+ conditioning (NBN followed 5 s later by an air puff to the face) or CSc conditioning, where NBN bursts were presented without air puffs. Mice could walk freely on a rotating disk, providing us with the means to measure NBN-elicited freezing during conditioning blocks under head fixation (Figure 3A). We found that cortical plasticity and auditory learning emerged shortly after the start of conditioning, despite the 5-s gap between the CS and US. NBN-triggered freezing behavior was significantly increased with CS+ conditioning compared with either CSc or a second control, in which air puffs were presented at the 5-s delay but directed away from the face (ANOVA, main effect for group, F = 6.51, p < 0.005; pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; Figure 3B). An example A1 RS unit exhibited a rapid and selective increase in firing rate near the CS+ frequency that was not observed in units recorded during a CSc session (Figures 3C and 3D). CS+-specific increases in spiking grew steadily during the early and late stages of conditioning and remained elevated after conditioning ended (CS+ conditioning, ANOVA, F = 8.98, p < 0.005; Figure 3E). CS-specific receptive field plasticity was significantly greater in CS+ conditioning than CSc conditioning (n = 37/71 for CS+/CSc, Kruskal-Wallis post hoc pairwise comparison, p = 0.02; Figure 3E). Forcing air through a narrow aperture creates an audible sound, making any air puff strong enough to be aversive a compound CS-US. However, neither conditioned freezing (Figure 3B) nor A1 receptive field plasticity was observed when the air puff was comparably loud but directed just away from the face, confirming that auditory learning and plasticity reflected the aversive sensation of the air puff, not the sound (n = 26, one-way ANOVA, F = 2.33, p = 0.36; Figure 3E). Data from individual RS and FS units are provided in Figure S2. We next pursued two explanations for why A1 receptive fields could be rapidly remodeled with a 5-s delay between NBN and an air puff (Figure 3E) but not with a 5-s delay between NBN and optogenetic release of ACh (Figure 1G). The first possibility was that pairing sound with delayed air puffs might have induced a prolonged representation of CS+ sound so that it persisted throughout the 5-s silent interval until the US-evoked ACh surge arrived (Figure 3F). We examined the change in spike rate in RS units, FS units, and unsorted multiunit clusters. We also measured the power in the local field potential (LFP) and current source density (CSD) when filtered at frequencies ranging from theta (4–8 Hz) to high gamma (50–120 Hz). We could not identify any electrical signature of the CS+ that persisted more than a few hundred milliseconds after sound offset. The response amplitudes of all signals measured just prior to the onset of the air puff were comparable with baseline levels prior to CS+ onset, ruling out the possibility that A1 neurons bridged the extended CS-US gap by prolonging the CS+ representation until the US arrived (Figure 3G). A second possibility was that A1 reorganization with CS-US trace conditioning protocols might not require cholinergic inputs in the ACx. To test this explanation, we injected a drug cocktail containing both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor antagonists into the A1 approximately 30 min prior to the start of recordings from awake, head-fixed mice from the same location (Figure 4A). To confirm the efficacy of the drug, we optogenetically activated cholinergic axons in the A1 and measured a robust cholinergic potential in the layer 2/3 (L2/3) CSD of ChAT-Cre × Ai32 mice with no injections or with vehicle injections (Figure 4B). Laser-evoked cholinergic potentials were virtually eliminated after cholinergic antagonists, down to the level observed in wild-type mice that do not express ChR2 (unpaired t tests; drug versus wild-type, p = 0.45; drug versus vehicle, p = 0.006; drug versus un-injected ChAT, p = 0.0001; Figure 4C). We next tested whether cholinergic receptor antagonists would block A1 receptive field plasticity induced by auditory trace conditioning (Figure 4D). Tuning functions and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) from example units demonstrate the expected enhancement of the CS+ frequency after vehicle injection but no change in A1 tuning when cholinergic synapses are blocked (Figures 4E–4G). Blocking cholinergic receptors in the ACx prevented receptive field reorganization at all time points (one-sample t tests against a population mean of 0; p > 0.67 for early, late, and post-conditioning stages), in contrast to the rapid and specific reorganization observed after local injections of vehicle solution (n = 24/25 RS units for drug/vehicle, Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.003; Figure 4H). Data from individual RS and FS units are provided in Figure S3. These findings were puzzling. On the one hand, we observed selective and persistent enhanced spiking evoked by sound frequencies paired with simultaneous cholinergic terminal activation, but not when ACh terminal activation lagged sound offset by 5 s (Figure 1G). On the other hand, using an air puff US instead of the laser pulse induced receptive field reorganization that could bridge the 5-s silent gap between the CS and US (Figures 2D and 3A–3E). We found no evidence of a persistent CS trace in the A1 that would sustain the acoustic representation until the US arrived (Figures 3F and 3G), but the receptive field reorganization was blocked by local injection of cholinergic antagonists (Figure 4). This led us to question the assumption that cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain were only elicited by the US. If, instead, cholinergic basal forebrain inputs were activated by the CS as well as the US during learning, then the cholinergic input would functionally bypass the 5-s gap and temporally coincide with the afferent sensory trace to establish the CS-US temporal handshake. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from optogenetically identified cholinergic basal forebrain neurons that project to the ACx (ChACx). To identify the highest density of ChACx neurons, we first performed an anatomy experiment in which fluorescent red retrobeads were injected into the A1 of ChAT-Cre × Ai32 mice (N = 4) (Figures 5A and 5B ; Figure S4). We identified enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)+ cholinergic neurons throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the basal forebrain (Figure 5C, top). Bead+ neurons clustered in two locations: (1) a rostral-ventral-medial region that overlaps with the nuclei of the diagonal band and rostral substantia innominata and (2) a more dorsal-lateral zone at the extreme caudal tail of the basal forebrain bordering the globus pallidus, an area that is sometimes referred to as the nucleus basalis (Figure 5C, center). The highest density of ChACx cells was found in this latter region, at the extreme caudal tail of the basal forebrain (Figure 5C, bottom; Kim et al., 2016Kim J.-H. Jung A.H. Jeong D. Choi I. Kim K. Shin S. Kim S.J. Lee S.-H. Selectivity of neuromodulatory projections from the basal forebrain and locus ceruleus to primary sensory cortices.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 5314-5327Google Scholar), although, even in the highest-density section, the majority of ChAT+ neurons (∼73%) did not contain retrobeads. The sparse projection underscored the need for an approach that could functionally isolate basal forebrain → ACx cholinergic projection neurons from other neighboring ChAT+ neurons that do not project to the ACx. This was accomplished by flashing blue light onto the surface of the ACx to trigger action potentials in cholinergic ACx axons and then recording the antidromic spike near the cell body in the basal forebrain (Figure 5D). In rare instances where brief (50-ms) optogenetic activation of ACx cholinergic axons activated basal forebrain single units (n = 176 of 1,566 recorded units), we noted that responses fell into two categories: short-latency spikes with low jitter in spike timing (Figure 5E, unit 1) or a longer latency burst of irregularly timed spikes (Figure 5E, unit 2). Either type of unit could have native auditory responses featuring well-defined tonal receptive fields with short-latency sound onset responses (Figure 5F). Among basal forebrain units driven both by laser and pure tones (n = 81), plotting the first spike latency against the first spike latency jitter revealed a sparse set of basal forebrain units (1.2%, n = 20 of 1,566 units) that stood apart from the remaining sample of recordings (Figure 5G). We operationally defined the short-latency, low-jitter population as directly activated ChACx units, whereas"
https://openalex.org/W2964809094,"Mel4 is a novel cationic peptide with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The current study examined the anti-staphylococcal mechanism of action of Mel4 and its precursor peptide melimine. The interaction of peptides with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and with the cytoplasmic membrane using DiSC(3)-5, Sytox green, Syto-9 and PI dyes were studied. Release of ATP and DNA/RNA from cells exposed to the peptides were determined. Bacteriolysis and autolysin-activated cell death were determined by measuring decreases in OD620nm and killing of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells by cell-free media. Both peptides bound to LTA and rapidly dissipated the membrane potential (within 30 seconds) without affecting bacterial viability. Disturbance of the membrane potential was followed by the release of ATP (50% of total cellular ATP) by melimine and by Mel4 (20%) after 2 minutes exposure (p<0.001). Mel4 resulted in staphylococcal cells taking up PI with 3.9% cells predominantly stained after 150 min exposure, whereas melimine showed 34% staining. Unlike melimine, Mel4 did not release DNA/RNA. Cell-free media from Mel4 treated cells hydrolysed peptidoglycan and produced greater zones of inhibition against M. lysodeikticus lawn than melimine treated samples. These findings suggest that pore formation is unlikely to be involved in Mel4-mediated membrane destabilization for staphylococci, since there was no significant Mel4-induced PI staining and DNA/RNA leakage. It is likely that the S. aureus killing mechanism of Mel4 involves the release of autolysins followed by cell death. Whereas, membrane interaction is the primary bactericidal activity of melimine, which includes membrane depolarization, pore formation, release of cellular contents leading to cell death."

We screened 2,197 adult patients with type 2 DM who had undergone fundus exam between August 2006 and February 2014. Among them, 1,592 subjects with available serial renal function and albuminuria measurement were included in the analysis. DR status was classified as no DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), and proliferative DR (PDR). The risk of CKD progression was assessed according to DR severity. A total of 384 (24.1%) had NPDR and 202 (12.7%) had PDR at either eye. The mean follow-up period was 5.6±2.1 years. DR was associated with lower body mass index, lower plasma hemoglobin, lower serum albumin level, longer duration of DM, poorer control of blood sugar, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and greater amount of albuminuria. Interestingly, baseline DR severity was associated with faster renal function decline and greater albuminuria progression. In multivariate analysis, NPDR had 2.9 times and PDR had 16.6 times higher risk for CKD progression. Our findings showed that baseline DR severity is a prognostic factor for future CKD progression in type 2 DM patients. Therefore, clinicians must evaluate DR severity at the first visit and closely monitor renal function and albuminuria in the subjects with severe DR."
https://openalex.org/W2965823716,"Open access publication rates have been steadily increasing over time. In spite of this growth, academics in low income settings struggle to gain access to the full canon of research literature. While the vast majority of open access repositories and funding organizations with open access policies are based in high income countries, the geographic patterns of open access publication itself are not well characterized. In this study, we developed a computational approach to better understand the topical and geographical landscape of open access publications in the biomedical research literature. Surprisingly, we found a strong negative correlation between country per capita income and the percentage of open access publication. Open access publication rates were particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa, but vastly lower in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. These effects persisted when considering papers only bearing authors from within each region and income group. However, papers resulting from international collaborations did have a higher percentage of OA than single-country papers, and inter-regional collaboration increased OA publication for all world regions. There was no clear relationship between the number of open access policies in a region and the percentage of open access publications in that region. To understand the distribution of open access across topics of biomedical research, we examined keywords that were most enriched and depleted in open access papers. Keywords related to genomics, computational biology, animal models, and infectious disease were enriched in open access publications, while keywords related to the environment, nursing, and surgery were depleted in open access publications. This work identifies geographic regions and fields of research that could be priority areas for open access advocacy. The finding that open access publication rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and low income countries suggests that factors other than open access policy strongly influence authors’ decisions to make their work openly accessible. The high proportion of OA resulting from international collaborations indicates yet another benefit of collaborative research. Certain applied fields of medical research, notably nursing, surgery, and environmental fields, appear to have a greater proportion of fee-for-access publications, which presumably creates barriers that prevent researchers and practitioners in low income settings from accessing the literature in those fields."
https://openalex.org/W2965285787,"Background Apolipoprotein E is a glycoprotein best known as a mediator and regulator of lipid transport and uptake. The APOE-ε4 allele has long been associated with increased risks of Alzheimer's disease and mortality, but the effect of the less prevalent APOE-ε2 allele on diseases in the elderly and survival remains elusive. Methods We aggregated data of 38,537 individuals of European ancestry (mean age 65.5 years; 55.6% women) from six population-based cohort studies (Rotterdam Study, AGES-Reykjavik Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Health-ABC Study, and the family-based Framingham Heart Study and Long Life Family Study) to determine the association of APOE, and in particular APOE-ε2, with survival in the population. Results During a mean follow-up of 11.7 years, 17,021 individuals died. Compared with homozygous APOE-ε3 carriers, APOE-ε2 carriers were at lower risk of death (hazard ratio,95% confidence interval: 0.94,0.90–0.99; P = 1.1*10−2), whereas APOE-ε4 carriers were at increased risk of death (HR 1.17,1.12–1.21; P = 2.8*10−16). APOE was associated with mortality risk in a dose-dependent manner, with risk estimates lowest for homozygous APOE-ε2 (HR 0.89,0.74–1.08), and highest for homozygous APOE-ε4 (HR 1.52,1.37–1.70). After censoring for dementia, effect estimates remained similar for APOE-ε2 (HR 0.95,0.90–1.01), but attenuated for APOE-ε4 (HR 1.07,1.01–1.12). Results were broadly similar across cohorts, and did not differ by age or sex. APOE genotype was associated with baseline lipid fractions (e.g. mean difference(95%CI) in LDL(mg/dL) for ε2 versus ε33: -17.1(-18.1–16.0), and ε4 versus ε33: +5.7(4.8;6.5)), but the association between APOE and mortality was unaltered after adjustment for baseline LDL or cardiovascular disease. Given the European ancestry of the study population, results may not apply to other ethnicities. Conclusion Compared with APOE-ε3, APOE-ε2 is associated with prolonged survival, whereas mortality risk is increased for APOE-ε4 carriers. Further collaborative efforts are needed to unravel the role of APOE and in particular APOE-ε2 in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2965423872,"Chronic activation of the IL-1β system in adipose tissue on metabolic disorders is well demonstrated. However, a mechanism for its expression and activation in the tissue has remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that IL-1β transcript was enriched in neutrophils of white adipose tissue (WAT) from lean mice. Mechanistically, the interaction of neutrophils with adipocytes induced IL-1β expression via NF-κB pathway. Lipolysis of adipocytes accumulated neutrophils prior to macrophages in WAT and produced high levels of IL-1β via an inflammasome pathway. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production in WAT also contributed to neutrophil accumulation. Furthermore, an LTB4-inflammasome axis contributed to the expression of chemotactic molecules involved in high-fat diet-induced macrophage infiltration into WAT. We have identified previously unappreciated roles for neutrophils in the development of adipose tissue inflammation: robust IL-1β production and infiltration of macrophages to initiate chronic inflammation.-Watanabe, Y., Nagai, Y., Honda, H., Okamoto, N., Yanagibashi, T., Ogasawara, M., Yamamoto, S., Imamura, R., Takasaki, I., Hara, H., Sasahara, M., Arita, M., Hida, S., Taniguchi, S., Suda, T., Takatsu, K.

Our data identify a molecular logic by which a single cell-intrinsic factor represses multiple extrinsic pathways that favor self-renewal, thereby ensuring robustness of neuronal fate transition. During neural development, the generation of the appropriate type and number of differentiated neurons and glial cells is controlled by a complex interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic cues acting on neural progenitors, thus regulating the balance between differentiation and self-renewal (Martynoga et al., 2012Martynoga B.

Cortical neurogenesis and morphogens: diversity of cues, sources and functions.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24: 269-276Google Scholar). In the developing cortex, radial glial cells are the main progenitors that will differentiate into specific postmitotic neuron populations, directly or through various classes of intermediate progenitors (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Google Scholar, Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Google Scholar). Proneural factors act on these progenitors as the main intrinsic drivers of neurogenesis (Guillemot and Hassan, 2017Guillemot F.

Key features of the Notch signaling pathway, such as lateral inhibition and oscillatory behavior, contribute in a major way to the irreversible commitment of differentiating cells toward neuronal fate (Kageyama et al., 2008Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Shimojo H. Imayoshi I. Dynamic Notch signaling in neural progenitor cells and a revised view of lateral inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1247-1251Google Scholar). Moreover, many classes of extrinsic morphogen cues, including Wnt ligands, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) can act on cortical progenitors to promote expansion and self-renewal and thereby effectively block neurogenesis (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors.Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Google Scholar, Kang et al., 2009Kang W. Wong L.C. Shi S.H. Hébert J.M.

Han Y.G. Hedgehog signaling promotes basal progenitor expansion and the growth and folding of the neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 888-896Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has long been proposed that postmitotic cells undergoing neuronal differentiation become insulated from extrinsic signaling (Edlund and Jessell, 1999Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Progression from extrinsic to intrinsic signaling in cell fate specification: a view from the nervous system.Cell. 1999; 96: 211-224Google Scholar). Whether and how responsiveness to extrinsic cues is negatively modulated to allow neuronal commitment remains essentially unclear. Delamination of the progenitors away from the ventricular zone could contribute to this process, as some of these cues are secreted in the embryonic cerebrospinal fluid and are thought to act through the apical processes or cilia of the radial glial cells (Lehtinen et al., 2011Lehtinen M.K. Zappaterra M.W. Chen X. Yang Y.J. Hill A.D. Lun M. Maynard T. Gonzalez D. Kim S. Ye P. et al.The cerebrospinal fluid provides a proliferative niche for neural progenitor cells.Neuron. 2011; 69: 893-905Google Scholar). However, several cues, most strikingly Wnts, are also present in the cortical tissue (Harrison-Uy and Pleasure, 2012Harrison-Uy S.J. Pleasure S.J. Wnt signaling and forebrain development.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a008094Google Scholar), where they can act on progenitors to block differentiation. Moreover, the signaling components of these various pathways, as well as some key downstream targets, are often partially overlapping. For instance, cross-talk of the Notch and Wnt pathways (Hayward et al., 2008Hayward P. Kalmar T. Arias A.M. Wnt/Notch signalling and information processing during development.Development. 2008; 135: 411-424Google Scholar), or Notch and FGFs (Rash et al., 2011Rash B.G. Lim H.D. Breunig J.J. Vaccarino F.M. FGF signaling expands embryonic cortical surface area by regulating Notch-dependent neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 15604-15617Google Scholar), has been documented during embryonic development and, despite the relatively simple intracellular regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, many of its components are used by other pathways or participate in distinct cellular activities. For instance, the deletion of Gsk3a/b, a major intracellular component of the β-catenin destruction complex, increases the proliferation of radial glial cells at the expense of their differentiation by altering not only Wnt but also Notch and FGF signaling activity (Kim et al., 2009Kim W.Y.

Also, some key effectors genes, such as Cyclin d1/d2, are found as common targets of all morphogen pathways, depending on cellular context (Cohen et al., 2010Cohen B. Shimizu M. Izrailit J. Ng N.F.

How these intermingled pathways are effectively shut down during neurogenesis is therefore a complex issue and remains largely unresolved.

Dimidschstein J. Piccirilli J. Gall D. Herpoel A. Bilheu A. Bonnefont J. Iacovino M. Kyba M. et al.BCL6 controls neurogenesis through Sirt1-dependent epigenetic repression of selective Notch targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Google Scholar), and in the cerebellum, Bcl6 promotes neurogenesis through repression of SHH pathway effectors Gli1/2 (Tiberi et al., 2014Tiberi L.

A BCL6/BCOR/SIRT1 complex triggers neurogenesis and suppresses medulloblastoma by repressing Sonic Hedgehog signaling.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26: 797-812Google Scholar). This raises the question whether Bcl6 promotes neurogenic conversion through the repression of distinct targets, depending on the cellular context, or through a more generic transcriptional repression program. Here, we combine transcriptome, epigenome, and in vivo functional analyses to determine the molecular logic of action of Bcl6 during neurogenesis, focusing on the cerebral cortex. We find that Bcl6 acts as a global repressor of a repertoire of signaling components of most signaling pathways known to promote self-renewal, including Notch, SHH, FGF, and most strikingly the Wnt pathway. These data define a molecular logic of neurogenesis whereby a single intrinsic factor downregulates the responsiveness to extrinsic cues, through transcriptional repression at multiple parallel and serial levels along these pathways, to ensure irreversible neurogenic fate transition. To determine the primary molecular mechanisms of Bcl6 action in cortical neurogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analysis on in vitro embryonic-stem-cell-derived cortical progenitors driving inducible Bcl6 expression in order to timely control the transgene induction (Figure 1A; Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Google Scholar). We found that, 24 h following Bcl6 induction, 764 genes were significantly upregulated, with Bcl6 being the most increased, and 610 genes were significantly downregulated, with Hes5 being the most repressed (Table S1). Gene Ontology analysis of the upregulated genes revealed a significant enrichment in categories linked to development and cell or neuron differentiation (Figure 1B; Table S2). More specifically, most of the canonical markers of differentiation into intermediate progenitors and neurons were significantly upregulated (Figure 1C; Table S1). On the other hand, downregulated genes showed an enrichment in gene categories linked to regulation of translation, negative regulation of neurogenesis, and most strikingly to signaling pathways promoting the expansion and self-renewal of cortical progenitors (Figure 1B; Table S2). Among the significantly downregulated genes, we found, as expected, markers of radial glial cells and transcriptional targets of Notch but also many signaling components of FGF and SHH-dependent pathways and, most strikingly, a high number of genes belonging to the Wnt signaling cascade, from ligands to receptors to target genes (Figures 1C–1E; Tables S1 and S3). Given that Bcl6 has strong effects on neurogenesis, it could be that these global transcriptional changes reflect the consequence of changes in cell fate rather than direct regulation by Bcl6. However, the majority of the tested genes belonging to these proliferative pathways (8/11) were downregulated following Bcl6 induction several hours earlier than changes in cell fate markers (Figures 1F and S1A), indicating that their downregulation is not the mere result of Bcl6-mediated differentiation.

Cell. 2010; 18: 472-479Google Scholar) and the number of downregulated genes belonging to this pathway, we tested the global impact of Bcl6 on the Wnt pathway in vivo. Axin 2, a classical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent target gene, was found to be upregulated in Bcl6−/− mouse embryonic cortex using in situ hybridization. Although Axin2 expression is normally detected in the medial pallium of the frontal cortex in wild-type animals, a higher signal was found throughout dorsolateral levels in Bcl6−/− mice (Figures 2A and 2B ), suggesting that β-catenin/Tcf activity is increased in the mutant cortex. Interestingly, this difference was not detectable at more posterior levels (Figures 2A and 2B), in accordance with the frontal high occipital low graded Bcl6 expression (Tiberi et al., 2012aTiberi L. van den Ameele J. Dimidschstein J. Piccirilli J. Gall D. Herpoel A. Bilheu A. Bonnefont J. Iacovino M. Kyba M. et al.BCL6 controls neurogenesis through Sirt1-dependent epigenetic repression of selective Notch targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Google Scholar). Given that these gene expression changes are specific to the frontal cortex, we tested whether they could affect areal patterning in the mutant mice. However, analysis of the pattern of expression of several area-specific markers did not detect any obvious changes in areal patterning in the Bcl6 mutant mice (Figures S2A–S2J), suggesting that Bcl6 effect on the Wnt pathways does not affect regional patterning of the cortex. On the other hand, these data suggest that Bcl6 neurogenic function could depend on the downregulation of the canonical Wnt pathway. We first tested this in vitro by examining potential genetic interactions between Bcl6 and β-catenin, the main signaling hub protein of the pathway. Neurogenic genes upregulated in vitro by Bcl6 were prevented by CHIR99021, a GSK3 inhibitor over-activating the canonical Wnt pathway. CHIR99021, which increased the levels of the Wnt reporter gene Lef1, also prevented Bcl6-mediated downregulation of Wnt target genes but did not prevent repression of Notch targets (Figure S2K). We then examined in vivo the impact of the gain of function of a stabilized β-catenin mutant on Bcl6 overexpression using in utero electroporation. Bcl6 gain of function alone led to increased neurogenesis, as assessed by increased number of cells in the cortical plate (CP) and an increase in Neurod2+ and Tuj1+ neurons, at the expense of ventricular zone (VZ)-located Pax6+ and Sox2+ progenitors, without detectable effect on neuronal migration or progenitor delamination (Figures 2C–2E and S3A–S3G). Importantly, these effects were suppressed by overexpression of stabilized β-catenin (Figures 2C–2E and S4C). Conversely, we combined Bcl6 and β-catenin (Ctnnb1) knockdown to assess potential epistasis. As expected (Tiberi et al., 2012aTiberi L. van den Ameele J. Dimidschstein J. Piccirilli J. Gall D. Herpoel A. Bilheu A. Bonnefont J. Iacovino M. Kyba M. et al.BCL6 controls neurogenesis through Sirt1-dependent epigenetic repression of selective Notch targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Google Scholar), Bcl6 knockdown led to decreased neurogenesis per se, as reflected by increased cell number in the VZ at the expense of the CP, associated with increased levels of radial glial cell progenitors and decreased neurons (Figures 2F–2H and S3H–S3N), and this phenotype was significantly rescued by the Ctnnb1 knockdown (Figures 2F–2H). These data collectively suggest that Bcl6 functionally acts on the Wnt pathway to promote neurogenesis, in addition to its effect on the Notch target Hes5 (Tiberi et al., 2012aTiberi L. van den Ameele J. Dimidschstein J. Piccirilli J. Gall D. Herpoel A. Bilheu A. Bonnefont J. Iacovino M. Kyba M. et al.BCL6 controls neurogenesis through Sirt1-dependent epigenetic repression of selective Notch targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Google Scholar). We next directly compared the impact of Bcl6 on Wnt and Notch pathways in vivo by combining Ctnnb1 and Hes5 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to further assess whether Bcl6 represses them in parallel or sequentially. Hes5 knockdown rescued some of the Bcl6 loss-of-function-mediated phenotype to levels similar to the rescue obtained using the Ctnnb1 knockdown. However, the association of both Ctnnb1 and Hes5 shRNAs showed additive rescue of Bcl6 knockdown, reaching the corresponding control levels (Ctnnb1+Hes5 shRNA combination; Figures 2F–2H), suggesting that Bcl6 alters these two cascades at least in part in parallel. Altogether, these data indicate that Bcl6-mediated repression of the Wnt pathway, already at the level of β-catenin, is necessary to elicit neurogenic activity, in parallel to Notch signaling repression. Thus, Bcl6 acts by repression of multiple pathways promoting progenitor self-renewal and proliferation. As β-catenin is not only a key component of the Wnt pathway but also an important regulator of adherens junctions (Nelson and Nusse, 2004Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Convergence of Wnt, beta-catenin, and cadherin pathways.Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Google Scholar), we tested further the specific implication of the Wnt pathway by focusing on Tcf7l1, which was also found to be downregulated in response to Bcl6 in vitro (Figure S1A) and is the most heavily expressed Tcf/Lef transcription factor in cortical progenitors (Galceran et al., 2000Galceran J. Miyashita-Lin E.M. Devaney E. Rubenstein J.L. Grosschedl R. Hippocampus development and generation of dentate gyrus granule cells is regulated by LEF1.Development. 2000; 127: 469-482Crossref Google Scholar). Remarkably, we found that overexpression of Tcf7l1 blocked Bcl6-mediated neurogenesis in vivo (Figures S4A–S4D). Hence, these data strongly suggest that β-catenin downregulation by Bcl6 is mostly linked to its Wnt-related transcriptional activity rather than its activity in adherens junctions. This is in line with our RNA-seq analyses, which show that the expression of most genes related to adherens junctions tend to increase upon Bcl6 overexpression, especially Jup/γ-catenin (Figure S1B), thereby compensating β-catenin decrease, as previously reported (Wickline et al., 2013Wickline E.D. Du Y. Stolz D.B. Kahn M. Monga S.P. γ-catenin at adherens junctions: mechanism and biologic implications in hepatocellular cancer after β-catenin knockdown.Neoplasia. 2013; 15: 421-434Google Scholar). Although Bcl6 appears to repress multiple serial components of individual pathways, it could also act through common effectors of parallel signals. In line with this hypothesis, Cyclin d1/d2 genes were found to be downregulated by Bcl6 overexpression in vitro (Figure 1D; Table S1) and are known to be upregulated by pathways driving progenitor self-renewal, including Wnt (Shtutman et al., 1999Shtutman M.

Cyclin D2 in the basal process of neural progenitors is linked to non-equivalent cell fates.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1879-1892Google Scholar). We first examined their expression in the developing cortex in wild-type and Bcl6−/− brains. Ccnd1 was found in the VZ and SVZ in wild-type mice as previously reported (Glickstein et al., 2007Glickstein S.B. Alexander S. Ross M.E. Differences in cyclin D2 and D1 protein expression distinguish forebrain progenitor subsets.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 632-642Google Scholar), and its levels were significantly increased in Bcl6−/− animals (Figures 3A and 3B ). Ccnd2 mRNA was mostly detected in basal endfeet of radial glial cells and at lower intensity in the ventricular zone at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), as previously described (Tsunekawa et al., 2012Tsunekawa Y. Britto J.M. Takahashi M. Polleux F. Tan S.S. Osumi N. Cyclin D2 in the basal process of neural progenitors is linked to non-equivalent cell fates.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1879-1892Google Scholar). Although the high density of labeling and limited resolution of in situ hybridization precluded detecting upregulation in the basal endfeet, Ccnd2 levels were significantly increased in the VZ in Bcl6−/− cortex (Figures 3C and 3D). Hence, Bcl6 negatively controls Ccnd1/2 expression in cortical progenitors in vivo. We next examined the functional impact of Bcl6 loss of function on Ccnd1/Ccnd2 double knockdown, as these two cyclins regulate cell cycle progression in a redundant manner (Ciemerych et al., 2002Ciemerych M.A. Kenney A.M. Sicinska E. Kalaszczynska I. Bronson R.T. Rowitch D.H. Gardner H. Sicinski P.

Polleux F. Tan S.S. Osumi N. Cyclin D2 in the basal process of neural progenitors is linked to non-equivalent cell fates.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1879-1892Google Scholar). Decreased neurogenesis observed following Bcl6 shRNA was completely rescued by the dual Ccnd1/Ccnd2 knockdown (Figures 3E–3G and S4E–S4G). Conversely, Ccnd1 overexpression blocked Bcl6-elicited neurogenesis in vivo (Figures S4A–S4D). This indicates that, in addition to repressing specific signaling pathway components, Bcl6 action also involves repression of common terminal effector targets, such as Ccnd1/2, driving progenitor proliferation and self-renewal. Overall, our data indicate that Bcl6 acts through inhibition of multiple pathways to promote neurogenesis, raising the question of which effects are directly related to Bcl6 transcriptional repression or reflect its indirect consequences. To address this point, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq to identify Bcl6 binding sites using in vitro cortical progenitors driving inducible Bcl6 expression in order to increase the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation (Figure S5). This revealed that Bcl6 binding was predominantly found on promoter regions, with a significant enrichment for Bcl6 matrix binding motif (Figures S5A–S5D). Further, 39% of the Bcl6-predicted targets (1,701/4,366 peak-associated genes) were similar to those previously reported by ChIP-seq in human B cells (Basso et al., 2010Basso K. Saito M. Sumazin P.

Integrated biochemical and computational approach identifies BCL6 direct target genes controlling multiple pathways in normal germinal center B cells.Blood. 2010; 115: 975-984Google Scholar). In line with our transcriptomics data, Bcl6 bound to numerous genes of the multiple cascades regulating the proliferation of cortical progenitors (Figure S5E), although it should be noted that only 19% of the downregulated genes from the RNA-seq dataset were found in the ChIP-seq screen (115/610 genes), indicating partial discrepancy between transcription factor binding and transcriptional effect, at least at the time points tested. Then we validated in vivo some of these targets using ChIP-qPCR on the identifie"

Methods A prospective quasi-experimental study was carried out on a sample of 116 students. 10 multiple-choice questions were designed, with only one possible correct answer and a 20-second-limited response time for each of the questions. Four of these questions previously answered in the classroom using this game were chosen (20% of the exam). Each one of them corresponded to one unit of the topics taught in the subject. In order to participate in the educational game, students needed their smartphones or electronic devices. After completing the game, the students’ satisfaction level derived from its use was assessed. Results The correct answer rate in the educational game was greater than 50% for all questions except for one, in which the rate was 28.8% (P<0.05). Response time as related to score presented statistically significant differences, and higher scores for those questions with lower response time (P<0.001). The questions included in the final test which had been previously answered using Kahoot! showed a significantly higher difficulty index than the rest of the final exam questions (P<0.05). Question 3 was the easiest, while being the one in which the highest-scoring students obtained more wrong answers. For the students this tool was easy to use (89.6%) and they positively valued the content acquisition and comprehension, as well as the teacher-student interaction (P<0.05). Conclusion The implementation of educational games which consider response time and correct answers favors competitiveness and motivates students to actively participate in their learning process."

Because endometrial disorders are also associated with aberrant decidualization, we asked whether they share molecular features with sPE. We employed microarray data integration to compare the molecular pathologies of PE-CVS and endometrial disorders, as well as decidua obtained postpartum from women with sPE. Eight public databases were reanalyzed with R software to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pathologic tissues relative to normal controls. DEGs were then compared to explore overlap. Shared DEGs were examined for enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Principal component and network analyses were subsequently applied to selected DEGs. There was significant overlap of DEGs changing in the same direction for PE-CVS and endometrial disorders, suggesting common molecular pathways. Shared DEGs were enriched for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Genes in this pathway revealed expression patterns forming 2 distinct clusters, one for normal and the other pathologic endometrium. The most affected hub genes were related to decidualization and NK cell function. Few DEGs were shared by PE-CVS, and PE decidua obtained postpartum. sPE may be part of a biologic continuum of ""endometrial spectrum disorders.""-Rabaglino, M. B., Conrad, K. P.

Here, using various biochemical and immunological methods, including flow cytometry, cell proliferation and migration assays, Rho activation and quantitative RT-PCR assays, we investigated the mechanism by which CS-GRP78 contributes to radioresistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. We found that activated α2-Macroglobulin (α2M*) a ligand of the CS-GRP78 receptor, induces formation of the AKT kinase (AKT)/DLC1 Rho-GTPase-activating protein (DLC1) complex and thereby increases Rho activation. Further, CS-GRP78 activated the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and tafazzin (TAZ) in a Rho-dependent manner, promoting motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells. We observed that radiation-induced CS-GRP78 stimulates the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ and increases YAP/TAZ target gene expressions. Remarkably, targeting CS-GRP78 with C38 monoclonal antibody (Mab) enhanced radiosensitivity and increased the efficacy of radiation therapy by curtailing PDAC cell motility and invasion. These findings reveal that CS-GRP78 acts upstream of YAP/TAZ signaling and promote migration and radiation-resistance in PDAC cells.

https://openalex.org/W2963263769,"Metabolic conditions affect the developmental tempo of animals. Developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) must therefore synchronize their dynamics with a variable timescale. We find that layered repression of genes couples GRN output with variable metabolism. When repressors of transcription or mRNA and protein stability are lost, fewer errors in Drosophila development occur when metabolism is lowered. We demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon by eliminating the entire microRNA family of repressors and find that development to maturity can be largely rescued when metabolism is reduced. Using a mathematical model that replicates GRN dynamics, we find that lowering metabolism suppresses the emergence of developmental errors by curtailing the influence of auxiliary repressors on GRN output. We experimentally show that gene expression dynamics are less affected by loss of repressors when metabolism is reduced. Thus, layered repression provides robustness through error suppression and may provide an evolutionary route to a shorter reproductive cycle."

Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to analyze controls and 1) all symptomatic samples or 2) symptomatic samples without CSF pleocytosis.Compared with the control CSF samples, levels of all investigated chemo/cytokines were increased in symptomatic CSF samples, and only IL-6 remained elevated in recovery samples (p ≤ 0.001). CSF CXCL-13 levels (> 10.9 pg/mL) were the best individual discriminatory criterion to differentiate neuroinflammation (specificity/sensitivity: 97/72% and 97/61% for samples without pleocytosis), followed by CSF WBC counts (specificity/sensitivity: 97/62%).

The contour shape and note composition significantly affected most acoustic variables of USV syllables in either pups or adults. The 1-note USV syllables were most common in either pups or adults. Pup USV syllables were overall longer and higher-frequency than adult ones, reminiscent of the USV ontogenetic pathway of bats and distinctive to rats and mice. We discuss that the USV syllable types of fat-tailed gerbils were generally similar in contour shapes and note compositions with USV syllable types of mice and rats, what means that software developed for automated classifying of mice ultrasound might be easily adapted or re-tuned to gerbil USV calls. However, using fat-tailed gerbils as model for biomedical research including control of USV vocalization is only possible since 6th day of pup life, because of the delayed emergence of USV calls in ontogeny of this species."

Due to this ability, B. subtilis is as well a model organism for cellular differentiation processes. Sporulating cultures of B. subtilis form sub-populations which include vegetative cells, sporulating cells and spores. In order to readily and rapidly quantify spore formation we employed flow cytometric and fluorescence activated cell sorting techniques in combination with nucleic acid fluorescent staining in order to investigate the distribution of sporulating cultures on a single cell level. Automated gating procedures using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) were employed to avoid subjective gating and allow for the simultaneous measurement of controls. We utilized the presented method for monitoring sporulation over time in germination deficient strains harboring different genome modifications. A decrease in the sporulation efficiency of strain Bs02018, utilized for the display of sfGFP on the spores surface was observed. On the contrary, a double knock-out mutant of the phosphatase gene encoding Spo0E and of the spore killing factor SkfA (Bs02025) exhibited the highest sporulation efficiency, as within 24 h of cultivation in sporulation medium, cultures of BS02025 already consisted of 80% spores as opposed to 18% for the control strain. We confirmed the identity of the different subpopulations formed during sporulation by employing sorting and microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2966834053,"Background Recent trends in sexual behavior, demonstrated in most countries, continue to indicate that more people are adopting safer sexual behaviors. However, there are signs of an increase in risky sexual behaviors in several countries. This study aimed to assess sexual behaviors and associated factors among youths in Nekemte town, East Wollega, Ethiopia in 2017. Methods A community-based cross sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Then, the collected data were analysed using logistic regressions with 95% confidence interval (CI). Besides, the results of data analysis were `presented using appropriate descriptive measures and tables. Findings Almost half of the respondents, 144(48.6%) had practiced sexual intercourse. Factors associated with ever had sexual intercourse include: being in age group 20-24(AOR = 2.322, 95% CI (1.258, 4.284)), having pocket money (AOR = 1.938, 95% CI (1.057, 3.556)), not attending school (AOR = 2.539, 95% CI (1.182, 5.456)), watching pornography (AOR = 4.314, 95% CI (2.265, 8.216)) and drinking alcohol (AOR = 7.725, 95% CI (3.077, 19.393)). Conclusion High proportions of youths were practicing sexual intercourse. Targeting those identified associated factors in future intervention plan would improve the sexual behaviors of youths."

Nuclear HDACs exist as at least six giant multiprotein complexes whose nonenzymatic subunits confer genome targeting specificity for these enzymes. The deacetylase activity of HDACs has been shown previously to be enhanced by inositol phosphates, which also bridge the catalytic domain in protein–protein interactions with SANT (Swi3, Ada2, N-Cor, and TFIIIB) domains in all HDAC complexes except those that contain the Sin3 transcriptional corepressors. Here, using purified recombinant proteins, coimmunoprecipitation and HDAC assays, and pulldown and NMR experiments, we show that HDAC1/2 deacetylase activity in one of the most ancient and evolutionarily conserved Sin3L/Rpd3L complexes is inducibly up-regulated by inositol phosphates but involves interactions with a zinc finger motif in the Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30) subunit that is structurally unrelated to SANT domains, indicating convergent evolution at the functional level. This implies that this mode of regulation has evolved independently multiple times and provides an evolutionary advantage. We also found that constitutive association with another core subunit, Rb-binding protein 4 chromatin-binding factor (RBBP4), further enhances deacetylase activity, implying both inducible and constitutive regulatory mechanisms within the same HDAC complex. Our results indicate that inositol phosphates stimulate HDAC activity and that the SAP30 zinc finger motif performs roles similar to that of the unrelated SANT domain in promoting the SAP30–HDAC1 interaction and enhancing HDAC activity.

https://openalex.org/W2964675668,"To evaluate the relationship among personality (according to Cloninger's psychobiological model), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, trait resilience and quality of life (QoL) in people who were exposed to the Kiss nightclub fire.188 participants were assessed with the Posttraumatic Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), the Resilience Scale (RS), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL-Bref), and the WHOQOL-100 Spirituality, religiousness, and personal beliefs (WHOQOL-100-SRPB). Data were analyzed in a dimensional approach, with correlation analysis, multiple linear regression and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with PCL-C, RS, and WHOQOL-Bref dimensions as dependent variables.Multiple linear regression showed that PTSD symptoms were predicted by harm avoidance (β = .34, p < .001), self-directedness (β = -.28, p < .01), and self-transcendence (β = .24, p < .01). Trait resilience was predicted by harm avoidance (β = -.38, p < .01), self-directedness (β = .20, p < .05), and self-transcendence (β = .18, p < .05). Also, PTSD symptoms had considerable negative effect on all dimensions of QoL. Self-transcendence was a positive predictor of subjective and spiritual QoL. SEM showed that QoL was predicted by PTSD symptoms (β = -.52, p < .001), trait resilience (β = .30, p < .001), cooperativeness (β = .135, p = 0.40), and self-directedness (β = .27, p < .01). The effect of self-directedness on QoL was mediated by PTSD symptoms and trait resilience. PTSD symptoms also mediated the relationship between trait resilience and QoL, and RS mediated the relationship of personality and PTSD symptoms.The study gives insights on prediction of PTSD severity, trait resilience and QoL from temperament and character traits, in a sample of people exposed to the Kiss nightclub fire. Harm avoidance was the most influent trait on PTSD symptoms and trait resilience. Self-directedness was the most import trait related to QoL, still that it was more related to PTSD severity than personality traits. Self-transcendence had positive effects on both PTSD symptoms and trait resilience, indicating a coping style that may coexist with psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2965453112,"Actomyosin networks, the cell’s major force production machineries, remodel cellular membranes during myriad dynamic processes1,2 by assembling into various architectures with distinct force generation properties3,4. While linear and branched actomyosin architectures are well characterized in cell-culture and cell-free systems3, it is not known how actin and myosin networks form and function to remodel membranes in complex three-dimensional mammalian tissues. Here, we use four-dimensional spinning-disc confocal microscopy with image deconvolution to acquire macromolecular-scale detail of dynamic actomyosin networks in exocrine glands of live mice. We address how actin and myosin organize around large membrane-bound secretory vesicles and generate the forces required to complete exocytosis5–7. We find that actin and non-muscle myosin II (NMII) assemble into previously undescribed polyhedral-like lattices around the vesicle membrane. The NMII lattice comprises bipolar minifilaments8–10 as well as non-canonical three-legged configurations. Using photobleaching and pharmacological perturbations in vivo, we show that actomyosin contractility and actin polymerization together push on the underlying vesicle membrane to overcome the energy barrier and complete exocytosis7. Our imaging approach thus unveils a force-generating actomyosin lattice that regulates secretion in the exocrine organs of live animals. Using intravital imaging, Ebrahim et al. show that actin and non-muscle myosin II assemble into polyhedral lattices around the vesicle membrane to mediate exocytic secretion in live tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2965906678,"Eukaryotes typically utilize two distinct aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase isoforms, one for cytosolic and one for mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, the genome of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains only one cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase gene (YNL247W, also known as CRS1). In this study, we report that CRS1 encodes both cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. The 5′ complementary DNA end method and GFP reporter gene analyses indicated that yeast CRS1 expression yields two classes of mRNAs through alternative transcription starts: a long mRNA containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a short mRNA lacking this targeting sequence. We found that the mitochondrial Crs1 is the product of translation from the first initiation AUG codon on the long mRNA, whereas the cytosolic Crs1 is produced from the second in-frame AUG codon on the short mRNA. Genetic analysis and a ChIP assay revealed that the transcription factor heme activator protein (Hap) complex, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, determines the transcription start sites of the CRS1 gene. We also noted that Hap complex–dependent initiation is regulated according to the needs of mitochondrial energy production. The results of our study indicate energy-dependent initiation of alternative transcription of CRS1 that results in production of two Crs1 isoforms, a finding that suggests Crs1's potential involvement in mitochondrial energy metabolism in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2965949515,"Chromosome abnormalities induces profound alterations in gene expression, leading to various disease phenotypes. Recent studies on yeast and mammalian cells have demonstrated that aneuploidy exerts detrimental effects on organismal growth and development, regardless of the karyotype, suggesting that aneuploidy-associated stress plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. However, whether and how this effect alters cellular homeostasis and long-term features of human disease are not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate cellular stress responses in human trisomy syndromes, using fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with trisomy 21, 18 and 13 showed a severe impairment of cell proliferation and enhanced premature senescence. These phenomena were accompanied by perturbation of protein homeostasis, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates. We found that treatment with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, decreased the protein aggregates in trisomy fibroblasts. Notably, 4-PBA treatment successfully prevented the progression of premature senescence in secondary fibroblasts derived from trisomy 21 iPSCs. Our study reveals aneuploidy-associated stress as a potential therapeutic target for human trisomies, including Down syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2966398979,"Focal and Segmental GlomeruloSclerosis (FSGS) can cause nephrotic syndrome with a risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. The idiopathic form has a high rate of recurrence after transplantation, suggesting the presence of a systemic circulating factor that causes glomerular permeability and can be removed by plasmapheresis or protein-A immunoadsorption.To identify this circulating factor, the eluate proteins bound on therapeutic immunoadsorption with protein-A columns were analyzed by comparative electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A soluble form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) was identified. CASK was immunoprecipitated only in the sera of patients with recurrent FSGS after transplantation and not in control patients. Recombinant-CASK (rCASK) induced the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in immortalized podocytes, a redistribution of synaptopodin, ZO-1,vinculin and ENA. rCASK also induced alterations in the permeability of a monolayer of podocytes and increased the motility of pdodocytes in vitro. The extracellular domain of CD98, a transmembrane receptor expressed on renal epithelial cells, has been found to co-immunoprecipitated with rCASK. The invalidation of CD98 with siRNA avoided the structural changes of rCask treated cells suggesting its involvement in physiopathology of the disease. In mice, recombinant CASK induced proteinuria and foot process effacement in podocytes.Our results suggest that CASK can induce the recurrence of FSGS after renal transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2966296930,"Background Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular foodborne pathogen that employs a number of strategies to survive challenging gastrointestinal conditions. It proliferates in the gut and subsequently causes listeriosis in high-risk individuals. Therefore, inhibition of its adherence to the intestinal receptors is crucial in controlling its infection. In this study, the effect of our previously developed recombinant Lactobacillus casei strain expressing invasion protein, Internalin AB of L. monocytogenes (LbcInlAB) on epithelial infection processes of the latter under simulated intestinal conditions was investigated. Materials and methods The confluent Caco-2 cell monolayer was pre-exposed to different L. casei strains at a multiplicity of exposure (MOE) of 10 for various periods before infection with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 under simulated intestinal conditions. Subsequently, L. monocytogenes adhesion, invasion, and translocation, cytotoxicity and impact on tight junction integrity of the Caco-2 cells were analyzed. Results Under the simulated gastrointestinal condition, LbcInlAB showed a significant increase (p<0.0001) in adherence to, invasion and translocation through the Caco-2 cells when compared with the wild type strain. Although LbcInlAB strain exhibited enhanced inhibition of L. monocytogenes, it was not able to displace L. monocytogenes cells already attached to the monolayer. Additionally, pre-exposure to LbcInlAB reduced L. monocytogenes-mediated cytotoxicity and protected the tight junction barrier function. Conclusion The recombinant L. casei expressing InlAB shows potential for use as a prophylactic intervention strategy for targeted control of L. monocytogenes during the intestinal phase of infection."

WHO and India's HIV/tuberculosis control programs recommend intensified case finding in prisons. Low HIV and tuberculosis detection rates suggest poor implementation of existing surveillance strategies within the prison healthcare system in Mizoram's capital city of Aizawl. We explored the operational feasibility of implementing the intensified case finding strategy in Aizawl central prison. We implemented the intensified screening through entry screening of new inmates, mass screening of resident inmates and exit screening at release. We set up digital chest radiography, sputum smear microscopy and HIV testing facilities within the prison and referral to external facility for Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT). We screened 738 inmates (Male: 626; Female: 112). Of 53% inmates having presumptive tuberculosis symptoms, 37% underwent sputum microscopy. We detected 14 new tuberculosis cases; overall tuberculosis positivity 1.9%. We tested 65% of 657 inmates for HIV, of which 41 new cases were detected; overall HIV positivity 16.5%. Three male inmates had HIV-tuberculosis co-infection. It is feasible to implement intensified case detection for tuberculosis/HIV in the prison with inter-departmental coordination, albeit with certain challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2966077435,"The 2017-2018 influenza epidemic season in Russia was characterized by a relatively low morbidity and mortality. We evaluated herd immunity prior to the 2017-2018 influenza season in hemagglutination inhibition assay, and performed characterization of influenza viruses isolated from severe or fatal influenza cases and from influenza cases in people vaccinated in the fall of 2017. During the 2017-2018 epidemic season, 87 influenza A and B viruses were isolated and viruses of the 75 influenza cases, including selected viral isolates and viruses analyzed directly from the original clinical material, were genetically characterized. The analyzed A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to clade 6B.1, B/Yamagata-like viruses belonged to clade 3, and B/Victoria-like viruses belonged to clade 1A and they were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine strains. A(H3N2) viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a and were difficult to characterize antigenically and the analysis indicated antigenic differences from the corresponding egg-grown vaccine strain. The next generation sequencing revealed the presence of D222/G/N polymorphism in the hemagglutinin gene in 32% of the analyzed A(H1N1)pdm09 lethal cases. This study demonstrated the importance of monitoring D222G/N polymorphism, including detection of minor viral variants with the mutations, in the hemagglutinin gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 for epidemiological surveillance. One strain of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 was resistant to oseltamivir and had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA protein. All other isolates were susceptible to NA inhibitors. Prior to the 2017-2018 epidemic season, 67.4 million people were vaccinated, which accounted for 46.6% of the country's population. Just before the epidemic season 33-47% and 24-30% of blood sera samples collected within the territory of Russia showed the presence of protective antibody titers against vaccine strains of influenza A and influenza B/Victoria-like, respectively. Mass vaccination of the population had evidently reduced the severity of the flu epidemic during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic season in Russia."
https://openalex.org/W2965512654,"Aims The aim of the present study was to investigate the major determinants of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), considering the traditional and newly discovered risk factors, including hypoglycaemia and glycemic variability. Methods This retrospective case-control study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan. A total of 2,837 patients with T2D were recruited, medical history and biochemical data were obtained, and patients were screened for DPN using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). DPN was defined as an MNSI exam score > 2. A stepwise selection of variables was used based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz Criterion (SC). Multivariate analysis was performed using the identified variables obtained from the stepwise selection. Results Among the recruited patients, 604 (21.3%) were found to have DPN. 275 patients with DPN were selected because of longer follow up period before enrollment and complete data of glycemic parameters, and paired with 351 patients with T2D without DPN and matched for age, gender, and diabetes duration. The results of the stepwise selection showed that the presence of moderately and severely increased albuminuria yielded the lowest values of AIC and SC, which indicate the best predictive performance. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that moderately and severely increased albuminuria and greater long-term glycemic variability significantly increased the risk of DPN, with a corresponding odds ratio of 1.85 and 1.61 (95%confidence intervals of 1.25–2.73and1.02–2.55, respectively), after adjusted for hypoglycaemia and types of diabetes treatment. Conclusions Albuminuria is a potent predictor of DPN, and greater long-term glycemic variabilityis clearly associated with DPN in adults with T2D. These findings indicate that, in addition to achieve average blood glucose control, screening for albuminuria and reducing blood glucose fluctuations might be useful for improving diabetic microvascular complications."

Previous work suggests that facial cues associated with perceptions of dominance and trustworthiness have context-specific effects on leadership decisions. Facial cues linked to perceived dominance have been found to be preferred in leaders for hypothetical wartime contexts and facial cues linked to perceived trustworthiness have been found to be preferred in leaders for hypothetical peacetime contexts. Here we sought to replicate these effects using images of women's faces, as previous studies have primarily focused on perceptions of leadership abilities from male faces, with only a handful of these including female faces. Consistent with previous work, a linear mixed effects model demonstrated that more trustworthy-looking faces were preferred in leaders during times of peace and more dominant-looking faces were preferred in leaders during times of war. These results provide converging evidence for context-specific effects of facial cues on hypothetical leadership judgments."

However, the application of epidemiological risk knowledge to individuals within such communities is not straightforward and creates tensions for community health workers who are part of the communities that they are serving. Situated qualitative interview data were co-produced with community health workers employed in a superdiverse, deprived, post-industrial region of the United Kingdom, using photo-voice methods, to develop an account of how they made sense of the challenges of their work. The analysis draws on and develops theories of risk work and resilience work, which draw on practice theory. The key findings were that, first, being a critical insider enabled community health workers to make sense of the diverse constraints on health and lifestyles within their community. Second, they understood their own public health role as limited by operating within this context, so they articulated their occupational identity as focused on supporting clients to make small but sustainable changes to their own and their families’ lifestyles. Third, the uncertainties of translating population based risk information to individual clients were (at least partially) resolved at an embodied level, with the community health workers identifying as accessible and trusted role models for the value of changed lifestyles. The article is important for policy and practice as it provides a critique of a rapidly evolving new mode of delivery of public health services, and insights on the development of this new public health workforce."

In ectotherms like fishes, temperature is a particularly important environmental variable that is known to have significant impacts on the phenotype. Here, we raised specimens of the surface ecomorph of Astyanax mexicanus at temperatures of 20°C, 23°C, 25°C, and 28°C to examine how temperature influenced vertebral number and body shape. To increase biological realism, specimens were also subjected to two water turbulence regimes. Vertebral number was counted from x-rays and body shape variation was analysed using geometric morphometric methods. Temperature significantly impacted mean total vertebral number, which increased at the lowest and highest temperatures. Fish reared at lower temperatures had relatively more precaudal vertebrae while fish reared at higher temperatures had relatively more caudal vertebrae. Vertebral anomalies, especially vertebral fusions, were most frequent at the extreme temperature treatments. Temperature significantly impacted body shape as well, with fish reared at 20°C being particularly divergent. Water turbulence also impacted body shape in a generally predictable manner, with specimens reared in high turbulence environments being more streamlined and having extended dorsal and anal fin bases. Variation in environmental variables thus resulted in significant changes in morphological traits known to impact fish fitness, indicating that A. mexicanus has the capacity to exhibit a range of phenotypic plasticity when challenged by environmental change. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying this plasticity and whether adaptive plasticity has influenced the evolutionary radiation of the Characidae, are major directions for future research."

The woolly false vampire bat Chrotopterus auritus is a carnivorous bat that is both an indicator species for well-conserved forests and a threatened species in Mexico and other countries due to deforestation. We currently lack the information needed to assess the effects of forest fragmentation and destruction on their populations and to develop plans for their conservation. We used GPS loggers to study the movement patterns of C. auritus in southern Mexico. We observed 72 foraging nights by GPS-tagging 10 individuals from two colonies on 32 occasions in a highly disturbed heterogeneous landscape with extensive deforestation (Hormiguero), and in a more homogeneous, well-preserved forested landscape (Monterrey). Tracked false vampire bats averaged a home range of 108.24 ha, a core foraging area of 3.78 ha and average maximum flight distances of 2.06 km. The bats ranged farther and flew significantly longer distances in Hormiguero than in Monterrey, with males flying longer and more variable distances. They used the well-preserved semi-deciduous forest more often than secondary forest and agricultural fields for traveling and foraging, but the bats occasionally moved and hunted along the borders of secondary forest and agricultural fields adjacent to semi-deciduous conserved forest areas. Although this carnivorous bat might cope with some fragmentation, we suggest that large well-preserved forested areas are highly important for its conservation."

The vast majority of the demands (41 demands) came from the public sector, and only six from the private sector. Most of the requests referred to the exclusion of specific indication; followed by extension of use, withdraw of the technology from SUS, maintenance, and restriction of use. The dimensions of analysis found in the recommendation reports were scientific evidence on efficacy, effectiveness and safety, disease-related issues, issues related to the use of technology, costs, and social participation. However, these dimensions were not included in all analysis, and a standardized structure of the reports has not been observed. The most relevant decision factors considered for decision-making were efficacy, safety and use of the technology.During a six-year period of Conitec actuation, we could find some reassessments of technologies that are available in SUS.

https://openalex.org/W2966806637,"Recent genome analysis of human prostate cancers demonstrated that both AR gene amplification and TP53 mutation are among the most frequently observed alterations in advanced prostate cancer. However, the biological role of these dual genetic alterations in prostate tumorigenesis is largely unknown. In addition, there are no biologically relevant models that can be used to assess the molecular mechanisms for these genetic abnormalities. Here, we report a novel mouse model, in which elevated transgenic AR expression and Trp53 deletion occur simultaneously in mouse prostatic epithelium to mimic human prostate cancer cells. These compound mice developed an earlier onset of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and accelerated prostate tumors in comparison with mice harboring only the AR transgene. Histological analysis showed prostatic sarcomatoid and basaloid carcinomas with massive squamous differentiation in the above compound mice. RNA-sequencing analyses identified a robust enrichment of the signature genes for human prostatic basal cell carcinomas in the above prostate tumors. Master regulator analysis revealed SOX2 as a transcriptional regulator in prostatic basal cell tumors. Elevated expression of SOX2 and its downstream target genes were detected in prostatic tumors of the compound mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses implicate a coregulatory role of AR and SOX2 in the expression of prostatic basal cell signature genes. Our data demonstrate a critical role of SOX2 in prostate tumorigenesis and provide mechanistic insight into prostate tumor aggressiveness and progression mediated by aberrant AR and p53 signaling pathways."

These ticks were morphologically identified and subjected to nested PCR, targeting Borrelia-specific CTP synthase (pyrG), outer surface protein A (ospA) and flagellin (flaB) genes. Molecular biological species identification of Borrelia-positive ticks was conducted via 16S rRNA PCR assays. Of the 484 ticks collected, 417 (86.2%) were identified as Haemaphysalis longicornis, 42 (8.7%) as H. flava, and 25 (5.2%) as Ixodes nipponensis. All the ixodid ticks containing Borrelia species bacteria were confirmed to be I. nipponensis adults, by both morphological and molecular methods. Of the 25 I. nipponensis ticks collected, four (16%) were positive for Borrelia species, three of which were B. afzelii and one B. miyamotoi.Our study has shown the harboring of B. miyamotoi by I. nipponensis in South Korea.

https://openalex.org/W2966483972,"Staphylococci have evolved numerous strategies to evade their hosts’ immune systems. Some staphylococcal toxins target essential components of host innate immunity, one of the two main branches of the immune system. Analysis of the Staphylococcus pseudintermedius secretome using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry guided by genomic data, was used to identify an S. pseudintermedius exotoxin provisionally named SpEX. This exoprotein has low overall amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus group of proteins named staphylococcal superantigen like proteins (SSLs) and staphylococcal enterotoxin- like toxin X (SEIX), but predictive modeling showed that it shares similar folds and domain architecture to these important virulence factors. In this study, we found SpEX binds to complement component C5, prevents complement mediated lysis of sensitized bovine red blood cells, kills polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes and inhibits neutrophil migration at sub-lethal concentrations. A mutant version of SpEX, produced through amino acid substitution at selected positions, had diminished cytotoxicity. Anti-SpEX produced in dogs reduced the inhibitory effect of native SpEX on canine neutrophil migration and protected immune cells from the toxic effects of the native recombinant protein. These results suggest that SpEX likely plays an important role in S. pseudintermedius virulence and that attenuated SpEX may be an important candidate for inclusion in a vaccine against S. pseudintermedius infections."

The aim of this study was to specify the total societal cost of OPC by HPV status, cancer stage, and subsite using a bottom-up cost-of-illness approach. Methods We analyzed 121 consecutive patients with OPC from the Southern Health Care Region of Sweden. We estimated the direct medical costs and indirect costs (e.g., disease-related morbidity and premature death) from 1 month prior to OPC diagnosis until 3 years after treatment completion. Results The mean total cost per patient was €103 386 for HPV-positive and €120 244 for HPV-negative OPC. Eighty-one percent of the patients analyzed were HPV-positive: Accordingly, HPV-positive OPC represented 79% of the total cost of OPC. The mean total cost of stage I, II, III, IVA, IVB, and IVC, regardless of HPV status, was €59 424, €57 000, €69 246, €115 770, €234 459, and €21 930, respectively, of which indirect costs were estimated at €22 493 (37.8%), €14 754 (25.9%), €28 681 (41.4%), €67 107 (58%), €166 280 (70.9%), and €0. Tonsillar cancer represented 64% of OPC, with a mean total cost of €117 512 per patient. Conclusion The societal cost of OPC is substantial. HPV-associated OPC comprises 79% of the total cost of this disease. The data presented in this study may be used in analytical models to aid decision makers in determining the potential value of gender-neutral HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2964660674,"Value and waste in preclinical and clinical research projects are intensively debated in biomedicine at present. Such different aspects as the need for setting objectives and priorities, improving study design, quality of reporting, and problematic incentives of the academic reward system are addressed. While this debate is also fueled by ethical considerations and thus informed by bioethical research, up to now, the field of bioethics lacks a similar extensive debate. Nonetheless, bioethical research should not go unquestioned regarding its scientific or social value. What exactly constitutes the value of bioethical research, however, remains widely unclear so far.This explorative study investigated possible value dimensions for bioethical research by conducting a qualitative literature analysis of researchers' statements about the value of their studies. 40 bioethics articles published 2015 in four relevant journals (The American Journal of Bioethics, Bioethics, BMC Medical Ethics and Journal of Medical Ethics) were analyzed. The value dimensions of ""advancing knowledge"" (e.g. research results that are relevant for science itself and for further research) and ""application"" (e.g. increasing applicability of research results in practice) were used as main deductive categories for the analysis. Further subcategories were inductively generated.The analysis resulted in 62 subcategories representing a wide range of value dimensions for bioethical research. Of these, 45 were subcategories of ""advancing knowledge"" and 17 of ""application"". In 21 articles, no value dimensions related to ""application"" was found; the remaining 19 articles mentioned ""advancing knowledge"" as well as ""application"". The value dimensions related to ""advancing knowledge"" were, in general, more fine-grained.Even though limitations arise regarding the sample, the study revealed a plethora of value dimensions that can inform further debates about what makes bioethical research valuable for science and society. Besides theoretical reflections on the value of bioethics more meta-research in bioethics is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2964966717,"The contemporary scientific community places a growing emphasis on the reproducibility of research. The projects R package is a free, open-source package created in the interest of facilitating reproducible research workflows. It adds to existing software tools for reproducible research and introduces several practical features that are helpful for scientists and their collaborative research teams. For each individual project, it supplies a framework for storing raw and cleaned study data sets, and it provides script templates for protocol creation, data cleaning, data analysis and manuscript development. Internal databases of project and author information are generated and displayed, and manuscript title pages containing author lists and their affiliations are automatically generated from the internal database. File management tools allow teams to organize multiple projects. When used on a shared file system, multiple researchers can harmoniously contribute to the same project in a less punctuated manner, reducing the frequency of misunderstandings and the need for status updates."
https://openalex.org/W2965902084,"The stereo correspondence problem exists because false matches between the images from multiple sensors camouflage the true (veridical) matches. True matches are correspondences between image points that have the same generative source; false matches are correspondences between similar image points that have different sources. This problem of selecting true matches among false ones must be overcome by both biological and artificial stereo systems in order for them to be useful depth sensors. The proposed re-examination of this fundamental issue shows that false matches form a symmetrical pattern in the array of all possible matches, with true matches forming the axis of symmetry. The patterning of false matches can therefore be used to locate true matches and derive the depth profile of the surface that gave rise to them. This reverses the traditional strategy, which treats false matches as noise. The new approach is particularly well-suited to extract the 3-D locations and shapes of camouflaged surfaces and to work in scenes characterized by high degrees of clutter. We demonstrate that the symmetry of false-match signals can be exploited to identify surfaces in random-dot stereograms. This strategy permits novel depth computations for target detection, localization, and identification by machine-vision systems, accounts for physiological and psychophysical findings that are otherwise puzzling and makes possible new ways for combining stereo and motion signals."
https://openalex.org/W2965840486,"The malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, and other mosquitoes modulate their biology to match the time-of-day. In the present work, we used a non-hypothesis driven approach (untargeted proteomics) to identify proteins in mosquito tissue, and then quantified the relative abundance of the identified proteins from An. stephensi bodies. Using these quantified protein levels, we then analyzed the data for proteins that were only detectable at certain times-of-the day, highlighting the need to consider time-of-day in experimental design. Further, we extended our time-of-day analysis to look for proteins which cycle in a rhythmic 24-hour (“circadian”) manner, identifying 31 rhythmic proteins. Finally, to maximize the utility of our data, we performed a proteogenomic analysis to improve the genome annotation of An. stephensi. We compare peptides that were detected using mass spectrometry but are ‘missing’ from the An. stephensi predicted proteome, to reference proteomes from 38 other primarily human disease vector species. We found 239 such peptide matches and reveal that genome annotation can be improved using proteogenomic analysis from taxonomically diverse reference proteomes. Examination of ‘missing’ peptides revealed reading frame errors, errors in gene-calling, overlapping gene models, and suspected gaps in the genome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2966753506,"Because the underdog in a conflict typically gains the support of observers, nations will often adopt a narrative that persuades both their domestic following and international allies that they are the true victim in the conflict. Three survey studies were conducted to assess the perceptions of citizens of a third-party observer nation (Canada) in relation to two nations in conflict that differ in their historical persecution, namely the U.S. and Israel. Perceptions of the vulnerability of their safety and survival, and their strength to protect themselves against their opponents were hypothesized to mediate differences in the perceived justification for each nation’s conflict actions. Study 1 (N = 91) supported this mediational model, with the U.S. seen as less vulnerable and more powerful than Israel, and perceptions of vulnerability accounting for differences in the justifiability of their respective conflict actions. Study 2 (N = 315) further demonstrated a moderating effect of Canadians’ shared identity with the nations in conflict; only at lower levels of a shared identity was Israel perceived to be more vulnerable and the mediated relation with the perceived justifiability of its conflict actions retained. Study 3 was conducted 10 years later (2018), administering measures to an independent sample of Canadian participants (N = 300). Canadians were found to be significantly less likely to share a common identity with Americans than previously; once again, the mediating role of the perceived vulnerability of the nations in conflict and the justifiability of their actions was conditional on shared identification. The findings contribute to understanding influences on the credibility of victim claims by nations in conflict, as well as implications for how their actions are construed by citizens of a third-party observer nation."
