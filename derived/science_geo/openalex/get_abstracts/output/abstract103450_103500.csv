In all of the cell types examined, PGHS-1 immunoreactivity was found equally distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE). PGHS-2 immunoreactivity was also present in the ER and NE. However, PGHS-2 staining was twice as concentrated in the NE as in the ER. A histofluorescence staining method was developed to localize cyclooxygenase/peroxidase activity. In quiescent 3T3 cells, which express only PGHS-1, histofluorescent staining was most concentrated in the perinuclear cytoplasmic region. In contrast, histochemical staining for PGHS-2 activity was about equally intense in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, a pattern of activity staining distinct from that observed with PGHS-1. Our results indicate that there are significant differences in the subcellular locations of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. It appears that PGHS-1 functions predominantly in the ER whereas PGHS-2 may function in the ER and the NE. We speculate that PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 acting in the ER and PGHS-2 functioning in the NE represent independent prostanoid biosynthetic systems.

Newly formed PGH2 is subsequently converted to what are considered to be the biologically active prostanoids, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, thromboxane A2, or PGI2. There are two PGH synthase isozymes called PGHS-1 (COX-1) and PGHS-2 (COX-2). Each isozyme is encoded by a different gene (1Kraemer S.A. Meade E.A. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem.

PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are 60% identical at the amino acid level.

The kinetic properties of the two enzymes are quite similar. Both enzymes catalyze (a) a cyclooxygenase reaction in which arachidonic acid is converted to PGG2 and (b) a peroxidase reaction in which PGG2 is reduced to PGH2(20Ohki S. Ogino N. Yamamoto S.

Despite the overall enzymic similarities between PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, it should be noted that there are subtle differences between the active sites of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 as evidenced by their different affinities toward some fatty acid substrates 2O.

Treatment of quiescent murine 3T3 cells with serum causes an increase in PGHS-2 protein levels which peak approximately 3 h post-serum treatment. During this period, there are no apparent changes in the levels of PGHS-1 protein (8Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Dewitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Lee S.H.

However, measurements of cyclooxygenase activities in quiescent and serum-stimulated (3 h) 3T3 cells have established that platelet-derived growth factor and serum cause only a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in total activity (8Evett G.E.

Similar measurements comparing the cyclooxygenase activities of control and LPS-treated macrophages have yielded similar results (16Lee S.H. Soyoola E. Chanmugam P. Hart S. Sun W. Zhong H. Liou S. Simmons D. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25934-25938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in those cells which already express PGHS-1, there is no dramatic increase in the total PGH2 biosynthetic capacity following the induction of PGHS-2. Coupled with the fact that PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 have very similar kinetic properties, it is difficult to argue that PGHS-2 is induced simply to augment the biosynthetic capacity of PGHS-1. Rather, PGHS-2 seems likely to have a function(s) independent of PGHS-1. There is recent biochemical evidence that PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 function as separate biosynthetic systems. Reddy and Herschman (32Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in murine 3T3 cells and macrophages PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 utilize different pools of arachidonate for synthesizing prostanoids. In murine bone marrow-derived mast cells, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are coupled to different stimulus-initiated pathways (33Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results argue that the arachidonate used by PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 for prostanoid biosynthesis is derived from different endogenous lipid pools. If PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 do use different intracellular pools of arachidonate, there must be mechanisms for compartmentalizing PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 such that each isozyme would only have access to its own arachidonate substrate pool. One possibility is that the PGHS isozymes are located in different subcellular compartments. Previous studies, including those from our laboratory, have indicated that PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are both found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE) of fibroblasts and macrophages and that there is no particularly obvious difference in the subcellular distributions of the isozymes (34Rollins T.E. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4872-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Regier M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem.

Reddy S.T. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now reinvestigated this issue using a variety of cell types, several antibodies for each isozyme, and a newly developed histofluorescence assay for PGHS activity. Our results confirm the previous observations that both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are located within the ER and NE. However, PGHS-2 protein was found to be more concentrated in the NE than PGHS-1. And when the distributions of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 activities were monitored by histofluorescence, only PGHS-2 caused staining within the cell nucleus.

Valerylsalicylate was synthesized as described previously (38Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Dunn J. Morgans D.J. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other reagents were from common commercial sources. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown on 100-mm Corning culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 8% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence, detached from the monolayer with 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, diluted into 50 ml of serum-supplemented DMEM, and used to inoculate Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses. NIH 3T3 cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% calf serum for 48 h were designated “quiescent” cells. To obtain “serum-activated” cells, the serum-starved cells were changed to a medium containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum in DMEM and incubated for 3 h. NIH 3T3 cells expressing PGHS-2 constitutively were prepared as follows. A 1.8-kilobase SalI restriction fragment containing the entire murine PGHS-2 coding sequence (39Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Lac-inducible plasmid pRSVNOT (40Fieck A. Wyborski D.L. Short J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pRSVNOT plasmid, part of the LacSwitch gene expression system (Stratagene), contains a combination Rous sarcoma virus promoter (RSV)-bacterial β-galactosidase promoter (RSV/β-gal) to drive transcription of the donor gene. The pRSVNOT-PGHS-2 plasmid was transfected into a murine NIH 3T3 cell line expressing a Lac repressor protein, modified so that it functions as an efficient eukaryotic transcription factor. In theory, the Lac repressor protein tonically suppresses gene expression from the RSV/β-gal promoter, and suppression can be relieved by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, allowing regulated expression of the target gene. During characterization of pRSVNOT-PGHS-2 transformants, however, one cell line was identified that constitutively expressed PGHS-2. This line was designated as the 3T3-cPGHS-2 cell line. 3T3-cPGHS-2 cells constitutively express PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 under serum-starved culture conditions. 3T3-cPGHS-2 cells were routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml geneticin and hygromycin. NIH 3T3-cPGHS-2 cells were transferred to Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses and cultured for 2 days, the medium was removed, and the cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% calf serum for 24 h. These cells were used for immunocytochemistry as described below. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Cell Systems, passage 3-4) were cultured in Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses in Cell System CS-C venous endothelial cell growth medium for 3 days. The cells were then treated with 2 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 3 h and used for localization experiments. Bovine arterial endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from freshly excised carotid artery obtained at a local abattoir as described previously (41Morita I. Kanayasu T. Murota S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded on 100-mm Corning culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and subcultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were identified as endothelial cells from their typical cobblestone appearance at confluency. The endothelial cells (passages 20-22) were cultured in Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses for 2 days, and then cells were treated with 2 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 3 h before use in localization experiments. Affinity-purified isozyme-specific antibodies to PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were generated as described previously (36Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies reactive against both the murine and human PGHS-1 were prepared using the following KLH-coupled peptides derived from the murine protein: (a) Leu-Met-Arg-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Gly-Val-Pro-Pro-Glu-Arg-Gln-Met-Ala-Cys (residues 274-289) or (b) Cys-Asn-Thr-Ser-Met-Leu-Val-Asp-Tyr-Gly-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu-Val-Asp-Ala-Phe-Ser (residues 412-429). An additional anti-peptide antibody reactive with human, ovine, and bovine PGHS-1, but not murine PGHS-1, was prepared against the ovine PGHS-1 sequence, Leu-Met-His-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ile-Pro-Pro-Gln (residues 272-283) (36Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously described an anti-peptide antibody reactive with human, bovine, and murine PGHS-2 (10Dewitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem.

Another antibody to murine PGHS-2 was prepared against the KLH-coupled murine PGHS-2-derived peptide, Cys-Gln-Asp-Pro-Gln-Pro-Thr-Lys-Thr-Ala-Thr-Ile-Asn (residues 569-580). Peptide-specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using peptide-coupled Sulfolink matrix as described previously (35Regier M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Murine NIH 3T3 cells, murine NIH 3T3-cPGHS-2 cells, HUVECs, and BAECs cultured in Lab-Tek chambers were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed by incubation for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and washed in 10% calf serum in PBS (35Regier M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies to either PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 diluted 1:20 in PBS containing 0.2% saponin and 10% calf serum were added to the chambers, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. After washing in PBS containing 10% calf serum, the samples were incubated for 30 min with a 1:40 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 0.2% saponin and 10% calf serum. The samples were washed with PBS containing 10% calf serum and then rinsed with PBS. For negative control staining, the same procedure as described above was performed (a) without primary antibody or (b) with primary antibody together with a 10 μM concentration of its cognate peptide. In one experiment, after murine 3T3 cells were subjected to immunocytofluorescence with anti-peptide antibodies, the cells were then stained using either DiOC6(3Smith W.L. Willis A.L.

The cells were treated with 1 μg/ml DiOC6(3Smith W.L. Willis A.L. CRC Handbook of Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins and Related Lipids. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 175-184Google Scholar, 42Terasaki M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 s or with 5 μg/ml FITC-conjugated ConA (43Velasco A. Hidalgo J. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) for 1 min at room temperature. The samples were then rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4. These procedures were performed on the platform of the microscope, and the samples were visualized immediately. Quiescent or serum-activated NIH 3T3 cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml of both calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (PBS+), incubated with 2 μM CDCF-DA in PBS+ for 5 min, and washed with PBS+. The fluorescence intensity in the cells at 0 time and 20 s after the addition of 10 μM arachidonic acid was quantified by fluorescence confocal microscopy. An Insight Bilateral scanning confocal microscope (Meridian Instruments, Okemos, MI) was used with an argon ion laser as the excitation source (44Wade M.H. DeFeijter A.W. Frame M.K. Schindler M. Bioanalytical Instrumentation. 1993; 37: 117-141Google Scholar). A 60× objective and a laser power setting of 1 milliwatt were used for subcellular localization of enzyme activity by histofluorescence and subcellular localization of DiOC6(3Smith W.L. Willis A.L. CRC Handbook of Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins and Related Lipids. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 175-184Google Scholar) and FITC-labeled ConA. A 60× objective lens and a laser power setting of 30 milliwatts were used for subcellular localization of PGHSs by immunocytochemistry. Shown in Fig. 1 are fluorescence photomicrographs of quiescent and serum-activated murine 3T3 cells stained by indirect immunofluorescence using primary antibodies specific for either PGHS-1 or PGHS-2. Staining for PGHS-1 was performed separately using two different anti-peptide antibodies directed against residues 274-289 and residues 412-429. In both quiescent and serum-activated 3T3 cells, PGHS-1 immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm near the nucleus and also more peripherally. PGHS-1 is known to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of 3T3 cells (34Rollins T.E. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4872-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, thus, fluorescent staining in the cytoplasm is due to staining of the ER. Anti-peptide antibodies reactive with residues 569-580 or 584-598 of murine PGHS-2 caused fluorescence staining of both the cytoplasm and the nuclear envelope (NE) of serum-activated 3T3 cells (Fig. 1); staining of the NE was clearly more prominent for PGHS-2 than for PGHS-1. No staining for PGHS-2 was observed in quiescent, serum-starved 3T3 cells which do not express this second PGHS isozyme (8Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, preincubation of either of the anti-PGHS-1 or anti-PGHS-2 antibodies with their cognate peptides completely eliminated staining, and no staining was observed in the absence of the primary antibody. To quantify the relative distributions of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 in the ER and the NE of 3T3 cells, the cells were stained first with an antibody to a single PGHS isozyme, and staining intensities in the ER and on the NE were then quantified using confocal imaging microscopy. The same cells were then stained with either FITC-labeled ConA or a fluorescent dye (DiOC6(3Smith W.L. Willis A.L. CRC Handbook of Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins and Related Lipids. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 175-184Google Scholar)), both of which partition uniformly among intracellular membranes (42Terasaki M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar, 43Velasco A. Hidalgo J. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and again the staining intensities were quantified in the ER and NE. 3The fluorescence resulting from the initial staining for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 did not interfere with the second sets of measurements, because the staining intensities of FITC-labeled ConA and DiOC6(3) were much greater than those for immunofluorescence staining for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. As shown in Fig. 2, the relative fluorescence intensities in the ER and NE were the same for PGHS-1, FITC-labeled ConA, and DiOC6(3Smith W.L. Willis A.L. CRC Handbook of Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins and Related Lipids. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 175-184Google Scholar). In contrast, the intensity of PGHS-2 immunofluorescence was two times higher in the NE than the ER. In a related experiment, we determined if time-dependent changes occurred in the distribution of either PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 in the NE relative to the ER of 3T3 cells after serum activation. As shown in Fig. 3, the relative fluorescence intensities in the ER and NE were 2.0, 2.0, 1.7, and 1.7 for PGHS-2 during a 4-h treatment of initially quiescent 3T3 cells with fetal calf serum; in contrast, the relative intensities were 1.0 for PGHS-1 at all time points. When measurements were conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h post-serum stimulation, the relative intensities were also the same"
https://openalex.org/W1483231863,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a newly isolated cytokine that was identified based on its ability to induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. It is a member of the family of cytokines that includes interleukins-6 and −11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M. These cytokines induce a pleiotropic set of growth and differentiation activities via receptors that use a common signaling subunit, gp130. In this work we determine the activity of CT-1 in six in vitro biological assays and examine the composition of its cell surface receptor. We find that CT-1 is inactive in stimulating the growth of the hybridoma cell line, B9 and inhibits the growth of the mouse myeloid leukemia cell line, M1. CT-1 induces a phenotypic switch in rat sympathetic neurons and promotes the survival of rat dopaminergic and chick ciliary neurons. CT-1 also inhibits the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. CT-1 and LIF cross-compete for binding to M1 cells, Kd[CT-1] ~ 0.7 nM, and this binding is inhibited by an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody. Both ligands can be specifically cross-linked to a protein on M1 cells with the mobility of the LIF receptor (~200 kDa). In addition, CT-1 binds directly to a purified, soluble form of the LIF receptor in solution (Kd~ 2 nM). These data show that CT-1 has a wide range of hematopoietic, neuronal, and developmental activities and that it can act via the LIF receptor and the gp130 signaling subunit.

Cardiac muscle hypertrophy is an important adaptive response of the heart to injury or to an increased demand for cardiac output (1Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hancer W. Van Bilson M.

In the course of identifying factors that mediate the various phases of cardiac hypertrophy, we recently isolated by expression cloning a novel cytokine, cardiotrophin (CT-1) 1The abbreviations used are: CT-1cardiotrophin-1ILinterleukinLIFleukemia inhibitory factorCNTFciliary neurotrophic factorOSMoncostatin MGPIglycosyl-phosphatidylinositolGPAgrowth promoting activitySTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionSIEc- sis-inducible element. , that induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vitro(7Pennica D.

One member of this family, LIF, a previously unrecognized inducer of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, was shown to be nearly as potent as CT-1 in inducing these effects in vitro(7Pennica D. King K.L.

The IL-6 family of cytokines has a wide range of growth and differentiation activities on many cell types including those from the blood, liver, and nervous system (8Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T.

CT-1 mRNA is widely (but not universally) expressed in adult mouse tissues including heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver.

In this work, we show that CT-1 is active in several in vitro biological assays where cytokines of the IL-6 family have activity. We also show that CT-1 can bind to and induce biological responses via the LIF receptor and its signaling subunit, gp130.

Briefly, binding reactions contained 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 6.7% glycerol, 0.067 g/liter poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC), 0.5 ng (25,000 cpm) of 32P-SIE DNA (5’-CTAGAGTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATCT and 5’-CTAGAGATTTACGGGAAATGTCGACT, high affinity m67 (42Sadowski H.B.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar)), and 3 μl of cell extract in a final volume of 15 μl. Some reactions included 100 ng of unlabeled SIE DNA. The reactions were incubated 30 min at 22°C and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. DNA encoding the extracellular domain of the mouse LIF receptor (amino acids 1-826) and mouse gp130 (1-617) was generated by PCR of M1 cell (above) mRNA and of a mouse lung cDNA library (Clontech). These sequences were cloned with a C-terminal tag encoding 6 histidine residues in the mammalian expression vector, pRK5 (44Suva L.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M. Dieffenbach-Jagger H. Rodda C.P. Kemp B.E. Rodriguez H. Chen E.Y. Hudson P.J. Martin T.J. Wood W.I. Science. 1987; 237: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), to give the plasmids, pRK5.mu.slifr and pRK5.mu.sgp130. DNA sequencing of the coding regions confirmed that these plasmids encode proteins that match the published amino acid sequence (45Tomida M. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Hozumi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception of the substitution of lysine for arginine at amino acid 326 of gp130, a change that was found for three fragments from both sources. The plasmids were transfected into human 293 cells (7Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and the proteins isolated from 4-day conditioned medium by Ni2+-nitrilo-triacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity purification. Briefly, the conditioned medium was concentrated ~18-fold (Centriprep 10, Amicon), and the tagged protein was purified by binding to the Ni2+ resin for 2 h at room temperature. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM imidazole, the proteins were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 mM imidazole and quantitated by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Analysis of the proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed single bands of 120 kDa for the soluble LIF receptor and 85 kDa for soluble gp130. Amino acid sequencing gave the expected amino-terminal sequence for the soluble LIF receptor beginning at amino acid 44 (45Tomida M. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Hozumi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 47von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar); the amino terminus of gp130 is expected to be blocked (46Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar), and amino-terminal protein sequencing gave no sequence for soluble gp130. Binding to the soluble LIF receptor and soluble gp130 was performed in a manner similar to that described previously (48Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed in 96-well Multiscreen-HV filtration plates with 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and including 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline-washed Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) in a final volume of 175 μl. Plates were incubated at room temperature overnight with agitation. Following vacuum filtration and one wash with 200 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, the individual assay wells were cut from the plate and counted. The data were analyzed as described above for M1 binding. We have previously shown that, like CT-1, some members of the IL-6 cytokine family (LIF, OSM, and IL-11) induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vitro(7Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Since the members of this family have a wide range of hematopoietic, neuronal, and developmental activities (9Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), CT-1 was assayed for its activity in these biological systems. IL-6 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing cells following antigen stimulation (8Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether CT-1 could also mediate these effects, we tested CT-1 on the mouse hybridoma cell line, B9 (29Aarden L.A. De Groot E.R. Schaap O.L. Lansdorp P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). While IL-6 stimulates the proliferation of B9 cells as indicated by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, CT-1 and LIF were inactive (Fig. 1 A), even at concentrations as high as 2 μM (data not shown). Thus, CT-1 does not mimic the activity of IL-6 in promoting B cell expansion. While IL-6 stimulates the growth of several B cell lymphomas, myelomas, and plasmacytomas, it also has growth inhibitory effects on certain B lymphoma and myeloid leukemia cells (8Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 (as well as LIF and OSM) inhibits the growth of the mouse myeloid leukemia cell line, M1, and induces its differentiation into a macrophage-like phenotype (8Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). On testing CT-1, we found that it was 6-fold more potent than LIF in inhibiting the uptake of [3H]thymidine by M1 cells (Fig. 1 B). Thus, CT-1 does share at least some of the growth inhibitory activities of the IL-6 family cytokines. Members of the IL-6 cytokine family modulate the phenotype and promote the survival of neuronal cells (50Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7833-7835Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). LIF and CNTF can induce a switch in the transmitter phenotype of sympathetic neurons from noradrenergic to cholinergic, a change that is accompanied by the induction of several neuropeptides including substance P, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (51Rao M.S. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 24: 215-232Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ability of CT-1 to induce this switch in the transmitter phenotype was determined with cultured rat sympathetic neurons. CT-1 inhibited the tyrosine hydroxylase activity (a noradrenergic marker) and stimulated somewhat the choline acetyltransferase activity (a cholinergic marker) of these cells, effects that paralleled the actions of LIF (Fig. 2 A). Thus, CT-1 is active in modulating the phenotype of sympathetic neurons. Parkinson's disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain (52Hirsch E. Graybiel A.M. Agid Y.A. Nature. 1988; 334: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). While proteins of the neurotrophin family (brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4/5) as well as of the transforming growth factor-β family (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, transforming growth factor-β2, and transforming growth factor-β3) promote the survival of cultured dopaminergic neurons (27Poulsen K.T. Armanini M.P. Klein R.D. Hynes M.A. Phillips H.S. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1245-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); many other growth factors and cytokines, including CNTF, do not. Unlike CNTF, CT-1 was found to promote the survival of rat dopaminergic neurons, although it was not as potent as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Fig. 2 B). While inactive on dopaminergic neurons, CNTF does promote the survival of ciliary neurons (53Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 139-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). CT-1 was tested for its activity in promoting the survival of chick ciliary neurons (Fig. 2 C). While at maximal concentrations, CT-1 was as active as CNTF, the potency of CT-1 in promoting ciliary neuron survival was about 1000-fold less than that of CNTF (Fig. 2 C). Thus, CT-1 shares some neuronal activities with the IL-6 family cytokines such as CNTF. The presence or absence of soluble factors plays a key role during embryonic and fetal development. For example, embryonic stem cells require the continuous presence of soluble factors secreted by fibroblasts to maintain their undifferentiated, pluripotent phenotype. LIF (54Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagner E.F. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 55Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), CNTF (56Conover J.C. Ip N.Y. Poueymirou W.T. Bates B. Goldfarb M.P. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Development. 1993; 119: 559-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and OSM (57Rose T.M. Weiford D.M. Gunderson N.L. Bruce A.G. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (but not IL-6 without the soluble IL-6 receptor (58Yoshida K. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A. Saito M. Yasukawa K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)) can replace these fibroblast-derived factors in maintaining the pluripotent phenotype of embryonic stem cells in culture. CT-1 was also found to inhibit the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (Fig. 3); it was as effective as LIF at the concentrations tested. Thus, the data from seven in vitro biological assays indicate that CT-1 is active in assays where LIF is active and vice versa. These data also show that CT-1 is active in assays where CNTF is active but that the converse is not always the case and that CT-1 is inactive in IL-6 specific assays, assays in which LIF is also inactive. Since the activity profiles of members of this cytokine family are determined by the receptors expressed on target cell populations, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that CT-1 binds and transduces its biological effects via the LIF receptor. In order to show directly that CT-1 functio"

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7248–7256). In Chinese hamster ovary cells labeled with [3H]serine or [3H]ethanolamine, we found that the majority of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine was derived from phosphatidylserine decarboxylation. Essentially no mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine, especially that in the inner membrane, was imported from the endoplasmic reticulum. We tested the hypothesis that phosphatidylserine made in the endoplasmic reticulum is delivered via the MAM to mitochondria for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine. Cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]serine and subsequently incubated either in the presence of hydroxylamine (for inhibition of phosphatidylserine decarboxylation) or under conditions for which cellular ATP had been depleted (for inhibition of phosphatidylserine import into mitochondria). In hydroxylamine-treated cells, within 2 h, the amount of radiolabeled phosphatidylserine in the MAM and mitochondria, but not microsomes, was greater than in untreated cells. Moreover, in ATP-depleted, but not in control, cells the amount of radiolabeled phosphatidylserine in the MAM approximately doubled by 3 h. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that newly synthesized phosphatidylserine normally traverses the MAM en route to mitochondria. Phosphatidylserine is synthesized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and a unique membrane fraction, the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7248–7256).

These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that newly synthesized phosphatidylserine normally traverses the MAM en route to mitochondria. In eukaryotes, the final stages in the biosynthesis of the majority of phospholipids occur on endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Vance and Vance, 1988Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The other membranes in the cell (e.g. mitochondria, nucleus, plasma membrane) are therefore assembled from lipids synthesized in, and exported from, the endoplasmic reticulum. An exception to this generalization is phosphatidylethanolamine which is synthesized in mitochondria by the decarboxylation of PtdSer 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSerphosphatidylserineCHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumMAMmitochondria-associated membranePtdEtnphosphatidylethanolamine (Dennis and Kennedy, 1972Dennis E.A. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Bes. 1972; 13: 263-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (Jelsema and Morré, 1978Jelsema C.L. Morré D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7960-7971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Vance and Vance, 1988Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An additional, minor route of PtdEtn biosynthesis is the base exchange pathway which also occurs on the endoplasmic reticulum (van Golde et al., 1974van Golde L.M.G. Raben J. Batenburg J.J. Fleischer B. Zambrano F. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 360: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Vance and Vance, 1988Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). phosphatidylserine Chinese hamster ovary Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium mitochondria-associated membrane phosphatidylethanolamine Compared to other cellular membranes, mitochondrial membranes are enriched in PtdEtn. For example, in rat liver the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes contain 39 and 35%, respectively, of their total phospholipids as PtdEtn, whereas in the endoplasmic reticulum only 20% of membrane phospholipids consist of PtdEtn (Colbeau et al., 1971Colbeau A. Nachbaur J. Vignais P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 249: 462-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar. Correspondingly, in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes the molar ratio of PtdEtn:phosphatidylcholine is 0.96 and 0.71, respectively, whereas in the endoplasmic reticulum the ratio is only 0.33. An aim of our study was to determine the biosynthetic origin of PtdEtn in mitochondrial membranes. One possibility was that all mitochondrial PtdEtn was synthesized in situ from the decarboxylation of PtdSer, which would imply that transfer of PtdEtn synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum from CDP-ethanolamine to the mitochondria was restricted. A second possibility was that mitochondrial PtdEtn was derived from both CDP-ethanolamine and from PtdSer decarboxylation and that PtdEtn synthesized from these two sources equilibrated rapidly between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. A third possibility was that PtdEtn in mitochondrial membranes was synthesized exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum from CDP-ethanolamine and that PtdEtn synthesized in mitochondria from PtdSer decarboxylation was rapidly exported to other cellular membranes. Although the most likely source of mitochondrial PtdEtn would intuitively appear to be the decarboxylation of PtdSer, our investigation of the origin of mitochondrial PtdEtn was prompted by two reports that PtdEtn made from PtdSer on the inner mitochondrial membrane rapidly flowed to the outer membrane without mixing with PtdEtn in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Simbeni et al., 1990Simbeni R. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hovius et al., 1992Hovius R. Faber B. Brigot B. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16790-16795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. We report that in CHO-k1 cells pulse-labeled with either [1–3H]ethanolamine or [3-3H]serine, mitochondrial PtdEtn, especially that in inner membranes, was mainly derived in situ from decarboxylation of PtdSer, even when ethanolamine was supplied in the culture medium. Very little ethanolamine-derived PtdEtn was detected in either inner or outer mitochondrial membranes. Since mitochondrial PtdEtn is derived primarily from PtdSer decarboxylation, and PtdSer is not synthesized in mitochondria (van Golde et al., 1974van Golde L.M.G. Raben J. Batenburg J.J. Fleischer B. Zambrano F. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 360: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Vance and Vance, 1988Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we also investigated the mechanism by which PtdSer is translocated from its site(s) of synthesis to mitochondria. This interorganelle movement of PtdSer is believed to occur by a mechanism that does not involve cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins (Voelker, 1989Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9921-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; Vance, 1991aVance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments have suggested that the most likely mechanism of transfer involves a direct contact between mitochondria (the site of PtdSer decarboxylation) and the membranes that synthesize PtdSer (Voelker, 1993Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concept that such regions of contact exist between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is supported by our recent isolation of a mitochondria-associated membrane, the MAM (originally called fraction X) (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAM was discovered during its co-isolation with rat liver mitochondria. Although the MAM has many properties characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum, distinct differences are apparent between the two types of membranes. For example, the specific activity of the endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme, NADPH:cytochrome c reductase in the MAM isolated from rat liver is only 30% of that in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, the specific activities of several lipid biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. PtdSer synthase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) in the MAM are 2–4-fold higher than in the endoplasmic reticulum (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Rusiñol et al., 1994Rusiñol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In addition, several other phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, including choline- and ethanolaminephosphotransferases and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, have been detected in the MAM with similar specific activities to those in the endoplasmic reticulum. In an attempt to elucidate the role of the MAM in the import of newly synthesized PtdSer into mitochondria we inhibited either the decarboxylation of PtdSer (with hydroxylamine) or the import of PtdSer into mitochondria (by energy depletion) and observed an accretion of PtdSer in the MAM. Materials—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-k1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The radiochemicals [l-3H]ethanolamine and [3-3H]serine were purchased from Amersham, Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Silica gel G thin-layer chromatography plates, 0.25 mm thickness, were from BDH Chemicals. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and minimum essential medium were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. L-Serine, ethanolamine, and hydroxylamine were purchased from Sigma. Primaria culture dishes (100 mm) were from Becton-Dickinson, Oxnard, CA. Phospholipid standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL. Percoli was from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden. The reagent for ATP bioluminescence constant light signal was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. Cell Culture—CHO-k1 cells were routinely maintained in 100-mm culture dishes either in DMEM or in Ham’s F-12/DMEM (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 40 units/ml of penicillin, and 40 µg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Half-confluence was attained after 1 day of culture and confluence after 3 days, as judged by visualization under the light microscope. Viability of the cells was estimated by the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue and by the lack of release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium (Vance, 1991bVance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1971-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase Experiments—For labeling experiments with [l-3H]ethanolamine, CHO-k1 cells were washed twice with DMEM. The medium was removed and cells were incubated with 3 ml/dish of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μCi/ml of [1-3H]ethanolamine for 1 h (pulse). For confluent cells, radioactive medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of DMEM containing 400 μμ serine, with or without 1 mM ethanolamine. For actively growing cells, after the pulse, the medium was replaced with Ham’s F-12/DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μμ serine, with or without 1 mM ethanolamine. For labeling experiments with [3-3H]serine, CHO-k1 cells were washed twice with serine-free minimum essential medium. The cells were then incubated in 3 ml/dish of serum-free, serine-free minimum essential medium containing 5 μCi/ml of [3-3H]serine for 1 h. The medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of DMEM containing 1 mM serine, with or without 1 mM ethanolamine for confluent cells, or with Ham’s F-12/DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM serine, with or without 1 mM ethanolamine, for experiments with half-confluent cells. In some experiments, as indicated, 1 mM hydroxylamine was added to the chase medium. In experiments in which energy was depleted, 20 mM potassium fluoride and 3 mM potassium cyanide were added to the chase medium (Shiao and Vance, 1993Shiao Y.-J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26085-26092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which reduced the cellular ATP level by approximately 90% after 2 h. After defined chase periods, media were collected, cells were harvested by scraping them into phosphate-buffered saline, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described below. Lipids were extracted from each fraction by addition of 3 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Individual phospholipids were isolated by thin-layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:2) after addition of unlabeled carrier phospholipids. The phosphorus content of PtdSer and PtdEtn was determined from a parallel group of unlabeled cells (Rouser and Fleischer, 1967Rouser G. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 385-406Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and specific radioactivity was calculated. Double Labeling Experiment—For double labeling experiments with [2-14C]ethanolamine and [1-3H]ethanolamine, confluent CHO-k1 cells were incubated in 3 ml/dish of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μCi/ml of [2-l4C]ethanolamine for 5 h. The medium was removed, and cells were harvested by trypsinization and divided into duplicate cultures. The cells were incubated in Ham’s DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μμ serine for an additional 18 h. The medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml/dish of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μCi/ml of [l-3H]ethanolamine for 1 h. Radioactive medium was removed and replaced with medium containing unlabeled ethanolamine (1 mM). The cells were harvested by scraping them into phosphate-buffered saline, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described below. Radiolabeled metabolites in each fraction were extracted and separated for measurement of radioactivity. For double labeling experiments with L-[U-14C]serine and [3-3H]serine, the procedure was as for the above double labeling experiment with ethanolamine except that the initial labeling was with 15 μCi/dish of L-[U-14C]serine for 5 h, and the second labeling was for 1 h with 15 μCi/dish of [3-3H]serine. For the simultaneous measurement of 3H and 14C the channel windows of the scintillation counter were set at 0–350 for 3H and 450–670 for 14C. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Culture dishes were placed on ice and cells were scraped from dishes into 5 ml/dish of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cellular material from four dishes was combined. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 μμ leupeptin, 100 μμ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was transferred to a minibomb cell disruption chamber (Kontes) and subjected to a pressure of 500 p.s.i. for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by rapidly subjecting the cells to atmospheric pressure. The pressure treatment in the minibomb was repeated resulting in disruption of essentially all cells as determined by visualization in the light microscope. Microsomes, mitochondria, and the MAM were isolated from the homogenate by a procedure similar to that described previously for rat liver (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,300 × gmax for 10 min to pellet crude mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gmax for 1 h in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor to pellet microsomes, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. Mitochondria were further purified as follows. The crude mitochondrial pellet was suspended by hand homogenization in 300 μl of isolation medium (250 mM mannitol, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and the suspension was layered on top of 8 ml of Percoll medium (225 mM mannitol, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 30% (v/v) Percoll) in a 10 ml of polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube. The tube was centrifuged for 30 min at 95,000 × gmax. A dense band, consisting of purified mitochondria, was recovered from approximately ¾ down the tube. Mitochondria were removed with a Pasteur pipette, diluted with isolation medium, and washed twice by centrifugation at 6,300 × gmax for 10 min to remove the Percoll. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. The MAM was isolated from the Percoll gradient as a diffuse white band located above mitochondria. The band was removed, diluted with isolation medium, and centrifuged at 6,300 × gmax for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gmax for 1 h in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor. The pellet (MAM) was resuspended in homogenization buffer. In some experiments, mitochondria were further fractionated into inner and outer membranes by a method similar to that described by Hovius et al., 1992Hovius R. Faber B. Brigot B.

The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in buffer H which consisted of 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose and 2 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/20 mg mitochondrial protein/ml. An equal volume of digitonin (6 mg/ml) in buffer H was added, and the sample was incubated at 0 °C for 15 min. The digitonin reaction was terminated by dilution of the mixture with an equal volume of a solution of 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin in buffer H. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and mitochondrial outer and inner membranes were obtained from the supernatant and pellet, respectively. Membrane fractions were assayed for the following marker enzymes by published procedures: NADPH:cytochrome c reductase (Mahler, 1955Mahler H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 553-559Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), cytochrome c oxidase (Mahler, 1955Mahler H.R.

PtdSer synthase activity was measured as described previously except that Triton X-100 was omitted from the buffer (Vance and Vance, 1988Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Cellular ATP levels were measured by a bioluminescence method (Martin and Pagano, 1987Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

Isolation and Purity of Subcellular Fractions from CHO-k1 Cells—The relative contributions of the PtdSer decarboxylation and CDP-ethanolamine pathways to mitochondrial PtdEtn were evaluated by subcellular fractionation of CHO-k1 cells pulse-labeled with either [3H]serine or [3H]ethanolamine. Three subcellular fractions were isolated: mitochondria, microsomes, and a mitochondria-associated membrane, MAM (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the membrane fractions was assessed by measurement of activities of marker enzymes for endoplasmic reticulum (NADPH:cytochrome c reductase) and mitochondria (cytochrome c oxidase and succinate:cytochrome c reductase) (Table I). Cross-contamination of the microsomal preparation by mitochondria, and of mitochondria by endoplasmic reticulum, were each 4% or less. The specific activity of the endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme, NADPH:cytochrome c reductase, in the MAM was only 10% of that in microsomes.Table ISpecific activity of marker enzymes in CHO-k1 cell membranesSpecific activityFractionNADPH: cytochrome c reductaseaMarker for ER.Cytochrome c oxidasebMarker for IMT.Succinate: cytochrome c reductasebMarker for IMT.PtdSer synthasecMarker for ER/MAM.Homogenate0.26 ± 0.2411.32 ± 8.7918.01 ± 15.311.90 ± 0.39Mitochondria0101.7 ± 14.2117.6 ± 31.31.11 ± 1.13MAM0.49 ± 0.2836.36 ± 0.9560.25 ± 19.5014.48 ± 3.04Microsomes5.01 ± 1.613.90 ± 3.103.33 ± 1.215.69 ± 1.51a Marker for ER.b Marker for IMT.c Marker for ER/MAM. Open table in a new tab The specific activities of the mitochondrial marker enzymes cytochrome c oxidase and succinate:cytochrome c reductase in the MAM were 35 and 51%, respectively, of those in mitochondria. The presence of this relatively high degree of contamination of the MAM by mitochondrial membranes was not unexpected, because we (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (Ardail et al., 1993Ardail D. Gasnier F. Lermé F. Simonot C. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar have suggested that a physical linkage may exist between the MAM and mitochondria, and fragments of mitochondria may have been co-isolated with the MAM. The presence of some mitochondrial membranes in the MAM fraction does not, however, significantly affect the studies on the subcellular distribution of labeled newly synthesized phospholipids for two reasons. First, mitochondrial contamination of the microsomes and vice versa is very low. Second, the phospholipid:protein ratio of the mitochondrial preparation (3.2 nmol of phospholipid/mg of protein) is low compared with that of the MAM or microsomal fractions (14.1 nmol of phospholipid/mg of protein). Therefore, although the MAM contains some mitochondrial protein, we estimate that less than 10% of the MAM phospholipids are the result of contamination by mitochondrial membranes. The activity of PtdSer synthase, an enzyme which we have previously shown is enriched in the MAM compared with the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum from rat liver (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also measured (Table I). In agreement with our studies with rat liver (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the specific activity of PtdSer synthase in the MAM from CHO-k1 cells was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that in microsomes. The specific activity of PtdSer synthase in mitochondria from CHO-k1 cells was only 7.6% of that in the MAM, indicating that mitochondria were minimally contaminated by MAM. Distribution of [3H]Serine-labeled PtdSer and PtdEtn among Subcellular Fractions—The incorporation of [3H]serine into PtdSer and PtdEtn of subcellular fractions of confluent CHO-k1 cells was examined in pulse-chase experiments. As shown in Fig. 1A the specific radioactivity of [3H]serine-labeled PtdSer was initially highest in the microsomal and MAM fractions and declined slowly thereafter. At all times, the lowest specific radioactivity of PtdSer was in mitochondria, the site of PtdSer decarboxylation. Since the loss of radioactive PtdSer was largely reflected in the increased radioactivity in PtdEtn (Fig. 1C), the decline in specific radioactivity of PtdSer in microsomes and the MAM throughout the chase period is most likely the result of [3H]PtdSer being exported to mitochondria for decarboxylation. At the start of the chase period, the specific radioactivity of PtdEtn was highest in mitochondria (Fig. 1B), but [3H]serine-derived PtdEtn gradually equilibrated throughout all three fractions as the chase period progressed. These data show that some PtdEtn generated in mitochondria from PtdSer decarboxylation was retained in mitochondria whereas some was exported to other subcellular organelles. Similar results were obtained in parallel pulse-chase studies with nonconfluent cells (data not shown), indicating that the distribution of PtdSer-derived PtdEtn among subcellular fractions was not dependent upon whether or not the cells were actively dividing. Distribution of [3H]Ethanolamine-labeled PtdEtn among Subcellular Fractions—The MAM and microsomes both have the capacity to synthesize PtdEtn from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, since both membranes contain CDP-ethanolamine:diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity (Vance, 1990Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of ethanolamine-derived PtdEtn to mitochondrial membranes was assessed in an experiment in which confluent CHO-k1 cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [3H]ethanolamine, and the distribution of labeled PtdEtn in subcellular fractions was determined. Fig. 2A demonstrates that labeled PtdEtn was distributed mainly in the microsomal and MAM fractions, but was not significantly imported into mitochondria, even after 23 h. Moreover, in another experiment in which the cells were incubated with [3H]ethanolamine for 24 h, the specific activity of PtdEtn in mitochondria was only approximately 1/10 of that in the MAM and microsomes (data not shown). A similar result was obtained for growing cells (Fig. 2B). In both dividing and quiescent cells, ethanolamine (1 mM) was added to the chase medium because: (i) a lack of ethanolamine in the medium might have restricted the synthesis of PtdEtn by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, and (ii) we wished that no further incorporation of radioactivity into PtdEtn would occur after the end of the pulse. The decline in specific radioactivity of PtdEtn in the MAM and microsomes over the 23-h period reflects the dilution of labeled PtdEtn by the continual catabolism and synthesis of PtdEtn using the abundant supply of unlabeled ethanolamine in the medium. PtdEtn in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Is Largely Derived from Decarboxylation of PtdSer, Not from CDP-ethanolamine—Previous studies in yeast (Simbeni et al., 1990Simbeni R. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and rat liver (Hovius et al., 1992Hovius R. Faber B. Brigot B. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16790-16795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar have suggested that PtdEtn synthesized from PtdSer in inner mitochondrial membranes is rapidly exported to outer mitochondrial membranes without equilibrating with the PtdEtn pool in inner membranes. We measured the distribution of PtdEtn, derived from its two biosynthetic routes, between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. CHO-k1 cells were pulse-labeled with either [3H]serine or [3H]ethanolamine. Two submitochondrial fractions, one enriched in inner, the other in outer, membranes were isolated from purified mitochondria after solubilization of the outer membranes with digitonin. The purity of the membrane fractions was assessed by measurement of activities of marker enzymes for outer mitochondrial membranes (NADH: cytochrome c reductase) and inner mitochondrial membranes (succinate:cytochrome c reductase) (Table II). Contamination of the outer membrane preparation by inner membranes was less than 14% and of the inner membrane preparation by outer membranes was only 2%.Table IISpecific activity of marker enzymes in submitochondrial membranes of CHO-k1 cellsSpecific activityFractionNADH: cytochrome c reductaseaMarker for OMT.Succinate: cytochrome c reductasebMarker for IMT.Mitochondria137 ± 10117 ± 31OMT137 ± 155 ± 2IMT19 ± 2248 ± 14a Marker for OMT.b Marker for IMT.

The toxin has a trypsin-sensitive region near the COOH-terminal end of the A-chain, and upon cleavage, two disulfide bonded fragments, A1 and A2, are generated. These fragments are also formed upon incubation with cells. The disulfide loop contains the sequence (Arg- X-X-Arg), which is a consensus motif for cleavage by the membrane-anchored protease furin. We found that a soluble form of furin cleaves intact A-chain producing A1 and A2 fragments, and furin also seems to be responsible for rapid cellular cleavage of Shiga toxin. LoVo cells, which normally do not produce functional furin, cleave intact A-chain very efficiently when transfected with furin (LoVo/fur), whereas a control cell (LoVo/neo) cleaves the toxin very slowly. To investigate the role of this cleavage for intoxication of cells, we studied the ability of unnicked and furin-nicked toxin to inhibit protein synthesis in LoVo/fur and LoVo/neo cells. LoVo/fur cells were intoxicated equally well with unnicked and nicked toxin, whereas in LoVo/neo cells nicked toxin was about 20 times more active than unnicked toxin. The results suggest that cleavage of Shiga toxin is important for intoxication of cells, and they indicate that furin can cleave and thereby activate Shiga toxin in cells.

Shiga toxin contains this motif in the disulfide loop between the A1 and A2 fragments. Furthermore, after endocytosis, the toxin can be transported to the TGN in a number of different cell types (4Sandvig K. Prydz K. Ryd M. van Deurs B. J.

In the present article, we demonstrate that furin cleaves ST-A into A1 and A2 fragments both in vitro and in vivo. We used LoVo cells, a cell line that does not express functional furin (22Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Butyric acid, Hepes, diaminobenzidine, and 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester were purchased from Sigma. Na125I was purchased from Du Pont (Belgium), and [3H]leucine was purchased from Amersham International (Amersham, United Kingdom).

LoVo cells transfected with mouse furin (LoVo/LF36) and with control vector (LoVo/neo) were a gift from Dr. E Mekada (Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan). LoVo/LF36 cells are called LoVo/fur cells in this paper. Establishment of these cell lines are described elsewhere (25Komada M. Hatsuzawa K. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Nakayama K. Kitamura N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well 2 or 3 days prior to the experiments. The cells were incubated with increasing amounts of toxin for the indicated time. Then, the cells were incubated 10 min in Hepes medium with 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine and no unlabeled leucine. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed two times in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Then, the cells were dissolved in 0.1 M KOH, and the radioactivity was measured. Cells were seeded out with a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates 3 days prior to the experiments. On the second day, 1 mM butyric acid was added to some of the wells, and the cells were incubated further for 48 h before the experiments. The cells were washed in Hepes medium and preincubated with BFA (2 μg/ml) or protease inhibitors for 20 min at 37°C; then, 125I-labeled Shiga toxin was added, and the incubation was continued for the indicated period of time. Control cells (no inhibitors) were incubated in parallel. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) on ice for 20 min. The cell lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and proteins were precipitated for 30 min on ice in the presence of 5% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed in ether, dissolved in sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After autoradiography, the bands corresponding to A and A1 fragments of Shiga toxin were quantified by densitometry (model 300 A, Molecular Dynamics). The cleavage was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM buffer (sodium acetate, pH 5.0; MES, pH 5.5-7.5; Hepes, pH 8.0), 10 ng of 125I-Shiga toxin, and 6 ng of purified furin. In a parallel experiment at pH 6.0, 5 mM EDTA was added instead of CaCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30°C, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For use in toxicity experiments, unlabeled Shiga toxin was cleaved by furin at a toxin concentration of 100 μg/ml at pH 6.0. The reaction mixture was the same as above, but without the addition of 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After the incubation, the sample was frozen at −20°C before use. Electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed for 30 min in 4% acetic acid and 27% methanol. For autoradiography, Kodak XAR films were exposed to dried gels at −80°C. Shiga toxin cleaved by furin, as described above, was applied to a protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems 477A). As expected, the reaction mixture contained three peptides due to nicking of the A-chain and the presence of the B-chain. LoVo/fur cells grown as monolayers in T-24 flasks were incubated 2 h with Shiga toxin horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The cells were fixed and processed for electron microscopy, as earlier described (24van Deurs B. Tnnessen T.I. Petersen O.W. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Shiga toxin has a trypsin-sensitive region near the COOH terminus of the A-chain, containing the motif Arg248-Val-Ala-Arg251, the minimal recognition sequence for furin (19Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cleavage, two disulfide-bonded fragments A1 (~27.5 kDa) and A2 (~4.5 kDa) are generated. The pH optimum for proteolytic activity by furin is variable depending on the substrate (27Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we therefore measured the ability of furin to cleave Shiga toxin at different pH values. As shown in Fig. 1, a soluble form of furin cleaves intact Shiga toxin with a pH optimum of 5.5-6.0, generating A1 (~27.5 kDa) and A2 (~4.5 kDa) fragments (the A2 fragment is in the front of the gel). Furin requires calcium for enzymatic activity (13Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi S. Takada K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in accordance with this, EDTA completely inhibited the cleavage at pH 6.0 (data not shown). To locate the cleavage site in the toxin, we performed amino-terminal sequencing of furin-nicked A-chain. The resulting sequence was Met-Ala- X-Asp-Glu-Phe-Pro, identical with residues 252-258. This indicates that furin cleaves Shiga toxin at the COOH-terminal side of Arg251, as expected. To examine whether furin is involved in cleavage of Shiga toxin in vivo, we used a stable, transfected cell line of LoVo cells expressing furin (LoVo/fur) and a control cell transfected with the vector alone (LoVo/neo). Cells were incubated with 125I-labeled Shiga toxin and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography; the A1 and A2 fragments were then quantified by densitometry. In LoVo/fur cells, ST-A was cleaved rapidly into A1 and A2 fragments. After 1 h of incubation, 40% of the cell-associated toxin was cleaved, while after 5 h, 80% was cleaved (Fig. 2, lanes8 and 9). In LoVo/neo cells, ST-A was cleaved much more slowly and not as extensively. After a 1-h incubation cleavage was not observed, while after 5 h of incubation, 30% of the cell-associated toxin molecules were cleaved (Fig. 2, lanes2 and 3). The data suggest that in vivo, furin is the cellular protease mainly responsible for cleavage of Shiga toxin. However, other cellular proteases can also cleave Shiga toxin in cells without furin, although much less efficiently. The observed processing could occur at the cell surface, in a membrane-bounded organelle, or in the cytosol. To study whether cleavage could occur at the cell surface, the cells were depleted for ATP by incubation with NaN3 and 2-deoxyglucose. Endocytosis is then inhibited, but the toxin molecules can still bind to cell-surface receptors (data not shown). In the presence of ATP-depleting reagents, there was essentially no cleavage of cell-surface bound Shiga toxin in LoVo/neo or LoVo/fur cells (data not shown), indicating that Shiga toxin is cleaved after endocytosis. To further localize the site of cleavage, we used the drug BFA, which disrupts the Golgi stacks in a number of different cell lines (28Damke H. Klumperman J. von Figura K. Braulke T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In BFA-treated cells, toxin molecules can still be endocytosed and exposed to proteases in endosomes and TGN, whereas retrograde transport through the Golgi cisterns and translocation to the cytosol cannot occur. BFA protected also LoVo/neo and LoVo/fur cells against Shiga toxin (data not shown), and importantly BFA treatment strongly inhibited the processing of Shiga toxin in LoVo/neo cells (Fig. 2, lanes4 and 5), whereas there was no effect on the processing in LoVo/fur cells (Fig. 2, lanes10 and 11). Thus, processing by furin seems to occur in endosomes and/or TGN, while furin-independent cleavage seems to occur in another location in the cells. We have shown earlier that a cell-permeable inhibitor of the cytosolic enzyme calpain protected Vero cells against a trypsin-resistant mutant (R248H/R251H) of Shiga toxin and inhibited the cell-mediated cleavage of this mutant toxin, while the inhibitor had no effect on the intoxication and processing of wild type toxin.2 We therefore decided to investigate whether calpain inhibitor would interfere with cleavage of wild type Shiga toxin in the LoVo cells. The inhibitor in fact strongly reduced the processing of Shiga toxin in LoVo/neo cells (Fig. 2, lanes6 and 7), whereas in LoVo/fur cells the processing was not inhibited (Fig. 2, lanes12 and 13). The calpain inhibitor has also been reported to inhibit cathepsin B and L (38Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1990; 3: 195-301Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which are also inhibited by leupeptin (39Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Indeed, leupeptin partly inhibited the processing of Shiga toxin in LoVo/neo cells (data not shown), suggesting that cathepsins are responsible for some of the nicking activity seen in the absence of furin. To test whether cleavage of ST-A with furin is important for intoxication of cells, we measured the ability of intact and furin-nicked Shiga toxin to intoxicate Vero cells and LoVo cells. Vero cells are highly sensitive to Shiga toxin and cleave intact toxin very efficiently (10Samuel J.E. Gordon V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4853-4859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 whereas LoVo cells lack functional furin (22Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In Vero cells (Fig. 3 A), there was no detectable difference between unnicked and nicked toxin, while in LoVo cells (Fig. 3 B), nicked toxin was 30-50 times more active than unnicked toxin, suggesting that cleavage is important for intoxication of cells. We also studied the ability of unnicked and furin-nicked Shiga toxin to inhibit protein synthesis in LoVo/neo and LoVo/fur cells. In LoVo/neo cells, nicked toxin was 20-30 times more active than unnicked toxin (Fig. 4 A), in accordance with the results in Fig. 3 B. In LoVo/fur cells, where the toxin is efficiently cleaved by furin, there was no difference between unnicked and furin-nicked toxin (Fig. 4 B). Unfortunately, LoVo/fur cells were less sensitive to Shiga toxin than LoVo/neo cells. Such clonal difference in sensitivity to Shiga toxin has been observed previously in other cell populations. 3Ø. Garred and K. Sandvig, unpublished results. Since butyric acid is known to sensitize A431 cells to Shiga toxin and induce increased transport of Shiga toxin to the TGN and the endoplasmic reticulum (20Sandvig K. Garred Ø. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), from where translocation to the cytosol may take place (20Sandvig K. Garred Ø. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred Ø. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we tested if butyric acid could sensitize LoVo/neo and LoVo/fur cells. As shown in Fig. 5, that was indeed the case, and both cell types became equally sensitive to nicked Shiga toxin. In butyric acid-treated LoVo/neo cells, furin-nicked toxin was still about 20 times more active than unnicked toxin (Fig. 5 A), whereas in the sensitized LoVo/fur cells, there was (as seen in the untreated cells) no difference between unnicked and nicked toxin (Fig. 5 B). Electron microscopical investigations confirmed that butyric acid induced Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus in LoVo/fur cells (data not shown). It should be mentioned that during culture, the LoVo/fur cells occassionally became quite sensitive to Shiga toxin even without treatment, and also then nicked and unnicked toxin were equally toxic to the cells (data not shown). In parallel experiments, we also showed that Shiga toxin was cleaved to about the same extent in butyric acid-treated cells as in untreated cells and that protease inhibitors inhibited cleavage in a similar way as in cells without butyric acid treatment.Figure 4:Effect of unnicked and furin-nicked Shiga toxin on LoVo/neo and LoVo/fur cells.

On the other hand, the protease inhibitor leupeptin, which similarly to the calpain inhibitor reduced nicking somewhat in LoVo/neo cells, had no effect on the toxicity (data not shown). The main finding in this paper is that the enzyme furin is responsible for cellular cleavage of Shiga toxin and that cleavage is essential for efficient intoxication of cells. Furin has been reported to nick proteins with the sequence Arg- X- X-Arg (19Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Shiga toxin A-chain contains this motif (Arg248-Val-Ala-Arg251) in the COOH-terminal region in the loop bridged by a disulfide bond. Here, we provide evidence that purified furin cleaves Shiga toxin A-chain between Arg251 and Met252in vitro, generating A1 (~27.5 kDa) and A2 (~4.5 kDa) fragments, and we show that the pH optimum for this reaction is slightly acidic, pH 5.5-6.0. In LoVo cells that do not express functional furin (22Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), Shiga toxin was cleaved very slowly and to a small extent into A1 and A2 fragments, and furin-nicked toxin was 20-30 times more toxic than unnicked toxin, whereas in furin-transfected LoVo cells (LoVo/fur), Shiga toxin was efficiently cleaved, and there was no difference in toxicity between unnicked and nicked toxin. These results suggest that furin is responsible for cleavage and activation of Shiga toxin in vivo but also implicate that other cellular proteases can cleave Shiga toxin in cells without furin activity, although less efficiently. LoVo/fur cells were less sensitive to nicked Shiga toxin than LoVo/neo cells. In the case of A431 cells, we have previously shown that these cells can be sensitized to Shiga toxin by butyric acid treatment, and following this treatment more Shiga toxin is transported to the Golgi apparatus, and the toxin can be visualized not only in the TGN but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (20Sandvig K. Garred Ø. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred Ø. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), where translocation to the cytosol may take place (20Sandvig K. Garred Ø. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred Ø. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Pelham H.R.B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Trends. Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, butyric acid treatment sensitized both LoVo/neo cells and LoVo/fur cells to Shiga toxin, and the toxicity of nicked toxin was then similar in LoVo/neo and LoVo/fur cells. Furin is expressed in a wide variety of cells (14Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas other members of the family of subtilisin-like proteases, including PC 1, PC 2, and PC 4, are expressed in specialized cells, like neuroendocrine cells, and recognize dibasic sequences (14Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Shiga toxin does not have any such sequence in the region where cleavage occurs. Therefore, furin or a furin-like enzyme may cleave and activate Shiga toxin in many different cell types. Pseudomonas toxin, diphtheria toxin, and anthrax toxin clearly require cleavage for successful translocation to the cytosol and for intoxication of cells, and furin seems to be the enzyme responsible for cleavage (11Klimpel K.R. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 12Tsuneoka M. Nakayama K. Hatsuzawa K. Komada M. Kitamura N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been questioned whether cleavage of Shiga toxin is important for intoxication of cells. Olsnes et al.(9Olsnes S. Reisbig R. Eiklid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8732-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Shiga toxin nicked between A1 and A2 with trypsin had increased enzymatic activity when inhibition of protein synthesis was measured in a cell-free system, whereas there was no difference in cytotoxic effect on HeLa S3 cells. Kongmuang et al.(43Kongmuang U. Honda T. Miwatani T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 56: 105-108Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported similar findings with Shiga-like toxin on Vero cells and suggested that cleavage did not affect the biological properties of the toxin. Similarly, we found no difference between furin-nicked and unnicked Shiga toxin on Vero cells. This lack of difference can be explained by the ability of these cells to cleave Shiga toxin. It was recently shown that Shiga toxin2 and Shiga-like toxin type IIv are easily nicked in Vero cells (10Samuel J.E. Gordon V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4853-4859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have produced mutants of Shiga toxin where the furin-sensitive site has been eliminated. These mutants were less efficient than wild type Shiga toxin in provoking rapid intoxication in Vero cells, and the mutants where cleaved inefficiently compared to wild type Shiga toxin.2 Similar results were obtained by Burgess and Roberts (44Burgess B.J. Roberts L.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of these results indicate that cleavage of Shiga toxin is important for intoxication. Furin is reported to be localized primarily in the TGN (15Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Bosshart H.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but may also be present in small amounts in endosomes and at the cell surface (11Klimpel K.R. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 12Tsuneoka M. Nakayama K. Hatsuzawa K. Komada M. Kitamura N. Mekada E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP-depleting agents, which inhibited the internalization of Shiga toxin, there was essentially no cleavage at the cell surface of LoVo/fur cells, whereas in the presence of BFA, which disrupts the Golgi cisterns, processing occurred at a normal rate, indicating that nicking of Shiga toxin may take place in TGN and/or in endosomes. Diphtheria toxin has recently been reported to be nicked at the cell surface by furin in transfected LoVo cells. This difference from our results can be explained by the different pH optima for furin cleavage of diphtheria toxin and Shiga toxin in vitro. Diphtheria toxin is in contrast to Shiga toxin cleaved efficiently at neutral pH (12Tsuneoka M. Nakayama K. Hatsuzawa K. Komada M. Kitamura N. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26461-26465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In LoVo/neo cells, cleavage of Shiga toxin was much less extensive than in LoVo/fur cells. Also in these cells, we could not detect any cleavage at the cell surface, and BFA in this case partly inhibited the cleavage. To further characterize the inefficient cleavage taking place in LoVo/neo cells, we tested the effect of a cell-permeable inhibitor of the cytosolic enzyme calpain and the effect of leupeptin, a protease inhibitor taken up by endocytosis and reported to inhibit the lysosomal proteases cathepsin B and L (39Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Leupeptin inhibited the cleavage extensively but did not protect against Shiga toxin, suggesting that some cleavage occurs in a compartment from where the toxin cannot translocate to the cytosol, most likely in the lysosomes. In contrast, the calpain inhibitor inhibited both cleavage and toxicity, indicating that a fraction of the toxin molecules can be cleaved and activated by another cellular protease than furin, possibly by the cytosolic enzyme calpain. However, from the experiments shown, it seems clear that furin, in contrast to other enzymes in LoVo cells, efficiently cleaves and activates Shiga toxin.

Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the purified urinary enzyme and used to investigate the biosynthesis of acid ceramidase. Immunoprecipitation studies on metabolically labeled skin fibroblasts indicated that both subunits arose from a single precursor of ~55 kDa. A minor portion of newly synthesized acid ceramidase was secreted into the medium as a monomeric 47-kDa protein, indicating that generation of the mature heterodimeric enzyme occurred in endosomal and/or lysosomal compartments. Acid ceramidase (N-acylsphingosine deacylase, EC 3.5.1.23) 1For the ceramide, N-acylsphingosine, the term sphingosine and sphinganine have been used for the C18 long chain bases with and without the 4-trans double bond, respectively. In the case of sphinganine derivatives, the acyl chain length is designated by the number of carbon atoms (e.g. C14 or C16).1For the ceramide, N-acylsphingosine, the term sphingosine and sphinganine have been used for the C18 long chain bases with and without the 4-trans double bond, respectively.

In the Golgi apparatus ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) serves as the biosynthetic precursor of most sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, glucosyl- and galactosylceramides, sulfatides, and complex glycosphingolipids such as gangliosides and globosides. In turn, the catabolism of these lipids in lysosomes results in the production of ceramide, which can be transported to the cell membrane.

Partial purification and characterization of acid ceramidase from rat brain were first described by Gatt and Yavin (1Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The most purified preparations were enriched ~200-fold and exhibited an optimum pH of ~5.0; the molecular mass was estimated by gel filtration to be ~150 kDa. Subsequently, AC was partially purified from human placenta ~300-fold by Chen and Moser (3Chen W.W. Moser H.W. Fed. Proc. 1979; 38: 405Google Scholar). The purified enzyme had an optimum pH similar to that obtained from rat brain, but the molecular mass was estimated to be ~47 kDa. In addition to AC, neutral ceramidases also have been described in intestine (7Nielson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), cerebellum (8Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and cultured fibroblasts (9Morell P. Braun P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Currently, the relationship of the acid and neutral forms of ceramidase remains unknown. Intense interest has recently focused on the role of ceramide and related sphingolipids in signal transduction and apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 10Kolesnick R. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Kan C.C. Kolesnick R. TIGG. 1993; 5: 99-106Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sphingosine, the product of AC activity, as well as its phosphorylated derivative, sphingosine 1-phosphate, has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C activity and to elicit potent effects on cell growth and differentiation (12Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilson E. Olcott M.C. Bell R.M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Because free sphingosine can only be produced by ceramide hydrolysis and not by de novo biosynthesis (15Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AC plays a critical role in the production of these important compounds. Ceramide also has been implicated in diverse processes such as neurite outgrowth, Ca2+ transport, monocyte differentiation, mitogenesis, and apoptosis (see Refs. 10Kolesnick R. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Kan C.C. Kolesnick R. TIGG. 1993; 5: 99-106Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This paper reports the purification of AC to apparent homogeneity from human urine, the physical, kinetic, and immunological characterization of AC, and investigation of its biosynthesis in cultured fibroblasts. These studies provide new insights into the biology of this important hydrolase and should be of interest to researchers investigating the role of AC in cell growth and differentiation, as well as those delineating the underlying defects causing Farber’s disease. Chemicals—Molecular weight standards and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Concanavalin A-Sepharose and octyl-Sepharose CL-4B were from Sigma, blue-Sepharose was from Pharmacia, and DEAE-cellulose (DE52) was from Vetter (Wiesloch, Federal Republic of Germany). HPLC-grade methanol was obtained from Riedel-de-Haen (Seelze, FRG); o-phthalaldehyde was from Merck, (Darmstadt, FRG). L-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and methionine-deficient minimal essential medium were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Meckenheim, FRG). 14C-Methylated molecular weight standards were from DuPont NEN. Amplify was from Amersham Corp.; protease inhibitors, Endo-H, and fetal calf serum were from Boehringer Mannheim. Peptido-N-glycanase F was from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, FRG). Sphingosine derivatives (i.e. D-erythro-sphingosine and N-acylsphingosines) were synthesized according to previously published methods (17Zimmermann P. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1988; : 663-667Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their homogeneity was judged by TLC, NMR spectroscopy, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. AC and Protein Assays—To determine AC activity, the standard reaction mixture contained N-lauroylsphingosine (150 μm) in sodium acetate buffer (250 mm, pH 4.2), Triton X-100 (0.5%, w/v), Tween 20 (0.2%, w/v), Nonidet P-40 (0.2%, w/v), sodium cholate (0.8%, w/v), and various dilutions of the enzyme preparation in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of an aqueous solution of saturated ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 800 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and C14- and C16-sphinganine (500 pmol of each). The chloroform phase, containing the liberated sphingosine, N-lauroylsphingosine, sphinganine, and lauric acid, was evaporated under nitrogen. The dried lipids were resuspended in 50 μl of methanol, and the sphingosine content was quantified by the o-phthalaldehyde reaction as described below. The amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixtures was chosen so that not more than 10% of the substrate would be degraded. Appropriate blanks containing denatured enzyme (30 min at 95 °C were run with each reaction and subtracted from the experimental samples. Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of Free Sphingosine—Free sphingosine was detected by modifying a method standardly used for amino acid analysis (22Roth M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 880-882Google Scholar, 23Jarrett H.W. Cooksy K.D. Ellis B. Anderson J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamisson W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The dried lipids were dissolved in 50 μl of methanol and mixed with 50 μl of the o-phthalaldehyde reaction buffer, which was prepared freshly by mixing 9.9 ml of an aqueous solution of 3% (w/v) boric acid (pH adjusted to 10.5 with KOH) and 0.1 ml of ethanol containing 5 mg of o-phthalaldehyde and 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for at least 5 min at room temperature, 0.9 ml of methanol, 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (90:10, v/v) was added, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Aliquots were injected immediately onto a ProSep C18 (5 μm) HPLC column (Latek) by using an automatic sample injector (Autosampler AS-100, Bio-Rad). Lipids were eluted with methanol and 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (90:10, v/v), and fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence detector (model RF-550, Shimadzu) connected with the CR-6A integrator (Shimadzu). For quantification of sphingosine released by ceramide hydrolysis, C16-sphinganine was used as an internal standard. AC Purification—The initial purification steps were performed essentially the same as those described by Yamanaka and Suzuki (25Yamanaka T. Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Quintern et al. (26Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for purification of acid sphingomyelinase. All steps were carried out at 4 °C with buffers containing NaN3 (0.02%, w/v) to prevent bacterial growth. Unless stated otherwise, the flow rate for the column chromatography steps was maintained at 30 ml/h. Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation—About 100 liters of human urine were concentrated ~10-fold using a Millipore ultrafiltration system (26Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The concentrate was dialyzed against potassium buffer (20 mm, pH 7.2) containing sodium chloride (170 mm) and Triton X-100 (0.2%, w/v) (buffer A). Four changes (10 liters each) of the dialysis solution were made over a 24-h period, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 h. Ammonium sulfate was then added (final concentration, 60%), and the suspension was slowly mixed overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation for 1 h at 10,000 × g, the precipitated proteins were solubilized in 200 ml of buffer A. Octyl-Sepharose—The solubilized protein of the ammonium sulfate precipitate was loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with buffer β (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 170 mm sodium chloride). Bound material was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of Triton X-100 (from 0 to 2%) in buffer B. Concanavalin A-Sepharose—Fractions from the octyl-Sepharose column containing the highest AC activity (i.e. >30% of maximal peak activity) were loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (30 × 1.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 500 mm sodium chloride and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100). Bound glycoproteins were eluted using a linear gradient of α-methylglucopyranoside (from 0 to 15%) in buffer C. Those fractions with the highest specific AC activity were pooled and dialyzed against 3 changes (5 liters each for a total of 12 h) of buffer D (20 mm potassium buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100). Blue-Sepharose—The dialyzed concanavalin A-Sepharose eluate was loaded onto a blue-Sepharose column (1.6 × 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer D. Bound proteins (including AC) were eluted with buffer D containing 100 mm sodium chloride at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. DEAE-cellulose—Fractions from the blue-Sepharose column containing the highest AC activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (3 changes, 2 liters each) and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 2 cm). Using these conditions, AC did not bind on the column and was found in the flow-through. Antibody Preparation—AC obtained from the DEAE-cellulose flow-through appeared homogeneous after SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1) and was used to prepare antibodies. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised by standard procedures (27Freund J. McDermott K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1942; 49: 548-553Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Freund J. Adv. Tuberc.

Briefly, the initial injection of 100 μg of antigen was administered in Freund’s complete adjuvant, followed by three injections of 50 μg of antigen in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant given in 4-week intervals. Animals were bled at day 10 after the last injection. Immunotitration of AC—Appropriate dilutions of either crude octyl-Sepharose eluate or the purified enzyme were mixed with variable amounts of antiserum in a total of 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. Preimmune serum was used as a control. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h, and 20 μl of a protein A-Sepharose suspension (50% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to precipitate the immune complexes. Following centrifugation, the activity of AC and other hydrolases (e.g. acid sphingomyelinase, glucocerebrosidase) was measured in the supernatant. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Denaturating SDS-PAGE was performed on 4–20% or 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) or Schägger and Jagow (32Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 106: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Western analysis was performed according to the method of Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Bound antigen was detected using goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate were used as substrates. Oligosaccharide Side Chain Analysis—To investigate the carbohydrate linkages on AC, the purified enzyme was digested with Endo-H (2 milliunits) or peptido-N-glycanase F (30 milliunits) for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0 and 6.0 for Endo-H and peptido-N-glycanase F, respectively) containing 0,5% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed as described below. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Confluent human skin fibroblasts were grown for 2 h in methionine-free minimal essential medium containing 4% dialyzed and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (35Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling was achieved by the addition of 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) to the culture medium. After a medium change, unlabeled methionine was added to a final concentration of 3 mm to “chase” the reactions. The labeled cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing Nonidet P-40 (1%, w/v), EDTA (10 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), and pepstatin and leupeptin (1 mm each). Cell extracts and media were preabsorbed with 20 μl of rabbit preimmune serum and 40 μl of a 50% suspension (w/v) of protein A-Sepharose for 4 h. Immune complexes were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatants were carefully removed, 2 μl of crude anti-AC antiserum was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out in the presence of 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% suspension) for 2 h and treated as described by Schnabel et al. (35Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophoresis the precipitate was incubated for 3 min at 100 °C in Laemmli sample buffer with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Radioactive proteins were detected by fluorography. Enzyme Purification—Table I summarizes the results of a typical purification of AC from 100 liters of human urine. The initial ammonium sulfate precipitation step provided a ~6-fold purification with a yield of about 95%. The enzyme was then passed through an octyl-Sepharose column, achieving an additional ~25-fold purification. Further enrichment using concanavalin A-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose columns resulted in a final preparation that was ~4500-fold enriched over the urine concentrate. The overall yield using this purification scheme was ~15%.Table IPurification of acid ceramidase from human urinePurification stepVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurification factormimgnmol/hnmol/(h × mg)%-foldUrine concentrate150032,08525700.0810010–60% (NH4)2SO4 precipitate270482524530.5956.3Octyl-Sepharose7015417991270150Concanavalin A-SepharoseaAbout 60 ml of the octyl-Sepharose eluate was applied to the concanavalin A-Sepharose column.302816905966739Blue-Sepharose28101728173672163DEAE-cellulose281392356154454a About 60 ml of the octyl-Sepharose eluate was applied to the concanavalin A-Sepharose column.

Upon treatment with the sulfhydryl reducing reagent β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1, lane 4), the 50-kDa protein was reduced into two polypeptides of ~13 kDa (α-subunit) and ~40 kDa (β-subunit), respectively. To characterize the oligosaccharide chains on the AC, the enzyme was treated with peptido-N-glycanase F or Endo-H. Under non-reducing conditions, bands of ~40 and 46 kDa, respectively, appeared after glycosidase treatment, both being derived from the native 50-kDa form (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). Under reducing conditions, no change in the molecular mass of the α-subunit was observed, whereas the mass of the β-subunit was reduced in size to ~27 kDa when treated with peptido-N-glycanase F and to ~30–35 kDa when treated with Endo-H (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Minor protein bands corresponding to unreduced AC occasionally resulted after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol. AC kinetics were assessed using N-lauroylsphingosine as substrate and the blue-Sepharose eluate as the enzyme source. AC displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent Km of ~149 μμ and a Vmax of ~136 nmol/mg/h (Fig. 2). The reaction was linear for up to 30 min. The purified AC was found to have optimum activity at pH 3.8–4.3 with half-maximal activities at pH 3.5 and 4.6; no AC activity was detectable above pH 6 (data not shown). The degradation rate using analogs of ceramide containing fatty acids of different chain length (Table II) was investigated in the same complex detergent mixture that was used throughout all experiments. Optimal AC activity was observed using ceramide containing a C12 fatty acid chain. Ceramides were better substrates than dihydroceramides.Table IIReaction rates of acid ceramidase using different ceramidesSubstrateFatty acid/sphingoid backboneSpecific AC activitynmol/(h × mg)N-AcetylsphingosineC2/C18:121N-HexanoylsphingosineC6/C18:119N-OctanoylsphingosineC8/C18:130N-LauroylsphingosineC12/C18:1107N-StearoylsphingosineC18:0/C18:117N-OleoylsphingosineC18:1/C18:128N-OctanoylsphinganineC8/C18:03N-PalmitoylsphinganineC16/C18:04 Open table in a new tab Production and Characterization of Anti-AC Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified urinary AC by standard procedures and assessed by immunotitration. As shown in Fig. 3, the anti-AC antibodies were able to precipitate >95% of AC activity from the octyl-Sepharose eluate. The activities of other hydrolases (e.g. acid sphingomyelinase, glucocerebrosidase, β-hexosaminidase, and acid phosphatase) were not precipitated (not shown). Western analysis of the octyl-Sepharose eluate also was performed (Fig. 4). Only one protein with apparent molecular mass of ~50 kDa was detected when samples were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4, lane 2). When samples were reduced with β-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE, two bands corresponding to molecular masses of ~40 and ~13 kDa, were observed (Fig. 4, lane 2). Thus, these results demonstrated the specificity of the anti-AC antibodies.FIG. 4Western analysis of AC. Fractions obtained from the octyl-Sepharose column (~10 μg) were applied to SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) under reducing (lane 1) and non-reducing (lane 2) conditions. Separated samples were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. AC was detected with polyclonal antibodies using anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium as substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Biosynthetic Studies of AC—The biosynthesis and processing of AC were investigated by metabolic labeling of cultured human fibroblasts with [35S]methionine. Confluent fibroblast cultures were pulsed for 1 h and then chased for various times. AC was subsequently immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, AC was synthesized as a 55-kDa precursor polypeptide, which was processed to the mature heterodimeric ~50-kDa enzyme within 8 h. No immunologically cross-reacting material was found in the culture medium of labeled cells until 12 h, when a minor polypeptide of ~47 kDa was immunoprecipitated. AC was purified from human urine ~4450-fold in the presence of Triton X-100. The final preparation, which was judged nearly homogenous by SDS-PAGE, yielded a single protein of ~50 kDa. The 50-kDa polypeptide was composed of two disulfide-linked subunits of ~13(α) and ~40 kDa (β). Treatment of the β-subunit with peptido-N-glycanase F and Endo-H reduced its molecular mass to ~27 and ~30–35 kDa, respectively, suggesting that this polypeptide contained 5 or 6 N-linked oligosaccharide chains and that as many as three of these may be of the complex type. In contrast, the α-subunit was not glycosylated. This subunit structure is confirmed by the immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized ceramidase in extracts of cultured cells and SDS-PAGE using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the purified protein and specifically precipitates ceramidase activity almost quantitatively from cell extracts. Triton X-100 was included throughout the purification because Yamanaka and Suzuki (25Yamanaka T. Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that the use of Triton X-100 during the purification of acid sphingomyelinase increased both the degree of purification (by prevention of aggregation) and the recovery (by rendering sphingomyelinase more stable). Similar observations were reported for urinary sphingomyelinase (36Weitz G. Quintern L.E. Shram A.W. Barranger J.A. Tager J.M. Sandhoff K. Freysz L. Dreyfus H. Massareli R. Gatt S. Enzymes of Lipid Metabolism II. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1986: 261-265Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, extraction of AC from rat brain in the absence of detergents yielded only 30% of total ceramidase, whereas complete solubilization was accomplished in the presence of 0.5% cholate (6Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggested that AC was associated with lysosomal membranes and that the inclusion of detergents in the purification scheme facilitated its isolation. The specific activity of the purified urinary AC is not excessively high; it is 3–4 orders of magnitude less than that of purified urinary human acid sphingomyelinase. However, extracts of cultured human fibroblasts contain about 10 times more acid sphingomyelinase activity (16–20 nmol/(mg × h)) than acid ceramidase activity (0.7–1.2 nmol/(mg × h)), suggesting that acid ceramidase is much more abundant than acid sphingomyelinase. This view is supported by preliminary immunoprecipitation studies. Furthermore, when the sphingolipid activator protein sap-D was added to the media of sphingolipid activator protein precursor-deficient fibroblasts (35Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ceramide catabolism was restored (34Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating that sap-D is a required cofactor for in vivo AC activity. In the present detergent-based in vitro assay system, no substantial stimulation of ceramide hydrolysis was observed after the addition of sap-D (data not shown). Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein specifically precipitated AC activity from cell extracts. Using these antibodies, the first studies on the biosynthesis of this important hydrolase were performed. AC is initially synthesized as a 55-kDa precursor polypeptide, which is proteolytically processed to the mature, heterodimeric 50-kDa form in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Preliminary studies indicate that targeting of AC to lysosomes is dependent on the mannose 6-phosphate pathway (data not shown). In contrast to many other newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases, where the precursor forms are partially secreted into the culture medium, AC is almost completely retained intracellularly. However, a minor polypeptide with a molecular mass of ~47 kDa is released into the medium. It is noteworthy that neither this form nor the 55-kDa precursor form could be immunoprecipitated from the Nonidet P-40 cell extracts and that reextraction of the cells with SDS was required to isolate them (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the AC precursor is tightly associated with membranes, as has been observed for another lysosomal hydrolase, acid β-glucocerebrosidase (37Pentchev P.G. Brady R.O. Hibbert S.R. Gal A.E. Shapiro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5256-5261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, AC has been purified to apparent homogeneity from human urine, facilitating the production of monospecific antibodies and the first biosynthetic studies of this important enzyme. Further studies of the purified enzyme should provide valuable insights into the relationship of this enzyme to a number of important cellular processes, including signal transduction and apoptosis, as well as into the nature of the metabolic abnormality underlying Farber’s disease.

Identification of a signal-dependent transfer step for proteins like the transferrin receptor operating on the exocytic pathway has important implications for membrane biogenesis, especially in the establishment of cell surface polarity. Newly synthesized proteins trafficking to the cell surface pass through the Golgi stack en route to a variety of destinations on the cell surface and inside the cell. Intracellular destinations include locations along regulated secretory pathways and endocytic routes. The earliest decisions in this selective routing are taken in trans-Golgi elements(1Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), many of which contain clathrin coated domains whose ability to concentrate and selectively route subsets of trafficking proteins is well documented(2Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). As yet, however, clathrin-coated domains are the only sorting mechanisms which have been definitively shown to be capable of selectively routing trafficking proteins in the TGN, 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkALPalk aline phosphataseGPIglycophosphatidylinositolTfn-Rtransferrin receptorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serum. and in view of the variety of alternative routes known to originate in this compartment it has become important to define more precisely the basis on which this selection is made. It seems likely, for example, that the first step in the sorting process is primarily concerned with selecting proteins carrying signals recognized by clathrin-coated domains so that further selective decisions are left to be made downstream, in the recycling pathways which receive these proteins(3Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev.

The best documented routes running directly from the trans-Golgi to intracellular destinations are those which carry mannose 6-phosphate receptors and major histocompatibility class II antigen-invariant chain complexes to the endocytic pathway(4Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These proteins are selected in the clathrin-coated domains of the trans-Golgi, and current evidence suggests that their recognition depends upon signals being carried in their cytoplasmic domains(4Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here we determine if other newly synthesized membrane proteins which carry recognition signals for clathrin lattices in their cytoplasmic domains are also delivered to endosomal compartments directly from the Golgi. Monoclonal antibodies B3/25 and H68.4 (to the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, respectively) specific for the transferrin receptor were generously provided by I. Trowbridge (Salk Institute, San Diego). To prepare anti-Tfn-R•gold complexes 10-nm gold particles were prepared and coupled to B3/25 as described previously(5Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody was from Dakopatts Ltd (High Wycombe, United Kingdom). Rb9, a polyclonal antibody to the Tfn-R extracellular domain, was obtained from Ed Lennox (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Cambridge). HEp.2 (American Type Culture Collection CCL 23) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, Scotland) containing 10% FCS. A construct encoding horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme c was kindly provided by Amersham International plc (Amersham, UK). To enable entry into the secretory pathway, the signal sequence from human growth hormone(6Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Surani M.A. Hirst B.H. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

The construct was ligated into the pSRα plasmid (7Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell.

To determine the rate at which a soluble tracer of the constitutive secretory pathway is transferred from the Golgi to the cell surface cells stably expressing horseradish peroxidase were incubated for 4 h at 20°C in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 20 mM HEPES. This treatment allows horseradish peroxidase activity to accumulate inside the cell. Cells were then transferred to 37°C for various times in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide to prevent further protein synthesis. Cells were then cooled to 4°C and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. After removal of the nuclei by centrifugation, supernatants were assayed for horseradish peroxidase activity using o-phenylenediamine as substrate. To determine the rate at which newly synthesized Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase are transferred from the Golgi to the cell surface cells were pulsed with trans-35S-label (150 μCi/ml) for 15 min in methionine-free medium and then chased in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 20 mM HEPES at 20°C for 4 h. Cells were then transferred to 37°C for various times before cooling to 4°C. To detect Tfn-R at the cell surface, cells were then incubated in 100 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 4°C(11Trowbridge I.S. Omary M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3039-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The cleaved fragment of the extracellular domain of the Tfn-R and the intact receptor that remained cell associated were immunoprecipitated with Rb9. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by quantitation either by densitometry or using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad, UK). To detect alkaline phosphatase at the cell surface, cells were incubated with 0.5 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C for 2 h at 4°C. Alkaline phosphatase released and that remaining cell-associated was immunoprecipitated with anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody and analyzed as described for the Tfn-R. To determine whether horseradish peroxidase passes through endosomes en route to the cell surface, cells were incubated for 4 h at 20°C in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 20 mM HEPES to accumulate horseradish peroxidase activity inside the cell. Anti-Tfn-R•gold was added for the last hour at 20°C. Cells were then transferred to 37°C for various times in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide and the continued presence of gold. Endosomes were then isolated as described (12Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar) except that cells were used 24 h after plating. Horseradish peroxidase activity in the endosome fraction and in an aliquot of the post-nuclear supernatant was measured after solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (to remove gold conjugates because they interfered with the horseradish peroxidase assay). To determine whether newly synthesized Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase pass through endosomes en route to the cell surface, cells were pulsed with trans-35S-label (150 μCi/ml) for 15 min in methionine-free medium and then chased in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 20 mM HEPES at 20°C for 4 h. Anti-Tfn-R•gold was added for the last hour at 20°C. Cells were then transferred to 37°C for various times in the continued presence of anti-Tfn-R•gold before cooling to 4°C. Gold-loaded endosomes were then isolated as described above. Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase were immunoprecipitated from an aliquot of the post-nuclear supernatant and from the endosome fraction. The proportion of newly synthesized Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase in the endosome fraction was determined by quantitating the radioactivity in the immunoprecipitates as described above. To determine the proportion of total Tfn-R in the endosome fraction and hence the endosome yield, the immunoprecipitated Tfn-R were Western blotted with H68.4, and antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, UK) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Cells stably expressing horseradish peroxidase were incubated for 4 h at 20°C. Anti-Tfn-R•gold was added for the last hour at 20°C, and cells were then fixed. Fixation was carried out in Karnovsky fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5(13Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27: 137aGoogle Scholar)). They were incubated with H2O2 and diaminobenzidine prepared as described(14Graham R.C. Karnovsky M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1966; 14: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (5192) Google Scholar), rinsed, osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded by standard procedures(5Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Sections were cut at either 70 nm, stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate or cut 1 μm thick, stabilized with a thin film of evaporated carbon and viewed, unstained in a Phillips CM12 transmission electron microscope. To obtain a marker of the constitutive secretory pathway, we have transfected mammalian cells with a cDNA encoding horseradish peroxidase linked to the signal sequence of human growth hormone, allowing the protein to gain access to the secretory pathway (10Connolly C.N. Futter C.E. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The enzyme is active and constitutively secreted in a number of different cell lines. In a HEp.2 cell line stably expressing horseradish peroxidase, the intracellular concentration of active enzyme is low. However, this can be increased by incubation of the cells at 20°C, a temperature that inhibits movement out of the Golgi toward the cell surface but allows protein synthesis to continue (1Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Upon warming the cells to 37°C in the presence of cycloheximide, the horseradish peroxidase activity accumulated in the Golgi is rapidly cleared from the cell with a half-time of approximately 20 min (Fig. 1). To determine whether a significant proportion of horseradish peroxidase passes through endosomes en route to the cell surface, cells expressing horseradish peroxidase were incubated for 4 h at 20°C and during the last hour of incubation at 20°C anti-Tfn-R•gold was added. Cells were then transferred to 37°C in the presence of cycloheximide and anti-Tfn-R•gold-loaded endosomes isolated as described previously(12Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological analysis shows that the entire Tfn recycling pathway is accessible at 20°C, and neither the yield nor the form of the endosomes changes significantly at this reduced temperature. As shown in Fig. 1 less than 5% of the post-nuclear supernatant horseradish peroxidase activity was recovered in the anti-Tfn-R•gold-isolated endosomes at any chase time studied (Fig. 1). Cells incubated as above were also examined by electron microscopy. In conventional thin sections the distribution of anti-Tfn-R•gold at the end of the 20°C incubation is seen in large (0.2-0.5 μm diameter) vacuoles and smaller (50-80 nm diameter) vesicles but is not found in the flattened cisternae of the Golgi stack or their associated vacuoles labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2). Sections up to 1 μm thick were also examined to determine whether there were continuities between structures labeled with horseradish peroxidase and those containing anti-Tfn-R•gold which would not be evident in thin sections. As shown in Fig. 3, although components containing the two tracers are closely associated double-labeled elements were not observed. We conclude, therefore, that TGN components are unlikely to be present in the anti-Tfn-R•gold-loaded fractions. In a previously published study (10Connolly C.N. Futter C.E. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we showed that if accumulation of horseradish peroxidase activity in Golgi elements at 20°C is followed by transfer to 37°C, the horseradish peroxidase and anti-Tfn-R•gold tracers remain distributed in separate elements.Figure 3:Thick section electron microscopy of the intracellular distribution of secretory horseradish peroxidase and the transferrin receptor. Thick sections (1.0 μm) of HEp.2 cells stably expressing horseradish peroxidase and incubated as in Fig. 2. Thick sections demonstrate the extensive continuity which exists between Golgi complex elements and show how closely associated they can be with endocytic elements containing gold tracer. However, even in sections which are up to 10 times thicker than the diameter of the 70-120 nm diameter vesicles and tubules the tracers are seen to be distributed in separate elements.

Cells were then transferred to 37°C, endosomes isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and radiolabeled Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase were immunoprecipitated. Compared to the content of pre-existing Tfn-R in the endosome fraction the content of newly synthesized Tfn-R in the endosomes isolated from 20°C incubated cells is low (Fig. 4a). This is consistent with the expectation that most of the newly synthesized Tfn-R will be retained in the Golgi at this temperature. On transfer to 37°C, there is a rapid increase in the content of newly synthesized Tfn-R in the endosome fraction. This increase, which reaches a peak in the first 10 min is then followed by a decline over the next 10 min. The amount of newly synthesized alkaline phosphatase in endosome fractions from cells incubated at 20°C is low and does not show any detectable increase when cells are shifted to 37°C. To determine whether newly synthesized Tfn-R reach the endosome before they can be detected on the cell surface, the rate at which newly synthesized Tfn-R and alkaline phosphatase are transported from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was measured. Cells were pulsed for 15 min at 37°C with trans-35S-label and incubated in chase medium at 20°C for 4 h. Cells were then transferred to 37°C. The amount of newly synthesized Tfn-R appearing on the cell surface was determined by incubating the cells with trypsin at 4°C. Under these conditions the extracellular domain of the Tfn-R is cleaved and can be immunoprecipitated with more than 80% efficiency(5Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The amount of newly synthesized alkaline phosphatase appearing on the cell surface was determined by incubating cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C at 4°C. This enzyme cleaves the labeled alkaline phosphatase which was then immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 4b, there is a steady increase in the amount of newly synthesized Tfn-R on the cell surface from 10 min at 37°C when less than 5% can be detected to 30 min when, as shown by more extended incubations, a steady state of 30% is reached. Thus the rise in the amount of newly synthesized Tfn-R in endosomes at 10 min occurs before significant amounts of newly synthesized Tfn-R can be detected at the cell surface. It is noteworthy that the decline in the amount of newly synthesized Tfn-R in endosomes that occurs at 20 min is coincident with the rise in newly synthesized Tfn-R at the cell surface. Although, as shown in Fig. 4b, a small amount (6%) of newly synthesized Tfn-R is found in the endosome at the end of the 20°C incubation, there is no indication that a similar leakage occurs to the cell surface at this temperature. Newly synthesized alkaline phosphatase reaches the cell surface with similar kinetics to newly synthesized Tfn-R (results not shown). A previous cell fractionation study on the hepatocyte cell line HepG2 by Stoorvogel et al.(15Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Griffith J.M. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) found a significant colocalization of a secretory protein with an endocytosed Tfn-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and their correlative morphological analysis suggested this was due to the presence of endocytosed Tfn tracer in the trans-Golgi reticulum. In the present study on HEp.2, an epithelioid cell line, we have shown that the anti-Tfn-R•gold tracer used to load the endosomes does not enter the TGN. This is apparent both from the cell fractionation work, which shows that fractions containing endocytosed anti-Tfn-R•gold contain very low levels of horseradish peroxidase after a 20°C block, and from the electron microscopy, which shows horseradish peroxidase accumulates in the TGN at 20°C but remains separate from gold-loaded endosomes. Endosomes loaded with anti-Tfn-R•gold contain extremely low levels of newly synthesized alkaline phosphatase as well as horseradish peroxidase at 20°C, and no increase is seen on transfer to 37°C when the newly synthesized proteins transfer to the cell surface. We conclude, therefore, that in HEp.2 cells routes for constitutive secretion do not pass through gold-loaded endosomes. However, since our previous studies (12Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar) showed by electron microscopy that endosome fractions obtained by this gold-mediated density shift protocol are composed primarily of the vacuolar elements of the Tfn-R recycling pathway we cannot exclude the possibility that these soluble phase and GPI-anchored proteins may be transferred to the cell surface via a later step in the recycling pathway. They could for example be transferred via the 60-nm tubules in the pericentriolar area which form the most distal compartment in the Tfn-R recycling pathway in these cells(16Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), since these tubules are not well represented in our density shifted fractions(12Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that horseradish peroxidase expressed from transfected cDNA is efficiently cleared from the cell supports the view that this fluid-phase tracer moves directly to the surface from the TGN because a fluid-phase tracer entering the vacuolar elements of the endocytic pathway would be more likely to move to the lysosome than recycle to the cell surface(3Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 9: 129-162Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the endosome content of newly synthesized Tfn-R increases approximately 3-fold when the cells are shifted from 20 to 37°C. No increases were seen with either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase which provide rigorous internal controls for the isolation procedure. The content of newly synthesized Tfn-R within the purified endosome fraction peaks 10 min after temperature shift at 15% of the total radiolabeled Tfn-R. It is important to emphasize that this percentage is a considerable underestimate of the endosome content because the purification procedure recovers only about 30% of the endosomal Tfn-R. This estimate is based on the percentage of total Tfn-R in the endosome fraction (approximately 20%), the earlier demonstration that the endosome fraction provides a 150-200-fold purification containing less than 1% plasma membrane(12Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar), and the percentage (70%) of total Tfn-R that are intracellular (assayed by stripping cells incubated to steady state with 125I-Tfn with low pH at 4°C). Correcting for the loss of endosome elements during fractionation suggests that the endosome compartment as a whole could contain more than three times (70/20) the amount of newly synthesized Tfn-R we detect in purified fractions. The efficiency with which newly synthesized Tfn-R are delivered to gold-loaded endosomes compared to fluid-phase horseradish peroxidase and GPI-linked alkaline phosphatase suggests that it is likely to be a signal dependent process. The only known trafficking signal carried by Tfn-R is the well characterized tyrosine-based internalization motif which is recognized by the selection mechanism of the clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane(3Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 9: 129-162Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that this motif is recognized by the sorting mechanisms located within the clathrin lattices of the TGN, although other signals such as the dileucine signal of the CD3y subunit of the T cell antigen receptor(17Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and the signals of the invariant chain (18Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) which are recognized in the TGN are also known to be recognized by the clathrin lattices of the plasma membrane. It would not be very surprising therefore to find that the internalization signal carried by the Tfn-R is recognized in the TGN so that this protein like the CD3y chain and invariant chain are then sorted directly into the endosome compartment. The suggestion that the internalization signal in the cytoplasmic domain of a predominantly cell surface protein like the Tfn-R is also recognized by clathrin lattices in the trans-Golgi has important implications for trafficking in polarized cells since it implies proteins carrying a plasma membrane internalization signal and routed through the TGN could be routed through the endosome. If this is so, then a means of ensuring that proteins trafficking through the endosome are transferred to the appropriate surface domain would also be required. In the proteins studied thus far this requirement has been satisfied. Thus in the polymeric IgA receptor which has a very efficient plasma membrane-coated pit signal there is also a signal which prevents transfer from the endosome to the apical surface(19Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Similarly in the low density lipoprotein receptor there is a proximal basolateral targetting signal which overlaps with the well characterized plasma membrane coated pit signal, as well as a distal signal, independent of the internalization signal, which prevents apical transfer(20Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, removal of the segment of the cytoplasmic domain of Tfn-R which includes the tyrosine-containing internalization signal is reported to have no influence on its delivery to the basolateral surface(22Dargemont C. LeBivic A. Rothenburger S. Iacopetta B. Kuhn L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, while the YTRF sequence in the Tfn-R has been shown to be all that is required for internalization in coated pits(23Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Pytowski B. Arzt J. Ferrone C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proposal that closely related or identical signals may be recognized with varying affinity by clathrin-coated domains in both the plasma membrane and the TGN(3Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 9: 129-162Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar), together with the knowledge that interaction with clathrin-coated domains at both sites results in delivery to the endosome, gives the endosome a central role in the selective routing of membrane proteins. It may be that the initial site of sorting on the biosynthetic pathway is the TGN and that it is the mechanisms for sorting which reside within the endosome which are primarily responsible for the delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane, the lysosome, the trans-Golgi and other intracellular destinations, such as the synaptic vesicle(25Bauerfeind R. Regnier-Vigouroux A. Flatmark T. Huttner W.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 105-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Regnier-Vigouroux A. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3589-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The number and nature of the sorting mechanisms within the endosome responsible for these decisions has yet to be determined, but they probably rely upon interactions other than those which operate within clathrin-coated domains."

We recently provided evidence that sphingolipid synthesis is necessary to maintain neuronal growth by demonstrating that in hippocampal neurons, inhibition of ceramide synthesis by Fumonisin B1 (FB1) disrupted axonal outgrowth (Harel, R. and Futerman, A. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14476-14481). We now analyze further the relationship between neuronal growth and sphingolipid metabolism by examining the effect of an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and by examining the effects of both FB1 and PDMP at various stages of neuronal development. No effects of FB1 or PDMP were observed during the first 2 days in culture, but by day 3 axonal morphology was significantly altered, irrespective of the time of addition of the inhibitors to the cultures. Cells incubated with FB1 or PDMP had a shorter axon plexus and less axonal branches. FB1 appeared to cause a retraction of axonal branches between days 2 and 3, although long term incubation had no apparent effect on neuronal morphology or on the segregation of axonal or dendritic proteins. In contrast, incubation of neurons with conduritol B-epoxide, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide degradation, caused an increase in the number of axonal branches and a corresponding increase in the length of the axon plexus. A direct correlation was observed between the number of axonal branch points per cell and the extent of inhibition of either sphingolipid synthesis or degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2052876393,"Cathepsin G is a neutrophil-derived protease that has been shown to inhibit the effects of thrombin on some cells expressing thrombin receptors while acting as an agonist on others. The present studies examine whether cleavage of the thrombin receptor by cathepsin G can account for these diverse effects. When added to cells that normally respond to thrombin, cathepsin G prevented a subsequent cytosolic Ca2+ increase caused by thrombin, but had no effect on responses to the thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLRN. These effects were observed in cells in which cathepsin G had little or no agonist effect (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HEL cells), as well as in cells in which cathepsin G acted as an agonist (platelets and CHRF-288 cells). Binding studies using monoclonal antibodies with defined epitopes within the first 60 residues of the thrombin receptor N-terminus showed that incubation of platelets and endothelial cells with cathepsin G abolished the binding of all of the antibodies, while thrombin abolished only the binding of antibodies whose epitopes were N-terminal to the known thrombin cleavage site between Arg41 and Ser42. Analysis of peptide proteolytic fragments identified three potential cleavage sites for cathepsin G: Arg41-Ser42, Phe43-Leu44, and Phe55-Trp56. Cleavage at Phe55-Trp56 would account for both the observed loss of all of the antibody binding sites and the inhibition of receptor activation by thrombin. Two approaches were used to determine whether a solitary cleavage at Arg41-Ser42 could result in receptor activation. In the first, HEL cells were exposed to cathepsin G or thrombin in the presence of an antibody whose epitope includes Phe55. The antibody inhibited responses to thrombin, but augmented the response to cathepsin G. In the second, COS-1 cells were transfected with variant thrombin receptors in which Phe55 and Trp56 were mutated to alanine. Transfected wild-type receptors responded to thrombin, but not cathepsin G, while the variant receptors responded to both proteases. These results 1) suggest that the ability of cathepsin G to inhibit responses to thrombin, but not SFLLRN, is due to cleavage of the receptor at Phe55-Trp56, deleting the tethered ligand domain, and 2) show that cathepsin G can activate thrombin receptors, but only if the cleavage site at PheS5-Trp56 is mutated or otherwise protected. This defines one mechanism by which neutrophil activation can prevent cellular responses to thrombin, while suggesting that the agonist effects of cathepsin G are less likely to be due to activation of the one known form of the human thrombin receptor unless post-translational modifications or local structural constraints prevent access of the enzyme to the Phe55-Trp56 site.

Thrombin is a potent agonist for a number of cells in and around the vascular space, including platelets, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Thrombin’s ability to activate cells depends upon its proteolytic activity and appears to be largely, if not exclusively, mediated by a member of the G-protein-coupled family of receptors (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar, 2Rasmussen U.B. Vouret-Craviari V. Jallat S. Schlesinger Y. Pagès G.

This receptor has a characteristic structure with 7 transmembrane domains and an extracellular N terminus. Cleavage of the N terminus between residues Arg41 and Ser42 exposes a new N terminus whose initial 5 residues, SFLLR, are thought to serve as a tethered ligand, interacting with sites elsewhere in the receptor. Those sites have not been precisely mapped, but are thought to include residues Asn75 to Ser93 in the N terminus near the first transmembrane domain, as well as residues Ile244 to Ala268 in the second extracellular loop (3Bahou W.F.

Following cleavage by thrombin, activated thrombin receptors undergo homologous desensitization and internalization (5Brass L.F. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Tarver A.P. Hoxie J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In theory, this mechanism for cell activation by thrombin could be used by other proteases as well, either by cleaving their own unique receptors or by cleaving the thrombin receptor at the same site as thrombin. A mutated thrombin receptor with an altered sequence preceding the thrombin cleavage site has been shown to respond to enterokinase (6Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), but the only known example of a distinct naturally occurring protease-sensitive receptor is the recently described PAR-2, a mouse protein that is 28% identical with the mouse thrombin receptor (7Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The natural “ligand” for PAR-2 has not been identified. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it can be activated by trypsin, but not thrombin. Trypsin can also activate thrombin receptors (8Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Williams A. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as can granzyme A, a protease derived from T-cells (9Suidan H.S. Bouvier J. Schaerer E. Stone S.R. Monard D. Tschopp J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8112-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have examined the interaction between thrombin receptors and cathepsin G. Cathepsin G is of particular interest for several reasons. First, like thrombin and trypsin, cathepsin G is a serine protease. However, in contrast to trypsin, which is not normally present in the vascular space, cathepsin G is released by activated neutrophils at sites of injury and inflammation, reaching concentrations that have been estimated to be as high as 0.5 μμ (10Weksler B.B. Jaffe E.A. Brower M.S. Cole O.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, cathepsin G has been shown to have two apparently contradictory effects. In some cells that express thrombin receptors, including platelets (11Selak M.A. Chignard M. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Molino M.

Surg. 1994; 19: 306-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (14LeRoy E.C. Ager A. Gordon J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Totani L. Piccoli A. Pellegrini G. Di Santo A Lorenzet R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 125-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cathepsin G acts as an agonist, stimulating events such as aggregation and prostaglandin I2 formation and causing an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In other cells that express thrombin receptors, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (10Weksler B.B. Jaffe E.A. Brower M.S. Cole O.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (16Selak M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), cathepsin G has been reported to have no agonist effect. In all of the cases that have been examined, however, preincubation with cathepsin G has been shown to inhibit a subsequent response to thrombin, irrespective of whether cathepsin G has a primary agonist effect on those same cells (10Weksler B.B. Jaffe E.A. Brower M.S. Cole O.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Selak M.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In order to determine the underlying mechanism for these diverse effects of cathepsin G and to establish the basis for studies of other biologically relevant proteases, we have examined the interaction of cathepsin G with thrombin receptors on human platelets, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and two human megakaryoblastic cell lines: HEL cells and CHRF-288 cells. The results show that cathepsin G cleaves the N terminus of the thrombin receptor in at least two places, one at the site normally cleaved by thrombin, the other at a site closer to the first transmembrane domain. Cleavage at the latter site removes the tethered ligand domain and renders the receptors unresponsive to thrombin. When that site is altered or protected, either by mutation or by the presence of a targeted antibody, cathepsin G can activate thrombin receptors by cleaving at the same site as thrombin, exposing the tethered ligand domain. These findings account for the inhibitory effects of cathepsin G on cell responses to thrombin and define the conditions that are required for cathepsin G to act as a thrombin receptor agonist. Given the estimation that in areas of inflammation the local concentration of cathepsin G exceeds the concentration of its inhibitors, these findings also suggest that cathepsin G may play a role in the modulation of cellular responses to thrombin, even in cells that do not have a primary response to cathepsin G.

Hybridoma supernatants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on the unconjugated peptide. Clones that were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were tested by flow cytometry for reactivity with the native receptor on CHRF-288 cells. Selected antibodies were grown in ascites and purified on protein A columns (Bio-Rad). All of them belong to the IgG1 class. Because of the location of their epitopes, antibodies PC42, PC143, and SPAN12 only recognize intact receptors, while antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 recognize both intact and thrombin-cleaved receptors. EH1, an IgG1 antibody reactive with the HIV-1 Nef protein, was used as an isotype-matched control (17Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N. Stadel J. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol.

Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (12Molino M. Di Lallo M. De Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer at 2 × 108/ml with 200 μμ RGDS to inhibit platelet aggregation (20Plow E.F.

Afterwards, aliquots of the platelets were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with thrombin or cathepsin G and then hirudin or soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor was added. All of the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) were incubated with the platelets for 15 min, after which the cells were washed in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer with 2 mM EGTA and 2 mM EDTA, and then resuspended in 50 μl of fetal calf serum plus 50 μl of a 1:40 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse (BioSource International, Camarillo CA) in staining buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% sodium azide and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After a further incubation of 15 min at 4 °C, the platelets were washed again, resuspended in 500 μl of HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Endothelial Cells—Venous endothelial cells were isolated from human umbilical cord veins (21Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minik C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 52: 2745-2756Crossref Scopus (6001) Google Scholar) and cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes in Medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.6 mM glutamine, 12 units/ml heparin, and 200 mg/ml crude endothelial cell growth factor at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The endothelial cells were passaged with trypsin-EDTA and were used for experiments at passages 1–6. Since trypsin can cleave thrombin receptors (8Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Williams A. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exposure of the cells to trypsin was avoided for at least 2 days prior to the experiments, which is long enough for any cleaved receptors to be replaced (22Woolkalis M.J.

The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by incubating with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Afterwards, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 without fetal calf serum at 2 × 106/ml. When indicated, agonists were added for 15 min at 37 °C, after which thrombin receptors were detected by incubating with the appropriate primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. After washing with staining buffer (see above), the endothelial cells were resuspended, incubated with the secondary antibody, and then analyzed as described for platelets. HEL Cells—HEL cells were resuspended at 2 × 106/ml and, when indicated, fixed with an equal volume of 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was then washed and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml. After incubation with or without cathepsin G at 37 °C, soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml) was added and the cells were stained with antibodies as described for human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Washed platelets, resuspended at 3 × 108/ml in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer with 1 μμ prostaglandin E1, were incubated with 1 μμ Fura2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed by centrifugation. In order to minimize activation, 2 mM EGTA and 1 μμ prostaglandin E1 were added before centrifugation of the cells. Afterwards, the platelets were resuspended at 1 × 108/ml in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2, and 1.5-ml samples were used for stimulation with agonists. Fluorescence was measured in an SLM/Aminco AB2 spectrophotometer and approximate values for [Ca2+]i were calculated using an assumed Kd of 224 nM. Changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in HEL and CHRF-288 cells were measured as described previously (8Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Williams A. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the studies with endothelial cells, the cells were released from culture dishes by incubation at 37 °C for 5–15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM EDTA. The cells were then resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in phenol red-free-RPMI 1640 medium (PRF-RPMI) and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Cells were then loaded with 5 mM Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 37 °C, resuspended in PRF-RPMI, equilibrated for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml before being used in the Ca2+ studies. Peptides were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 2 μμ cathepsin G or 100 units/ml thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, the cleavage products were applied to a C-18 HPLC column and eluted with a gradient from 0% to 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectroscopy was performed by the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center Protein Chemistry Facility. The EcoRl fragment of the human thrombin receptor cDNA isolated from a HEL cell cDNA library was inserted into the expression vector, pRK7. The sequence of this clone (pRK7/TR) differs from that reported previously (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

In addition, a nine-amino acid (YPYDVPDYA) epitope tag was inserted at the C terminus of the receptor.

COS-1 cells, cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran with 0.5–1.5 µg/ml cDNA encoding the human (wild-type or mutated) thrombin receptor. One day after transfection, the cells were detached from the plates by trypsin/EDTA treatment and split into 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Three days after transfection, agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured (see below). Receptor expression was also measured on day 3 using flow cytometry and antibodies ATAP2 and SPAN12. To measure inositol phosphate formation, the transfected COS-1 cells were incubated overnight with 4 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (ICN Radiochemicals, specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) beginning 48 h after transfection. Afterwards, the cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C with 20 mM LiCl for 1 h and then stimulated with thrombin (2 units/ml) or cathepsin G (400 nM) for 45 min at 37 °C. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were extracted with perchloric acid, neutralized, and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex columns (24Dean N.M. Beaven M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) after adding phytic acid (15 µg/sample) as a carrier. As a first step, a comparison was made between the effects of cathepsin G, thrombin, and the thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLRN, on platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In platelets, all three agonists caused a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Exposure to thrombin caused a partial decrease in the subsequent response to SFLLRN (Fig. 2, A versus B), while preincubation of the platelets with cathepsin G completely abolished the response to thrombin (Fig. 2, A versus C). The results obtained with the endothelial cells were similar, with thrombin partially inhibiting the response to SFLLRN (Fig. 2, D versus E) and cathepsin G completely inhibiting the response to thrombin (Fig. 2, D versus F), although one difference was that in endothelial cells cathepsin G had no apparent effect on cytosolic Ca2+ even at the high concentration used (400 nm). Results similar to those obtained with platelets and endothelial cells were obtained with the HEL cells (Fig. 3) and CHRF-288 cells (not shown). In all cases, prior exposure to cathepsin G inhibited a subsequent response to thrombin. This inhibition was concentration-dependent and was half-maximal in HEL cells at 20 nM cathepsin G (Fig. 3). The inhibition was not due to cleavage of thrombin by cathepsin G since the cathepsin G inhibitor, eglin C, was added before the thrombin. Eglin C by itself had no effect on the magnitude of the thrombin response (not shown).FIG. 3Inhibition by cathepsin G of the Ca2+ response to thrombin in HEL cells. Fura-2-loaded HEL cells were preincubated for 2 min with the indicated concentrations of cathepsin G (Cath. G), followed by 10 μg/ml eglin C (Eglin C). Thrombin (Thrombin) was added at 2 units/ml. The data shown are representative of two experiments performed under identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Effects of Cathepsin G on Thrombin Receptors—Although cathepsin G abolished the response to thrombin in all of the cells that were tested, it had no effect on the response of the same cells to SFLLRN, even at reduced SFLLRN concentrations (FIG. 2, FIG. 4). In both control and cathepsin G-treated HEL cells, the Ca2+ response to SFLLRN was half-maximal at approximately 5 μμ (Fig. 4). This suggested that the failure of the cells exposed to cathepsin G to respond to thrombin was not due to classical desensitization of the receptor, since that has been shown to affect responses to both thrombin and the agonist peptides (25Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative, we considered whether cathepsin G might cleave the thrombin receptor at one or more sites that would impair responses to thrombin, but not SFLLRN. Recent studies with receptor-directed antibodies (3Bahou W.F. Coller B.S. Potter C.L. Norton K.J. Kutok J.L. Goligorsky M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and with chimeric receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (4Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have shown that residues Asn75 to Ser93 in the N terminus are important for receptor activation by the agonist peptides and that deletion of that domain shifts the peptide dose-response curve to the right, increasing the EC50 (4Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Since we found that cathepsin G had no effect on the EC50 for SFLLRN, we hypothesized that cathepsin G might cleave the thrombin receptor proximal to residue Asn75, leaving the remainder of the N terminus intact. To test this hypothesis, we made use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies with defined epitopes within the receptor N terminus (Fig. 1). Those antibodies differ with respect to their ability to bind to thrombin-cleaved receptors in a manner that would be predicted by the locations of their epitopes. Antibodies PC42 and PC143, which recognize the fragment cleaved from the receptor by thrombin, and antibody SPAN12, which is directed at the thrombin cleavage site between Arg41 and Ser42, bind to both intact receptors and peptide-activated receptors, but do not bind to thrombin-cleaved receptors. Antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15, on the other hand, recognize both intact and thrombin-cleaved receptors (17Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N. Stadel J. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 compares the effects of cathepsin G and thrombin on the binding of the receptor-directed antibodies to platelets and endothelial cells. In each case, the antibodies were added after the cells had been incubated with the proteases. With both platelets and endothelial cells, thrombin caused a 50–60% decrease in the binding of the cleavage-insensitive antibodies, ATAP2 and WEDE15, and a 90% decrease in the binding of antibodies PC42 and SPAN12. We have shown previously using HEL and CHRF-288 cells that the loss of binding sites for antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 caused by thrombin reflects receptor internalization, while the loss of binding sites for antibody SPAN12 is due to receptor cleavage, which typically occurs in excess of internalization (17Brass L.F.

Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to thrombin, cathepsin G caused a decrease in the binding of all four antibodies. This decrease was detectable within 10 s of the addition of the cathepsin G and was independent of receptor internalization since it was also observed when HEL cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde to prevent receptor internalization (Fig. 6). Under the same conditions, thrombin and SFLLRN had no effect on WEDE15 binding to the HEL cells, showing that fixation had blocked receptor internalization (not shown).FIG. 6Incubation of fixed HEL cells with cathepsin G. Paraformaldehyde-fixed HEL cells were incubated with 100 nM cathepsin G at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at the indicated times by adding soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml) and by chilling the cell suspension. The binding of antibodies WEDE15 and SPAN12 is expressed as a percentage of the value obtained with untreated cells. The results shown are the mean ± S.E. of three to four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of the Cathepsin G Cleavage Sites on the Human Throm"

Although the sites on vWF that bind to platelet GPIb/IX and GPIIb/IIIa have been well characterized, the collagen-binding site(s) within vWF is not well defined. Results vary with the source of vWF, the type of collagen, and the nature of the binding assay. Previous investigators have reported that vWF binds to collagen types I, III, and VI (7Santoro S.A.

One is localized in the propeptide, which is cleaved during the assembly of vWF multimers and is unlikely to play a major role in platelet adhesion (16Takagi J. Sekiya F. Kasahara K. Inada Y. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6017-6020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other two sites have been localized to amino acids 542-622 and 948-998 of the mature vWF subunit polypeptide (17Roth G.J. Titani K. Hoyer L.W. Hickey M.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8357-8361Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Analysis of vWF cDNA and its predicted amino acid sequence shows an interesting pattern of homologous repeats (20Shelton-Inloes B.B.

Thus, two of the triplicated A repeats contain sequences that have been implicated in collagen binding. In addition to their sequence similarity, the A1 and A3 repeats each contain a single intrachain disulfide bond. The A1 disulfide bond links Cys-509 and Cys-695, and the A3 disulfide links Cys-923 and Cys-1109, forming a 185-amino acid “loop” structure in each domain (19Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), there is still some uncertainty regarding the existence of a collagen-binding site in the A1 domain. One early study, utilizing unpurified bacterial lysate, reported an interaction between recombinant vWF-A1 protein in the bacterial lysate and collagen (32Pietu G. Meulien P. Cherel G. Diaz J. Baruch D. Courtney M. Meyer D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other investigators who have subsequently expressed and studied the function of purified vWF-A1 protein have reported conflicting results (33Azuma H. Dent J.A. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12342-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gralnick H.R. Williams S. McKeown L. Kramer W. Krutzsh H. Gorecki M. Pinet A. Garfinkel L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5202-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, our laboratory recently reported that a highly purified monomeric vWF-A1 protein bound to platelet GPIb/IX and heparin, but did not bind to collagen (36Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that recombinant vWF from which the entire A1 domain has been deleted, which forms the normal spectrum of multimers, no longer binds to platelet GPIb/IX, but still binds to collagen (37Sixma J.J. Schiphorst M.E. Verweij C.L. Pannekoek H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 688: 1-7Google Scholar).To resolve these conflicting results and to learn more about the collagen-vWF interaction, we have cloned and expressed vWF A1 and A3 domain polypeptides and compared their biochemical properties with a chimeric vWF A1 domain polypeptide containing sequences derived from the vWF A1 and A3 domains (vWF-A1/A3). The studies reported here clearly demonstrate that vWF-A3 protein and the vWF-A1/A3 chimera both bind to type I collagen. Results obtained with vWF-A1/A3 help to localize the collagen-binding sequence in the A3 domain to a sequence between amino acids 1018 and 1114. We have concluded that the vWF-A3 binding site can account for all of the interactions between multimeric vWF and type I collagen and that this site probably represents the physiologically relevant collagen-binding site in vWF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of vWF Expression VectorsA map for each of the three vWF cDNAs expressed is shown in Fig. 1. For expression of the vWF A3 domain in Escherichia coli, a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 908-1111 of mature vWF was constructed by mutagenesis of vWF cDNA in M13 with two oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide 1 spanned codons 1666-1674 (28Bonthron D. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ginsburg D. Handin R.I. Orkin S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7125-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and introduced a BamHI restriction site (encoding Gly and Ser) at codons 1670 and 1671. Oligonucleotide 2 spanned codons 1870-1882 and introduced a termination codon and a HindIII restriction site. Following sequence confirmation, the vWF-A3 cDNA fragment was isolated by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into the expression vector pQE9 (QIAGEN Inc.). Insertion of the vWF-A3 fragment in pQE9 produces an amino-terminal fusion protein containing the vWF sequence fused in frame to 10 amino acids (6 histidines) contributed by the vector. vWF-A1 cDNA was prepared as described previously and used to transform pQE9 as well (36Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Chimeric vWF-A1/A3 cDNA was constructed with a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis strategy. In the first round of amplification, the amino-terminal half of the A1 domain (residues 475-598) and the carboxyl-terminal half of the A3 domain (residues 1018-1114) were amplified. The 3’-primer for amplifying the A1 domain was designed to contain 12 extra bases of A3 domain sequence (5’-TCGCACAGCAAACAAGACCTCGCTGGTGGA-3’ (vWF-A1 sequence is underlined)). Thus, the amplified A1 cDNA contained a short A3 sequence at its 3’-end. Similarly, A3 cDNA contained a short A1 sequence at its 5’-end (5’-AGCGAGGTCTTGGCTGTGCGATACTTG-3’ (vWF-A1 sequence is underlined)). The two chimeric cDNA fragments were then incubated together so that they were annealed via their overlapping sequences. The annealed material was used as the template for the second round of polymerase chain reaction. The chimeric DNA fragment was amplified using 5’-A1 (5’-CCTCACCTGTGAAGGATCCCAGGAGCCGGGAG-3’) and 3’-A3 (5’-CATTCCAAGCTTGAATTCATCAAGATCTAACAAATCCAGAGC-3’) primers designed to introduce BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, for cloning as described previously above. The chimeric vWF-A1/A3 cDNA fragment was isolated by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and used to transform pQE9.Purification of Recombinant ProteinsE. coli M15(pREP4) cells (QIAGEN Inc.) containing pQE9-vWF-A3, pQE9-vWF-A1, or pQE9-vWF-A1/A3 were cultured overnight at 37°C in 8 liters of 25 g/liter Tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:20 and grown to A595 = 0.7. The culture was adjusted to 1.5 mM IPTG and incubated for 5 h at 37°C. The cells were then harvested, resuspended in 125 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing lysozyme at a final concentration of 250 μg/ml, and allowed to stand for 1 h at 4°C. The bacterial cells were lysed in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml deoxycholic acid and 7 μg/ml DNase I. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet was washed with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10 mM EDTA, followed by recentrifugation.For purification of vWF-A3 protein, the washed pellet was solubilized by the addition of 7.5 M urea in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and the solubilized proteins were dialyzed against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The solubilized proteins were passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. vWF-A3 eluted from the column with sodium chloride. The fractions containing vWF-A3 were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)Recombinant vWF-A1 or chimeric vWF-A1/A3 protein was expressed in E. coli as described above. They were both purified as described previously (36Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after induction with IPTG and collection of inclusion bodies from lysed E. coli cells, the washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, dialyzed into 6 M urea, and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on an S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Urea was removed by slow dialysis, and the recombinant proteins were dialyzed against TBS (36Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the purified recombinant proteins was then concentrated by adsorption to and elution from a heparin column (Bio-Rad) and/or ultrafiltration and dialyzed against TBS.Radiolabeling of vWF-A3 ProteinE. coli cells were grown overnight and diluted in medium described above. When grown to A595 = 0.7, the cells (500 ml) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with M9 minimal medium (6 g of Na2HPO4/liter, 3 g of KH2PO4/liter, 0.5 g of NaCl/liter, 1 g of NH4Cl/liter, 1 mM MgCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% glucose), and pelleted again. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with a 0.02% concentration of 18 amino acids except Met and Cys. Bacteria were grown for 45 min; IPTG was added; and the medium was supplemented with 1.5 μCi/ml [35S]H2SO4 (DuPont NEN) overnight at 37°C. Labeled vWF-A3 was purified as described above. Specific activity of 35S-labeled vWF-A3 was 3.6 × 104 cpm/μg.Production and Purification of Multimeric Recombinant vWFRecombinant vWF was purified from the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been stably transformed with full-length vWF cDNA as described previously (21Bonthron D.T. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ewenstein B. Loscalzo J. Ginsburg D. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 324: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Wise R.J.

Confluent cells were rinsed and incubated for 24-48 h in α-minimal essential medium containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin, insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite supplement (Sigma), and 1% (v/v) aprotinin (Sigma, A-6279). The conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and Na2EDTA and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride were added to final concentrations of 5 and 2 mM, respectively. To isolate vWF wild-type protein, Chinese hamster ovary cell-conditioned medium was concentrated in dialysis tubing by using Aquacide II (Calbiochem) and passed over a Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration chromatography column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 5 × 100 cm). Fractions containing vWF protein were pooled, concentrated by Aquacide II, and dialyzed against TBS. For radiolabeling of vWF produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Cys- and Met-deficient serum-free medium was supplemented with 10 μCi/ml [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (39Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21948-21955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled vWF was purified as described above. Specific activity of 35S-labeled vWF was 2.0 × 104 cpm/μg.Collagen Binding AssayA final concentration of 1.8 mg/ml acid-soluble bovine type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical, Boston) was added to microtiter wells in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 90 min. An acid-soluble calfskin type I collagen (Sigma) was also used in some experiments. After washing three times with TBS to remove nonadsorbed collagen, wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 30 min. Increasing concentrations of 35S-labeled vWF proteins were added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. For competition assays, a constant concentration (1-4 μg/ml) of 35S-labeled vWF was added to the wells with increasing concentrations of the unlabeled ligands. Wells were washed with TBS, and bound radioactivity was removed for scintillation counting by overnight incubation in 1% SDS/TBS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 40-fold excess of nonradioactive vWF-A3 or a 50-fold excess of nonradioactive vWF. In each case, nonspecific binding was always <5% of total binding. The amount of collagen bound to wells was measured in duplicate as described previously (12Bockenstedt P. McDonagh J. Handin R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Bound collagen was removed with 1% SDS and submitted to protein quantitation. At the concentration used in the assays, 6 ± 1.0 μg of collagen bound to each well.Platelet Agglutination AssayRistocetin-induced platelet agglutination was carried out in siliconized glass cuvettes at 37°C with constant stirring at 1200 rpm in a four-channel aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp.). A suspension of 2 × 108/ml formaldehyde-fixed platelets containing 8 μg/ml purified vWF (41Cruz M.A. Petersen E. Turci S.M. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations of the recombinant proteins was prepared. After 5 min of incubation at 37°C, agglutination was initiated by the addition of ristocetin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.Protein QuantitationProtein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled protein was visualized by autoradiography utilizing ENHANCE (DuPont NEN). Gel filtration analysis was carried out in a Sephacryl 300-HR column (Sigma; 0.8 × 30 cm) using a Waters 650E-APPS apparatus (36Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSProduction, Purification, and Collagen-binding Activity of vWF-A3After induction with IPTG, transformed bacteria expressing vWF-A3 cDNA, pQE9-vWF-A3, were lysed, and their inclusion bodies were collected. As shown in Fig. 2 A, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the washed inclusion bodies contained a prominent protein band of 27,000 Da. The inclusion bodies could be solubilized in 7.5 M urea, and all of the protein remained in solution after dialysis against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.2. The soluble proteins were then fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column and a linear NaCl gradient. As shown in Fig. 3, vWF-A3 eluted in a sharp peak at 160 mM NaCl. This peak represented ~50% of the total vWF-A3 protein expressed. The remaining 50%, which formed high molecular mass aggregates, eluted in the flow-through volume of the column. The final yield of purified monomeric protein was 8 mg/liter of bacterial culture. To assess the purity of vWF-A3, radiolabeled protein was produced by incubating E. coli containing pQE9-vWF-A3 in medium containing 35SO4 and IPTG. Radiolabeled vWF-A3 was then purified by the procedure described above. A single radiolabeled band was seen after purification by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2 B, lane4).Figure 2:SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant vWF-A3 protein. Bacterial inclusion bodies and purified bacterial vWF-A3 protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). A, the gel, analyzed under reducing conditions, shows molecular mass markers (lane1) and washed bacterial inclusion bodies (lane2) from E. coli transformed with pQE-vWF-A3 and induced with IPTG. B, lanes 1, 2, and 4 were analyzed under reducing conditions. Lane1 shows molecular mass markers. Lane 2 shows vWF-A3 eluted from a Q-Sepharose column. Lane 3 shows vWF-A3 analyzed under nonreducing conditions. Lane 4 shows an autoradiograph of vWF-A3 metabolically labeled with 35SO4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Ion-exchange chromatography of vWF-A3. Following solubilization of inclusion bodies, vWF-A3 was purified using a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The bound protein was eluted with a gradient of NaCl.

Abs, absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The calculated molecular mass for the sequence between Ser-908 and Gly-1111 is 21,538 Da. The 10 additional amino acids from the vector sequence add another 1254 Da, bringing the estimated molecular mass to 22,792 Da. This is in good agreement with the estimated molecular mass of the purified material of 27,000 Da (Fig. 2 B, lane2). In addition, purified vWF-A3 eluted from a Sephacryl 300 column with the Kav of a globular monomeric 24-kDa protein (data not shown). When purified vWF-A3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 B, lane3), it migrated slightly faster than the reduced form, suggesting a compact globular structure that is extended following reduction of the single disulfide bond between Cys-923 and Cys-1109.As shown in Fig. 4, 35S-labeled vWF-A3 bound to immobilized soluble type I collagen derived from bovine Achilles tendon or calfskin collagen in a saturable and reversible manner. At the highest concentration of added 35S-labeled vWF-A3, nonspecific binding accounted for <5% of total bound radioactivity. The relevant binding parameters for vWF-A3 were derived by Scatchard analysis of binding isotherms (Fig. 4, inset). The Scatchard plot demonstrated a single class of binding sites with a Kdof 1.8 ± 0.3 μM. At saturation, there were 300 fmol of vWF-A3 bound per μg of immobilized collagen.Figure 4:Binding of 35S-labeled recombinant vWF-A3 protein to collagen-coated microtiter wells. A final concentration of 1.8 mg/ml acid-soluble bovine type I collagen was added to microtiter wells in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 90 min at 37°C. After washing with TBS to remove nonadsorbed collagen, wells were blocked by the addition of 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. Increasing concentrations of 35S-labeled recombinant vWF-A3 were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Wells were washed with TBS, and bound radioactivity was removed with 1% SDS/TBS and counted. Nonspecific binding, measured in parallel wells with the addition of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled vWF-A3 protein, was subtracted from each point. The values shown represent specific binding from five separate experiments. B, bound; F, free.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of Chimeric vWF-A1/A3 ProteinThe purified vWF-A1/A3 chimera, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, had a band of 32,000 Da. This is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 27,000 Da. The anticipated shift in mobility between reduced and unreduced protein was also demonstrated, suggesting formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-509 and Cys-1109 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, both vWF-A1 and vWF-A1/A3 proteins inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 for both proteins was between 200 and 600 nM. This finding provides additional evidence for proper folding of the chimeric protein and helps to localize the GPIb/IX-binding domain to the first 98 residues of the vWF A1 domain. In contrast, at concentrations up to 2 μM, vW"

Although sequence conservation in the pro region is lower than in the mature proteases, a conserved motif (Gly-Xaa-Asn-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Asp-36, papain precursor numbering) was found within the pro region of cysteine proteases of the papain superfamily. To determinate the function to this conserved motif, we have mutagenized at random each of the 4 residues individually within the pro region of the papain precursor. Precursor mutants were expressed in yeast, screened according to their ability to be processed through either a cis or trans reaction, into mature active papain. Three classes of mutants were found. Non-functional propapain mutants of the first class are completely degraded by subtilisin indicating that they are not folded into a native state. Mutants of the second class were neutral with respect to cis and trans processing. The third class included mutants that mostly accumulated as mature papain in the yeast vacuole. They had mutations that had lost the negatively charged Asp-36 residues and a mutation that probably introduces a positive charge, Phe-38His. The precursor of the Phe-38His mutant could be recovered by expression in a vph1 mutant yeast strain which has a vacuolar pH of about 7. The Phe-38His propapain mutant has an optimum pH of autoactivation about one pH unit higher than the wild type molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2017872129,"TolA, -B, -Q, and -R proteins are involved in maintaining the cell envelope integrity of Escherichia coli; they have been parasitized by the group A colicins and the single strand DNA of some filamentous bacteriophages to permit them to enter the cells. TolA and TolR are anchored to the inner membrane by a single transmembrane domain, TolQ is an integral membrane protein with three transmembrane segments, and TolB has recently been found to be periplasmic although it is partially membrane-associated. The latter result suggests that TolB might interact with membrane proteins. Other lines of evidence favor the existence of a Tol complex. To further characterize this complex, we investigated which proteins interact with TolB. For this purpose, two different methods were used. First, we took advantage of the existence of a tagged TolB (TolBep) to perform immunoprecipitation under native conditions in order to preserve the putative associations of TolBep with other proteins. Secondly, in vivo cross-linking experiments with formaldehyde were performed. These two approaches led to the same result and demonstrated for the first time that a component of the Tol system, TolB, interacts with a protein located in the outer membrane, the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein.

These two approaches led to the same result and demonstrated for the first time that a component of the Tol system, TolB, interacts with a protein located in the outer membrane, the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria acts as a barrier preventing the entry of large deleterious molecules of the environment (such as detergents, proteases, and hydrophobic antibiotics). Some quite large molecules are able to cross the outer membrane, however. This is so in the case of iron siderophores and vitamin B12, which use an energy-coupled uptake system composed of a high affinity outer membrane receptor and the proteins TonB, ExbB, and ExbD (for a review, see Refs. 1Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Braun V. Günter K. Hantke K. Biol. Metals. 1991; 4: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Postle K. J.

Macromolecules such as colicins and the DNA of some bacteriophages parasitize this TonB-dependent transport system and another system composed of TolA, -B, -Q, and -R proteins and thus enter the cells. The exact physiological role of the Tol system has not yet been elucidated but Tol proteins are involved in maintaining the cell envelope integrity, since tol mutants are hypersensitive to drugs and detergents and since tolA and tolB mutants are leaky for periplasmic proteins (5Lazzaroni J.C.

The Tol and TonB systems have some common features, since ExbB and ExbD are 75% homologous with TolQ and TolR, respectively (9Eick-Helmerich K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these proteins have been found to have similar topologies. ExbD and TolR both have one transmembrane N-terminal domain, and their C terminus faces the periplasm (10Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5485-5487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 6050-6057Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 12Müller M.M. Vianney A.

Lewin T. M-. Beyer Jr., W.F. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some functional cross-reactivity has been found to exist between ExbB/D and TolQ/R (15Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6387-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first evidence that the constituents of the TonB system were able to form a complex arose from the finding that TonB was unstable in exbB exbD mutants (16Fischer E. Günter K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5129-5134Crossref Google Scholar, 17Skare J.T. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TonB is anchored to the inner membrane by its N-terminal hydrophobic segment while the remainder protrudes into the periplasm (18Hannavy K. Barr G.C. Dorman C.J. Adamson J. Mazengera L.R.

(21Karlsson M. Hannavy K. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dependence of phage ϕ80 sensitivity on ExbB and -D proteins was specified by the TonB transmembrane domain. This result suggested that a functional interaction might occur between the N-terminal domain of TonB and ExbB and -D proteins inside the membrane. These indirect pieces of evidence were recently confirmed by the results of in vivo cross-linking experiments (22Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol.

By analogy with the TonB system, the Tol system was also suspected of forming a complex. This hypothesis was supported by two different results: (i) the TolA N-terminal membrane spanning sequence was found to specify the dependence on TolQ and -R proteins (21Karlsson M. Hannavy K. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and (ii) Tol proteins were found to co-fractionate with contact sites between the inner and outer membranes (24Bourdineaud J.P.

Identifying the components of the Tol complex and understanding how they interact are essential to elucidating how the Tol system functions in the uptake of colicin or phage DNA. Furthermore, this knowledge might provide us with useful clues as to the physiological role of the Tol system. In this study, we focused on the TolB protein, which has recently been found to be a periplasmic protein although a small part of it was peripherally membrane-associated (27Isnard M. Rigal A.

Using two different methods, native co-immunoprecipitation of a tagged TolB protein with a monoclonal antibody and in vivo chemical cross-linking with formaldehyde, we demonstrate here that TolB and a 20-kDa protein, identified as PAL 1The abbreviations used are: PALpeptidoglycan-associated lipoproteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismAbmonoclonal antibody.

Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Cellular Fractionations—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer of proteins from the SDS-PAGE to nitrocellulose was performed as described by Towbin et al. (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). After the transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was treated as described by Gorvel et al. (35Gorvel J.P. Rigai A. Sarles J. Maroux S. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 239: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose was from Schleicher and Schüll. Cellular fractionations were performed as described by Isnard et al. (27Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Cloning—pBP was constructed by inserting the pal gene downstream of the tolB gene into the pMUIII plasmid. The pal gene was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the chromosomal pal gene of 1292 strain. On the chromosome, pal is immediately downstream of tolB, and part of its promoter is thought to be in the tolB coding sequence (36Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A single AseI restriction site, located 29 base pairs upstream of pal, is still present in pMUIII, and the 5′ primer was designed to initiate the amplification 32 base pairs upstream of the pal start codon in order to amplify this site. The 3′ primer was designed to place a BsaI site downstream of pal. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with AseI and BsaI and ligated into pMUIII digested with the same enzymes to create pBP. The pal gene inserted in pBP was sequenced to ensure that no errors were introduced during the polymerase chain reaction amplification. Immunoprecipitation of TolBep with mAb 1C11—HB101, HB101 pMUI, and HB101 pFAI cells labeled with [35S]methionine and otherwise were harvested. In the case of labeled cells, the incorporation of [35S]methionine was first stopped by isotopic dilution and by adding chloramphenicol (250 μg/ml). The cells were then resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, and lysosyme (100 μg/ml) at 37.5 units A600/ml. After being incubated for 15 min on ice, the cells were lysed by five successive freeze and thaw cycles. DNA was digested by adding DNaseI (100 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (10 mm). In order to solubilize the membranes, Triton X-100 (1%) was added, and the sample was vigorously shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. The insoluble material was eliminated by carrying out a 15-min centrifugation at 105,000 × g. To immunoprecipitate TolBep and other putative associated proteins, Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) coupled to mAb 1C11 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) were added to this extract (10 μl for 2 units A600). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100 and twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, the immunoprecipitate was dissociated from the coupled beads by adding 16 μl of sample buffer (with no reducing agent) per 10 μl of beads and by heating 5 min at 95 °C. Obtaining the AS1 Antiserum, Directed against the Material Immunoprecipitated with the mAb 1C11—To raise an antiserum against the material immunoprecipitated by mAb 1C11, 500 units A600 of HB101 pFAI were treated as described above. After being incubated with the Affi-Gel-coupled beads, the immunoprecipitate was divided into two preparations, both of which were used to immunize a rabbit. The first preparation consisted of half of the beads, which were directly injected to the rabbit after five phosphate-buffered saline washes. The other half of the beads was washed as described in the previous section. The immunoprecipitated material was then dissociated from these beads by adding 500 μl of 200 mm Tris, pH 8.8, containing 5 mm EDTA and 5% SDS and by heating 5 min at 95 °C. This material constituted the second preparation. The rabbit was given four injections of each of the two preparations. In the first injection, the preparations were mixed with Freund’s complete adjuvant and were injected subcutaneously, whereas in the second injection (21 days after the first injection), they were mixed with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant before being injected intramuscularly. The two last injections were carried out 31 and 32 days after the first injection with no adjuvant, the one subcutaneously and the other intravenously. The rabbit was killed 40 days after the first injection. Specific Radiolabeling of TolB and PAL and Immunoprecipitation with the AS1 Antiserum—TolB and PAL proteins were specifically labeled in JC7752 pGPl-2 cells harboring either pMUIII or pBP, as described previously (29Tabor S. Richardson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [35S]methionine was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%). The pellet obtained after a 30-min incubation at 4 °C and a 15-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g was resuspended in TES (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS). After boiling for 10 min, TNET (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) was added (15:1). The soluble material obtained after a 15-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g was then immunoprecipitated overnight with Affi-Gel 10 beads coupled to the antibodies of the AS1 antiserum. To purify the antibodies, the AS1 antiserum was brought to 0.5 ammonium sulfate saturation. The pellet obtained after centrifuging for 20 min at 27,000 × g was resuspended in the same volume of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 35 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. Pure IgGs were obtained by passing the preparation through a DEAE-Trisacryl column (IBF) on which they were not adsorbed. The immunoprecipitates obtained were dissociated from the beads with sample buffer containing no reducing agent and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Adsorption of the AS1 Antiserum against TolB and PAL Proteins—Extracts of JC3417 and JC7752 pMUIII cells were prepared as described previously in the case of HB101 pFAI cells. The cell pellets corresponding to 300 units A600 were resuspended in 2.7 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA. 300 μl of AS1 antiserum was incubated overnight at 4 °C with these cell extracts. After 2 h of centrifugation at 125,000 × g, the supernatant was collected. The AS2 antiserum was adsorbed against PAL (JC3417 cells), and the AS3 antiserum was adsorbed against TolB (JC7752 pMUIII cells). In Vivo Cross-linking with Formaldehyde—Cells were grown to 1 unit A600/ml and pelleted by centrifugation. They were washed once with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and resuspended at 0.5 unit A600/ml in the same buffer, to which formaldehyde was added at a final concentration of 1% (w/w) as described previously by Prossnitz et al. (37Prossnitz E. Nikaido K. Ulbrich S.J. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Skare et al. (22Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were incubated for the times indicated at room temperature, and the cells were then pelleted again, washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and solubilized in sample buffer. Benzon nuclease (Merck) was added (1 unit/0.8 unit A600) to eliminate DNA from the samples. Before loading on SDS-PAGE, the samples were either heated for 10 min at 37 °C to maintain the formaldehyde cross-links or heated for 20 min at 95 °C to destroy them. In each experiment, control samples were subjected to the same treatment except for the addition of formaldehyde. 0.4 unit A600 of cells were loaded per lane. Using a Tagged TolB Protein to Perform Immunoprecipitations under Native Conditions—In a previous study, the TolB protein was tagged by inserting in its C-terminal region an epitope recognized by the 1C11 monoclonal antibody (mAb 1C11) (27Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This epitope, consisting of 14 amino acids, does not alter the function of TolB but makes its immunodetection possible as described previously in the case of other proteins (38Géli V. Lloubès R. Zaat S.A.J. van Spaendonk R.M.L. Rollin C. Bénédetti H. Lazdunski C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 109: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After the tagging, the protein could furthermore be immunoprecipitated by mAb 1C11. We performed this immunoprecipitation after solubilizing the extracts of cells producing TolBep (HB101 pFAI) in 1% Triton X-100. Since Triton X-100 is a mild and nonionic detergent, we called these immunoprecipitation conditions, “native conditions.” We expected these conditions to preserve the putative associations of TolBep with other proteins and therefore to result in the co-immunoprecipitation of TolBep and its associated protein with the mAb 1C11. The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by Western blotting with the polyclonal anti-TolA antibodies. No TolA was detected in the immunoprecipitate of HB101 pFAI cells producing TolBep (data not shown). No antibodies against TolQ and TolR proteins are available. In order to determine whether these two proteins were immunoprecipitated with TolBep, HB101 cells expressing TolBep protein and otherwise (HB101 pFAI and HB101 pMUI, respectively) were therefore labeled with [35S]methionine before their extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb 1C11. The analysis of the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography did not show the presence of any proteins migrating at the Mr of TolQ and TolR. A 20-kDa protein was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TolBep, however (Fig. 1). The material obtained after immunoprecipitation by mAb 1C11 of HB101 pFAI cell extracts was used both with and without a denaturing treatment to immunize a rabbit in order to develop polyclonal antisera (AS1) directed against native and denatured conformations of TolB. The Antiserum Directed against the Material Immunoprecipitated by mAb 1C11 Recognizes TolB and PAL Proteins—When tested by Western blotting on wild-type 1292 cell extracts, the AS1 antiserum was found to strongly recognize two proteins with an apparent Mr of 43,000 and 20,000 (Fig. 2). In the JC3417 tolB mutant strain, the 43-kDa band disappeared (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the AS1 antiserum recognizes the same band as that recognized by mAb 1C11 in JC3417 pFAI cells, which corresponds to TolBep (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the 43-kDa protein was indeed the TolB protein. The JC7752 strain is derived from 1292 and has been deleted from the DNA fragment encoding the 69 C-terminal amino acids of TolB, the pal promoter region, and the DNA region encoding the 147 N-terminal amino acids of PAL. 2J. C. Lazzaroni, personal communication. It might therefore be expected to produce a TolB truncated protein of 361 amino acids instead of 430 amino acids (i.e. a 37-kDa protein) and no PAL protein. As shown in Fig. 2, the AS1 antiserum detected a very faint band at 37 kDa and no 20-kDa protein in these cell extracts. This result indicates that the TolB truncated protein might be either unstable or poorly recognized by AS1. Furthermore, the 20-kDa protein might correspond to PAL. In order to check this possibility, the pal gene was introduced downstream of the tolB gene in the pMUIII plasmid which has a T7 ϕ10 related promoter inserted upstream of tolB (Isnard et al., 1994). JC7752 cells harboring the resulting plasmid (pBP) or pMUIII were transformed by pGP1–2 in order to produce the T7 RNA polymerase and make it possible to perform specific radiolabeling of TolB and PAL proteins (29Tabor S. Richardson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 3, TolB is the only labeled protein in JC7752 pGPl-2 pMUIII cells, and TolB and PAL are the only labeled proteins in JC7752 pGPl-2 pBP cells. Since TolB and PAL are overproduced, they show up as double bands, corresponding to their mature and precursor forms (data not shown). TolB and PAL, the two labeled proteins in JC7752 pGPl-2 pBP cells, were immunoprecipitated by the AS1 antiserum under denaturing conditions (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that the 20-kDa protein recognized by the AS1 antiserum was indeed the PAL protein. The PAL Protein Is Co-immunoprecipitated with the Tagged TolB Protein by the mAb 1C11—Concentrated extracts of tolB– cells (JC3417) were added to the AS1 antiserum in order to block the binding of the antibodies to PAL protein. Although the resulting antiserum (AS2) still strongly recognized TolB, there was no further evidence of its binding to PAL (Fig. 4). Conversely, when the antiserum was adsorbed against TolB by adding concentrated extracts of cells expressing TolB but not PAL (JC7752 pMUIII), the resulting antiserum (AS3) recognized only the PAL protein (Fig. 4). Adding the AS1 antiserum to a saturating amount of TolB or PAL proteins therefore made it possible to obtain two separate antisera directed specifically against PAL and TolB proteins. This result indicates that TolB and PAL proteins do not have a common antigen which might be recognized by the same antibodies, but that the original AS1 antiserum comprises at least two groups of antibodies specifically directed against TolB and PAL proteins. This suggests that the material used for the immunization procedure, i.e. the mAb 1C11 immunoprecipitate of HB101 pFAI cell extracts, contained both proteins and that the 20-kDa labeled protein detected in the 1C11 immunoprecipitate of labeled HB101 pFAI cell extracts might correspond to PAL. To test this hypothesis, the mAb 1C11 immunoprecipitate of HB101 pFAI and HB101 cell extracts was analyzed by Western blotting by using the AS1 antiserum (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, PAL was immunoprecipitated with the mAb 1C11 as long as the cell extracts contained the tagged TolB (TolBep). Furthermore, the 20-kDa labeled protein obtained after immunoprecipitating HB101 pFAI cell extracts in native conditions was no longer detected in the immunoprecipitate of pal mutant cell extracts containing TolBep (JC7752 pFAI) (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that PAL is co-immunoprecipitated with TolBep by the mAb 1C11. TolB Can Be Cross-linked in Vivo with PAL—In an additional attempt to identify the proteins with which TolB associates, in vivo cross-linking experiments with formaldehyde were carried out. Wild-type cells (1292) were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. TolB was detected by performing Western blotting with the AS2 antiserum directed against TolB (Fig. 6). In addition to the band corresponding to the normal molecular weight of TolB (43,000), two other very close bands with an apparent Mr of 65,000 were observed. These bands were not present when the cells were not incubated with the cross-linking agent and disappeared when the cross-links were destroyed upon boiling (Fig. 6). The 65-kDa bands, therefore, appear to be specific cross-linked products in which TolB is associated, via a methyl group, with one or more proteins with a total Mr of 22,000. TolQ, -R, and -A proteins or colicin receptors at the cell surface are liable to interact with TolB. We have demonstrated above that TolB and PAL can be co-immunoprecipitated and therefore somehow interact. These proteins are therefore candidates for being cross-linked with TolB in vivo. The Mr values of TolQ (25,500), TolR (15,500), and PAL (20,000) are compatible with their possible participation in the 65-kDa complexes. To test this hypothesis, cells lacking the PAL protein and harboring the pMUIII plasmid, and thus able to produce a full-length TolB protein (JC7752 pMUIII), were treated with 1% formaldehyde and analyzed by performing Western blotting with the antibodies directed against TolB (AS2) (Fig. 7). No 65-kDa cross-linked products were detected in these cells. When the pal gene was inserted into the pMUIII plasmid (giving the pBP plasmid), thus making it possible for the JC7752 pBP cells to produce the PAL protein, the 65-kDa bands reappeared (Fig. 7). These data clearly indicate that PAL is involved in the formation of the 65-kDa complexes. Since we demonstrated above that PAL and TolB are associated, it is likely that PAL may participate directly in the 65-kDa complexes. To confirm this hypothesis, extracts of JC7752 pBP cells treated with formaldehyde were probed with the AS3 antiserum directed against PAL (Fig. 7). The 65-kDa bands revealed by these antibodies showed that PAL was present in both complexes. PAL Plays a Role in the Association of TolB with the Membrane—Isnard et al. (27Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that a small amount of TolB might be peripherally associated with the cell membranes. Since PAL is localized in the outer membrane, and since TolB and PAL interact, it is tempting to conclude that a fraction of TolB may be membrane-associated via PAL. To test this hypothesis, the localization of TolB was examined in cells producing (JC7752 pBP) or not producing (JC7752 pMUIII) the PAL protein. Cells were fractionated and the resulting fractions were analyzed by performing Western blotting with the AS1 antiserum. Control tests were carried out using other antisera di"
https://openalex.org/W2088405534,"Advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) arise from glucose-derived Amadori products and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. We recently reported the presence of an AGE-modified form of low density lipoprotein (LDL) that circulates in high amounts in patients with diabetes or renal insufficiency and that exhibits impaired plasma clearance kinetics. We utilized AGE-specific antibodies to identify the major sites of AGE modification within protease-digested preparations of apolipoprotein B that impair the binding of the AGE-modified form of LDL by human fibroblast LDL receptors. The predominant site of AGE immunoreactivity was found to lie within a single, 67-amino acid region located 1791 residues NH2-terminal of the putative LDL receptor binding domain. These data point to the high reactivity and specificity of this site for AGE formation and provide further evidence for important structural interactions between the LDL receptor binding domain and remote regions of the apolipoprotein B polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2019850310,"The TolA, TolB, TolQ, and TolR proteins are involved in maintaining the integrity of the Escherichia coli outer membrane and in the import of group A colicins and filamentous phage DNA. TolA, TolQ, and TolR are localized in the inner membrane while TolB is periplasmic, although a small amount of membrane-associated TolB is always found. In vivo cross-linking experiments with formaldehyde were performed in order to determine the proteins interacting with TolA. In wild-type strains, two specific complexes of 65 and 71 kDa, comprising TolA, were identified. These complexes were absent in a tolQ strain, while only the 65-kDa complex was absent in a tolR strain. When the tol strains were transformed with plasmids encoding TolR or TolQ, the specific complexes were restored. Moreover, immunoprecipitation experiments with the antiserum directed against TolA indicated that TolQ and TolR were co-immunoprecipitated with TolA after cross-linking. These data demonstrate that TolA interacts directly with TolR and TolQ. Two truncated TolA proteins devoid of either the C-terminal or the central domains of the protein were subjected to in vivo cross-linking. Since these two TolA derivatives still formed specific complexes with TolR and TolQ, we concluded that the TolA N-terminal domain interacted with these proteins. The TolA, TolB, TolQ, and TolR proteins are involved in maintaining the integrity of the Escherichia coli outer membrane and in the import of group A colicins and filamentous phage DNA.

The TolA, -B, -Q, and -R proteins are necessary for group A colicins to be transferred from their receptors in the outer membrane to their respective targets in the inner membrane or the cytoplasm. The exact physiological role of the Tol proteins is not yet clearly defined, although these proteins have been found to play a role in maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane. The tol mutants exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype; in particular, they are highly sensitive to detergents, drugs, and dyes, and they release periplasmic proteins into the extracellular medium (1Fognini-Lefebvre N.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Tol proteins have been parasitized to permit the group A colicins (colicins A, E, K, and N) and the single-stranded DNA of phages (M13, fd, and fl) (2Webster R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) to be transported through the outer membrane. The topologies of the TolA, TolQ, and TolR inner membrane proteins have been determined (3Bourdineaud J.P. Howard S.P. Lazdunski C. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TolA (421 amino acids) is a three-domain protein with an N-terminal membrane anchor (residues 14 to 34), a periplasmic central domain (230 amino acids), and a C-terminal domain involved in colicin import (8Levengood-Freyermuth S.K. Click E.M. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 222-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has been found to interact in vitro with colicins A and E1 (9Bénédetti H. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1989-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TolR (142 amino acids) has an inner membrane anchor (residues 23 to 43); it has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region and the rest of the protein protrudes into the periplasm. TolQ (230 amino acids) comprises an N-terminal periplasmic region followed by three transmembrane segments (residues 20 to 38, 136 to 156, and 175 to 191) and a C-terminal region exposed to the cytoplasm. TolB is periplasmic, although a little of it is membrane-associated (10Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Another system, composed of the TonB, ExbB, and ExbD proteins, is involved in the import of group β colicins (colicins B, D, I, and M) and of phage DNA (T1, T5, and ϕ80) (11Davies J.K. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 96-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of the TonB system is related to the active transport of chelated iron (Fe(III)) and vitamin B12 through high affinity outer membrane receptors. TonB acts as an energy transducer from the inner to the outer membrane, allowing the active transport of nutrients (12Postle K. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1993; 25: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar). According to the amino acid composition, TolQ and ExbB are 75% homologous and so are TolR and ExbD (13Eick-Helmerich K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5117-5127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only 12 residues located in the N-terminal membrane anchors of TonB and TolA proteins are homologous (14Karlsson M. Hannavy K. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the topologies of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD have been found to be very similar to those of TolA, TolQ, and TolR, respectively (15Roof S.K. Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5554-5557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5485-5487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 6050-6057Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Both TolR and TolQ, as well as ExbB and ExbD, cross-complement either exbB/exbD or tolQ/tolR double mutants (18Braun V. Hermann C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Membrane fractionation analyses showed that the Tol proteins are preferentially located at the contact sites between inner and outer membranes and that their relative amounts at these sites increase after colicin A has been translocated. This suggested that TolA, -B, -Q, and -R formed a complex with a given stoichiometry (19Guihard G. Boulanger P. Bénédetti H. Lloubès R. Besnard M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5874-5880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The idea of a Tol protein complex also emerged from the experiments in which the TonB anchor was replaced with that of TolA: the fact that the resulting TolA-TonB polypeptide was found to function more efficiently with TolQ than with ExbB indicated that the TolA anchor interacts with TolQ within the membrane bilayer (14Karlsson M. Hannavy K. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lazzaroni et al. (20Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Popot J.L. Bénédetti H. Samatey F. Lazdunski C. Portalier R. Géli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) obtained suppressor mutations in the anchor of TolR by using a mutant in a transmembrane region of TolQ which suggested that TolQ and TolR interact through their transmembrane domains.In vivo cross-linking experiments have shown that TonB interacts directly with ExbB and with the outer membrane receptor FepA (21Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, in vivo cross-linking experiments were performed in order to obtain some information about the possible interaction between TolA and other cell envelope proteins. Cross-linked proteins were analyzed after being immunodetected with an anti-TolA antibody that we developed. We demonstrate that TolA interacts directly with TolQ and TolR and forms two specific complexes upon cross-linking with formaldehyde. In addition, the results of cross-linking analysis performed on two TolA truncated derivatives lacking the central or C-terminal domain of the protein demonstrate that TolA interacts with TolQ and TolR via its N-terminal domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—All the strains and plasmids used in the present study are described in Table I. In strain JC8031, the NcoI-HindIII tol cluster region, including the entire tolR gene and the 5′ part of tolA, were deleted. Cells were analyzed under exponential growth conditions. The conditions for T7 specific labeling were as described previously (22Tabor S. Richardson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, cells (4 × 108 cells/ml) were labeled for 5 min with 15 μCi of [35S]methionine (at 1200 Ci/mmol) and chased with 0.2% cold methionine.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrainsPlasmidsGenotypeReference1292supE, hsdS, met, gal lacY, tonAW.

Since the orf1 (the first gene of the tolQ, -R, -A, -B gene cluster) was present in almost all the constructs (except pRAB and pToIαΔn) and was not analyzed, we omitted it from the names of the plasmids.pQRAB has been described previously (under the name pMUI, Ref. 10Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it contains the entire sequence of the tol cluster (from EcoRI to AseI restriction sites), from nucleotides 1 to 4427 according to the tol nucleotide sequence (23Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Levengood S.K. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6600-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRAB was constructed by deleting the 85–681 BssHII DNA fragment of pQRAB, which contains the –10 box of the promoter of the orf1tolQRA operon, 1T. Clavel and J. C. Lazzaroni, unpublished results. the orf1 and the 5′ part of the tolQ gene. Plasmid pRAB expressed the TolA and TolB proteins and small amounts of TolR under the control of the T7 promoter. Complementation tests were carried out without the T7 expression system, with pRAB transformed into strains tolA, tolB, and tolR. Colicin A and E3 sensitivity tests indicated that pRAB was able to fully complement the tolA and tolB mutations, while the tolR mutant was partly complemented (data not shown). pQRA was obtained by inserting the EcoRI-HpaI DNA fragment into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of the MCS of pT7–5 (21Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid expressed the Orf1, TolQ, -R, and -A proteins. pQA was a mutant derivative of pQRA from which the start codon of tolR was removed. This plasmid no longer expressed TolR.The SphI 1930-NotI 2598 DNA fragment of pQRA (two sites located within tolA) was deleted to give pQRAΔh, and the following synthetic DNA fragment was inserted into these sites: 5′-CCCGGGAAAGGTGATGGAACCGGCTGGAGCTCTGAACGTGGATCCGGGCCCGAGCC-.This synthetic DNA consisted of two oligonucleotides encoding amino acids 8 to 25 of colicin A (the 8th and 25th codons are indicated in bold print) including the 1C11 monoclonal antibody epitope (25Géli V. Lloubès R. Zaat S.A.J. van Spaendonk R.M.L. Rollin C. Bénédetti H. Lazdunski C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 109: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This construct led to the deletion of the central domain of TolA (from residue 68 to 290 according to the amino acid sequence of TolA described by Levengood et al. (5Levengood S.K. Beyer W.F. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) and conserved the in-frame downstream sequence of TolA, giving the TolAI-III protein. pQRAΔc was obtained directly from pQRA by deleting the NotI 2598-ClaI DNA fragment (two unique sites, since ClaI was located in the MCS of pT7–5). The truncated TolA (291 residues instead of 431) was called TolAI-II because the whole domain III of TolA was removed. In this construct, the residue Ala-292 was changed into Arg and was followed by two stop codons.pToIAΔn was constructed from the previous pTPS306 plasmid (24Levengood S.K. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6600-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By exchanging the NcoI-SphI DNA fragment with a synthetic DNA fragment containing the T7 promoter, a RBS sequence, and an ATG codon (which are underlined in the following top strand oligonucleotide sequence, where the ATG in bold print corresponds to residue 67 of TolA): 5′-CATGCGCTATCTAGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA CTAGTTAAGAAGGAGATATAGATGCCCGGCATG-.This resulted in the synthesis of a truncated TolA protein from which domain I (N-terminal) was deleted. Cells transformed with pToIAΔn were used to purify a soluble TolAII-III protein and to obtain an anti-TolA antibody.Formaldehyde Cross-linking—Chemical formaldehyde cross-linking experiments were performed as described by Prossnitz et al. (26Prossnitz E. Nikaido K. Ulbrich S.J. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Skare et al. (21Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C in rich medium to an OD600 of 0.7 and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold 10 mm KPi, pH 6.8, and resuspended in the same buffer to an OD600 of 0.5. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/w), and the samples were incubated for various times (10 to 30 min) at room temperature (21–22 °C) without shaking. The cross-linked samples were harvested and washed with cold 10 mm KPi, pH 6.8. The pellets were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and either heated at 37 °C for 10 min to maintain the formaldehyde cross-links or at 96 °C for 20 min to break the chemical cross-links.TolAII-III Purification and Antibody Production—TolAII-III was purified from A5922 (pGP1-2 pTolαΔn) cells. Cells were grown in rich medium at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.5, and the temperature was then shifted to 42 °C for 30 min and the cells were further incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The following cytoplasmic TolAII-III extraction and purification steps were as described previously by Levengood et al. (5Levengood S.K. Beyer W.F. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised against TolAII-III by performing three injections to immunize a rabbit (200 μg of protein in phosphate-buffered saline mixed with Freund’s adjuvant) over a period of 40 days.Immunodetection—After 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Scnüll, 0.2 μm) for 2–3 h. Block, primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline/milk (5% non-fat dried milk), and revealed as described (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation was carried out as follows and analyzed using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Cells treated or not treated with formaldehyde were solubilized in TES (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS) for 10 min at 37 °C. They were then diluted 10-fold in TNET (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), further incubated with vigorous shaking, and centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g in order to remove nonsolubilized material. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-TolA purified IgG coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad). The beads were then washed three times with TNET and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In the last step, the beads were resuspended with Laemmli sample buffer without any reducing agent and heated at 96 °C for 3 min or for 20 min in order to remove the antigen or to remove the antigen and to dissociate the cross-linked proteins, respectively.RESULTSTwo Major Complexes of 65 and 71 kDa, Containing TolA, Are Specifically Immunodetected after in Vivo Cross-linking—In vivo cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde was performed in order to identify the proteins interacting with TolA. The cross-linked material was analyzed through Western blotting with an anti-TolAII-III polyclonal antibody (anti-TolA pAb) 2The abbreviations used are: pAb, polyclonal antibody; TM, transmembrane. that we developed. No signal was obtained with the anti-TolA pAb after Western blot analysis with the strain JC8031 (ΔtolRA) treated or not treated with formaldehyde (data not shown). Two major 65- and 71-kDa bands were reproducibly detected (C1 and C2 in Fig. 1) under cross-linking conditions (at 37 °C) in each of the wild-type cells we used. These complexes were obtained after a 10- to 30-min formaldehyde treatment and were destroyed by heating the samples to 96 °C for 20 min (26Prossnitz E. Nikaido K. Ulbrich S.J. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they were absent from samples not treated with formaldehyde. These cross-linked C1 and C2 TolA complexes are therefore specific. Without formaldehyde treatment, faint bands were detected at a higher Mr than TolA in 37 °C heated samples, which were not analyzed in this study. The formaldehyde-treated W3110 cells were fractionated: the two cross-linked complexes were recovered with TolA in the membrane fraction (data not shown).TolR and TolQ Are Associated with TolA in the Two Specific Complexes—The molecular masses of TolA, TolQ, and TolR were calculated and found to be 43.1, 25.5, and 15.5 kDa, respectively, and their respective migrations in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponded to 48, 24, and 17 kDa (23Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Levengood S.K. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6600-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the specific complexes of 65 and 71 kDa might correspond to TolA associated with TolR or with TolQ. In order to test this possibility, we checked whether these complexes were absent from strains tolR and tolQ.In the strain GM1, the two specific complexes were detected, while only the 71-kDa complex was observed in its tolR derivative, TPS300 (Fig. 2A). A TolR-TolA association may therefore form the 65-kDa band obtained with a wild-type strain. To check this hypothesis, the JC 8031 (ΔtolRA) strain was transformed with plasmids pQRA or pQA which encode TolQ, -R, and -A proteins or TolQ and -A proteins, respectively. The 65-kDa TolA complex was detected when TolR was produced in JC8031 (pQRA) cells, but was not restored in JC8031 (pQA) cells (Fig. 2B). This result confirms that in the same bacterial context, the production of TolR is sufficient to specify the 65-kDa complex.FIG. 2Immunoblot analysis of TolA in TPS300 and GM1 strains (A), JC8031 (pQA), and JC8031 (pQRA) strains (B), cross-linked in vivo for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde. A, about 5 × 108 cells were analyzed and the immunodetection was revealed with the ECL chemiluminescent system. B, 108 cells were analyzed and revealed with diaminobenzidine. The legend is the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In vivo cross-linking was performed on the TPS13 (tolQ) strain. In this strain, the two specific complexes were not detected (Fig. 3A). Complementation experiments were carried out with TPS13 transformed with plasmid pQRAB. After cross-linking, the C1 and C2 complexes were present in TPS13 (pQRAB) cells (Fig. 3β). One possible explanation for these results is based on the polarity of the tolQ mutation on TolR production (18Braun V. Hermann C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), since the tolQ null mutant strain expresses about 5% of TolR (measured by using a TolR-PhoA fusion). 3A. Vianney and J. C. Lazzaroni, unpublished results. We therefore concluded that the 71-kDa complex might correspond to the association of TolQ with TolA and, as mentioned above, that the 65-kDa complex might correspond to the association of TolR with TolA. TPS13 (pRAB) cells were analyzed, and the results of cross-linking experiments were the same as those obtained with TPS13 cells (Fig. 3β). TolA was poorly expressed in TPS13 as compared with GM1 (Fig. 3A), which might be due to polar effects of the tolQ mutation on TolA production, or to some instability of TolA in the absence of TolQ. Therefore, samples of TPS13 and TPS13 (pRAB) cells were overloaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as compared with the amount of TPS13 (pQRAB) (Fig. 3B) in order to ensure the absence of the complex.FIG. 3Immunoblot analysis of TolA in strains TPS13 and GM1 (A), TPS13 (pQRAB), and TPS13 (pRAB) strains (B), cross-linked in vivo for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde. A, about 5 × 108 cells were analyzed, and immunodetection was carried out using the ECL chemiluminescent system. B, 5 × 108 TPS13, TPS13 (pRAB), and 2.5 × 107 TPS13 (pQRAB) cells were analyzed and immunodetected with diaminobenzidine. The legend is the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the other hand, we observed that plasmids pQRA and pQRAB complemented the tol phenotype of the JC8031 and TPS13 cells, while, as expected, the JC8031 and TPS13 cells transformed with plasmids pQA and pRAB, respectively, remained tolerant (since tolR and tolQ were not complemented, respectively). In parallel, we analyzed the effect of overproducing the TolQ, -R, and -A proteins in the 1292 strain treated with formaldehyde. An approximately 10-fold increase in TolA and in the C1 and C2 specific complexes was detected in the 1292 (pQRA) as compared with the 1292 cells (Fig. 4). These results provide further evidence that TolA and TolR on the one hand, and TolA and TolQ on the other hand, interact. With 1292 pQRAB cells, the conclusions were the same and, moreover, indicated that overexpressing TolB protein does not result in the detection of a TolA-TolB complex (data not shown).FIG. 4Immunoblot analysis of TolA in 1292 and 1292 (pQRA) cells cross-linked in vivo for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde. About 5 × 108 cells were analyzed.

Because anti-TolQ and anti-TolR antibodies are unavailable, and since it was not possible to sequence the complexed proteins directly, which had their N-terminal residues blocked with formaldehyde, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with anti-TolA pAb after in vivo cross-linking with formaldehyde (Fig. 5). For this purpose, TPS13 (pQRAB) and TPS13 (pRAB) cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine during the exponential growth phase and were treated with formaldehyde. The cells were solubilized at 37 °C in TES and subjected to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were incubated in sample buffer under two conditions: warmed up for either 20 min (at 96 °C) in order to destroy the cross-links between proteins or for 3 min (at 96 °C) to dissociate the antigens from the anti-TolA IgG (this incubation time is too short to destroy all the cross-links). In control experiments, immunoprecipitating TPS13 (pQRAB) cells untreated with formaldehyde yielded two major and several faint bands. The higher band was assigned to TolA (Fig. 5). According to Western blot immunodetections, one of the faint bands corresponded to a degradation product of TolA (clearly visible in lane C20 below TolA), while a major band migrating like TolB was not immunodetected with the anti-TolB antibody (data not shown). Immunoprecipitated samples of TPS13 (pQRAB) cells treated with formaldehyde specifically gave two proteins migrating like TolQ and TolR (Fig. 5) when the cross-linking was destroyed by 20 min of boiling. T7 specific labeling of GM1 cells harboring pGP1-2 and pQRAB or pGP1-2 and pRAB was carried out in order to identify the positions of TolQ and TolR. In similar experiments with TPS13 (pRAB) cells, no labeled protein was detected at the position corresponding to TolQ and TolR. TolQ and TolR were therefore specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TolA after the in vivo cross-linking treatment.FIG. 5Immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-TolA pAb of TPS13 (pQRAB) and TPS13 (pRAB) radiolabeled cells treated or not treated with formaldehyde and further solubilized at 37 °C in TES. The equivalent of 5 × 108 cells was immunoprecipitated in each lane. T7 pRAB and T7 pQRAB correspond to the T7 in vivo specific labeling used to give the positions of the corresponding TolA, TolB precursor (pre-TolB), TolB, TolQ, and TolR. Immunoprecipitates from formaldehyde-treated (F) or untreated (C) cells were heated for 3 and 20 min in sample buffer (indicated as F3, F20, C3, and C20).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal Domain of TolA Interacts with TolQ and TolR—Two deletions within the tolA gene were constructed in the pQRA plasmid and analyzed in order to map the domain of TolA interacting with TolQ and TolR. The plasmids called pQRAΔh and pQRAΔc produced TolAI-III and TolAI-II, respectively, along with TolQ and TolR. After plasmid transformations in JC8031 cells, the accessibilities of the TolA derivatives to periplasmic proteases were analyzed by performing trypsin digestion experiments on permeabilized cells (8Levengood-Freyermuth S.K. Click E.M. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 222-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TolA, TolAI-III, and TolAI-II from JC8031 cells containing pQRA, pQRAΔh, and pQRAΔc, respectively, were digested like the entire TolA from the wild-type 1292 strain (not shown). This result indicates that the TolA derivatives display a normal membrane insertion. The phenotype of JC8031 strain transformed with pQRAΔh, pQRAΔc, and pQRA plasmids was analyzed (Table II). As expected, the two TolA derivatives did not complement the leaky and bile salt-sensitive phenotypes of JC8031. Cells producing TolAI-II were tolerant toward group A colicins, but colicin sensitivity was restored in cells producing TolAI-III with a roughly 10-fold lower efficiency as compared to that of the 1292 parent strain (Table II).Table IIComplementation tests of the JC8031 strain transformed by pQRA, pQRAΔh, and pQRAΔc plasmidsJC8031JC8031 pQRAJC8031 pQRAΔhJC8031 pQRAΔc1292colAR43R4colE3R54K5RNaseI+−++−DOC−+−−− Open table in a new tab JC8031 cells harboring pQRAΔh, pQRAΔc, and pQRA were treated with the anti-TolA pAb after in vivo cross-linking (Fig. 6).

The purified kinase displays similar specific enzyme activity and similar phosphorylation site specificity as the neuronal Cdc2-like kinase purified from bovine brain. Bovine brain extract contains Cdk5 uncomplexed with p35 or p25 which has also been found to be activated by p21 or p25. The results substantiate the previous suggestion that p35 is a specific Cdk5 activator. Several observations suggest that, unlike other well characterized Cdc2-like kinases whose activities depend on the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunits at a specific site by a distinct kinase, the reconstituted Cdk5/p21 does not depend on the phosphorylation of Cdk5 for activity. The reconstitution of the highly active Cdk5 kinase was achieved without requiring any other kinase in the reconstitution reaction. The possibility of autophosphorylation of Cdk5 on the putative activation site has been ruled out as no phosphorylation occurred on Cdk5 during the enzyme reaction.

Several Cdc2 family members with molecular masses in a range of 33 kDa to 35 kDa have been suggested to depend on cyclin for activity and designated as cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdks; individual members of this group are distinguished by numbers, such as Cdk1 (Cdc2), Cdk2 etc. (21Soloman M.J.

Members of the cyclin family, on the other hand, are categorized into subfamilies by letters as, cyclin A, cyclin B etc. A large number of active protein kinases may be derived from heterologous interaction between members of the two protein families. Cell cycle progression of animal cells appears to be coordinated by the concerted action of many of these kinases. In addition to depending on cyclin for activity, Cdc2 and Cdk2 are regulated by complex phosphorylation mechanisms involving a network of protein kinases and phosphatases (21Soloman M.J. Glotzer M.

The phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue, Thr161/Thr160, by a distinct kinase, Cdk activating kinase, is essential for, or markedly enhances, the activity of the Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase (30Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Solomon M.J. Lee T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol.

On the other hand, phosphorylation of a threonine, Thr14 or a tyrosine, Tyr15, in the amino-terminal region results in inactivation of the Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase (25Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 26Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 29Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A protein kinase catalyzing the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation has been identified and shown to be related to the yeast wee1 gene product (37Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 38Featherstone C. Russell P. Nature. 1991; 349: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Parker L.L.

Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase on Thr14 has not been identified. Since the regulatory phosphorylation sites are mostly conserved, or conservatively substituted among Cdc2 family members, it seems possible that some other Cdc2-like kinases are also regulated by similar phosphorylation mechanisms. For example, a recent study has shown that the activation of Cdk4 by cyclin D is also dependent on an activating kinase (41Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 42Matsuoka M. Kato J.-Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Not all Cdc2-like kinases are cell cycle regulators. Many Cdc2-related proteins are present in tissues where proliferative activity is very low (19Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.-L. Su L.-K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 43Draetta G. Beach D. Moran E. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 553-557PubMed Google Scholar, 44Okuda T. Cleveland J.L. Downing J.R.

Neurons of mammalian central nervous system contain a Cdc2-like kinase, called neuronal Cdc2-like kinase, which has been implicated in the regulation of neurocytoskeleton dynamics (45Hellmich M.R.

Purified active neuronal Cdc2-like kinase is a heterodimer of Cdk5 and a 25-kDa regulatory protein (48Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have revealed that the 25-kDa protein is derived from a novel 35-kDa protein, p35 (51Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The mRNA transcript of p35 has been shown to be specifically expressed in the central nervous system. The primary structure of p35 shows only limited homology to members of the cyclin family; yet, the protein appears to perform a cyclin-like role in neuronal Cdc2-like kinase. A bacteria-expressed, truncated form of p35 has been found to activate a bacteria-expressed Cdk5. In the present study, we demonstrate the activation of Cdk5 by a number of bacterially expressed, truncated forms of p35, including one corresponding to the 25-kDa subunit of neuronal Cdc2-like kinase purified from bovine brain, and carry out detailed characterization of the kinase activation reaction. The study has revealed a major difference between the mechanism of Cdk5 activation and that of Cdc2 or Cdk2 activation. Although the amino acid sequence of Cdk5 contains a phosphorylatable residue, serine, at the position corresponding to the positive regulatory threonine of Cdc2 or Cdk2, the activation of Cdk5 does not appear to be dependent on the presence of a Cdk activating kinase. The active form of the kinase does not catalyze autophosphorylation of Cdk5, thus ruling out the possibility that the specific serine residue is phosphorylated by an autocatalytic reaction. Four sets of polymerase chain reaction primers were designed according to the full sequence of neuronal regulatory subunit described previously (51Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) for plasmid constructions to express the full-length or truncated forms of the neuronal regulatory subunit (Fig. 1). Primer 1, 5’-CCCGGGGATCCATGGGCACGGTGCTG-3’, and primer 3, 5’-CCCGGGAATTCTCACCGGTCCAGCCC-3’, are for the full-length protein of 307 amino acids, p35. Primer 2, 5’-CCGGGGATCCGCCCAGCCCCCGCCGG-3’, and primer 3 are for the 25-kDa protein (p25) found in the purified neuronal Cdc2-like kinase. Primer 4, 5’-CCCGGGGATCCAAGTCGCTGTCGTGC-3’, and primer 6, 5’-CCCGGGAATTCTAGTTCTTCAGGTCGGAGA-3’, are for the 23-kDa truncated form (p23) of p35, which encodes amino acids 88-291. Primer 5, 5’-CCCGGATCCTGTCCCCCTGCCAGC-3’, and primer 6 are for the 21-kDa fragment (p21) of p35, which encodes amino acids 108-291. These expressed fragments as well as the 35-kDa full-length sequence are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned in pGEX-2T vector at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The recombinant pGEX plasmid constructs, encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST, 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. ) 26 kDa) fusion proteins, GST-p21, GST-p23, GST-p25, GST-Cdk5, and GST-cyclin D1, were individually expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The host cells were cultured in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 of 0.5-0.8 at 37°C. The synthesis of GST recombinant protein was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) for a subsequent incubation of 2-3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The cell pellets were washed with PBS and pelleted again for subsequent purification of the recombinant proteins. glutathione S-transferase dithiothreitol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fast protein liquid chromatography. Purification of the GST fusion proteins was carried out essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (52Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 2 mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. All procedures for the purification were carried out at 0-5°C. The cells were lysed using a French press at 1000 p.s.i. and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied onto a 2-ml column of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) which had been equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA and DTT, and the mixture of protease inhibitors described above. The column was sealed and allowed to sit on an end-over-end shaker for 1 h. After loading, the column was washed with 20 bed volumes of the same buffer, followed by 5 bed volumes of PBS supplemented with 1 mM DTT. The GST fusion protein was eluted by 5 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM DTT. To remove glutathione, the pooled samples were dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and DTT and then concentrated to a small volume by dialysis against Aquacide II (Calbiochem). His6-tagged cyclin A was expressed and purified as described by Poon et al. (33Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed by passing through a French Press in the lysis buffer without lysozyme. For further purification of GST-p21 to remove most of the proteolyzed products, the concentrated GST-p21 was clarified by centrifugation and loaded on an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (Prep grade, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in PBS with 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the 45-kDa polypeptide of GST-p21, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and then concentrated by dialysis against Aquacide II to a small volume. 2 mg of GST-Cdk5 affinity-purified by a glutathione-agarose column was mixed with 4 mg of GST-p21 purified from a glutathione-affinity column and gel filtration in a volume of 5 ml in PBS buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. The mixture was allowed to sit at 30°C for 1 h for reconstitution and subsequently treated with human thrombin (Sigma) in a concentration of 10 units of thrombin per mg of recombinant protein at room temperature for 1 h to cut out the GST fusion part. The GST-free complex of Cdk5 and p21 was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine at 4°C for 2 h. The dialyzed sample was clarified by centrifugation and then loaded on an FPLC Mono S column (HR5/5, Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of the same buffer, and the bound kinase activity was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.3 M/10 ml). Protein kinase activity was monitored by phosphorylation assay of the histone peptide. The bovine brain extract in Buffer A (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.6 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant containing 40 mg of protein was injected at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min into an FPLC Mono S column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a salt gradient (0-0.5 M NaCl) in 30 ml of Buffer A. The fractions containing Cdk5 monomer were identified by immunoblots with the Cdk5 and p25 antibodies. The pooled sample was concentrated by Amicon Centricon-10 concentrator and then applied to an FPLC Superose 12 column (HR 10/30, Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer A supplemented with 0.15 M NaCl at 0.5 ml/min. This column was calibrated in the same condition using a Bio-Rad calibration kit (bovine thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; bovine γ-globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; horse myoglobin, 17 kDa; vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa). Immunoblotting and reconstitution assay with GST-p21 or GST-p25 were performed with the column fractions. The protein kinase activity and substrate specificity were determined according to the procedure described previously (48Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was performed at 30°C, and the reaction mixture contained 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (~300 dpm/pmol), peptide substrate as indicated, and the protein kinase sample. When assay of purified kinase was performed, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was included in the reaction mixture for enzyme stability. Phosphate incorporation into substrate peptide was quantitated by liquid scintillation using a scintillation counter (Beckman LKB 1215). Protein concentration was measured either by absorbance at A280 or by the method of Bradford (54Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The Bradford assay was performed in an alternate way. The samples were mixed with Bradford reagent in a microtiter plate and read at A570 using a Dynatec MR 600 microtiter plate reader. The amount of pure enzyme in the purified sample was estimated by scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using a Pharmacia LKB 2202 Ultrascan laser densitometer. The stained protein bands were compared with carbonic anhydrase as the protein standard. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 10% vertical slab gels, and gels were stained with silver (56Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V. Hankcock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar) or 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For immunoblot, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and immunostained with the indicated antibodies. Antibodies against Cdk5 and the p35 derivatives were rabbit polyclonal antibody preparations raised against the bacteria-expressed Cdk5 and 21-kDa fragment of p35, respectively. The expression of GST-fused Cdk5 and p35, as well as p25, p23, and p21 truncated forms of p35 (Fig. 1) were attempted in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The bacteria lysates were centrifuged to separate into a soluble and a particulate fraction, and expression of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. The expression of the full-length p35 fusion protein was not successful; essentially no fusion protein was detectable in the bacteria lysate (data not shown). Most of the expressed truncated forms of p35 were found in the insoluble fraction. In all cases, the soluble recombinant proteins appeared to have undergone considerable proteolytic degradation. Lowering the induction temperature from 37°C to room temperature or decreasing the protein induction time to 1 h did not significantly affect the extent of the protein degradation. Attempts to express the full-length p35 using a different vector, PQE30 (QIAGEN), was also unsuccessful. The expressed proteins were purified from the soluble fractions of bacteria lysates by glutathione affinity column chromatography. As shown previously (51Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), the expressed Cdk5 fusion protein did not exhibit any kinase activity by itself, nor did any of the p35-related fusion proteins. Protein kinase activity, however, could be readily detected upon mixing Cdk5 with the fusion proteins of the truncated forms of p35, and the fusion proteins of p21, p23, and p25 showed similar activity in Cdk5 activation (Fig. 2 A). To achieve maximal activation, the mass ratio of activating proteins to Cdk5 of 8:1 was used in these experiments, and the protein mixtures were preincubated for 30 min before kinase assay. Dose-dependent activation of Cdk5 by p21 indicated that close to maximal activation could be approached at a mass ratio of Cdk5/p21 of 1:1.5 (Fig. 2 B). The optimal activation of Cdk5 by the truncated forms of p35 also requires preincubation of the proteins. For example, the time course of the kinase reaction of a mixture of Cdk5 and p21 displays low kinase activity and pronounced upward curvature indicative of a slow activation of the kinase during the reaction. If the two proteins have been incubated for 1 h before the kinase reaction is initiated, a linear initial time course with greatly increased kinase activity will result (Fig. 2 C). Since our attempts in bacteria expression of the full-length p35 had not been successful, a similar reconstitution experiment with the full-length protein was not possible. p25 corresponds to the 25-kDa subunit of the purified bovine brain neuronal Cdc2-like kinase which exhibits specific kinase activities similar to or higher than those of the fully activated Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases.

First, we show that in stably transfected CHO cells expressing ETA, binding of an ET-1 ligand induces rapid endocytosis of cell surface ETA. Receptor endocytosis was measured both by immunofluorescence and by radioiodinated antibodies specific for ETA. Second, we demonstrate that ET-1 remains intact for up to 2 h after endocytosis and, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation, internalized 125I-ET-1 remains bound to ETA receptors. We hypothesize that internalized ET-1, bound to ETA receptors, continues to activate a signal-transducing G protein, thus accounting for the prolonged period of contraction induced in smooth muscle cells by a single administration of ET-1.

In response to norepinephrine, cAMP production by plasma membranes from four clonal cell lines was stimulated to levels comparable with brown adipocytes isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (72.8-89.6 versus 97.8 pmol cAMP/min/mg of protein, respectively). All cell lines responded to the highly selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 by stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity (3-10-fold over basal). β1-, β2-, and β3-adrenergic receptor mRNA was detected by Northern blotting and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Competition binding assays with the antagonists CGP20712A and 125I-cyanopindolol showed the proportions of β1AR and β2AR in immortalized cells to be similar to brown adipocytes from tissue (cells: 35%β1AR, 65%β2AR; brown adipocytes from tissue: β1AR 41%, 59%β2AR). Expression of brown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Ucp) was stimulated by β-adrenergic agonists in two of the four cell lines. The ability of individual βAR subtypes to regulate Ucp expression was examined with combinations of selective β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Expression of Ucp could be induced by any of the β-adrenergic receptor subtypes. However, the greatest response was obtained by stimulating all three β-adrenergic receptor subtypes simultaneously (100 μM isoproterenol). Incubation of membranes from cultured cells or brown adipocytes from tissue with CL316,243 at an optimal concentration (5 μM) did not prevent norepinephrine from further stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity, suggesting that the combined activation of β1AR/β2AR, plus β3AR, together produced an additive cAMP response. Multiple forms of adenylyl cyclase were identified in brown and white adipocyte cell lines and tissues. Northern blot analysis detected adenylyl cyclase types 5, 6, and 10. Screening of reverse transcriptase-PCR products by DNA sequencing confirmed the identities of these forms and lower levels of additional isoforms, raising the possibility that β-adrenergic receptor subtypes in adipocytes couple to distinct adenylyl cyclases. Because these cell lines display functional and phenotypic similarities to interscapular brown adipocytes, they will be a useful model to study the regulation of β-adrenergic receptor expression and function, and the control of Ucp expression and activity.

The blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus has a heme-binding protein (RHBP) in its hemolymph (Oliveira, P. L., Kawooya, J. K, Ribeiro, J. M. C., Meyer, T., Poorman, R., Alves, E. W., Walker, F., Padovan, G. J., and Masuda, H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10897-10901. Here we show that this protein inhibits heme-dependent peroxidation of both linolenic acid liposomes and lipophorin, the main lipoprotein of insect hemolymph. The oxidized lipophorin is functionally impaired, being defective both in its capacity to be loaded with phospholipids from the fat body as well as in its ability to deliver phospholipids to the growing oocytes. RHBP prevents the heme-induced oxidative damage to lipophorin. It is proposed that in vivo RHBP binds the heme derived from digestion of blood hemoglobin, suppressing the generation of activated oxygen species and protecting the insect against oxidative stress throughout the feeding cycle."

Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford, 1976Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (210775) Google Scholar. For one-dimensional analysis, recombinant, neutrophil, and brain proteins were prepared in sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.14 Mβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 2-3 min before being separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. For two-dimensional analysis, proteins were mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (9.5 M urea, 10 mM lysine, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 2% Nonidet P-40 containing 4% ampholines, pH 5-7, and 1% ampholines, pH 3.5-10) and separated on tube gels containing the same ampholines by electrophoresis overnight at 300 V and then for 1 h at 1000 V. Tube gels were then equilibrated in sample buffer for 1 h and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. One- and two-dimensional gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotter in transfer buffer (4.8 mM Tris, 3.9 mM glycine, and 0.375% SDS). For dot blotting, proteins (5-20 μl) were applied directly on 1-2-cm2 nitrocellulose filters. After protein transfer, filters were incubated in renaturation buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) for 2 h. p21 probes were prepared by incubating Cdc42Hs and Rac1 (1μg) with 1 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (DuPont NEN; 6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 1.6 M) or 2 μl of [α-32P]GTP (DuPont NEN; 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 0.8 M) in 50 μl of exchange buffer (50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.25 mM EDTA, 1.25 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mM DTT) for 10 min at room temperature. [α-32P]GDP probes were generated by loading with [α-32P]GTP and allowing the p21-GTP complex to hydrolyze the γ-phosphate group for 60-90 min at room temperature. Probes were used immediately on preparation by diluting into Petri dishes containing 4 ml of binding buffer (50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mM DTT, 0.5 mM GTP). Filters were incubated with p21 probes for 5 min at room temperature before being washed six times for 5 min each in wash buffer (50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Mes, pH 6.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100) on ice. After washing, the filters were quickly dried by placing on Whatman 3MM paper and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 5-25 h. Quantitative p21 binding analysis was carried out by cutting out 1 cm2 of nitrocellulose and determining the amount of radioactivity by scintillation counting. p68 protein purified as described below (100 ng) was incubated for 10 min with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp., 5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) in kinase buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 × sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Samples were then loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresed for 50 min at 180 V or until the dye front containing free label was run off the bottom of the gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 10 min. p68 protein was purified in five steps using the Cdc42Hs binding assay described above. (i) Neutrophil cytosol (280 ml, containing 20 mg/ml protein) was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mM Pipes, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0) containing 6% sucrose and protease inhibitors (1 mM pepstatin and 100 μM Nα- p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1-1 M) in the above buffer, and 10-ml fractions were collected. Binding protein eluted at between 0.2-0.3 M NaCl. Six fractions were pooled and diluted 3-fold in ice-cold water. (ii) The above pool (180 ml) was applied to a heparin-agarose column, equilibrated as above, and proteins eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1-1 M) in the same buffer. Binding protein eluted between 0.3 and 0.4 M NaCl. Five fractions of 5 ml were pooled, and the volume was reduced to 5 ml using polyethylene glycol by dialysis for 3 h at 4°C. (iii) After filtration to clear the protein sample, it was loaded onto a Superose 12-gel filtration column (Pharmacia), equilibrated as before, and 1.3-ml fractions were collected in the above buffer. (iv) A 1-ml chelating Sepharose column was prepared by applying 10 column volumes of 100 mM ZnCl2; the protein sample was applied, the column was washed in buffer Z (100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and elution was carried out in buffer Z containing 25 mM Mes, pH 6.0. (v) Protein was loaded onto a Cdc42Hs-G12V-GTP glutathione-Sepharose affinity column in the presence of 1 mM GTP. For these experiments, Cdc42Hs was not cleaved with thrombin, leaving the GST component as an affinity tag. The column was washed in 5 ml of buffer Z containing 25 mM Mes, pH 6.0, and proteins were eluted in 1 column volume fractions of buffer Z containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, or freshly prepared 5 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. p67phox antibody was a gift from Dr. Franz Wientjies. p65pak and GST antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant protein from Escherichia coli. The immunization procedure consisted of injection of fusion protein (100 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosts (every 4 weeks) of fusion protein (100 μg) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbits were bled 1 week after the third boost and after subsequent injections. Antibodies were purified on affinity columns of the recombinant protein. Affinity-purified p67phox antibodies have been previously described (Wientjes et al., 1993Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blotter as described above. Filters were then blocked and washed as previously described (Ahmed et al., 1994Ahmed S. Lee J. Wen L-P. Zhao Z. Ho J. Best A. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17642-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before incubation with primary antibody (1 in 10,000 dilution for the p67phox antibody and 1 in 500 for p65pak in PBS, 0.1% Tween, 1% non-fat milk). Filters were washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween (5 × 5 min) before incubation with secondary antibody; DAKO peroxidase-conjugated Swine Anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, diluted 1 in 1,000 in PBS, 0.1% Tween, 1% non-fat milk, and staining visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) was as described by the manufacturer. After phosphorylation, both recombinant GST-p65pak and p68 were incubated for 60 min at 4°C with either 5 μl of affinity-purified p65pak antibody or preimmune serum (in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT; final volume, 100 μl). A 50% slurry in the same buffer (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma, 100 μl) was then added, and incubation continued for a further 60 min. The protein A-Sepharose beads were sedimented by packing in a spin column, and the unbound material and radioactivity was removed by discarding the supernatant. The column was then washed three times with 750 μl of PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. 50 μl of sample buffer (2×) was then added to the beads followed by incubation at 95°C for 10 min. The beads were then spun down, and the supernatant containing protein was analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. To detect potential Cdc42Hs targets, proteins in neutrophil cytosol were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, renatured, and probed with Cdc42Hs-[γ-32P]GTP. Proteins with molecular masses of 66-68 kDa were detected (Fig. 1). Partial purification of Cdc42Hs binding activity by DEAE chromatography revealed two distinct protein bands (not shown). Cdc42Hs-[γ-32P]GTP detects proteins in brain cytosol of a similar size, which are most probably the recently characterized p65pak kinase (Manser et al., 1994Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z-s. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). This interaction was specific to the GTP-bound state of Cdc42Hs as (i) Cdc42Hs-GDP at 10-fold higher concentration did not compete with the probe, and (ii) Cdc42Hs-[α-32P]GDP did not detect the neutrophil (or brain) binding proteins (Fig. 1). Rac1-[γ-32P]GTP also reacted with proteins of around 68 kDa from neutrophils (Fig. 1) and brain (not shown). However, the signals were approximately 5-fold weaker when Rac1 was used as a probe, suggesting that it binds less tightly than Cdc42Hs (Fig. 1, lane3; note longer exposure for Rac1). A very weak signal at 48 kDa was also seen with Rac1 (Fig. 1, lane3) and with Cdc42Hs, but this was variable. On the basis of these characteristics, we speculated that the p66-68 Cdc42Hs binding proteins in neutrophils might be either p67phox or a member of the p65pak family of kinases, which are abundant in brain (Manser et al., 1994Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z-s. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), and p48 might be p47phox . Purified recombinant neutrophil oxidase components (5 μg) were immobilized on nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE and then probed with Cdc42Hs-[γ-32P]GTP. Recombinant p67phox, but not p47phox or native cytochrome b protein, was detected with this Cdc42Hs probe. However, p67phox was not detected with Rac1-[γ-32P]GTP (Fig. 2 A). To increase the sensitivity of the assay for Rac1, proteins were directly dot blotted onto nitrocellulose, thus avoiding the denaturation caused by running in SDS-PAGE. Using this method of immobilizing protein, with Rac1-[γ-32P]GTP as probe, signals were obtained for p67phox (2.5-7.5 μg) but not for p47phox, p40, cytochrome b, BSA, or the recombinant phosphatidylinositol kinase p85 subunit (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, with Cdc42Hs as probe, signals were not seen for p47phox or p40phox (not shown). The strength of signal obtained with Rac1 as probe increased, with an increase in p67phox protein amounts between 2.5 and 7.5 μg. As with the 66-68-kDa binding proteins in neutrophil cytosol, Rac1-GDP did not inhibit the Rac1-[γ-32P]GTP interaction with p67phox, and signals were not obtained for p67phox with Rac1-[α-32P]GDP as probe (not shown). Taken together, these data establish the use of this dot-blotting technique to detect protein-protein interactions eliminating the SDS-PAGE step, which denatures proteins. The specificity of these interactions were determined by using the Q61L GTPase negative mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1, RhoA and p65. Ras-Q61L has increased effector function in terms of transformation ability and Ras-GTPase activating protein interaction (Brownbridge et al., 1993Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J.M. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1-Q61L is a more potent activator of neutrophil oxidase (Xu et al., 1993Xu X.M. Barry D.C. Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1294Google Scholar) and membrane ruffling3( 2S. Ahmed and A. Best, manuscript in preparation. ) and binds the Rac1-GTPase activating protein n-chimaerin more tightly than wild-type or Rac1-G12V proteins (Ahmed et al., 1994Ahmed S. Lee J. Wen L-P. Zhao Z. Ho J. Best A. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17642-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1-Q61L probe gave a stronger signal than wild-type protein for interaction with p67phox (compare Fig. 3B with 2 B; see below for quantitation), as did Cdc42Hs-Q61L probe (not shown). These mutant p21 proteins only generated a signal with p47phox when it was present at high amounts. The Q61L mutation also increased the binding of Rac1 to p66-68 from neutrophil or brain cytosol (data not shown). RhoA, a member of this subfamily of Ras-related GTP binding proteins, did not bind p67phox under these conditions (Fig. 3 C). Further evidence for the specificity of the Rac1 and Cdc42Hs interaction with p67phox was obtained by carrying out dot blots in the presence of p65, which includes the Rac1/Cdc42Hs binding domain, as a competitor. p65pak interacts specifically with GTP-bound states of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs with high affinity (nM). 2 μM p65pak binding domain inhibited Cdc42Hs-Q61L (Fig. 3 D) and Rac1-Q61L (not shown) from interacting with p67phox, while 2 μM GST was without effect. To quantify the interactions between Rac1 and p67phox, the nitrocellulose filters were radioassayed rather than being exposed to film. To detect Rac1 binding by this technique, amounts of p67phox greater than 2 μg of protein had to be used. Fig. 4 A shows that there was a linear increase in Rac1-Q61L binding as the amount of p67phox protein was increased. p47phox bound low levels, just above background, of Rac1-Q61L, but this was not dependent on the amount of p47phox over the range studied. To quantify the difference between Rac1 and Rac1-Q61L in strength of binding to p67phox, both probes were used in the same experiment, and the filters were radioassayed. p67phox bound approximately 17-fold more Rac1-Q61L than Rac1 (Fig. 4 B). Initially, to investigate whether p66-68 were related to p65pak, we carried out a two-dimensional gel Cdc42Hs binding analysis of proteins in neutrophil and brain cytosol. The major binding proteins in brain have been shown to be p65pak and possibly related proteins (Manser et al., 1994Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z-s. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Proteins in neutrophil and brain cytosol were analyzed on isoelectric focusing tube gels, followed by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with Cdc42Hs (Fig. 5). The locations of the binding proteins in brain and neutrophils were very similar, with the proteins having similar molecular masses (around 68 kDa) and basic isoelectric points. Two major protein spots were detected for brain and neutrophil cytosol. Additional protein spots with more acidic isoelectric points were also seen with longer exposure (not shown) and probably represent phosphorylated forms of the same protein or isoforms. Next, we purified p68 using column chromatography and Cdc42Hs-[γ-32P]GTP binding assays, with affinity purification as the last step (Fig. 6). The yield of protein eluted from Cdc42Hs columns was low with the bulk of protein either flowing through the column or remaining bound to resin (Fig. 6, lane6). p48 was found to copurify with p68, and its level varied from batch to batch of neutrophil cytosol. We believe p48 is a breakdown product of p68, but further work will be necessary to establish its origin. p68 possessed kinase activity as seen by its ability to autophosphorylate. The kinase activity was stimulated by Rac1 (Fig. 7).Figure 7:Kinase activity of p68. Lane1, Coomassie Blue stain of partially purified p68. Lanes2-4, kinase activity as seen by autophosphorylation of p68. Lane2, in the absence of additions. Lane3, in the presence of Rac1-GDP. Lane4, in the presence of Rac1-GTP. p68 was partially purified (approximately 80%) by Q-Sepharose/heparin-agarose/gel filtration. Chelating Sepharose was incubated with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min, and then the sample was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and the gel was dried down and exposed to film for 10 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether p68 was related to p67phox or p65, specific affinity-purified antibodies were used. Neutrophil cytosol, p67phox, and purified p68 were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. p67phox antibodies detected recombinant p67phox and a protein of similar size in neutrophil cytosol but not p68. p65pak antibodies detected p68 and a band of similar size in neutrophil cytosol but not p67phox or p48 (Fig. 8 A). p65pak antibodies also detected a protein of approximately 68 kDa in brain cytosol. Thus, the p68 protein from neutrophil cytosol is closely related to p65. To show that the p68 kinase activity was not due to a contaminating 68 kDa protein, a purified p68 fraction and recombinant GST-p65pak were incubated in parallel with [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min followed by incubation with purified anti-p65pak antibodies (or GST antibodies), and proteins were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose beads. Anti-p65pak antibodies were able to precipitate both the autophosphorylated p68 and GST-p65pak (Fig. 8 B). Anti-p65pak antibodies also precipitated Cdc42Hs binding activity with p68 and GST-p65pak (not shown). Neutrophil cytosol contains Rac1 binding proteins of 66-68 and p48 kDa that bind preferentially to the GTP-bound state of this p21. The possibility that these binding proteins were p67phox and p47phox was addressed by probing purified proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose with Rac1-[γ-32P]GTP. Interestingly, p67phox was found to bind specifically to Rac1 but not to RhoA. The NADPH oxidase components, p40, p47phox, and cytochrome b, did not bind Rac1. p67phox bound approximately 17-fold more of the GTPase negative mutant protein Rac1-Q61L than Rac1, which correlates with the increased potency of Rac1-Q61L to activate neutrophil oxidase (Xu et al., 1993Xu X.M. Barry D.C. Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7 (abstr.): 1294Google Scholar). During the course of this work, Diekmann et al. (1994) demonstrated that Rac1 interacted specifically with p67phox by using GST fusion proteins and glutathione-Sepharose to examine protein-protein interactions. In general, our results are in agreement with those presented by Diekmann et al. (1994). However, in their study, Rac1-Q61L did not interact more strongly with p67phox than wild-type Rac1. This could be explained by differences in the sensitivity of the assays employed or the exact conditions used. We have also shown here that purified native cytochrome b and p40phox are not Rac1 binding proteins. Thus, out of all of the components of the neutrophil oxidase, p67phox is the sole target for Rac1. In preliminary experiments, we have mapped a Rac1 binding site of p67phox very near its polyproline domain4( 3S. Ahmed and R. Kozma, unpublished data. )(SH3 binding site), which is thought to interact with p47phox . This may suggest that one purpose of the Rac1-p67phox interaction is to influence the ability of p67phox to bind p47phox . Further work on the formation of the complex will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which Rac1 activates superoxide production by the neutrophil oxidase. As with Rac1, Cdc42Hs was found to bind specifically to the 66-68-kDa proteins in neutrophil cytosol and purified p67phox but not the other oxidase components. Cdc42Hs does not activate the oxidase in vitro (Kwong et al., 1993Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5711-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and this suggests that p21 binding to p67phox is not in itself sufficient to cause activation. What then is the function of the Cdc42Hs-p67phox interaction? One possibility is that p67phox could have a function in neutrophils other than being a component of the oxidase. Microinjection of Cdc42Hs induces distinct morphological effects, such as filopodia formation and loss of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Kozma et al., 1995Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). These events are associated with a redistribution of actin polymers. It is therefore possible that p67phox could be a target for Cdc42Hs in a morphological pathway of neutrophils. If this is the case, p67phox could link activation of the neutrophil oxidase with morphological events that are essential for phagocytosis. The demonstration that p67phox is a Cdc42Hs binding protein suggests novel functions for this protein that will require further investigation. The experiments presented here investigating the ability of Cdc42Hs or Rac1 to bind to purified oxidase components utilized microgram quantities of p67phox . Since the abundance of p67phox in neutrophil cytosol is approximately 0.2%,3 it can be estimated that 200 ng is present in the SDS-PAGE analysis of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 binding proteins. This amount of purified recombinant p67phox is not detected even in our dot-blotting assay with Rac1-Q61L as probe while 100 ng of p68 or p65pak is detected. It is therefore likely that the p68 kinase is the major component of the Cdc42Hs and Rac1 binding signals seen in neutrophil cytosol with separation on SDS-PAGE. The relationship between the p66- and p68-kDa proteins in neutrophil cytosol and p65pak was investigated by carrying out a two-dimensional gel analysis of Cdc42Hs binding proteins. Two major protein spots were detected with similar isoelectric points. An almost identical pattern of Cdc42Hs binding proteins was seen when brain cytosol was examined, suggesting that neutrophil protein(s) may be related if not identical to the brain p65. Indeed, purified p68 protein from neutrophil cytosol had kinase activity and could be immunoprecipitated in an autophosphorylated form by anti-p65pak antibodies. To confirm the relationship between p65pak and p68, affinity-purified antibodies were used in Western analysis. p68 was detected by p65pak antibodies but not by p67phox antibodies, demonstrating that p68 is closely related to brain p65. We are presently sequencing peptides of p68 to establish the amino acid sequence identity of this protein to p65. Unlike p68, p48 was not detected by anti-p65pak antibodies, and therefore further work will be necessary to establish its identity. In conclusion, we have been able to identify two targets for the GTP binding proteins Cdc42Hs and Rac1 in neutrophils: a p68 kinase and p67phox .

https://openalex.org/W1975935203,"Activation of the human NADPH oxidase requires the interaction of at least four cytosolic proteins and one membrane-bound heterodimeric protein. Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and their proline-rich counterstructures have been shown to play an important role in protein-protein interactions. Because it was found that the cytosolic oxidase components p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox reside in a complex in resting neutrophils, we studied the role of SH3 domains in their interaction by use of an overlay technique. Wild-type and mutated 35S-labeled p67phox and p47phox were used to detect immobilized cytosolic proteins on a protein blot. A specific association of native p67phox to blotted p47phox and blotted p40phox was found. These interactions were not disturbed by deleting the only proline-rich region (amino acids 227–231) in p67phox. We also found a specific association of native p47phox with blotted p67phox. Deletions in a putative SH3-binding region of p47phox completely abrogated the interaction with p67phox. Other results suggest that the C terminus of p47phox exposes this SH3-binding domain for interaction with p67phox. Similar results were obtained when the binding of cytosolic p67phox to wild-type or mutated p47phox were studied in solution. Interestingly, mutants of p47phox unable to bind to p67phox were fully capable of supporting superoxide production under cell-free activation conditions.

We conclude that an interaction between the C-terminal proline-rich region of p47phox and the second SH3 domain of p67phox is not required for oxidase activity in the cell-free assay. The NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells is an electron transport system that catalyzes the one-electron reduction of oxygen to superoxide (O2⨪), a process essential for the host defense against invading micro-organisms (1Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1991; 77: 673-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For an active NADPH oxidase, at least five different proteins are required: the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (consisting of the subunits gp91phox and p22phox) and three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, either Rac-1 (in macrophages) or Rac-2 (in neutrophils) (2Abo A.

In addition, p47phox and p67phox as well as p22phox possess proline-rich regions that are putative SH3 counterstructures (15Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Walker L.E. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H.

Materials—Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP7S) and NADPH were purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Reagents and molecular weight markers for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were from Bio-Rad. BA84 nitrocellulose sheets for Western blotting were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Antibodies used in this study were monoclonal antibodies 449 and 48, directed against p22phox and gp91phox, respectively (21Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Meerhof L.J. Van Zwieten R. Keijer J.

Rabbit antisera specific for either p47phox or p67phox were raised against the C-terminal 12 residues of these proteins. The rabbit antiserum directed against p40phox was a kind gift of Dr. F.

Isolation and Fractionation of Leukocytes—Human neutrophils were isolated from 30 buffy coats of 500-ml blood donations of healthy donors, as described (22Roos D. De Boer M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

To improve the efficiency in the regions high in G + C content, 10% 7-deaza-2′-dGTP (Promega) was added in the PCR for p47phox. PCR primers corresponding to each end of the cDNA encoding p47phox contained EcoRI sites, and primers for p67phox contained 5′-EcoRI and 3′-HindIII sites to facilitate cloning. The deletion in p47Δ1, lacking amino acid residues 236–350, was created when the pGEX-p47wt construct was digested with StuI and NheI, which cleave at nucleotide positions 716 and 1206, respectively. The deleted sequence was replaced by two PCR products, the first containing nucleotides 716–1039, with StuI and HindIII sites, and the second containing nucleotides 1060–1206, with HindIII and NheI sites. Instead of the expected amino acid 343–350 deletion, an in-frame deletion of amino acids 236–350 was obtained. The truncated protein p47Δ2, with the C-terminal 13 amino acids removed, was constructed by digesting pGEX-p47wt with SstII and NheI, which cleave at nucleotide positions 1117 and 1206, respectively. The deleted sequence was replaced by complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GGCCGAGCGCCGACCTCATCCTGAACCGCTGAG-3′ (sense) and 5-CTAGCTCAGCGGTTCAGGATGAGGTCGGCGCTCGGCCGC-3′ (antisense)), which served to link these noncompatible ends and to introduce a stopcodon (underlined). The p47Δ3 and p47Δ4 mutants, lacking amino acids residues 367–380 and 367–390, respectively, were engineered by digesting pGEX-p47wt with NaeI and NheI, which cleave at nucleotide positions 1098 and 1206, respectively. The deleted sequences were replaced by complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (GGCTGTGCCAAGCACCAAGCGGAAGCTGGCGTCTGCCGTCTGAG (sense) and CTAGCTCAGACGGCAGACGCCAGCTTCCGCTTGGTGCTTGGCTCAGCC (antisense) for p47Δ3 and GGCAGTGCGTTGAAGGCCTG (sense) and CTAGCAGGCCTTCAAGGCACTGCC (antisense) for p47Δ4. The deletion of the proline-rich region 227–231 in p67Δ was accomplished by PCR amplification of nucleotides 586–703 with primers GAAGGATTACCTAGGC (sense) and TGAAGATCTCTGGGGTTTTCTCAGCTGCCTGTGG (antisense), containing AvrII and BglII sites (bold print), respectively. The antisense oligonucleotide introduced the deletion of nucleotides 769–784. After digestion with AvrII and BglII, the PCR product and the pGEX-p67 vector were ligated. All pGEX constructs were analyzed by sequencing with the Sequenase version 2.0 system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Expression of GST-fusion proteins was performed in Escherichia coli DH5α as previously described (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The concentration of the various GST-fusion proteins was estimated by measuring GST activity with 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1 mM reduced glutathione in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Absorbance changes were read at 335 nm. In Vitro Translation—The PGEX inserts encoding p47wt, p47Δ2, p67wt, and p67Δ were cloned into the pGEM-3Zf-vector (Promega) by use of the EeoRI and HindIII sites. For in vitro translation, 1 μg of pGEM plasmid was used in the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte-lysate translation system (Promega). Translation was performed in the presence of L-[35S]methionine at 30 °C for 90 min, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To confirm successful protein synthesis, 1/10 of the in vitro translation mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Overlay Technique (28)—Neutrophil cytosol and plasma membrane fractions or recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked with 5% w/v low-fat milk powder, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 100 mM L-methionine in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in oxidase buffer (10 mM Hepes, 75 mM NaCl, 170 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 2 mM NaN3, pH 7.0). The in vitro translation mixture was 100-fold diluted in oxidase buffer and added to the blot during 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the blot was washed five times in oxidase buffer, dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 2–5 days. Binding of GST-p47phox Proteins to Cytosolic p67phox—GST-p47wt, GST-p47Δ1–4, or GST alone (about 50 μg of protein) were incubated in oxidase buffer with 40 μl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose and normal or A47° neutrophil cytosol (900 μg of protein) in the presence or absence of 100 μμ SDS and 10 μμ GTPγS for 1.5 h at 4 °C (total volume 1.5 ml). After washing the beads three times with incubation buffer, the proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% minigel and immunoblotted for p67phox as described (25Leusen J.H.W. De Boer M. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Ochs H.D. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 95: 2120-2126Crossref Google Scholar). Cell-free Oxidase Assay—Measurement of NADPH oxidase activity in cell-free preparations was performed by the superoxide dismutase-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c in a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer (model Lambda 2). The contents of six cuvettes measured in parallel were stirred continuously and were thermostated at 28 °C. Plasma membranes (10 μg of protein) were mixed with a Rac-2-enriched cytosol fraction and recombinant p47phox (GST-p47) and recombinant p67phox (GST-p67). The mixture was incubated in 0.8 ml of oxidase buffer containing 60 μμ cytochrome c. After 2 min of incubation, NADPH-oxidase assembly was induced by addition of SDS (100 μμ) and GTPγS (10 μμ). After 5 min, NADPH (250 μμ) was added, and the rate of cytochrome c reduction was measured at 550 nm. Interaction of p47phox and p67phox with Neutrophil Fractions—Because the cytosolic oxidase components p47phox and p67phox are known to interact with the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (7Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we aimed to study this interaction with an overlay technique. Therefore, neutrophil plasma-membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was then incubated with in vitro generated p47phox or p67phox, which had incorporated [35S]methionine. As Fig. 1 shows, no binding to gp91phox or p22phox was detected by either cytosolic protein (panels A and B, lanes 1). This result might indicate that the cytosolic proteins do not interact with cytochrome b558 in resting cells. Therefore, also plasma membranes isolated from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophils were used. Again, no binding was detected with either subunit of cytochrome b558 (Fig. 1, panels A and B, lanes 3). However, the overlay with labeled p47phox showed a weak binding to a 67-kDa band (panel A, lane 3), which also stained with an antiserum against p67phox (panel D, lane 3). The overlay with labeled p67phox showed two weak bands at 47 and 40 kDa (panel B, lane 3), which also stained with antisera directed against p47phox and p40phox (panel D, lane 3). Probably, these bands are the cytosolic oxidase proteins, translocated to the plasma membrane upon neutrophil activation. When cytosol of resting neutrophils was investigated with this technique, a 67-kDa band was clearly detected in the overlay with p47phox (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 2). In addition, 47- and 40-kDa bands were present in the overlay with p67phax (Fig. 1, panel B, lane 2). Again, the antisera against the three cytosolic Phox components detected proteins with the same mobility (Fig. 1, panel D, lane 2). Overlay with Neutrophil Cytosol from CGD Patients—To establish the identity of the proteins in the neutrophil cytosol that bound labeled p47phox and p67phox, we used cytosol from neutrophils of CGD patients, lacking either p47phox (A47O) or p67phox (A67O) Fig 2, panel A, shows that labeled p67phox bound to both 47- and 40-kDa bands in neutrophil cytosol from a healthy donor (lane 1) but only weakly to a band at 40 kDa in cytosol from the A47° patient (lane 2). In the cytosol of the A67O patient, the 47-kDa band was clearly detected, but the 40-kDa band appeared to be almost absent (lane 3). This agrees with the finding that p40phox is diminished or absent in A67° CGD patients (4Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O. Kuratsuji T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When the binding of p47phox was studied in these cytosol fractions (Fig. 2B), a 67-kDa band was found in the blotted cytosol of a healthy donor and of a CGD patient lacking p47phox but not of an A67° patient. Again, the bands were verified by immunostaining (Fig. 2C). Effect of Antibodies on the Overlay—To study the regions of the proteins important in these interactions, we first investigated whether antisera directed against the last 12 residues of p47phox and p67phox could interfere Fig 3 snows a blot of recombinant p47phox and p67phox as fusion proteins with the 26-kDa GST (GST-p47 and GST-p67, respectively). When blotted GST-p47 was preincubated with an anti-p47 antiserum and overlaid with labeled p67phox, no effect of the antiserum was observed (lane 3). However, when labeled p47phox was preincubated with the antiserum, binding to GST-p67 on the blot was almost completely blocked (lane 6). In contrast, the anti-p67phox antiserum did not interfere with the binding of p67phox to p47phox (lanes 4 and 5) To verify the presence of recombinant protein in all lanes, the blot was also immunostained (right part of Fig. 3). Deletion Mutants of p47phox and p67phox—To investigate the regions important for the binding between p47phox and p67phox in more detail, four deletion mutants of p47phox and one deletion mutant of p67phox were constructed. Fig. 4A shows a schematic representation of the deleted regions with respect to the SH3 domains and proline-rich stretches that might act as SH3-binding domains. The mutated proteins were expressed as fusion proteins to GST, purified, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining. The result is shown in Fig. 4B. The observed shifts in mobility agree with the deletions. Effect of Deletions in p47phox on Interaction with p67phox—Blotted GST-p47wt and deletion mutants were overlaid with labeled p67phox. Fig. 5A shows normal binding of p67phox to GST-p47wt and GST-p47Δ1, reduced binding to GST-p47Δ2, and no binding to GST-p47Δ3 and GST-p47Δ4. These results are in agreement with the recent finding of Finan et al. (19Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13752-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the SH3-binding domain of p47phox binds directly to p67phox. Panel β of Fig. 5 shows that blotted GST-p67 can bind to p47wt but not to p47Δ2. This result agrees with the blocking by the anti-p47 antibody in Fig. 3. Apparently, the C-terminal part of p47phox is important in the binding to p67phox, especially when p47phox is in solution. Because the overlay technique requires that one of the proteins is denatured, we also performed binding experiments with both p47phox and p67phox in solution. Fig. 6 shows the binding of cytosolic p67phox to GST-p47wt, GST-p47 deletion mutants, or GST alone in the presence or absence of SDS and GTPγS. Without these activators, the results were similar to the overlay experiments. GST-p47wt and GST-p47Δ1 bound a considerable amount of p67phox, whereas GST-p47Δ2 bound much less p67phox, and GST-p47Δ3 and Δ4 did not bind any p67phox (Fig. 6A). With SDS and GTPγS, these last two deletion mutants showed an increased binding of p67phox, but this was also observed with GST alone (Fig. 6B). To rule out the possibility that most of the p67phox in the cytosol was already complexed to cytosolic p47phox and therefore not able to participate in binding to the GST fusion proteins, we repeated the experiment with A47° cytosol, with the same results as described above. Effect of Deletion of Proline-rich Domain of p67phox—The deletion mutant of p67phox was tested in the overlay assay; the result is shown in Fig. 7. Panel A shows neutrophil cytosol of healthy donors on a blot, overlaid with p67wt (lane 1) or p67Δ (lane 2). Both proteins bound to p47phox and p40phox. Also, when GST-p67wt and GST-p67Δ were blotted and probed with 35S-labeled p47phox, no difference was observed between the interactions of p47phox with the wild type or the deletion mutant of p67phox (Fig. 7, right panel). Cell-free Oxidase Assay with Recombinant Proteins—We measured the rate of superoxide production induced by the recombinant proteins GST-p47 and GST-p67 in a cell-free system with plasma membranes and a crude cytosol fraction as a source of Rac-2 protein. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Only p47Δ1, lacking a large part of the second SH3 domain, showed a significantly reduced potency of inducing superoxide production (about 24% of the control value). All other deletion mutants exhibited a normal oxidase-inducing activity. It is well established that so-called SH3 domains are involved in protein-protein interactions (13Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 14Musacchio A. Gibson T. Lehto V.P. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The counter structure for these SH3 domains has been identified as proline-rich stretches found in various proteins (16Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Both p47phox and p67phox of the NADPH oxidase contain two SH3 domains and one putative SH3-binding domain. Of the two membrane-bound cytochrome b558 subunits, only p22phox contains such a putative SH3-binding domain, comprising residues 149–162. We aimed at studying the interaction of the cytosolic oxidase proteins with the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 by using an overlay technique, as described in Ref. 19Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13752-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. However, neither p47phox nor p67phox bound to either p22phox or gp91phox on a blot (Fig. 1). Possibly, regions on both subunits of cytochrome b558 are required for a stable interaction with the cytosolic proteins. This concurs with the observation that single mutations in either subunit of cytochrome b558 can lead to total absence of translocation of p47phox and p67phox upon cell activation. This was shown for an X91+ CGD patient with a Asp500 → Gly substitution in gp91phox (25Leusen J.H.W. De Boer M. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Ochs H.D. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 95: 2120-2126Crossref Google Scholar) and for an A22+ CGD patient with a Pro156 → Gln substitution in a proline-rich region of p22phox (29Leusen J.H.W. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Kaulfersch W. Seger R.A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This latter finding is confirmed by the results of Sumimoto et al. (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), who found an interaction between the SH3 domains of p47phox and the proline-rich region of p22phox, both expressed as fusion proteins with GST. The Pro156 → Gln substitution abolished this interaction. The cytosolic oxidase components p47phox and p67phox appear to reside in a complex of 240–300 kDa in the cytosol of resting neutrophils (17Park J.-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Park J.-W. Benna J.E. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We studied this interaction by using an overlay technique; soluble p47phox bound to a 67-kDa protein in blotted neutrophil cytosol that was absent from p67phox deficient cytosol, and soluble p67phox bound to a blotted 47- and 40-kDa protein. The former band was absent in p47phox-deficient cytosol, and the latter band was described as the novel cytosolic oxidase component p40phox that is thought to play a role in stabilizing p67phox (4Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O. Kuratsuji T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To explore the regions of p47phox and p67phox that play a role in these interactions, we studied the effect of antibodies directed against the C termini of p47phox and p67phnx, and we constructed deletion mutants of these proteins. An antiserum directed against the C terminus of p67phox had no effect, but an antiserum directed against the last 12 residues of p47phox blocked the binding of soluble p47phox to recombinant p67phox immobilized on a blot almost completely (Fig. 3). However, this antiserum had no effect on the binding of soluble p67phox to blotted recombinant p47phox (denatured by SDS), although the antiserum did bind to this denatured p47phox. This suggests that the C terminus of p47phox has no primary function in the binding to p67phox. This was confirmed by the experiments with the truncated protein p47Δ2, which lacks the last 13 residues. Soluble p67phox bound to blotted p47Δ2, but binding of soluble p47Δ2 to blotted GST-p67 was not detected (Fig. 5). Deletion of a large part of the second SH3 domain of p47phox in p47Δ1 had no effect on the interaction with p67phox. However, the putative SH3-binding domain of p47phox is essential for the interaction with p67phox, as demonstrated with p47Δ3 and p47Δ4. These mutated proteins lack a part of the proline-rich region of p47phox, which was mapped by Finan et al. (19Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13752-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with use of synthetic peptides as being the counterstructure in p47phox of the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox. In addition, our results indicate that the last 13 amino acids of p47phox are required to expose its proline-rich region for binding to p67phox. Similar results were obtained with an assay that allows interaction between p47phox and p67phox both in solution (Fig. 6A), which strongly suggests that the proline-rich region of p47phox is the only important domain for interaction with p67phox The addition of SDS and GTPγS as cell-free activators did not change the characteristics of the binding of p47p to p67phox, although a specific binding of p67phox was observed (Fig. 6B). It has been suggested by Wientjes et al. (4Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) that the interaction between p40phox and p67phox is based on the SH3 domain of p40phox and a proline-rich region PPPRPKTP (residues 227–234) of p67phox. To test this hypothesis, we constructed p67Δ, lacking residues 227–231, and used it in an overlay experiment with blotted neutrophil cytosol (Fig. 7). However, no effect of this deletion on the binding of p67phox to p40phox or p47phox was observed. Also, this deletion had no effect on the potency of p67phox to induce superoxide production (Fig. 8). Because no other proline-rich regions are present in p67phox, the nature of the binding between p40phox and p67phox remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, no correlation was found for the p47phox mutants between the ability to bind p67phox and the superoxide-inducing capacity in the cell-free assay. For instance, p47Δ1, which bound p67phox normally, induced only little superoxide production (Fig. 8). This latter effect might be explained by a defective association with the SH3-binding domain in p22phox because the second SH3 domain is largely removed in this p47phox mutant. For p47Δ3 and p47Δ4, the opposite is true; they did not interact with p67phox, but they did induce a normal superoxide production in the cell-free assay (Fig. 8). Hence, the proline-rich region of p47phox, important for p67phox binding, is not required in the assembled NADPH oxidase. This strongly suggests that a complex of the cytosolic Phox proteins is not required for activity in the cell-free system. However, our studies do not exclude that during activation of the NADPH oxidase regions become exposed that mediate other interactions between p47phox and p67phox. In conclusion, the interaction between the cytosolic Phox proteins can conveniently be studied with the overlay technique as a model for the resting situation in the human cytosol. However, a complex of cytosolic Phox proteins does not seem to be required for activity in the cell-free assay. Obviously, it would be interesting to test in intact cells the mutated p47phox proteins that have been found in this study to be deficient in p67phox binding. These studies are currently carried out in our laboratory."

Several negative cofactors (NC1, NC2, and Dr1) are known to interact with TBP in a manner that prevents productive interactions of transcription factors TFIIA and TFIIB with promoter-bound TBP. To gain insights into the regulatory interplay on the surface of TBP, we have employed mutant forms of TBP to identify amino acid residues important for interactions with the negative regulatory cofactor NC2 and the general factor TFIIB. The results show the involvement of distinct domains of TBP in these interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2001742363,"Humans possess five classes of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), including forms able to oxidize ethanol or formaldehyde as part of a defense mechanism, as well as forms acting as retinol dehydrogenases in the synthesis of the regulatory ligand retinoic acid. However, the mouse has previously been shown to possess only three forms of ADH. Hybridization analysis of mouse genomic DNA using cDNA probes specific for each of the five classes of human ADH has now indicated that mouse DNA cross-hybridizes to only classes I, III, and IV. With human class II or class V ADH cDNA probes, hybridization to mouse genomic DNA was very weak or undetectable, suggesting either a lack of these genes in the mouse or a high degree of mutational divergence relative to the human genes. cDNAs for murine ADH classes I and III have previously been cloned, and we now report the cloning of a full-length mouse class IV ADH cDNA. In Northern blot analyses, mouse class IV ADH mRNA was abundant in the stomach, eye, skin, and ovary, thus correlating with the expression pattern for the mouse Adh-3 gene previously determined by enzyme analysis. In situ hybridization studies on mouse stomach indicated that class IV ADH transcripts were abundant in the mucosal epithelium but absent from the muscular layer. Comparison of the expression patterns for all three mouse ADH genes indicated that class III was expressed ubiquitously, whereas classes I and IV were differentially expressed in an overlapping set of tissues that all contain a large component of epithelial cells. This expression pattern is consistent with the ability of classes I and IV to oxidize retinol for the synthesis of retinoic acid known to regulate epithelial cell differentiation.

This expression pattern is consistent with the ability of classes I and IV to oxidize retinol for the synthesis of retinoic acid known to regulate epithelial cell differentiation. The results presented here indicate that the mouse has a simpler ADH gene family than the human but has conserved class IV ADH previously shown to be a very active retinol dehydrogenase in humans.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons between the five classes of human ADH have revealed interclass sequence identities in the 57-69% range, indicating divergence from a common progenitor about 450 million years ago during early vertebrate evolution (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All classes of vertebrate ADH as well as all other medium chain ADHs (i.e. 35-40 kDa) found in bacteria, yeast, plants, and invertebrates have arisen from duplication and divergence of a primordial class III ADH gene, which encodes a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase found ubiquitously in all organisms analyzed (Koivusalo et al., 1989Koivusalo M.

Class III ADH does not function in ethanol metabolism, but other ADHs that have evolved from it have acquired this ability (Kaiser et al., 1993Kaiser R. Fernández M.R. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Proc.

A. 1993; 90: 11222-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). alcohol dehydrogenase mouse gene encoding ADH human gene encoding ADH base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. Some vertebrate ADHs have evolved to metabolize additional alcohols such as retinol (vitamin A). The ability of some classes of ADH to act as retinol dehydrogenases implies that they may participate in the synthesis of retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A involved in regulating cellular differentiation and embryonic development (Connor, 1988Connor M.J. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 7038-7040PubMed Google Scholar; De Luca, 1991De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Purified mammalian ADHs have been demonstrated to catalyze retinol oxidation in vitro including human ADH classes I, II, and IV (Yang et al., 1994Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcoholism (NY). 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), rat ADH classes I and IV (Boleda et al., 1993Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and mouse ADH-C2 (Connor and Smit, 1987Connor M.J. Smit M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (defined herein as class IV ADH). Of these isozymes, only class I ADH has evolved to efficiently oxidize both ethanol and retinol (Boleda et al., 1993Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 1994Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcoholism (NY). 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). ADH classes I and IV are found in all mammals analyzed in a wide variety of epithelial tissues (Holmes, 1978Holmes R.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 61: 339-346Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar; Juli et al., 1987Juli P. Farrés J. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which are known to convert retinol to retinoic acid (Blaner and Olson, 1994Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 229-255Google Scholar). Since the only major site of ethanol metabolism is the liver (Boleda et al., 1989Boleda M.D. Juli P. Moreno A. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the function of extrahepatic class I and IV ADH is more consistent with a role in retinoid metabolism rather than ethanol metabolism. In addition to the cytosolic alcohol/retinol dehydrogenases, a microsomal retinol dehydrogenase has also been identified that catalyzes retinol oxidation in vitro (Posch et al., 1991Posch K.C. Boerman M.H.E.M. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6224-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The relative importance of all of these enzymes in vivo remains to be determined. To use molecular genetics for further study of this issue, we have sought to characterize the mouse ADH gene family. The murine ADH system appears to be less complex than that seen in humans. The existence of three forms of mouse ADH encoded by three genes was early established by enzyme analyses and genetic studies, i.e. ADH-A2, ADH-B2, and ADH-C2 encoded by Adh-1, Adh-2, and Adh-3, respectively (Holmes, 1977Holmes R.S. Genetics. 1977; 87: 709-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Holmes, 1978Holmes R.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 61: 339-346Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sequencing of cDNAs for Adh-1 (Edenberg et al., 1985Edenberg H.J. Zhang K. Fong K. Bosron W.F. Li T.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2262-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Ceci et al., 1986Ceci J.D. Lawther R. Duester G. Hatfield G.W. Smith M. O'Malley M.P. Felder M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Adh-2 (Hur et al., 1992Hur M.-W. Ho W.-H. Brown C.J. Goldman D. Edenberg H.J. DNA Sequence-J. DNA Seq. Map. 1992; 3: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) allowed a comparison with the known sequences of several classes of human ADH, indicating that they encode mouse class I and class III ADH, respectively. Whereas humans possess three class I ADH genes, the mouse was found to possess only one gene encoding class I ADH, i.e.Adh-1 (Ceci et al., 1987Ceci J.D. Zheng Y.-W. Felder M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1987Zhang K. Bosron W.F. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A lack of sequence data on the form of ADH encoded by the mouse Adh-3 gene has made it impossible to determine if it is homologous to one of the known classes of human ADH. The ADH enzyme encoded by Adh-3 has been shown to be expressed predominantly in the stomach (Holmes, 1978Holmes R.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 61: 339-346Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and thus may be most closely related to the major stomach ADH of humans and rats (Yin et al., 1990Yin S.-J. Wang M.-F. Liao C.-S. Chen C.-M. Wu C.-W. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 829-835PubMed Google Scholar; Parés et al., 1990Parés X. Moreno A. Cederlund E. Höög J.-O. Jörnvall J.

Amino acid sequence data on human and rat stomach ADH defined a new class called class IV ADH (Parés et al., 1990Parés X. Moreno A. Cederlund E. Höög J.-O. Jörnvall J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Parés et al., 1992Parés X. Cederlund E. Moreno A. Saubi N. Höög J.-O. Jörnvall H.

A. 1994; 91: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, the cloning of a cDNA for human class IV ADH was described by this laboratory (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now used this human class IV ADH cDNA to verify that the mouse contains this gene and have isolated a full-length mouse class IV ADH cDNA. This has allowed a detailed comparison of the expression patterns for ADH classes I, III, and IV in mouse tissues. The results suggest a correlation of mouse class I and class IV ADH gene expression with epithelial tissues known to require retinoic acid for proper differentiation. Total RNA was isolated from mouse stomach mucosal layer tissue (6-month-old female, strain FVB/N) by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method previously described (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning was performed by reverse transcription-PCR. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed on 10 μg of total mouse stomach mucosa RNA using oligo(dT) as a primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described in the cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen). The single-stranded cDNA product was subjected to PCR using primers specific for mouse class IV ADH as described below. The conditions for PCR were a modification of the standard methodology (Ausubel et al., 1989Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). PCR reactions (100 μl) contained 0.5 mM of each nucleotide (dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP), 1 × reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl), 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 pmol of both upstream and downstream primers, and 1-5 μl of the above single-stranded cDNA product. The reaction was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil and then subjected to 36 cycles of PCR with increasing annealing stringency in later cycles. Cycling conditions were 94°C (1 min) for denaturation, 51°C (2 min) for annealing, and 72°C (3 min) for elongation during cycles 1-10; 94°C (1 min), 53°C (2 min), and 72°C (3 min) during cycles 11-20; 94°C (1 min), 55°C (2 min), and 72°C (3 min) during cycles 21-35; and for the 36th cycle the elongation at 72°C was extended to 7 min. The sample was extracted once with chloroform to remove mineral oil and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was gel purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII (sites engineered into the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to generate sticky ends), and then cloned into Bluescript II KS (Stratagene) for DNA sequence analysis. A partial mouse class IV ADH PCR product of 738 bp in length extending from codons 93 to 339 was obtained using the same primers (GD-70 and GD-73) previously reported as successful for preparing a partial rat class IV ADH PCR product (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PCR product containing the full coding region of the mouse class IV ADH gene was obtained using additional primers determined from sequencing of genomic clones encoding mouse class IV ADH. A mouse 129 SVJ genomic DNA library (Stratagene) was screened by the plaque-lift technique previously described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The hybridization probe consisted of the 738-bp partial mouse class IV ADH PCR product described above. Radiolabeling of the probe, hybridization conditions, and phage DNA purification were performed as previously described (Žgombić-Knight et al., 1995Žgombić-Knight M. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4305-4311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA from four independently isolated phage was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis by linear PCR amplification as previously described (Wang et al., 1992Wang B. Fang Q. Williams W.V. Weiner D.B. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 527-530PubMed Google Scholar) using primers able to hybridize to the 5’- or 3’-ends of the coding region to enable sequencing of the 5’- or 3’-untranslated regions, respectively. As a 5’-sequencing primer, we used a degenerate human class I ADH exon 1 primer (GD-88), which previously proved successful in sequencing the 5’-untranslated region of the human class IV ADH gene due to its ability to cross-hybridize to exon 1 (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a 3’-sequencing primer, we used GD-113, 5’-AGCATTCGAACGGTCCTGAC(A/T/G/C)TT(T/C)TGA-3’, corresponding to the coding strand sequence of codons 367-374 plus the stop codon previously determined for the human class IV ADH cDNA (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence data of the mouse class IV ADH 5’-untranslated region obtained from primer GD-88 with phage λMZm9 were used to construct an upstream PCR primer (GD-122) 5’-GTCGAAGGATCCAGAGGCAGGATGGGCACCGCTG-3’ located on the coding strand overlapping the start codon. Nucleotide sequence data of the mouse class IV ADH 3’-untranslated region from primer GD-113 with phage λMZm2 were used to construct a downstream PCR primer (GD-115) 5’-TGCTAGAAGCTTCAGAGAACACTGTCAGGAGCAAGG-3’ located on the noncoding strand 70 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR with GD-122 and GD-115 was carried out as described above to generate a DNA fragment of about 1.2 kb containing the full coding region of mouse class IV ADH. A mouse class III ADH cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR as described above, except that the source of the RNA was total RNA (10 μg) from liver, and the upstream and downstream PCR primers were based upon the published nucleotide sequence of a mouse class III ADH cDNA (Hur et al., 1992Hur M.-W. Ho W.-H. Brown C.J. Goldman D. Edenberg H.J. DNA Sequence-J. DNA Seq. Map. 1992; 3: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The upstream PCR primer (GD-106) 5’-GTCGAAGGATCCGCCATGGCGAACCAGGTGATC-3’ was located on the coding strand at positions 37-57 bp overlapping the start codon, and the downstream PCR primer (GD-107) 5’-CCATGAAAGCTTGAAAGAGTGCAGGATGGACAG-3’ was located on the noncoding strand at positions 1180-1200 bp just downstream of the stop codon. To obtain a probe for human class V ADH, we used reverse transcription-PCR to prepare a full-length class V ADH cDNA from human liver RNA, which has been shown to express this form of ADH (Yasunami et al., 1991Yasunami M. Chen C.-S. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7610-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out as above except with 1.0 μg of human liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). The conditions for PCR amplification from the single-stranded cDNA and cloning of the PCR product are described in detail above except that primers specific for human class V ADH were used. Based upon the sequence of human class V ADH encoded by the ADH6 gene (Yasunami et al., 1991Yasunami M. Chen C.-S. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7610-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we synthesized an upstream PCR primer (GD-123) 5’-GTCGAAGGATCCAAATCAGCATGAGTACTACAGG-3’ containing sequence on the coding strand from −8 to +14 bp relative to the ATG translation start codon, as well as a downstream PCR primer (GD-103) 5’-GATGACAAGCTTTCTACTCCCAAGCCAATACACCC-3’ containing sequence on the noncoding strand downstream from the stop codon at +1154 bp to +1176 bp. Double-stranded plasmid DNAs from ADH cDNAs cloned in pBluescript II KS were subjected to dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis using the Sequenase Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequences were determined on both strands. The standard DNA sequencing primers for pBluescript II KS were used, i.e. T3, T7, KS, and SK (Stratagene) as well as several specialized oligonucleotides, all of which were synthesized by the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation DNA Chemistry Facility. Computer analysis of nucleotide sequences, alignment of deduced amino acid sequences, and estimation of enzyme pI values were accomplished using the MacVector version 4 program (International Biotechnologies, Inc.). Human, mouse, and rat genomic DNAs were purchased from Clontech. Samples (5 μg) of each were digested with EcoRI or HindIII and fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. DNA was denatured and transferred to filters for hybridization analysis by Southern blotting as previously described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization of filters was carried out for 20 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.6), 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 10 μg/μl poly(A), 250 μg/μl herring sperm DNA, and 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled probe. Final washing was under moderate stringency conditions (to allow human/mouse cross-hybridization) at 68°C for 1 h in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed with intensifying screens at −70°C for 48 h. The hybridization probes consisted of human cDNAs representing all five known classes of human ADH. The cDNA inserts for each ADH plasmid were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random hexamer-primed labeling using the oligolabeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Plasmids containing full-length cDNAs for human class I ADH encoded by ADH3 (Höög et al., 1986Höög J.-O. Heden L.-O. Larsson K. Jörnvall H. Von Bahr-Lindström H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), human class II ADH encoded by ADH4 (Höög et al., 1987Höög J.-O. Von Bahr-Lindström H. Heden L.-O. Holmquist B. Larsson K. Hempel J. Vallee B.L. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1926-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and human class III ADH encoded by ADH5 (Giri et al., 1989Giri P.R. Krug J.F. Kozak C. Moretti T. O'Brien S.J. Seuanez H.N. Goldman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were obtained for use as hybridization probes. A cDNA for human class IV ADH encoded by ADH7 was recently cloned in this laboratory (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA for human class V ADH encoded by ADH6 was prepared by reverse transcription coupled to PCR as described above. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues (6-month-old males and females, strain FVB/N) by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method previously described (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μg) of total mouse RNA were separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The presence of mouse 18 S RNA (1.87 kb) and 28 S RNA (4.72 kb) was used to estimate the integrity of the various RNA preparations as well as controlling for lane-to-lane differences in the amount of RNA loaded and to estimate the molecular sizes of hybridizing species of RNA. The hybridization probes included a cDNA for the mouse class I ADH gene (Adh-1) previously described (Edenberg et al., 1985Edenberg H.J. Zhang K. Fong K. Bosron W.F. Li T.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2262-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Ceci et al., 1986Ceci J.D. Lawther R. Duester G. Hatfield G.W. Smith M. O'Malley M.P. Felder M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and cDNAs for the mouse class III ADH gene (Adh-2) and class IV ADH gene (Adh-3) both prepared by reverse transcription coupled to PCR as described above. Radiolabeling of the cDNA probes and hybridization conditions were as described above for Southern blot analysis except that final washing was performed under high stringency conditions at 68°C for 1 h in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS to prevent cross-hybridization. For some analyses, samples (10 μg) of total mouse liver RNA were run in parallel with samples (0.5 μg) of human stomach and liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). These samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis as above except that the probes consisted of a cDNA for human class II ADH (Höög et al., 1987Höög J.-O. Von Bahr-Lindström H. Heden L.-O. Holmquist B. Larsson K. Hempel J. Vallee B.L. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1926-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and a cDNA for human class V ADH described above, with final washing being performed under moderate stringency conditions at 68°C for 1 h in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS to allow human/mouse cross-hybridization. Stomach tissue from adult mice was fixed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and processed for in situ hybridization according to the methods previously described (Wilkinson and Green, 1990Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 155-171Google Scholar). A 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe for mouse class IV ADH mRNA was synthesized using a T3 polymerase in vitro transcription reaction with [α-35S]UTP from the full-length cDNA encoding mouse class IV ADH cloned in pBluescript II KS described above. A control sense RNA probe was synthesized from the same plasmid using T7 polymerase. Slides were exposed to emulsion for 2-3 weeks prior to development. Staining of sections was performed with toluidine blue or neutral red, and photography was under bright field and dark field conditions. To determine whether the mouse possesses ADH genes in addition to the previously characterized class I and class III ADH genes, cDNAs for each of the five classes of human ADH were used as cross-hybridization probes to examine mouse genomic DNA for the presence of the homologous genes. The human/mouse intraclass amino acid sequence identity for class I ADH is 85% (Zhang et al., 1987Zhang K. Bosron W.F. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and for class III ADH is 93% (Hur et al., 1992Hur M.-W. Ho W.-H. Brown C.J. Goldman D. Edenberg H.J. DNA Sequence-J. DNA Seq. Map. 1992; 3: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas the interclass amino acid sequence identity among the five known human ADH classes ranges between 57 and 69% (Satre et al., 1994Satre M.A. gombi-Knight M.

Therefore, hybridizations were able to be carried out under conditions that would easily allow detection of human/mouse intraclass cross-hybridization but not human/mouse interclass cross-hybridization. When cDNAs for human ADH classes I, II, III, IV, and V were used as hybridization probes for human DNA, we detected for each probe a unique set of human DNA fragments (Fig. 1, A-E), thus indicating that the hybridization conditions were sufficiently stringent to prevent interclass cross-hybridization among any of the classes. The numerous human DNA fragments detected with the class I ADH probe represent the previously reported EcoRI and HindIII fragments observed in genomic clones of the three human class I ADH genes (i.e.ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3 encoding enzymes sharing about 94% sequence identity), which cross-hybridize under these conditions (Duester et al., 1986Duester G.

The rodent DNA fragments detected with the human class I ADH cDNA probe represent those present in the previously analyzed genes for mouse class I ADH (Ceci et al., 1987Ceci J.D. Zheng Y.-W.

As expected, the degree of hybridization of the human class I ADH cDNA with mouse and rat DNA fragments was much less than that observed with human DNA fragments due to species-specific sequence differences.

This structural difference can be attributed to fascin. How cells regulate the superorganization of cytoplasmic actin filaments is an area of active interest. Several actin-associated proteins have been isolated from cytoplasmic actin gels formed when low calcium, ATP-supplemented cell extracts are warmed. This approach was pioneered in studies on the gelation of sea urchin egg cytoplasm by Kane, 1975Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Kane, 1976Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. One component of echinoid actin gels is a 55-kDa protein termed fascin (Bryan and Kane, 1978Bryan J. Kane R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Echinoid fascin organizes actin filaments into bundles in egg microvilli (Otto et al., 1980Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and into the core bundles of filopodia in coelomocytes (Otto and Bryan, 1981Otto J.J. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1981; 1: 179-192Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Until recently, fascin was thought to be restricted to invertebrates and was considered to be an invertebrate analog of fimbrin. Recent cloning of fascin cDNAs from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus demonstrated that fascins are widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom (Bryan et al., 1993Bryan J. Edwards R. Matsudaira P. Otto J.J. Wulfkuhle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9115-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison showed that echinoid fascin is homologous to the product of the Drosophila singed gene (Paterson and O'Hare, 1991Paterson J. O'Hare K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is important in both mechanosensory bristle development and oogenesis. Overton showed that developing bristles contain a central core of microtubules surrounded by numerous actin filament bundles. In developing bristles of singed flies, the number of actin filament bundles is severely reduced, and those that remain are highly disorganized (Overton, 1967Overton J. J. Morphol. 1967; 122: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the recombinant singed gene product, Drosophila fascin, can produce actin bundles with the same 12-nm transverse periodicity (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as seen in echinoid fascin-actin bundles (Bryan and Kane, 1978Bryan J. Kane R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Antibody evidence shows that Drosophila fascin is present in normal bristles, but missing in the deformed bristles of singed flies (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Normal Drosophila oogenesis involves the transfer of cytoplasm from nurse cells to the oocyte through joining structures called ring canals. Flies deficient in fascin lack cytoplasmic actin bundles responsible for centering the nuclei in the cell; in their absence, the nuclei plug up the ring canals, blocking cytoplasmic transfer (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition to Drosophila, fascin homologs have now been cloned from a Xenopus pituitary library (Holthuis et al., 1994Holthuis J.C.M. Schoonderwoert V.T.G. Martens J.T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library (Duh et al., 1994Duh F.M. Latif F. Weng Y. Geil L. Modi W. Stackhouse T. Matsumura F. Duan D.R. Linehan W.M. Lerman M.I. Gnarra J.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, peptide sequence data (Bryan et al., 1993Bryan J. Edwards R. Matsudaira P. Otto J.J. Wulfkuhle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9115-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reveal that human fascin is identical to the 55-kDa bundling protein isolated from HeLa cells (Yamashiro-Matsumura and Matsumura, 1985Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin characterizing the function of fascin in mammals, we have cloned the murine homolog from fetal mouse brain, described its tissue distribution, and identified isoforms. We have constructed a new expression vector that can be used to produce large amounts of soluble active fascin. We show that this material bundles filaments into highly ordered arrays that will be useful for high resolution structural work. Restriction enzymes were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Sequenase was from United States Biochemical Corp., and common chemicals were from Sigma and Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies for human fascin were kindly provided by Drs. Fumio and Shigeko Matsumura. Samples of mouse tissues were homogenized in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2% SDS and boiled for 5 min. 20 μg of protein from each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with primary anti-fascin antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000. Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (p-toluidine salt)/nitro blue tetrazolium after incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. 5 × 105 phage from a Uni-Zap XR fetal mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were screened with a 2.7-kilobase piece of human fascin cDNA kindly provided by Dr. George Mosialos (Mosialos et al., 1994Mosialos G. Yamashiro S. Baughman R.W. Matsudaira P. Vara L. Matsumura F. Kieff E. Birkenbach M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three primary positive clones were obtained; two gave secondary positive plaques. In vivo excision was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting 2.7-kilobase cDNAs were sequenced in M13 using the dideoxy procedure (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51918) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 or M13mp19 as described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed using Sequenase according to the manufacturer's instructions. All subcloning and expression procedures were performed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. pTRXFUS (LaVallee et al., 1993LaVallee E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar), a thioredoxin-containing plasmid, was obtained from the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). pAED4, carrying a T7 promoter, was kindly provided by Dr. Don Doering (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). The thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein expression vector was constructed as follows. A 539-base pair N-terminal fragment of murine fascin cDNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides CGAAGGTACCGatgACCGCCAACGGCAC and GCCAAGGTGATGAGCGA (start codon is underlined); digested with KpnI and SalI; and subcloned in frame into pTRXFUS, creating pTRXFAS-N. This plasmid was cut with BglII and NcoI, and a 2003-base pair BglII- NcoI fragment containing the remainder of the fascin open reading frame was inserted into pTRXFAS-N, creating the plasmid pTRXMFAS. The complete thioredoxin-fascin open reading frame was then subcloned into pAED4 3’ of the T7 promoter to produce pMFAST7. pMFAST7 was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. These were grown at 37°C to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and grown at 30°C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted; resuspended in 0.4 volume of 20% (w/v) sucrose in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM EDTA; set on ice for 10 min; and then pelleted for 10 min at 15,000 × g. This pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM EDTA; set on ice for 10 min; and pelleted again. The supernatant will be referred to as the “shockate.” The shockate containing the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein was incubated with α-chymotrypsin (1:30 (w/w) enzyme/substrate) for 3 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4°C. The mixture was run over a DEAE-Sephacryl column equilibrated in 10 mM NaPO4, pH 6.8, and eluted with a linear gradient of 10-500 mM NaCl. Recombinant fascin-containing fractions were then applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in 10 mM KHPO4, pH 6.8, and eluted with a linear gradient of 10-500 mM KHPO4, pH 6.8. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mM KHPO4, pH 6.5, and loaded onto a sulfopropyl-Sephadex column equilibrated in the same buffer. The run-through fraction containing r-fascin1( 1The abbreviation used is: r-fascinrecombinant fascin. ) was concentrated over Centriprep 30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) to a final concentration of 4-6 mg/ml and stored at 4°C with 1 mM NaN3. The same procedure can be used to purify the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein. recombinant fascin. Filopodial cores and purified echinoid fascin from coelomocytes of S. purpuratus and F-actin from longitudinal body muscle of Parastichopus californicus were prepared as described (Bryan and Kane, 1982Bryan J. Kane R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 175-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 10 amino acids of r-fascin and a 39-kDa fragment were determined using an Applied Biosystems Model 470-A gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with an in-line Model 120-A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Recombinant fascin was subjected to acid-urea electrophoresis by the method of Allis et al. (1979). Briefly, r-fascin was separated on an 11-cm 6 M urea, 10% acrylamide gel equilibrated in 5% (v/v) acetic acid for a total of 1600 V-h. After Coomassie Blue staining, the lane was excised from the gel and equilibrated in Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar stacking gel buffer with 10% (w/v) glycerol and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. The lane was laid on its side on top of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated in the second dimension. Rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin was purified as described (Spudich and Watt, 1971Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4860-4871Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with the addition of a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephadex G-50 column as an additional purification step and stored in 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM NaN3. The actin concentration was determined using following formula: F-actin (mg/ml) = (A290 - 1.34 A320)/0.69, where A320 is the absorbance at 290 nm, 1.34 A320 corrects for light scattering by F-actin, and A3201% = 0.69 is the extinction coefficient for G-actin. The concentration of r-fascin was determined using a molar extinction of 54,406 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm calculated from sequence data. Recombinant fascin was incubated with 3.5 or 7 μM rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin at actin/fascin molar ratios of 40, 20, 12.5, 10, 7.8, 6.5, 5.5, 5, 4, 2.5, 2, and 1.5:1 in 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP for 16-18 h at 4°C. The mixtures were briefly vortexed and centrifuged for 15 min at 22,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined on pellets resuspended in 1% SDS using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce)). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. The data shown are corrected for F-actin sedimentation in the absence of added fascin and represent the mean of six experiments. Either r-fascin or echinoid fascin was mixed with skeletal muscle F-actin at a molar ratio (fascin/actin) of 1:6 in 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP and then incubated for 72 h at 4°C. Aliquots (5 μl) of the mixture were applied to Formvar-coated nickel grids (200 mesh), stained with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate, and viewed at ×76,000 in a Philips EM-410 transmission electron microscope. The final actin concentration was 5 μM. Electron cryomicroscopy was done on 5-μl aliquots that were applied to carbon-coated holey grids and then quick-frozen in liquid ethane. Specimens were imaged in a Jeol 4000 transmission electron microscope at 400 kV using a low electron dose and nominal magnification of ×30,000. The tissue distribution of murine fascin was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). A single immunoreactive species with an apparent Mr of 55,000 was seen in all of the analyzed tissues. Mouse brain contained the greatest amount of immunoreactive fascin/microgram of protein. Significant amounts of fascin were detected in uterus, small intestine, and spleen. Northern analysis of whole RNA extracted from the same tissues gave a single band at 2.7 kilobases; fascin mRNA was also most abundant in brain (data not shown). Based on the abundance of fascin in brain (Fig. 1), a fetal mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a human fascin cDNA probe. Three primary candidate positive clones isolated from 5 × 105~-phage yielded two secondary positive clones. Restriction analysis revealed that these two clones were identical. Fig. 2 gives the sequence and translation of murine fascin (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number L33726). The longest open reading frame begins at base pair 90 with a good Kozak consensus initiation sequence (Kozak, 1987Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar) and terminates at base pair 1569, encoding a peptide of 493 residues. A consensus polyadenylation sequence (AATAAA) begins at residue 2636. The molecular mass of the encoded protein is 54,412 Da, with a calculated pI of 6.63. The peptide sequence of murine fascin was compared with those of the echinoid, Drosophila, human, murine, and Xenopus fascins obtained from GenBankTM. The overall sequence identity is 17%. 15% of the substitutions are conservative. The murine and human sequences differ at 24 out of 493 residues. To demonstrate that the cloned sequence encodes a functional fascin, we expressed mouse fascin cDNA in E. coli. Early attempts at expression of either fascin itself or as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using T7-based plasmids produced insoluble material. Expression of a soluble functional peptide was achieved by cloning the coding region of fascin in frame behind the E. coli thioredoxin A gene in plasmid pTRXFUS (LaVallee et al., 1993LaVallee E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar). The original vector produced small amounts of soluble material. The level of synthesis was improved by putting the cDNA encoding the fusion protein under control of a T7 promoter and inducing expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. ~60% of the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein can be recovered by hypotonic shock. We have taken advantage of the relative insensitivity of fascin to chymotrypsin to cleave the fusion protein and to purify r-fascin. This was done by treating the shockate with α-chymotrypsin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:30 to effect cleavage. The hydrolysate was then fractionated over DEAE-Sephacryl, hydroxylapatite, and DEAE-Sephacel to purify r-fascin. Essentially the same procedure can be used to purify the fusion protein. The results for the cleaved protein are shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of lanes1 and 2 in Fig. 3 and Western blot data (not shown) indicate that induction was modest and that expression from this plasmid is leaky, although no deleterious effects have been noted on bacterial physiology. Lane3 shows the protein profile of the shockate. 4 liters of induced culture were pelleted and used to produce 100 ml of shockate. The degree of enrichment of several proteins is apparent. The prominent 67-kDa band is the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein; the band at 43 kDa is the E. coli elongation factor Tu protein. Lane4 indicates the effect of treatment with chymotrypsin and purification on a DEAE-Sephacryl column, while lanes5 and 6 show the extent of purification after chromatography on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-Sephacel, respectively. The ~39,000-Da band in lane6 is a proteolytic fragment of fascin that begins at Ser133 and presumably extends to the C terminus. Purified r-fascin has an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa on SDS gels, identical to that observed for the brain protein. Recombinant fascin was used for N-terminal microsequencing to define the site of chymotryptic cleavage. The first 10 residues were TANGTAEAVQ, identical to the deduced peptide sequence if the N-terminal methionine has been cleaved. Echinoid fascin is also missing its N-terminal Met (Bryan et al.,1993). We have not attempted to sequence native mouse fascin, but conclude that purified r-fascin probably corresponds to the native cytoplasmic form of the molecule with the exception of the changed ratios of isoforms. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mouse brain extracts revealed the presence of at least four isoelectric variants, two major and two minor species (Fig. 4, panel 1). Multiple variants were also seen in r-fascin (panel 2). Panel 3 shows the coelectrophoresis of brain and recombinant fascins. The four variants comigrate, and the results show that the most alkaline variant is most prominent in r-fascin. The minor spots in the upper left and lower right corners of panel 3 are the undigested fusion protein and the 39-kDa proteolytic fragment, respectively. The results suggest that fascin has been post-translationally modified to decrease its isoelectric point. This could occur either by phosphorylation or by modification of amino groups, e.g. methylation or acetylation of lysine. The results are consistent with r-fascin being incompletely modified, while most of the brain protein is altered. All of our attempts to provide support for the idea that fascin is phosphorylated have been negative. These efforts included: (i) treatment with acid or alkaline phosphatase, which did not change the two-dimensional gel pattern; (ii) metabolic labeling of 3T3 fibroblasts with 133PO4, which gave no incorporation of label into fascin; (iii) phosphorylation trials using purified rat brain protein kinase C (Huang et al., 1986Huang K.P. Chan K.F.J. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H. Huang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12134-12140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which failed to label r-fascin; and (iv) amino acid analysis of r-fascin, which indicated that only trace amounts of phosphoamino acids were present. The results of these experiments (data not shown) suggest that fascin isoforms are not the result of phosphorylation. Our inability to demonstrate phosphorylation of r-fascin in vitro or of native fascin in vivo suggested that fascin might have modified amino groups. To address this possibility, we subjected r-fascin to acid-urea electrophoresis (Allis et al., 1979Allis D. Glover V.C. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4857-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which separates peptides under acid pH conditions expected to resolve differences due to peptide acetylation, but not phosphorylation. As seen in Fig. 5, this two-dimensional gel system resolves r-fascin into at least three spots, suggesting their generation by acetylation. Recombinant fascin and the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein actively bundle F-actin. Bundles were generated at various actin/fascin ratios by mixing fascin and 3.5 or 7 μM F-actin and incubating at 4°C. Bundles were recovered by low speed centrifugation (22,000 × g for 15 min) to separate them from single filaments. The pelleted material was resuspended in 1% SDS, and the protein concentration was determined. At low levels of added fascin, the amount of protein recovered by low speed centrifugation increased nearly linearly with the amount of added fascin (Fig. 6). The values are corrected for F-actin pelleted in the absence of added fascin. The points in the linear range were used to calculate a regression line. The slope of this line, ~4.1, gives the weight ratio of bundles formed (defined by low speed sedimentation) per weight of added fascin. Assuming that all of the added fascin is incorporated into bundles, the slope gives a minimum estimate of the actin/fascin ratio of 4.1:1. A similar value is observed if the thioredoxin-fascin fusion protein is used in place of r-fascin. The structure of the bundles was examined by negative staining and quick-freezing. Highly ordered bundles were formed over the pH range 6.0-8.5 in 100 mM KCl at 4°C using a 6:1 actin/fascin ratio (5 μM actin, 0.83 μM fascin). A negatively stained bundle, formed at pH 7.0 from r-fascin and rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin, is shown in Fig. 7 a. A transverse periodicity spaced every 36 nm at an angle of 61° to the bundle axis is marked (Fig. 7 a, arrowheads). This periodicity is clearly visible in a reconstituted vitreous ice-embedded bundle (Fig. 7 b). To compare the fine structure of bundles formed from mammalian and invertebrate fascins, sea urchin filopodial cores, which consist almost entirely of actin and echinoid fascin (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), were also negatively stained (Fig. 7 c) and ice-embedded (Fig. 7 d). Due to the inherent axial twist in these bundles, one of two predominant banding patterns is seen, depending on which orientation of the bundle is observed. Near the right edge of the filopodial core, a constant 12-nm spacing is visible (Fig. 7 c, arrowheads). The frozen echinoid bundle shows pairs of bands 12 nm apart, separated by a spacing of 24 nm (Fig. 7 d, arrowheads). A similar spacing pattern can be discerned in Fig. 7 c (arrows). Reconstituted bundles produced with Drosophila fascin and chicken skeletal muscle F-actin (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) appear to be similar in structure to the fiber bundles found in Drosophila bristles (Overton, 1967Overton J. J. Morphol. 1967; 122: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, early experiments in which echinoid fascin was mixed with rabbit skeletal muscle actin produced bundles whose morphology was identical to the echinoid bundles shown in Fig. 7 (c and d). This suggests that fascin, not the actin filaments, determines the final bundle structure. To reinforce this conclusion, we determined the structure of bundles reconstituted from murine fascin and echinoid F-actin isolated from P. californicus. The resulting bundles were indistinguishable from the murine fascin-rabbit actin bundles shown in Fig. 7 (a and b). From these results, we conclude that the phenotype of a fascin-actin bundle is determined by the species of fascin, not actin, utilized. Fascin has been assumed to be an invertebrate actin filament-bundling protein. However, the recent cloning of sea urchin fascin (Bryan et al., 1993Bryan J. Edwards R. Matsudaira P. Otto J.J. Wulfkuhle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9115-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) indicates that this family of proteins is not related to other known actin-binding proteins and is far more diverse than previously thought. Homologs have been identified in Drosophila, humans, Xenopus, and now mice. This organismal diversity and the wide tissue distribution suggest that fascins may be a major organizing factor for actin filament bundles including fibroblast stress fibers and microspikes (Yamashiro-Matsumura and Matsumura, 1986Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), neuronal growth cone filopodia,2( 2R. A. Edwards and J. Bryan, unpublished data. ) abalone sperm acrosomal processes (Shiroya and Sakai, 1993Shiroya Y. Sakai Y.T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 323-329Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and more specialized structures like mechanosensory bristles in Drosophila (Overton, 1967Overton J. J. Morphol. 1967; 122: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A practical problem in studying recombinant fascins has been the insoluble nature of the bacterially expressed protein. This is in contrast to native echinoid fascin, which is easily soluble under a range of solution conditions (Bryan and Kane, 1978Bryan J. Kane R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 1982). We have used a novel thioredoxin expression plasmid (LaVallee et al., 1993LaVallee E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar) to produce mouse fascin as a soluble fusion protein. We have taken advantage of the fact that fascin is relatively resistant to digestion by α-chymotrypsin to cleave the fusion protein. A chromatographic procedure has been developed to purify the cleaved fascin, here termed r-fascin. The fusion protein and purified r-fascin both bundle filaments. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that native brain fascin, detected by Western blotting, has multiple charge isoforms. These same isoforms are found in r-fascin. The relative abundances indicate that the precursor of the other isoforms is the most alkaline variant. The present data support the idea that the isoforms are generated by modification of amino groups. While is it widely appreciated that eukaryotes modify amino groups via acetylation (Allis et al., 1979Allis D. Glover V.C. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4857-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and glutamylation (Eddé et al., 1990Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), it has only recently been demonstrated that peptides expressed in E. coli may be acetylated (Violand et al., 1994Violand B.N. Schlittler M.R. Lawson C.Q. Kane J.F. Siegel N.R. Smith C.E. Kolodziej E.W. Duffin K.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The significance of fascin isoforms is unclear since our preliminary data indicate that the two major brain isoforms are equally incorporated into bundles. A comparison of multiply aligned fascin sequences reveals several peptide motifs that are absolutely conserved. These motifs presumably are regions essential for fascin function, and we are attempting to map F-actin-binding sites on fascin. Our preliminary results suggest that the conserved N-terminal region may be critical for bundling since the C-terminal 39-kDa proteolytic fragment of fascin generated by α-chymotryptic digestion (Fig. 3, lane 6) is not incorporated into bundles with r-fascin and will not produce bundles when tested alone. Similarly, this fragment does not bind to F-actin. The importance of the other conserved regions remains to be tested. The bundles formed by mouse fascin appear to be morphologically different from those isolated from echinoid sources (Bryan and Kane, 1982Bryan J. Kane R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 175-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or reconstituted from Drosophila fascins (Cant et al., 1994Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One major difference is that the transverse bands seen in bundles formed by vertebrate fascin are not perpendicular to the bundle axis as the echinoid bands are. The periodicity patterns also differ. The 33-36-nm periodicity described by Kane, 1976Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar is visible in all of these bundles. The constant 11-12-nm periodicity of echinoid and Drosophila bundles has not been observed in reconstituted mouse fascin bundles. The stoichiometries of bundles formed by the three fascins are, however, quite similar, with estimated actin/fascin ratios of 4.6:1 for echinoid bundles, 4.3:1 for Drosophila bundles, and 4.1:1 for murine bundles. These numbers are consistent with a model of fascin-actin bundles (DeRosier et al., 1977DeRosier D.J. Mandelkow E. Silliman A. Tilney L. Kane R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 679-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; DeRosier and Censullo, 1981DeRosier D.J. Censullo R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that proposes one cross-link/4.5 actin subunits if each cross-link is a fascin monomer. This model is based on negatively stained images and depends critically on the values of the actin filament helical parameters. The x-ray structures for G-actin (Kabsch et al., 1990Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) and F-actin (Holmes et al., 1990Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) have refined the measurements of these parameters. The numbers used for F-actin in the DeRosier model differ by ~7-8% from those given by the Holmes model. It will be necessary to alter the bundle model to accommodate these newer parameters, but it is not clear if inclusion of the new parameters will alter the predicted cross-link/actin ratio or if the model can accommodate the vertebrate structure. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we are currently refining structural models for both the echinoid fascin and reconstituted mouse r-fascin bundles. At this time, the reasons for the structural differences are not clear since the proteins themselves, the sources of F-actin used for reconstitution, and the solution conditions used to produce echinoid, Drosophila, and murine bundles were all different. Since the bundles produced from murine and echinoid fascins retain their individual morphology independent of the species of F-actin used for reconstitution, we conclude that fascin directs which class of bundle structure is formed. The invertebrate structure with a banding pattern perpendicular to the filament axis is seen in echinoid and Drosophila bundles. The vertebrate structure is defined by tilted transverse bands as seen in reconstituted murine fascin-actin bundles. The invertebrate pattern has been seen clearly in situ and has been used to localize fascin. The differentiation of a novel murine bundle pattern should now provide a similar means to localize fascin to vertebrate fascin-actin bundles in situ.

The 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 is able to bind to clathrin triskelia and assemble them into a homogeneous population of clathrin cages and will also bind to preassembled clathrin cages. The 42-kDa central region of AP-3 can bind to both clathrin triskelia and to clathrin cages, but cannot assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. The 16-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 can bind to clathrin cages, but cannot bind to clathrin triskelia or assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. The clathrin binding activities of the 42-kDa central region and 16-kDa C-terminal region are weaker than the corresponding activity of either the 58-kDa C-terminal region or full-length AP-3. Previous efforts had mapped a clathrin binding site within the N-terminal 33 kDa of AP-3 (Murphy, J. E., Pleasure, I. T., Puszkin, S., Prasad, K., and Keen, J. H. (1991) J. Biol.

However, although the N-terminal 33 kDa of AP-3 is able to bind to clathrin triskelia (Murphy, J. E., Pleasure, I. T., Puszkin, S., Prasad, K., and Keen, J. H. (1991) J. Biol.

Res. 41, 15-26) or bind to preassembled clathrin cages (Ye, W., and Lafer, E. M. (1995) J. Neurosci. Res. 41, 15-26). It appears that the smallest functional unit that carries out all of the reported clathrin binding and assembly properties of AP-3, essentially as well as the full-length protein, is the 58-kDa C-terminal region. We separately expressed the 58-kDa C-terminal, 42-kDa middle, 16-kDa C-terminal, and 33-kDa N-terminal regions of AP-3 (also called F1-20, AP180, NP185, and pp155), and determined their clathrin binding and assembly properties.

It appears that the smallest functional unit that carries out all of the reported clathrin binding and assembly properties of AP-3, essentially as well as the full-length protein, is the 58-kDa C-terminal region. Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in pathways of receptor-mediated intracellular transport (4Pley U. Parham P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 431-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These include the movement of proteins from the trans-Golgi network to secretory vesicles for regulated secretion, the transfer of lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the biogenesis and recycling of synaptic vesicles. The protein coats of clathrin-coated vesicles have been well characterized (5Kirchhausen T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 182-188Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The major coat protein is clathrin (6Pearse B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The solution form of clathrin is the triskelion, which consists of three identical clathrin heavy chains (192 kDa) and three clathrin light chains (22-28 kDa) (7Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 755-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Jackson A.P. Seow H.F. Holmes N. Drickamer K. Parham P.

Triskelions can associate with one another to form icosahedral cages. When these structures form at the surface of a cell membrane, the membrane invaginates into a coated pit, followed by its separation from the parent membrane as a coated vesicle. Coated vesicles also contain one or more of the assembly proteins: AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, or auxilin (12Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Zaremba S. Keen J.H.

The assembly proteins all share the property that they promote the assembly of clathrin triskelia into a homogeneous population of clathrin cages in solution (12Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Ahle S.

In vivo, the assembly proteins are believed to sit between the cell membrane and the clathrin cage (18Vigers G.P. Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The assembly proteins are thought to be involved in directing clathrin cage assembly to a particular cell membrane through an interaction with a membrane receptor (19Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Much remains to be elucidated concerning the mechanism by which clathrin assembly is promoted by a clathrin assembly protein and how this assembly might be regulated. The assembly proteins AP-1 and AP-2 are tetramers, whereas the assembly proteins AP-3 and auxilin are monomers. AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 have been cloned and sequenced (20Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a monomer, AP-3 represents a simple system in which to investigate how a clathrin assembly protein promotes clathrin assembly. AP-3 is the only clathrin assembly protein shown to be synapse-specific (24Perry D.G. Hanson V. Benuck M.L. Puszkin S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Perry D.G. Li S. Hanson V. Puszkin S. J. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2130-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a specialized role in the life cycle of the synaptic vesicle (27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding how AP-3 functions will also make a contribution toward elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying neurotransmission. AP-3 was independently discovered in a number of laboratories, and has been known as pp155 (28Keen J.H. Black M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), AP180 (16Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), NP185 (29Kohtz D.S.

Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), as well as a high affinity receptor for specific inositol polyphosphates (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These two functions are intimately related, since binding of specific inositol polyphosphates has been shown to inhibit clathrin assembly (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase bovine serum albumin GST fused with full-length AP-3 (isoform AS15-AS108+) GST, fused with amino acids 305-744 of AP-3 (isoform AS15-AS108+) GST, fused with amino acids 1-304 of AP-3 (isoform AS15-AS108+) GST, fused with amino acids 745-901 of AP-3 (isoform AS15-AS108+) GST, fused with amino acids 305-744 of AP-3 (isoform AS15-AS108+) phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. In order to begin to understand the structure-function relationships of AP-3, clathrin binding properties of proteolytic fragments of AP-3 were studied (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It was found that the 33-kDa N-terminal region could bind to clathrin triskelia, leading to the conclusion that the 33-kDa N-terminal region was a clathrin binding domain (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this same study it was found that the 33-kDa N-terminal region was insufficient for clathrin assembly. We confirmed these findings utilizing the bacterially expressed N-terminal 33-kDa region of AP-3 and extended them by showing that the 33-kDa N-terminal region could bind to clathrin triskelia, but not to preassembled clathrin cages (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggested that clathrin triskelion binding and clathrin cage binding are not functionally equivalent. It was also shown that the 33-kDa N-terminal region contained a high affinity binding site for specific inositol polyphosphates (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol.

In the current study, we undertook an analysis of the clathrin binding and assembly properties of additional individually expressed regions of AP-3. We found that the 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 had all of the clathrin binding and assembly properties of full-length AP-3. Previous proteolysis studies (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that the 58-kDa C-terminal region could be further divided into a 42-kDa central domain and a 16-kDa C-terminal domain. We found that the 42-kDa central region could bind to clathrin cages and clathrin triskelia and that the 16-kDa C-terminal region could bind to clathrin cages. However, neither of the latter two regions alone could assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. All buffers used in the protein work, even if not explicitly indicated in the citations, contained 0.1 mM PMSF. The proteins GST-AP-3 (AS15-AS108+) (27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S.

Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and GST were all expressed and purified exactly as described previously (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bovine brain clathrin was purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles as described previously (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci.

SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified clathrin revealed three silver-stained bands, corresponding in apparent molecular weight to clathrin heavy chain and to the two clathrin light chains. Clathrin was determined to be free of detectable contaminating AP-3 by Western blot analysis with the F1-20 monoclonal antibody utilizing the ECL detection system (27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three cycles of assembly-disassembly was carried out (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci.

Monoclonal antibody F21-5 was generated by fusion of spleens from mice immunized with clathrin which was free of AP-3 as determined by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody F1-20. F21-5 was found to be specific for clathrin heavy chain and did not display cross-reactivity with bacterially expressed or bovine AP-3, clathrin light chains, AP-1 or AP-2. 2E. M. Lafer, W.

Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This construct (pGEX3X-F1-20-COOH58 kDa) was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 for protein expression. GST-C58 kDa was expressed and purified as described previously (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A construct expressing GST-C16 kDa was constructed as follows. Plasmid pGEX3X-F1-20-COOH58 kDa was digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI and StuI, followed by mung bean nuclease treatment and agarose gel electrophoresis. The largest fragment was purified and ligated to form closed circular DNA. The new construct (pGEX3X-F1-20-COOH16 kDa) was introduced into E. coli DH5α for protein expression. GST-C16 kDa was expressed and purified under the same conditions as GST-AP-3 (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci.

A construct expressing GST-M42 kDa was constructed as follows. Plasmid pGEX3X-F1-20-COOH58 kDa was digested with restriction endonucleases StuI and EcoR I, followed by mung bean nuclease treatment and agarose gel electrophoresis. The largest fragment was purified and ligated to form closed circular DNA. The new construct (pGEX3X-F1-20-middle 42 kDa) was introduced into E. coli DH5α for protein expression. GST-M42 kDa was expressed and purified under the same conditions as GST-AP-3 (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that the cells were grown for 4 h following isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. Methods Clathrin cage binding assays were carried out as described (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Lindner R. Ungewickell E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except that all the GST-fusion proteins were used at 20 μM, clathrin was used at 1.8 μM (corresponding to molarity of triskelia; 1.2 mg/ml), and all of the binding reactions were carried out in isolation buffer (0.1 M MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 6.7). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis. The Western blots were stained with a monoclonal antibody against GST (“GST (12Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)” from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and visualized utilizing the ECL detection method, as described (27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of the GST-fusion proteins between the pellet and supernatant fractions was quantitated using the Millipore BioImage system with 3cx scanner. Values given in the text for the percent fusion protein bound represent: the percent fusion protein in the pellet in the sample containing clathrin - the percent fusion protein in the pellet in the parallel reaction not containing clathrin. GST-AP-3, GST-C58 kDa, GST-M42 kDa, GST-C16 kDa, and GST were each bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rather then eluting the bound proteins with glutathione, each resin was then equilibrated with ice-cold isolation buffer (0.1 M MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.7) containing 0.1 mM PMSF and 0.01% gelatin. 0.4 mg/ml clathrin triskelia in isolation buffer were incubated with an equal volume of each resin at 4°C for 2 h with rocking. The resins were pelleted by a 5-s microcentrifugation, and the supernatants were removed. The supernatants were labeled F for flow-through in Fig. 2 and correspond to the unbound material. The resins were washed six times with an equal volume of ice-cold isolation buffer containing 0.1 mM PMSF and 0.01% gelatin. The last wash was found to be free of clathrin by Western blot analysis using the clathrin heavy chain-specific monoclonal antibody F21-5, indicating that all nonspecifically bound material was removed. The beads were then eluted by boiling for 5 min in an equal volume of 1 × SDS sample buffer, followed by a 5-s microcentrifugation, and the supernatants were removed. These supernatants were labeled B for bound material in Fig. 2. All of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis using the clathrin heavy chain-specific monoclonal antibody F21-5 with the ECL detection system. A parallel set of experiments was carried out using 0.4 mg/ml BSA instead of clathrin triskelia in the incubation mix to ensure that the resins did not nonspecifically bind to proteins in the solution. These blots were blocked with 0.10% gelatin instead of BSA and stained with a monoclonal anti-BSA antibody (Sigma B2901). 3 μM clathrin triskelia were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against isolation buffer with the addition of 20 μM of either GST, GST-AP-3, GST-C58 kDa, GST-M42 kDa, GST-C16 kDa, GST-N33 kDa, or GST, as indicated in the figure legend to Fig. 3. Following a 3-min centrifugation at 13,600 × g to remove nonspecific aggregates, newly assembled clathrin cages were pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis using the anti-clathrin heavy chain-specific monoclonal antibody F21-5. The distribution of clathrin heavy chain between the pellet and supernatant fractions was quantitated using the Millipore BioImage system with 3cx scanner. For the quantitative assembly plot (Fig. 4), assays were carried out as described above, except that the concentration of test assembly protein was varied, as indicated on the plot. Each point on the plot represents the average of triplicate determinations. The morphology of the products of the assembly assays using either 20 μM GST-AP-3, 20 μM GST-C58 kDa, or 20 μM GST were evaluated by negative staining electron microscopy, as described (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Figure 4:The 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 assembles clathrin as efficiently as full-length AP-3. Quantitative assembly assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3 μM clathrin triskelia were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against isolation buffer with the addition of one of the following test assembly proteins at the concentrations indicated in the figure: GST-AP-3 (closed circle), GST-C58 kDa (open circle), GST-C16 kDa (closed square), GST-M42 kDa (closed triangle), or GST (×). Each data point represents the mean from three experiments with the error bars representing the standard deviations derived from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies had demonstrated that bacterially expressed AP-3 could bind to clathrin cages, whereas the 33-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 (amino acid residues 1-304) could not bind to clathrin cages (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the ability of the 58 kDa C-terminal region (amino acid residues 305-901), the 42 kDa central region (amino acid residues 305-744), and the 16 kDa C-terminal region (amino acid residues 745-901) of AP-3 to bind to preassembled clathrin cages (Fig. 1). In this assay, the ability of the indicated GST fusion proteins to co-sediment with the pre-assembled clathrin cages was monitored by Western blot analysis with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody, and subjected to a quantitative analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consistent with previous observations (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) we found 88% binding of GST-AP-3 (lanes 1-4) (positive control) and 0.2% binding of GST-N33 kDa (lanes 5-8) (negative control) to the clathrin cages. In experiments utilizing the newly expressed domains, we found 86% GST-C58 kDa (lanes 9-12), 42% GST-M42 kDa (lanes 13-16), and 51% GST-C16 kDa (lanes 17-20) bound to the clathrin cages. The GST negative control showed 0% binding to the clathrin cages (lanes 21-24). We conclude that the 58-kDa C-terminal region, the 42-kDa central region, and 16-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 all bind to clathrin cages. Previously, we showed that the bacterially expressed 33-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 could bind to clathrin triskelia, but could not assemble clathrin triskelia into cages or bind to preassembled clathrin cages (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggested that binding to clathrin triskelia and clathrin cages were not functionally equivalent. In the present study, we examined the ability of the 58-kDa C-terminal region, the 42-kDa central region, and the 16-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 to bind to clathrin triskelia. For these experiments, we coupled proteins GST-AP-3, GST-C58 kDa, GST-M42 kDa, GST-C16 kDa, and GST to glutathione-Sepharose. A solution of clathrin triskelia, or as a control a solution of BSA, was incubated with each resin. The resins were washed to remove nonspecifically bound protein, followed by solubilization of the bound material by boiling each resin in SDS-sample buffer. The flow-through (labeled F) and bound (labeled B) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The gels in the top panel were stained for total protein with Coomassie Blue, and the gels in the bottom panel were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with either an anti-clathrin heavy chain-specific monoclonal antibody (lanes 1-10) or anti-BSA monoclonal antibody (lanes 11-20). Note that the GST fusion proteins also eluted from the resins by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and showed up in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. None of the resins retained the BSA (lanes 11-20), indicating that the resins did not nonspecifically bind to proteins. In experiments utilizing GST-AP-3 and GST-C58 kDa resins, all the clathrin triskelia were found in the bound fractions (lanes 1-4). This confirmed that GST-AP-3 can bind to clathrin triskelia and demonstrated that GST-C58 kDa can bind to clathrin triskelia. In experiments utilizing GST-M42 kDa resin, clathrin triskelia were found both in the flow-through fraction (lane 5) and bound fraction (lane 6). This indicated binding between clathrin triskelia and GST-M42 kDa. In experiments utilizing either GST-C16 kDa, or GST (negative control), essentially all of the clathrin triskelia were found in the flow-through fractions (lanes 7-10), indicating that clathrin triskelia did not bind to either of these proteins under these assay conditions. We also increased the concentration of clathrin in the assay by a factor of 3 (1.2 mg/ml) and were still unable to detect any binding of clathrin triskelia to GST-C16 kDa. It had been shown previously that bacterially expressed GST-AP-3 could assemble clathrin triskelia into cages, whereas the bacterially expressed 33-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 was insufficient for clathrin assembly (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In order to further localize the regions of AP-3 required for clathrin assembly, we compared the ability of GST-AP-3, GST-C58 kDa, GST-M42 kDa, GST-C16 kDa, GST-N33 kDa, and GST to assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. In this assay, we monitored clathrin assembly as the movement of clathrin from a 100,000 × g soluble form (triskelia) to a 100,000 × g insoluble form (cages) following dialysis with a test assembly protein (Fig. 3). In the gel displayed, it is clear that clathrin moves from the supernatant to the pellet in the presence of GST-AP-3 (lanes 1 and 2) or GST-C58 kDa (lanes 3 and 4), indicative of clathrin assembly. However, no movement of clathrin is seen from the supernatant to the pellet in the presence of GST-M42 kDa (lanes 5 and 6), GST-C16 kDa (lanes 7 and 8), or GST-N33 kDa (lanes 9 and 10), compared with the negative control GST (lanes 11 and 12). When these experiments were carried out over a wider range of protein concentrations, and subjected to a quantitative analysis (Fig. 4), it was found that the 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 assembles clathrin as well as the full-length protein. No significant clathrin assembly was found by GST-M42 kDa, GST-C16 kDa, GST-N33 kDa, or GST. A hallmark of factor-dependent clathrin assembly is the homogeneity of the cages formed. Analysis of the morphology of the cages assembled in the experiment shown in Fig. 3 is presented in Fig. 5. It is apparent that no cages were formed with GST (Fig. 5 A) and that both GST-AP-3 (Fig. 5 B) and GST-C58 kDa (Fig. 5 C) assembled clathrin triskelia into a homogeneous population of clathrin cages. We conclude that the 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 is sufficient to assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. The results of the study presented here were integrated with the previously published studies, to prepare a summary of structure-function relationships for AP-3 (Fig. 6). These relationships are diagrammed against the distribution of acidic and basic residues in the primary structure of AP-3. Previously, it was reported that the 33-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 contained a high affinity binding site for specific inositol polyphosphates, with similar binding parameters as full-length AP-3 (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We show that the 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 is able to bind to clathrin triskelia and assemble them into a homogeneous population of clathrin cages and will also bind to preassembled clathrin cages. We also show that the clathrin triskelia binding, clathrin cage binding, and clathrin assembly activities of the 58-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 are essentially indistinguishable from that of the full-length protein. We found that the 42-kDa central region of AP-3 can bind to both clathrin triskelia and to clathrin cages, but cannot assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. We found that the 16-kDa C-terminal region of AP-3 can bind to clathrin cages, but cannot bind to clathrin triskelia or assemble clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages. We noted that the clathrin binding activities of the 42-kDa central region and 16-kDa C-terminal region are weaker than the corresponding activity of either the 58-kDa C-terminal region or full-length AP-3. Previous efforts had mapped a clathrin binding site within the N-terminal 33 kDa of AP-3 (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, although the N-terminal 33 kDa of AP-3 is able to bind to clathrin triskelia (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it does not promote their assembly into clathrin cages (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or bind to preassembled clathrin cages (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It appears that the smallest functional unit that carries out all of the reported clathrin binding and assembly properties of AP-3, essentially as well as the full-length protein, is the 58-kDa C-terminal region. The data presented in this study allow us to consider alternative interpretations to previously published studies. In clathrin cage binding assays utilizing a partial trypsin digestion of AP-3, bands with apparent molecular masses of 148, 107, and 33 kDa were found to co-sediment with preassembled clathrin cages (2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the digestion products revealed that the 33-kDa fragment corresponded to the 33-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 and that the 107-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment began at amino acid 304. The interpretation presented was that the 33-kDa N-terminal region bound specifically to the cages and that the 107-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment was only retained by the cages due to a noncovalent association with the 33-kDa N-terminal fragment. Our demonstration of clathrin cage binding by the 58-kDa C-terminal region, the 42-kDa central region, and the 16-kDa C-terminal region, coupled with the lack of clathrin cage binding by the 33-kDa N-terminal region (3Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggest an alternative interpretation of these proteolysis studies. Possibly it was the 107-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment that was bound specifically to the cages, and the 33-kDa N-terminal fragment was only retained by the cages due to a noncovalent association with the 107-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment. Similarly, in the clathrin triskelia binding assays in which it was shown that the 33-kDa N-terminal region could bind to clathrin triskelia, some retention by the clathrin-Sepharose of a 135-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment and a 100-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment were also observed (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the 100-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment was not bound directly to the clathrin triskelia, but was retained by a noncovalent association with the 33-kDa N-terminal fragment. Our data allow one to consider the possibility that both the 33-kDa N-terminal fragment and 100-kDa apparent molecular mass fragment were specifically retained by the clathrin-Sepharose. Analysis (27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar) of the amino acid sequence of AP-3 (23Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed clear divisions between the characteristics of the ~30-kDa N-terminal region and the ~60-kDa C-terminal region. The ~60-kDa C-terminal region has an unusual self-repeating primary structure, a preponderance of acidic residues, an unusually high proline, serine, threonine, and alanine content, and is predicted to have a high content of irregular secondary structure. The ~30-kDa N-terminal region of AP-3 has an amino acid composition typical of a globular protein, with a roughly equal balance of acidic and basic residues, and is predicted to have a high alpha helix content. It was suggested that AP-3 has an essentially neutral ~30-kDa N-terminal domain with an amino acid composition typical of a globular structure and an acidic ~60-kDa C-terminal domain with a highly repetitive and redundant amino acid composition (23Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data were consistent with published proteolysis studies (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which had shown that limited digestion with a number of different proteases generated a stable ~30-kDa fragment, which was later shown (2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to correspond to the 33-kDa N-terminal region. Other investigators (2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) proposed a further division within the 58-kDa C-terminal region into a 42-kDa central acidic domain and a 16-kDa C-terminal domain. These assignments were based on the identification of these regions as products of partial proteolysis reactions (1Murphy J.E. Pleasure I.T. Puszkin S. Prasad K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E.

The results of this study lend additional support to the assignment of a 33-kDa N-terminal domain and a 58-kDa C-terminal domain. The 33-kDa N-terminal domain is a high affinity receptor for inositol polyphosphates (33Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol.

The 58-kDa C-terminal domain is a fully functional clathrin binding and assembly domain. Evidence supporting the further subdivision of the 58-kDa C-terminal domain into a 42-kDa central domain, and a 16-kDa C-terminal domain, is more tenuous at this time. We found that each of these proteins is less stable than the 33-kDa N-terminal or 58-kDa C-terminal regions. For example, we were able to identify conditions under which we could stably prepare both the 33-kDa N-terminal region and the 58-kDa C-terminal region free of GST. However, we were not able to identify conditions, even with extensive testing, under which we could prepare stable 42-kDa central region and 16-kDa C-terminal region free of GST (data not shown). The reported binding properties of these fragments are interesting, but their meaning is subject to several possible interpretations. For example, it is possible that the 42-kDa central region, and the 16-kDa C-terminal region, each contain a distinct binding site for clathrin cages. Alternatively, it is possible that in the 58-kDa C-terminal region, residues from both the 42-kDa central region and 16-kDa C-terminal region contribute to a single clathrin binding and assembly site. When expressed and studied separately, the residues can make sufficient contacts to account for the clathrin binding observed in this study, but not to carry out clathrin assembly. Distinguishing between these various possibilities may require the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of AP-3. This study raises two intriguing and important questions. Why is there is a binding site for clathrin triskelia in the 33-kDa N-terminal domain, when the 58-kDa C-terminal domain binds and assembles clathrin as well as the full-length protein? How does an inositol polyphosphate binding site in the 33-kDa N-terminal domain modulate the clathrin assembly activity which we show here is present in the 58-kDa C-terminal domain? While at this point in time we can only speculate, it is interesting to consider that the 33-kDa N-terminal domain may function as a regulatory domain, and the 58-kDa C-terminal domain may function as a clathrin assembly domain. In this light, it is provocative that the 33-kDa N-terminal domain binds to a site on clathrin triskelia that either becomes inaccessible or changes conformation upon assembly of the triskelia into cages. Answers to these interesting questions await future studies."

In the major secretory pathway, βAPP is cleaved by α-secretase within the region comprising the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), resulting in release of a soluble NH2-terminal exodomain (APPα) and a 3-kDa peptide (p3) derived from the carboxyl-terminal tail. In the alternative amyloidogenic pathway, βAPP is cleaved by β-secretase, with the release of a truncated exodomain (APPβ) and an intact Aβ peptide. When βAPP751 was coexpressed with Rab1B(wt) or dominant-negative Rab1B mutants (Rab1BN121I or Rab1BS22N) there was a marked decrease in conversion of the immature Endo-H sensitive form of βAPP751 (108 kDa) to the mature O-glycosylated form of βAPP751 (130 kDa) in cells expressing the mutant forms of Rab1B. The block in Golgi-dependent processing of βAPP was accompanied by inhibition of secretion of APPS (APPα). A similar decrease in secretion of APPS (APPα+ APPβ) was observed in cells that were coexpressing Rab1BN121I with the “Swedish” variant of βAPP751 (i.e. βAPP SW751), which undergoes increased amyloidogenic processing. Coincident with the decline in APPS secretion, the cells coexpressing βAPP SW751 with Rab1BN121I showed a 90% decrease in Aβ secretion. The data indicate that Rab1B plays a key role in endoplasmic reticulum → Golgi transport of βAPP, and that βAPP must pass through a late Golgi compartment before entering either the α-secretase or the amyloidogenic β-secretase pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1989926271,"Using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assay, we have demonstrated that isolated oat etioplasts convert the linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin IXα to (3E)-phytochromobilin, the proposed precursor of the chromophore of the plant photoreceptor phytochrome. In addition to (3E)-phytochromobilin, the synthesis of a second phytochromobilin was detected by its ability to functionally assemble with recombinant oat apophytochrome A. The structure of this new pigment has been determined to be the 3Z isomer of phytochromobilin by absorption and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Like (3E)-phytochromobilin, assembly of HPLC-purified (3Z)-phytochromobilin with apophytochrome yielded a holoprotein that is spectrally indistinguishable from native oat phytochrome A. However, the postchromatographic conversion of (3Z)- to (3E)-phytochromobilin appears to be responsible for this result. Kinetic HPLC analyses have demonstrated that (3Z)-phytochromobiIin is synthesized prior to the 3E isomer by oat etioplasts. We therefore propose that (3Z)-phytochromobilin is the immediate product of biliverdin IXα reduction by the enzyme phytochromobilin synthase.

These two components are brought together in the plant cytosol where the mature photoreceptor is assembled. While the chemical structure of the protein-bound phytochrome chromophore has been known for some time (6Lagarias J.C. Rapoport H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 7Rudiger W. Thummler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the structure of PΦβ was only recently verified (8Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, a pigment with the 3E-PΦβ structure (see Fig. 1) was isolated from the red alga Porphyridium cruentum and shown to properly assemble with recombinant oat apophytochrome A. The resulting holophytochrome exhibited a spectrophotometric signature that was indistinguishable from that of oat phytochrome isolated from dark grown seedlings. Based on these investigations, we proposed that 3.E-PΦβ is the immediate precursor of the phytochrome chromophore. Until now, the intermediacy of 3E-PΦβ in the pathway of phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis has been primarily based upon an indirect coupled assay in which its production was detected after assembly with apophytochrome (9Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22215-22221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That study demonstrated that PΦβ is derived from biliverdin IXα (BV; see Fig. 1 for structure), a conversion that is accomplished by the plastid-localized enzyme, PΦβ synthase. In this report, we present direct experimental evidence for the conversion of BV to 3.E-PΦβ by oat etioplast preparations using a newly developed HPLC assay. These studies reveal that 3Z-PΦβ pigment is also produced during the incubation of BV with etioplasts (see Fig. 1 for structure). Based upon these investigations and the kinetics of the synthesis of the two PΦβ isomers, a revised pathway for the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore is proposed. Bilin Preparations—For all biochemical assays, reagent grade biliverdin IXα was prepared from bilirubin (Vega Biochemicals, Tucson, AZ) as described previously (10Elich T.D. McDonagh A.F. Palma L.A. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 1H NMR spectroscopy and data shown in Fig. 4, BV was further purified by HPLC as described under “HPLC Analyses.” 3E-PΦβ was purified from P. cruentum as described previously (8Cornejo J.

The molar absorption coefficient of 64,600 m–1 cm–1 at 386 nm in 2% HCl in methanol was used to estimate the concentration of the 3E-PΦβ standard used for HPLC analyses (12Weller J.-P. Gossauer A. Chem. Ber. 1980; 113: 1603-1611Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Etioplast Isolation—Oat seeds (Avena sativa L. cv Garry) were germinated and grown in the dark on vermiculite for 6 days at 25 °C. Shoot tissue was homogenized at 4 °C in a precooled Waring blender with an equal volume to fresh weight tissue of cold homogenization medium (50 mm MOPS/KOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 142 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and two layers of Miracloth and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization medium lacking 2-mercaptoethanol but including 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. This suspension was centrifuged at 100 × g for 1 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 2 min to give a pellet containing mostly intact plastids. Plastids were kept as a pellet on ice until required. Phytochromobilin Synthase Assay—Plastids were resuspended in PΦβ synthase assay buffer (20 mm TES, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.7, containing 500 mm sorbitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μμ leupeptin) containing 3000 units/ml catalase and an NADPH regenerating system (1.2 mm NADP+, 9.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1.5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 mm BV in Me2SO to give a final concentration of 10 μμ BV. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 28 °C in the dark for various lengths of time. Reaction volumes were routinely 2.5 or 5 ml for analytical assays, 40 ml for preparative assays, and 1 ml for kinetic measurements. Argon was typically used to remove oxygen from the reaction tubes both prior to and at hourly intervals throughout the assay. Following completion of the incubation period, samples were centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 15 min to remove the plastids. Bilins were partially purified on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters-Millipore Corp., Milford, MA) using the following procedure. Prior to application of the assay supernatant, the Sep-Pak cartridge was washed with acetonitrile, water, and 50 mm N-methylmorpholine/acetate buffer, pH 7.7. After application of the extract, the Sep-Pak cartridge was then sequentially washed with 50 mm N-methylmorpholine/acetate buffer, pH 7.7 (2 × 3 ml), 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (2 × 3 ml), and acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20:80; 2 × 2 ml). The crude bilin mixture was typically eluted with 3 ml acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (60:40) and dried in vacuo. Holophytochrome Assembly Assay—Recombinant apophytochrome was prepared from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 29A containing the full-length oat phytochrome (phyA3) cDNA plasmid pM-phyA3 as described previously (13Li L. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19204-19210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All phytochrome reconstitution experiments were performed under green safelight in a final volume of 500 μl of assembly buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Crude and HPLC-purified bilin preparations were added by diluting stock solutions in Me2SO by 100-fold to give an final bilin concentration of approximately 5 μμ. Apophytochrome was added from a 17.5 μg/ml stock in assembly buffer (described above). The final concentrations of apophytochrome and bilins in specific experiments are given in the appropriate figure legend. Following incubation for 15 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 5 °C for 15 min at 200,000 × g before measurement of phytochrome difference spectra. HPLC Analyses—Crude bilin samples were analyzed by C18 reverse phase HPLC using a Varían 5000 liquid Chromatograph and a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS column (5 μm; 10 mm × 250 mm). The mobile phase solvent consisted of ethanol/acetone/water/acetic acid (48/34717/1; v/v/v/v) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The column eluate was monitored at 380 nm with an Varian UV100 flow through absorbance detector. Peak areas were quantitated using a Hewlett Packard 3390A integrator. Before injection, all samples were dissolved in the HPLC solvent and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 s. HPLC-purified bilins were concentrated by diluting 1 to 4 with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and applying to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. After washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, bilins were eluted with acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (60: 40). The purified bilins were then dried in vacuo prior to spectroscopic analysis and/or reconstitution experiments. Spectroscopic Measurements—All absorbance measurements and phytochrome difference spectra were obtained using a Hewlett Packard 8450A UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra of 3Z- and 3E-PΦβ were taken in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (60:40; v/v) or 2% HCl in methanol at room temperature. Phytochrome difference spectra were measured at 5 °C as described previously (14Lagarias J.C. Kelly J.M. Cyr K.L. Smith Jr., W.O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 5-13Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra were obtained in pyridine-d5 (100.0 atom % D; Sigma catalog no. 23,699-3) at 28 °C using a GE Omega 500 spectrometer at the UCD NMR Facility. Protein Assay—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hemanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). Oat and Cucumber Etioplasts Synthesize 3E-PΦβ from BV—The conversion of biliverdin IXα (BV) to phytochromobilin (PΦβ) by oat etioplast preparations was analyzed using essentially the same reverse phase HPLC conditions described for the analysis of phycobilin biosynthesis (16Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (trace b), BV elutes as a peak with a retention time of approximately 17 min on this HPLC system. After incubation with plastids for 1 h at 28 °C in the presence of an NADPH regenerating system, BV is converted to a new pigment with a retention time of 28 min (Fig. 2, trace c). This 28-min peak was not observed in samples where either BV (Fig. 2, trace a) or plastids (Fig. 2, trace b) were omitted from the incubation medium. These results indicate that the new pigment is formed by the de novo conversion of BV by plastid enzyme activities. As shown in Fig. 2 (traces d and e), the retention time of this new pigment is identical with that of 3E-PΦβ (see structure in Fig. 1). In addition, the absorption spectrum of the new pigment is indistinguishable from that of 3E-PΦβ (data not shown). Based on these results and phytochrome reconstitution experiments (see next section), it is clear that the new pigment is 3E-PΦβ. To compare with previous studies (9Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22215-22221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cucumber etioplast preparations were similarly analyzed with the above HPLC system. These studies confirmed that BV is converted to 3E-PΦβ in this tissue as expected (data not shown). Under similar experimental conditions, however, cucumber etioplasts yielded a reduced amount of 3.E-PΦβ by comparison with oat etioplasts (data not shown). For this reason, subsequent investigations have exclusively utilized oat etioplasts to study the enzymatic conversion of BV to 3E-PΦβ. A Second Phytochromobilin Is Also Synthesized by Oat Etioplasts—To further confirm the identity of the 3E-PΦβ peak produced by incubation of BV with plastids, phytochrome reconstitution experiments were performed. This entailed incubation of the HPLC-purified pigment with recombinant apophytochrome and determination of a phytochrome difference spectrum. Since previous studies have shown that BV does not assemble with apophytochrome (13Li L. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19204-19210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the BV peak was similarly analyzed as a negative control. These experiments revealed that both peaks yielded photoactive holophytochromes, thereby indicating that a second PΦβ was co-fractionating with BV on our HPLC system. As shown in Fig. 3, injection of larger amount of sample onto a preparative C18 column proved effective in partially resolving these co-eluting pigments (labeled as peaks b and c). These two components and two other pigment fractions, one that elutes at 3 min (peak a) and the other at 25 min (peak d), were individually collected and analyzed using the phytochrome assembly assay. The results of these phytochrome reconstitution experiments are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3. As observed in the experiment described above, two pigment fractions yielded photoactive holophytochrome. Moreover, the difference spectra were essentially indistinguishable from that of phytochrome isolated from etiolated oat seedlings (i.e. with maxima at 666 nm and minima at 730 nm). Further spectrophotometric analyses using more concentrated samples of these holophytochrome species confirmed this result (data not shown). Owing to the observations that peak d represents 3E-PΦβ (see above discussion) and authentic 3E-PΦβ is a biologically active phytochrome chromophore precursor (8Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional assembly of peak d was expected. The identity of peak b is addressed in the subsequent discussion. Reconstitution experiments were also performed with the other two peaks; however, in both cases very low amounts of photoactive holophytochrome were produced (Fig. 3, panels a and c). Since peak c was identified as BV (data not shown), the small amount of holophytochrome produced is probably due to a small amount of contamination from the novel PΦβ in peak b. The reason for the small amount of holophytochrome obtained with peak a was not further investigated. The Second Phytochromobilin Is 3Z-PΦβ—The difference spectrum of the peak b-derived holophytochrome species and the earlier retention time of this pigment compared with 3EPΦβ both support the hypothesis that peak b is 3Z-PΦβ (see Fig. 1 for structure). The 3Z isomers of the phycobiliprotein chromophore precursors, phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phycoerythrobilin (PEB), both elute earlier than their corresponding 3E isomers on a similar HPLC system (16Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of HPLC-purified peak b is also consistent with this interpretation. As shown in Fig. 4, both absorption maxima of peak b are blue-shifted relative to those of 3.E-PΦβ in acetonitrile/0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (60:40, v/v) solvent. The absorption maxima of synthetic 3Z-PΦβ and 3Z-PCB dimethyl esters show similar blue shifts compared with their corresponding 3E isomers (12Weller J.-P. Gossauer A. Chem. Ber. 1980; 113: 1603-1611Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When the spectra of peak b and 3E-PΦβ were compared in 2% HCl in methanol, however, the absorption spectra of peak b and 3E-PΦβ are indistinguishable. To address this apparent discrepancy with the literature, the peak b sample was reanalyzed by HPLC after dissolving in 2% HCl in methanol. This analysis revealed that peak b is unstable in the solvent and in part converts to 3.E-PΦβ (data not shown). Based on all of the above information taken together, it appears reasonable that peak b is 3Z-PΦβ. To ascertain the chemical composition of peak b, its 1H NMR spectrum in pyridine-d5 was determined and is presented in Fig. 5. Detailed analysis of this spectrum indicates that peak b consists of three bilin components. In addition to the new PΦβ pigment, two of these components proved to be known bilins (i.e. BV and 3E-PΦβ). BV was expected to be a component of this mixture, since the BV peak (i.e. peak c) partially overlaps peak b in our HPLC system. 3.E-PΦβ appears to have arisen by a post-chromatographic chemical interconversion of the new PΦβ, a hypothesis that has been confirmed by HPLC (see “Discussion”). The three pigments are present in unequal amounts in the peak b NMR sample, an observation that has greatly facilitated the assignments of specific resonances to individual bilin components. The relative intensities of bilin-specific resonances indicates a molar ratio of 20% BV, 25% 3E-PΦβ, and 55% new PΦβ in the peak b mixture. The complete assignments of the 1H NMR spectra of the three components of peak b are summarized in Table I. All resonances attributable to BV and 3E-PΦβ were made by respective comparison with published data (8Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22341-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our own NMR measurements of purified BV in pyridine-d5 (data not shown). Without exception, the chemical shift positions of all proton signals for both bilins agreed with those of their purified counterparts within 0.01 ppm. Both homonuclear spin decoupling experiments and comparison with the 1H NMR spectra of other known bilins contributed to the interpretation of the spectrum of the new PΦβ component. The new bilin possesses the characteristic NMR signature of an ethylidene-containing dihydrobilatriene (i.e. two methyl doublets at 1.44 and 1.95 ppm). Homonuclear spin decoupling experiments shown in Fig. 6 and chemical shift positions of the coupled resonances support the assignment of the two doublets to the 2- and 3 2M. T. McDowell and J. C. Lagarias, unpublished results.-methyl groups, respectively. These experiments indicated that the 1.95 ppm methyl doublet is J-coupled to the doublet of quartets in the aromatic region at 5.79 ppm, while the 1.44 ppm doublet is coupled with the quartet in the methine region at 3.31 ppm. Double irradiation of the 3.31 ppm quartet also collapsed the 1.50 ppm doublet to a singlet, which confirms the assignment of this methyl group resonance to the 2-methyl group of 3E-PΦβ (Fig. 6). This result indicates that the magnetic environment of the C2 hydrogen of the new PΦβ is the same as that of 3E-PEB.Table I500 MHz 1H NMR spectral data for HPLC-purified peak b in pyridine-d5Proton assignmentBiliverdin IXα(3E)-Phytochromobilin(3Z)-Phytochromobilin21methyl2.10 (s)1.50 (d, 7.4)1.44 (d, 7.4)32methylNot present1.69 (d, 7.7)1.95 (d, 7.4)71, 131, 171methyl2.00aResonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV., 2.04bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping., 2.08 (3s)2.02, 2.14bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping., 2.17 (3s)2.00aResonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV., 2.14bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping., 2.15 (3s)82, 1222.86 (m)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.2.86 (m)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.2.86 (m)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.82, 1213.11, 3.13 (2t)aResonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV.3.12, 3.18 (2t)a,Resonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV.bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.3.12, 3.20 (2t)a,Resonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV.bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.2Not present3.31 (q)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.3.31 (q)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.182vinyl (Hx)5.55 (dd)aResonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV.5.52 (dd)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.5.52 (dd)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.32vinyl (Ha)5.59 (dd)Not presentNot present32vinyl (Hb)5.71 (dd)Not presentNot present5methine5.99 (s)5.89 (s)5.82 (s)15methine6.08 (s)6.19 (s)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.6.19 (s)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.31ethylideneNot present6.33 (dq)5.79 (dq)182vinyl (Hb)6.63 (dd)6.76 (mABX)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.6.76 (mABX)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.181vinyl (Ha)6.72 (dd)6.78 (mABX)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.6.78 (mABX)bResonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping.31vinyl6.79 (dd)Not presentNot present10methine7.38 (s)7.28 (s)7.35 (s)a Resonances of one or both PΦβ isomers were overlapping with those of BV.b Resonances for both PΦβ isomers were overlapping. Open table in a new tab The C2 hydrogen signal is the only spectral feature attributable to the bilin α-ring that is the same for both PΦβs. By contrast, the 32-methyl group of the new PΦβ lies considerably downfield from that of 3E-PΦβ (i.e. 1.95 ppm versus 1.69 ppm), while the 31-ethylidene hydrogen to which it is coupled resonates upfield (i.e. 5.79 ppm versus 6.33 ppm). The relative chemical shift of these two resonances is known to be a good indicator of the configuration of the ethylidene double bond (8Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized in Table II, the chemical shifts of the 32- and 31-resonances for the new PΦβ are in good agreement with those of other (3Z)-ethylidene-containing linear tetrapyrroles. The upfield chemical shift of the 21-methyl group of the new bilin relative to that of 3E-PΦβ also supports the assignment of the 3Z configuration. With the sole exception of the two PEB isomers in pyridine-d5, the 21-methyl groups of the 3Z isomers occur at higher fields when compared in the same NMR solvent (see Table II). Slight shifts were also observed in the C5 and C10 methine bridge resonances and two of the four pyrrole ring methyl groups. Aside from these differences, the NMR spectra of both PΦBs are otherwise identical (Table I). Taken together, the 1H NMR data support the conclusion that the third bilin component in the peak b mixture is 3Z-PΦβ.Table IIChemical shift values (ppm relative to TMS) for the C3-ethylidene resonances and the C2-methyl group for (3E)- and (3Z)-ethylidene containing bilins and their dimethyl esters (DME) in different solventsCompoundSolvent32methyl31ethylidene21methylReference3Z-PΦβPyr-d6aPyr-d5, pyridine-d5.1.955.791.44This study3Z -PΦβ DMECDCl32.125.861.28123Z -PCB DMECDCl32.08, 2.095.84, 5.901.26, 1.2512, 163Z -PEBPyr-d52.185.771.35163E-PΦβPyr-d51.69, 1.726.33, 6.351.50, 1.52This study, 83E-PΦβ DMECDCl31.816.381.30123E-PCBPyr-ds1.646.231.4018bValues have been adjusted by adding 0.06 ppm to original hexamethyldisiloxane-referenced values.3E-PCB DMEPyr-d51.65, 1.726.24, 6.331.39, 1.4719bValues have been adjusted by adding 0.06 ppm to original hexamethyldisiloxane-referenced values., 203E-PEBPyr-d51.636.231.3121bValues have been adjusted by adding 0.06 ppm to original hexamethyldisiloxane-referenced values.3E-PEB DMECDCl31.89, 1.916.40, 6.401.41, 1.4322, 23a Pyr-d5, pyridine-d5.b Values have been adjusted by adding 0.06 ppm to original hexamethyldisiloxane-referenced values. Open table in a new tab 3Z-PΦβ Biosynthesis Precedes That of 3E-PΦβ—The synthesis of two PΦβ isomers raises the obvious question: which PΦβ isomer is synthesized first? To address this question, oat etioplasts were incubated with BV as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the following changes to improve PΦβ synthase activity; 5 mm sodium ascorbate replaced the 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and the pH of the reaction was lowered to 7.3. The HPLC mobile phase used for this experiment was changed to ethanol/acetone/100 mm formic acid (25/65/10;v/v/v). This change improved resolution of 3Z-PΦβ from BV and therefore allowed quantitation of the two bilins (data not shown). Fig. 7 shows the kinetics of 3Z- and 3E-PΦβ synthesis following the incubation of BV with oat etioplasts. For each time course experiment, the molar ratio of the three bilins (i.e. BV, 3E-PΦβ, and 3Z-PΦβ) was estimated by dividing the individual peak areas by the published molar absorption coefficient for each bilin. After normalization to the amount of BV present at the start of the incubation, these values were plotted as a function of incubation time (Fig. 7). This analysis clearly indicates that 3Z-PΦβ is produced prior to any detectable 3.E-PΦβ. At the 30-min time point, the level of 3EPΦβ was below the limit of detection, while 3Z-PΦβ was readily detectable. The inset to Fig. 7 shows that 3E-PΦβ appears only after an extended incubation period, during which time the level of the 3Z isomer remains roughly constant. These observations support the hypothesis that 3Z-PΦβ is the precursor of 3E-PΦβ. The reverse phase HPLC assay described here corroborates the hypothesis that 3E-PΦβ is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore as proposed earlier (9Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22215-22221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these studies show that a second PΦβ is produced during the incubation of BV with oat etioplast preparations. Initially detected by its functional assembly with apophytochrome, this new pigment has been identified to be 3Z-PΦβ by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Kinetic measurements presented here are consistent with the conclusion that the 3Z isomer of PΦβ is synthesized prior to the 3E isomer. This interpretation is supported by several other observations. First, recent biochemical investigations to further purify PΦβ synthase from oat etioplasts have yielded enzyme fractions that only convert BV to 3Z-PΦβ, which suggests that the 3Z isomer is the primary product of BV reduction by PΦβ synthase.2 Second, a bilin reductase that catalyzes the analogous reduction of a vinyl pyrrole moiety has been identified in the phycobiliprotein-containing red alga Cyanidium caldarium (17Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22341-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of this enzyme, which reduces 15,16-dihydro-BV, is the 3Z isomer of PEB. Based on evolutionary considerations, this observation lends support to the proposal that 3Z-PΦβ is the direct product of BV reduction in plants. Third, it is well established that 3E bilin isomers are thermodynamically more stable than their corresponding 3Z isomers. Synthetic 3Z-PCB dimethyl ester quantitatively converts to the 3E isomer in hot methanol, and, in acidic solvents, an equilibrium mixture of the two isomers is produced (25Gossauer A. Tetrahedron. 1983; 39: 1933-1941Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the isomerization of synthetic 3Z-PΦβ dimethyl ester was not previously reported (12Weller J.-P. Gossauer A. Chem. Ber. 1980; 113: 1603-1611Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the present investigation indicates that 3Z-PΦβ does interconvert to the 3E isomer in two solvent systems (i.e. pyridine-d5 and 2% HCl in methanol). These arguments support the proposed biosynthetic scheme shown in Fig. 8, in which the conversion of BV to 3E-PΦβ occurs in two steps. In the first step, we envisage that BV reduction to 3Z-PΦβ is mediated by the enzyme PΦβ synthase. Since the analogous 3Z to 3E interconversions in the pathway of phycobilin biosynthesis in the red alga Cyanidium are enzyme-mediated (16Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22341-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22328-22332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we favor the hypothesis that the second step is accomplished by an enzyme that we propose to name PΦβ isomerase. One of the interesting properties of 3Z-PΦβ is that while the absorption spectrum of the free pigment differs from that of 3E-PΦβ, the phytochrome difference spectra after assembly to oat apophytochrome A is indistinguishable for the two isomers. This result suggests that both PΦβs yield structurally identical holophytochromes, although this conclusion will require additional experiments, which are beyond the scope of this investigation. It is possible that the Z isomer itself does not assemble with apophytochrome A, but that its assembly requires isomerization to the E isomer. This hypothesis can now be tested directly using a fluorescence-based kinetic assay for holophytochrome assembly, which has recently been developed in our laboratory. 3L. Li, J. T. Murphy, and J. C. Lagarias, manuscript in preparation. A reduced ability (or inability) of 3Z-PΦβ to assemble with apophytochrome would be consistent with its role as an intermediate in the synthesis of the phytochrome chromophore precursor 3E-PΦβ. However, we would like to emphasize that only assembly to phytochrome A has been examined in this study. Other apophytochromes, such as B-E (27Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1745-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 28Clack T. Mathews S. Sharrock R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), may utilize the 3Z-PΦβ isomer as the immediate precursor of the protein-bound chromophore. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that the assembly of 3E-PCB to recombinant tobacco phytochrome β proceeds with an apparent rate constant very similar to that reported for phytochrome A from oat (29Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests that 3E-PΦβ is the natural precursor of the chromophores of both phytochromes A and B.

Rhodopsin is the major component of the outer segments of the vertebrate rod photoreceptor cell. This visual pigment consists of an integral membrane protein to which a chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, is covalently linked via a protonated Schiff base. Rhodopsin triggers the conversion of photon energy (light) into a graded membrane potential. The absorption of a photon leads to a number of discrete conformational changes in the protein moiety of the pigment (sequel of photointermediates → photocascade), finally resulting in the exposure of G-protein binding sites at the cytoplasmic surface of the protein. In the past decade, research has focused on analyzing the relationship between the structure of the receptor and its functional properties. Heterologous expression of the protein in combination with site-specific mutagenesis has become an attractive way to study this relationship. Several expression systems capable of in vitro biosynthesis of opsin have been described (1Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression levels in these systems are usually quite low compared to total cell protein (<0.5%) and even to total membrane protein. For most analyses, recombinant rhodopsin therefore has to be extensively purified. Several methods have been described for the purification of recombinant rhodopsin (1Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 4Nathans J. Weitz C.J. Agarwal N. Nir I. Papermaster D.S.

Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These methods often have the disadvantage that the obtained samples are still contaminated to a various extent with proteins derived from the cells, used for recombinant protein production (4Nathans J. Weitz C.J. Agarwal N. Nir I. Papermaster D.S. Vision Res. 1989; 29: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6DeCaluwé G.L.J. VanOostrum J. Janssen J.J.M. DeGrip W.J. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Quite pure preparations can be obtained using immunoaffinity chromatography (1Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, this approach is expensive (monoclonal antibody, peptides for elution), laborious (antibody production, purification, and coupling), and fairly inefficient (low column capacity, recovery only in the order of 50%). Hence, this procedure is not very suitable for production of larger amounts (1–10 mg of purified protein) required for structural studies (crystallization, FT-IR spectroscopy, 1The abbreviations used are: FT-IRFourier transform infraredIMACimmobilized metal affinity chromatographyv-Rhowild-type regenerated opsin produced in vitro by recombinant baculovirusv-Rhohisg6xC-terminally histidine-tagged regenerated opsin produced in vitro by recombinant baculovirusDoMdodecyl-β-1-maltosidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid;MES,4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHEPPS4-(2-hydroxyethy1)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic aciddsdouble-strandedNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis NMR spectroscopy).

VanOostrum J. Janssen J.J.M. DeGrip W.J. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Janssen J.J.M. DeCaluwé G.L.J. DeGrip W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus far, we have used concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography to purify rhodopsin produced in this system (6DeCaluwé G.L.J. VanOostrum J. Janssen J.J.M. DeGrip W.J. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which, combined with reconstitution into proteoliposomes, yields reasonably pure preparations (60–80%). However, it is quite inefficient. Because of contaminating viral glycoproteins, the column capacity for recombinant rhodopsin is small, and a laborious elution profile has to be applied. Here we report on an alternative approach, using a histidine tag engineered onto the C terminus of bovine opsin. Histidine tagging for purification of recombinant proteins by means of IMAC has been used for a number of proteins both in prokaryotic (8Gentz R. Certa U. Takaes B. Matile H. Döbeli H. Pink R.

A. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) expression systems, including recombinant baculovirus (12Chen X. Brash A.R. Funk C.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Wang M. Bentley W.E. Vakharia V. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1994; 43: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Reddy R.G. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Funk C.D. Marnett L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). None of these proteins, however, belonged to the superfamily of heptahelical G-protein-coupled membrane receptors of which rhodopsin is a member. Membrane proteins have to be solubilized with the help of specific detergents which may impair affinity techniques. Hence, we have evaluated IMAC for purification of recombinant rhodopsin. Here we will demonstrate that an adapted IMAC allows relatively simple, highly efficient single-step purification of histidine-tagged rhodopsin with an excellent purification factor (≥500). The procedure we developed is directly applicable to other membrane (receptor) proteins. Interestingly, the C-terminally located histidine tag slightly influences spectral properties (3 nm red-shift) and photocascade (downshift of the pKa of the Meta I ↔ Meta II equilibrium) of rhodopsin, however, without perturbing the structural changes accompanying the photocascade. The effects are fully reversible at higher ionic strength and probably represent unexpected electrostatic effects on selected rhodopsin properties. Materials—Dodecyl-β-1-maltoside (DoM) and nonyl-β-1-glucoside were prepared as described previously (15DeGrip W.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1979; 23: 321-335Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PIPES, HEPPS and MES buffers were purchased from Research Organics Inc., Trolox from Aldrich, and leupeptin from Sigma. AgCl windows were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. Construction of the Histidine Tag Transfer Vector (pAcJAC2)—A unique BamHI restriction sequence was engineered in front of the stop codon at the 3′-end of the cDNA-encoding bovine opsin (16Nathans J. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1983; 34: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad MutaGene kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This changed the original 3′-end coding sequence from 5′caa gtg gcg cct gcc taa gccc-3′ to 5′-caa gtg gat cct gcc taa gccc-3′ (Fig. 1B). Into this BamHI site we inserted a short synthetic dsDNA sequence with BamHI overhangs using the two complementary oligonucleotides 5′-gatcctcaccatcaccatcaccactagt-3′ and 5′-gatcactagtggtgatggtgatggtgag-3′. The resulting transfer vector, designated pAcJAC2 (Fig. 1A), encodes bovine opsin carrying 6 histidines at the C terminus (Fig. 1B). The sequence was confirmed by dideoxysequencing. We used pAcJAC2 to generate a recombinant baculovirus as described previously (17Janssen J.J.M. Mulder W.R. DeCaluwé G.L.J. Vlak J.M. DeGrip W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Regeneration and Purification of v-Rhohis6x—Baculovirus propagation, transfection, isolation of recombinant virus, and Sf9 insect cell culture are performed as described previously (17Janssen J.J.M. Mulder W.R. DeCaluwé G.L.J. Vlak J.M. DeGrip W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Exp. Station Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar). Viral infection was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cells were harvested 3 days post-infection by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Regeneration of v-opshis6x into v-Rhohis6x was accomplished in total cellular membrane preparations. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (6.5 mm PIPES, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithioerythritol, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5) at 108 cells/ml and lysed upon homogenization (Potter-Elvehjem-tube). Homogenized cells were centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in buffer β (20 mm PIPES, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5). All subsequent manipulations were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere and under dim red light (Schott-Jena, RG 645 cut-off filter). Retina lipids were added in 100-fold molar excess over v-opshis6x, followed by 11-cis-retinal in a small volume of dimethylformamide (10-fold molar excess over v-opshis6x) and solid dodecyl-β-1-maltoside (DoM) to 0.5 mm. Samples were rotated for 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). v-Rhohis6x was solubilized from the pellet in the same buffer that was used to bind v-Rhohis6x to the Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Ni2+-NTA; Qiagen). Several buffers were evaluated for the IMAC. Buffer C consisted of 20 mm HEPPS, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ng/ml leupeptin, 1 mm imidazole, 50 μμ Trolox, and 20 mm DoM (pH 8.0). Buffer D was identical with buffer C, except for 10 mm imidazole instead of 1 mm. Buffer E was identical with buffer C, except for buffer and pH: PIPES (pH 6.5) was used instead of HEPPS (8.0). The regenerated pellets were incubated with these buffers (1 ml/108 cells) for 2 h at room temperature to solubilize v-Rhohis6x. Extracts were centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material, and glycerol was added to a concentration of 15% (w/v). The solubilized v-Rhohis6x was then applied to the Ni2+-NTA column at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/h for 16 h at 4 °C under continuous recycling. This flow rate was maintained throughout the entire procedure. Typically, we used a column volume of 1 ml for the v-Rhohis6x extract from 1–2 × 109 infected insect cells. Unbound material was eluted from the column with the same buffer that was used for loading of the sample except that it was supplemented with 15% (w/v) glycerol and 20 mm nonylglycose instead of 20 mm DoM (10 column volumes). This was followed by a second rinse using the same buffer, but now containing 25 mm imidazole (4 volumes). The bound v-Rhohis6x was then eluted from the column using the same buffer (C, D, or E) supplemented with 100 mm imidazole and containing 20 mm nonylglucose instead of DoM and 130 mm instead of 500 mm NaCl (6 volumes). Reconstitution of Purified v-Rhohis6x into Retina Lipids—Retina lipids were extracted from illuminated bovine retinae using standard procedures (19Hendriks T. Klompmakers A.A. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 433: 271-281Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The lipids were stored at –80 °C in the dichloromethane/methanol extract. Their concentration was determined by a modified Fiske-Subbarow phosphate assay (20Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The aliquot required for reconstitution is dried with argon gas, dissolved in a small volume of methanol, and then diluted with buffer β containing 20 mm nonylglucose. Purified v-Rhohis6x was concentrated to 3–10 nmol/ml on an Omega 30K filter (Filtron, Northborough, MA) and mixed with 1 volume of retina lipid extract (100-fold molar excess). This mixture was layered on top of a sucrose step gradient (10%, 20%, and 45% (w/w) in 3 × diluted buffer B) and spun overnight (100,000 × g, ≥ 16 h, 4 °C). Reconstituted v-Rhohis6x was collected from the 20% and/or 45% interface. Collected proteoliposomes were either diluted with the required buffer, and used for analysis, or with distilled water, pelleted (80,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and stored at –80 °C until further use. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schull BA85, pore size 85), and probed with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (17Janssen J.J.M. Mulder W.R. DeCaluwé G.L.J. Vlak J.M. DeGrip W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The anti-opsin antibodies Rho-1D4 (monoclonal) and CERNJS858 (polyclonal) have been described before (22Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 23DeGrip W.J. Progr. Retinal Res. 1985; 4: 137-180Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and were used in 1:1000 dilution. The anti-histidine tag antiserum was obtained from Cappel, Organon Teknika N.V., Turnhout, Belgium and was also used 1:1000. UV/Vis Spectroscopy and Photolysis—UV/Vis spectroscopy to determine absorbance band shape and λmax was routinely performed at pH 6.5 in buffer β supplemented with 20 mm DoM using a Perkin-Elmer λ15 recording spectrophotometer. Detergent was added to prevent light-scattering artifacts. The spectrum of detergent-solubilized samples was recorded, after addition of 1 M hydroxylamine to 50 mm, before and after illumination (5 min, 300-watt light bulb, KG1 heat filter, Schott, Mainz, FRG). For accurate determination of the λmax, difference spectra were used (illuminated spectrum subtracted from the “dark” one). The late photointermediates Meta I, Meta II, and Meta III were studied at 10 °C in proteoliposomes of v-Rhohis6x, using isotonic solutions buffered with 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5–7.0), 20 mm MES (pH 5.5–6.0), or 20 mm HEPPS (pH 7.5–9.5) (24Cotton R.G.H. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 125-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The photocascade was triggered by illumination for 15 s (Schott OG530 cut-off filter), and spectra were recorded every 3 minutes. After 30 min, hydroxylamine was added to 50 mm to convert all photoproducts into opsin and retinaloxime, and remaining rhodopsin was bleached away by a 5-min illumination. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Difference Spectroscopy—FT-IR spectra of the rhodopsin → Meta II transition were recorded in principle as described previously (25Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26DeGrip W.J. Gray D. Gillespie J. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. VanDenBerg E. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nmol samples were deposited on AgCl windows by isopotential spin-drying (27DeGrip W.J. Gillespie J. Rothschild K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The resulting films were hydrated with 3 μl of MES buffer (pH 5.5), covered with another AgCl window, sealed with Teflon tape, and mounted into a variable temperature cell (Specac P/N21500, Kent, UK). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Mattson Cygnus 100 spectrometer (Madison, WI) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled, narrow band MCT detector. Sample hydration was monitored by the ratio between the peak absorbance near 3400 cm–1 (OH stretching mode of water) and near 2900 cm–1 (CH stretching mode of protein and lipids). Rhodopsin → Meta II difference spectra were recorded at 10 °C. Spectra were taken at 8 cm–1 resolution in 5-min blocks before and after illumination at (1280 scans/spectrum). Each sample was illuminated for 30 s in the spectrometer under computer control using a 12-V 20-watt halogen lamp equipped with Schott KG1 and OG530 cut-off filters. Difference spectra were computed by subtracting spectra before illumination from spectra taken after illumination, using the EXPERT-IR software (Mattson). Construction of the Histidine Tag Transfer Vector pAcJAC2 and Generation of Recombinant Virus—In order to introduce a tag consisting of six histidines at the C terminus of bovine opsin, the transfer vector pAcJAC2 was constructed (Fig. 1A). pAcJAC2 is derived from the baculovirus transfer vector pAcDZ1 (28Zuidema D. Schouten A. Usmany M. Maule A.J. Belsham G.J. Roosien J. Klinge-Roode E.C. VanLent J.W.M. Vlak J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A short synthetic sequence encoding a histidine tag followed by a stop codon was introduced at the C terminus using two complementary oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). As a result, the two alanine residues at the C terminus of opsin (Ala-346 and Ala-348) were substituted by an aspartic acid and the first histidine residue, respectively (Fig. 1B). These substitutions concern residues, which are not highly conserved. Also, the aspartic acid residue introduced should partly counterbalance the additional charge carried by the histidine tag. In pAcJAC2, opsin biosynthesis is controlled by the polyhedrin promoter while the small heat shock promoter of hsp70, drives the biosynthesis of β-galactosidase, which functions as a reporter enzyme (17Janssen J.J.M. Mulder W.R. DeCaluwé G.L.J. Vlak J.M. DeGrip W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Zuidema D. Schouten A. Usmany M. Maule A.J. Belsham G.J. Roosien J. Klinge-Roode E.C. VanLent J.W.M. Vlak J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Expression of v-opshis6x using Recombinant Virus AcNPV/opshis—Protein samples derived from recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells were analyzed by immunoblot, using a polyclonal antiserum elicited against bovine opsin (Fig. 2A). Wild-type virus-infected Sf9 cells are used as a negative control, and native bovine opsin and wild-type v-ops as positive controls (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, and 4). The presence of the histidine tag in v-opshis6x was confirmed by the following observations: 1) only v-opshis6x is recognized by the histidine tag antibody (see below), 2) the apparent molecular mass of v-opshis6x is larger (by about 2 kDa) than that of native opsin and v-ops (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lanes 2 and 4), 3) v-opshis6x does not react with the monoclonal antibody 1D4 (Fig. 2B, lane 1 versus 2), since the C-terminal histidine tag extension eliminates the epitope for this antibody (29Molday R.S. Progr. Retinal Res. 1989; 8: 173-209Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, recombinant virus AcNPV/opshis directs expression of a fully intact histidine-tagged v-ops. The expression level varies between 20 and 30 pmol/106 cells, which is comparable to wild-type v-ops (6DeCaluwé G.L.J. VanOostrum J. Janssen J.J.M. DeGrip W.J. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Regeneration and Purification of v-Rhohis6x—To convert expressed v-opshis6x into v-Rhohis6x, we incubated total membranes, harvested at 3 days post-infection from infected Sf9 cells, with 11-cis-retinal. Spectral analysis of regenerated samples showed that this resulted in 18 ± 2 pmol of v-Rhohis6x per 106 cells (n = 7). For purification by IMAC, regenerated samples were solubilized using DoM as a detergent and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA agarose column. This column appeared to bind v-Rhohis6x with high capacity. Proteins, which have natural affinity for metal ions are bound as well. A variety of washing and elution conditions have been tested to remove this contamination as much as possible without sacrificing binding capacity of the column and recovery of v-Rhohis6x. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (protein pattern), immunoblotting (anti-rhodopsin CERNJS858 antiserum), and by UV/Vis spectroscopy (A500 to detect and quantify v-Rhohis6x; ratio A280/A500 as a purity indicator). Typical results are presented in Fig. 3 and Table I. Lane 1 in Fig. 3, A, B, and C, presents the total extract of Sf9 membranes after regeneration. Only by immunoblot analysis can glycosylated v-opshis6x be identified (arrow) together with a minor amount of unglycosylated species (arrowhead). The nonbound, flow-through fraction shows a very similar protein pattern (lane 2), except that most v-Rhohis6x has bound, since only minimal amounts of the glycosylated form are detected in this fraction. Additional washings with extraction buffer (buffer C) elute a complex protein population (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), probably representing aspecifically or very weakly bound proteins. The nonglycosylated v-opshis6x is already strongly present in these fractions (Fig. 3, β and C, lanes 2–4, arrowhead) and apparently is not very well retained by the column. Protein contamination, weakly interacting with the column, could be eluted by raising the imidazole concentration to 25 mM (Fig. 3, lane 5). Under these conditions, a minor amount of v-Rhohis6x was eluted. Most of the specifically bound v-Rhohis6x, however, only was eluted upon raising the imidazole concentration to 100 mM (Fig. 3, lane 6). This fraction also contains a minor amount of nonglycosylated species and is still contaminated by several other minor bands (Fig. 3A, lane 6, open arrowheads).Table IGeneral characteristics of v-Rhohis6× purification by IMAC as determined by UV/Vis spectroscopyConditionBuffer CBuffer ESolubization (%)100 ± 20100 ± 8Nonbound (%)8 ± 55 ± 6Recovery (%)84 ± 480 ± 5A280/A5002.7 ± 0.42.4 ±0.4 Open table in a new tab The amount of nonglycosylated v-opshis6x in the DoM extract and column fractions varied between different experiments, but it was always present at immunodetectable levels (data not shown). In addition, immunoblots showed the presence of a third opsin species (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4) which on SDS-PAGE gels migrated between the glycosylated and nonglycosylated v-opshis6x. This species did not react with the anti-histidine tag antibody (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–4). We were unable to detect this band in the final purified v-Rhohis6x fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 6). An overview of IMAC results obtained under two conditions, as determined by spectroscopic analysis, is given in Table I. Nearly complete binding of v-Rhohis6x to the Ni2+-NTA agarose was attained. At pH 8.0 (buffer C), a pH at which IMAC is usually performed, an average recovery of 84% was achieved with a purification factor of at least 450. An attempt to reduce contamination by weakly binding proteins, by applying the membrane extract in the presence of a higher imidazole concentration (10 mM; buffer D), resulted in a much higher loss of v-Rhohis6x and in fact lowered the purification factor (not shown). Finally, the performance of the procedure we developed at pH 8.0, was evaluated at pH 6.5, since rhodopsin and most of its mutants are thermally much more stable at the latter pH. This actually improved the purification factor to at least 500, without significant reduction in recovery (Table I, buffer E). At pH 6.5, best v-Rhohis6x samples had a purity of 80–85% (A280/A500 ratio of 2.0–2.1), and the average purity of combined fractions was 70–75%. The maximal capacity of the Ni2+-NTA agarose column for v-Rhohis6x has not been determined exactly but is at least 35 nmol/ml bed volume. The efficiency of this IMAC procedure is spectrally illustrated in Fig. 4A. Curve 1 represents the total membrane extract applied to the column, while curve 2 presents the spectrum of the combined purified v-Rhohis6x fractions. The contamination in the v-Rhohis6x fraction obtained after IMAC resides in several minor bands. These are largely removed upon subsequent reconstitution of v-Rhohis6x into retina lipid proteoliposomes, which represent a more native-like environment, we routinely use to analyze functional properties of recombinant rhodopsin (6DeCaluwé G.L.J. VanOostrum J. Janssen J.J.M. DeGrip W.J. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 307-321Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To simplify reconstitution, the detergent used during regeneration (DoM) is exchanged during IMAC for nonylglucose, which is more easily exchanged for phospholipids (30DeGrip W.J. Olive J. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 168-179Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The resulting v-Rhohis6x proteoliposomes contain at least 95% rhodopsin on a protein base and are suitable for all functional analyses (Fig. 3A, lane 8) Spectral Properties and Photocascade of v-Rhohis6x—Curve 2 in Fig. 4A is a typical absorbance spectrum of the combined v-Rhohis6x fractions obtained after IMAC purification. Illumination of v-Rhohis6x “bleaches” the main absorbance band at 500 nm, and we used difference spectra to calculate the λmax more accurately. Unexpectedly, the absorbance band of v-Rhohis6x turns out to be slightly red-shifted (λmax = 501 ± 1 nm, n = 7) relative to wild-type (λmax = 498 ± 1 nm) (Fig. 4S).

To elucidate the physiological implication of this finding, the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on PNMT promoter activity and Egr-1 expression were examined. PMA stimulated luciferase expression in RS1 cells transfected with a rat PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, and also elevated both Egr-1 mRNA and Egr-1 protein levels in the untransfected cells. Further study on the concentration dependence of PMA action showed that the stimulation of luciferase expression correlated with the elevation of Egr-1 mRNA level. Finally, the stimulatory action of PMA on luciferase expression was dramatically diminished in the cells transfected with a mutant construct in which the Egr-1 binding site in PNMT promoter was mutated. These findings suggest that PMA-stimulated PNMT gene expression requires the enhancement of Egr-1 expression, thus providing further evidence for the physiological role of Egr-1 in the regulation of PNMT gene expression in the adrenergic cell.

In earlier studies, adrenal PNMT activity in the hypophysectomized rat has been found to be much lower than in the intact animal, and the enzyme activity has also been shown to be restored by administration of either ACTH or high doses of exogenous glucocorticoids (1Wurtman R.J.

Further studies on the effects of glucocorticoid hormones on PNMT gene expression in the hypophysectomized rat have shown that ACTH and a synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone cause an increase in PNMT mRNA level as a result of enhancing PNMT gene transcription in the adrenal gland (4Stachowiak M.K.

However, although Egr-1 expression has been extensively studied, only a few genes, those encoding α-myosin heavy chain (38Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adenosine deaminase (39Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yung C.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5242-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), have been identified as specific target genes for this transcription factor. The examination of the proximal promoter/regulatory region of the PNMT gene has shown that there are two potential Egr-1 binding elements located at –45 bp and –165 bp upstream of the transcription start site, thus raising the possibility that PNMT gene expression may be modulated through the interaction of Egr-1 with PNMT promoter. We have recently shown that PNMT gene expression is markedly enhanced by transfection of RS1 cells with an Egr-1 expression construct, and that this enhancement is markedly reduced by mutation of the Egr-1 consensus binding element in the PNMT promoter (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because Egr-1 protein is considered to be overexpressed in the cells transfected with the Egr-1 expression construct, the involvement of endogenous Egr-1 in the regulation of PNMT gene expression still remains to be elucidated. To elucidate the physiological role of Egr-1 in the regulation of PNMT gene expression, we examined the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is known to stimulate the expression of endogenous Egr-1 gene, on PNMT promoter activity in RS1 cells transfected with a rat PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct, and found that the reporter gene expression was markedly enhanced by treatment of the transfected cells with PMA. Furthermore, PMA was also shown to enhance endogenous Egr-1 mRNA level in RS1 cells, and this enhancement of Egr-1 mRNA expression was tightly correlated with that of reporter gene expression. These findings provide further evidence for the physiological role of Egr-1 as a factor regulating PNMT gene expression in the adrenergic cell. Cell Culture—RS1 cells were isolated by hygromycin selection from PC12 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the rat glucocorticoid receptor cDNA and the hygromycin resistance gene, and established as a subline of PC12 cells as described previously (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures on a 100-mm culture dish in 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum, 5% horse serum, gentamycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), and hygromycin β (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a 93% air, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmids—PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct pRP863LUC, the promoterless luciferase construct pbsLUC, the mutant PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct pRPmutALUC, and the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pON405 were generated as described previously (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct pRP863LUC contains two Egr-1 consensus elements at –45 and –165 bp and a glucocorticoid response element at –513 bp within its promoter/regulatory sequences. To generate the Egr-1 plasmid pbsEgr1–303, the 303-bp cDNA fragment was isolated from the Egr-1 expression plasmid pCMVEgr-1 (43Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by restriction digestion with EcoRl and BglII, and then inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pBluescript SK. Transient Transfection—RS1 cells were plated on a collagen-coated 24-well cluster plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well, and transfected with 1 μg/ml of the PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct, pRP863LUC, at 24 h after plating using calcium phosphate precipitation by the method of Wigler et al. (44Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) with modifications (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were incubated for 20 h in 1 ml of the culture medium after exposure to 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 2 min, and then treated with PMA in the medium for different time periods in a humidified incubator. PMA was stored as stock solution dissolved in Me2SO, and this solution was directly added to the cell cultures or diluted with the culture medium before use. The final concentration of Me2SO in the cell cultures was less than 0.4%. To monitor transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase expression plasmid pON405 (0.2 μg/ml) was simultaneously transfected into the cells, and β-galactosidase activity was then determined. No significant difference in the transfection efficiency was observed under the experimental conditions used here. Luciferase Assay—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after discarding the medium by aspiration, and lysed by adding 120 μl of the cell lysis buffer and subjecting them to a freeze-thaw cycle. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf Microfuge, and luciferase activity in 20 μl of the cell lysates was determined using the Luciferase Assay System. A calibration curve for luciferase expression was generated using purified firefly luciferase, and the cell extracts were appropriately diluted to measure the enzyme activity within the linear range. Total protein in the cell extracts was measured by the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214148) Google Scholar) using bovine immunoglobulin G as a standard. Hybridization Probes—To generate an antisense Egr-1 riboprobe, the plasmid pbsEgr1–303 was linearized by restriction digestion with XhoI, and the transcription was then carried out with T3 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 60 min in the reaction mixture containing [α-32P]rUTP as described previously (47Wong D.L. Lesage A. White S. Siddall B. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 67: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A sense Egr-1 RNA was generated using T7 RNA polymerase and the pbsEgr1–303 linearized with XbaI. Similarly, an antisense glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobe (376 bp) was generated using T3 RNA polymerase and a commercially available DNA pTRI-GAPDH-rat as a template. After digesting with DNase I, the transcripts were isolated from the mixture by the method described previously (48Bordonaro M. Saccomanno C.F. Nordstrom J.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 428-430PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was prepared from RS1 cells by a single-step purification method (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.1st Ed. John Wiely & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), and the expression of Egr-1 mRNA was then determined by ribonuclease protection assay (47Wong D.L. Lesage A. White S. Siddall B. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 67: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with modifications (48Bordonaro M. Saccomanno C.F. Nordstrom J.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 428-430PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with 32P-labeled riboprobe (1 × 105 dpm, specific activity = 8.4 × 107 dpm/µg) at 45 °C overnight, and digested in 300 μl of ribonuclease mixture containing ribonuclease1 A (2 μg/ml) and ribonuclease T1 (0.5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 60 min. Ribonucleases in the incubation mixture were inactivated by digestion with proteinase K followed by the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, and the protected RNA fragments were then separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiograms were prepared from the gels, and the signals were quantified by computerized densitometry using Image 1.36 software (NIH). Sense Egr-1 mRNA standards were also run through the entire procedure to determine the linear range, and the autoradiogram within the linear range was selected for densitometric analysis. Glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level in each sample was also determined concurrently using the 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobe (1 × 104 dpm, specific activity = 1.7 × 106 dpm/µg), and Egr-1 mRNA level was expressed relative to glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from RS1 cells treated with PMA as described previously (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and gel mobility shift assay was performed according to the method of Muller (49Muller M.T. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 858-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with adaptations (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide (21 bp) containing the consensus sequence of the Egr-1 binding element was labeled with [γ-32P]αTP at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was mixed with nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) in 25 μl of the binding solution, and then incubated for 60 min on ice. The reaction mixture was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For gel mobility shift assay with antibodies, the antibodies (1 μg of protein) were directly added to the binding mixture. Chemicals—[α-32P]rUTP and [γ-32P]dATP were purchased from DuPont NEN. The anti-Egr-1 antibodies (588, 675, and C-19) and the anti-Sp-1 antibody (PEP2) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The In Vitro Transcription Kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase-template DNA, pTRI-GAPDH-rat, was from Ambion (Austin, TX). The Luciferase Assay System and ribonucleases were from Promega, Inc. (Madison, WI). Purified firefly luciferase, proteinase K, and PMA were from Sigma. Other chemicals used here were commercially available reagent grade or ultrapure grade. Data Analysis—All data are presented as the mean ± S.E., and the statistical significance of the difference between two groups was determined using Student’s t test. A p value of <0.001 was accepted as a statistically significant difference. Effect of PMA on PNMT Promoter Activity—RS1 cells were transfected with the rat PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct pRP863LUC, and the effect of PMA on PNMT promoter activity was then examined by measuring luciferase expression. As shown in Fig. 1, luciferase activity was rapidly and markedly enhanced by treatment of the transfected cells with 80 nM PMA, and a significant increase in the enzyme activity was already apparent at 2 h after exposure to the drug. Luciferase activity reached maximum level at 6 h, remained at the same level through 12 h, and decreased gradually to basal level by 36 h. In contrast, luciferase activity was only slightly altered by exposure of these transfected cells to the vehicle (0.4% Me2SO). PMA was also shown to stimulate the reporter gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 2, the significant enhancement of luciferase expression was observed by treatment of the cells with 4 nM PMA, and the maximum stimulation was obtained at about 40 nM PMA. These results indicated that PMA stimulated PNMT promoter activity in RS1 cells. Effect of PMA on the Egr-1 Gene Expression—Total RNA was prepared from cells treated with PMA, and Egr-1 mRNA level was determined to examine the effect of PMA on Egr-1 gene expression in RS1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, PMA caused a marked and transient increase in Egr-1 mRNA level. A significant increase in the Egr-1 mRNA level was observed at 30 min, and the maximum increase was observed at 60 min after exposure to PMA, followed by the rapid decrease to basal level by 4 h. In addition, the effect of PMA on Egr-1 protein expression was also examined using gel mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells, and incubated with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe containing the Egr-1 binding element at –165 bp (designated site A) in the PNMT promoter. As shown in Fig. 4, the oligonucleotide probe formed two major DNA-protein binding complexes with the nuclear extracts (bands 1 and 2). The intensity of lower band (band 2) was enhanced when the probe was incubated with the nuclear extract prepared from the cells treated with PMA (80 nM) for 1 h (lane 3). By comparison, the intensity of band 2 observed with the nuclear extracts prepared from the cells treated with PMA for 4 h (lane 4) was lower, but still significantly higher than its intensity observed with the nuclear extracts obtained from the untreated cells (lane 2). The intensity of band 2 was not significantly different from the control level when the probe was incubated with the extracts obtained from the cells treated with PMA for 8 h or longer (lanes 5–7). If the same nuclear extracts were incubated with the probe containing the Egr-1 binding element at –45 bp (site B) in the PNMT promoter, the same DNA-protein complexes were observed, although the intensities of these bands were much lower in comparison with those obtained using the site A probe (data not shown). These results indicated that PMA could stimulate the expression of nuclear protein which could bind preferentially to the Egr-1 binding site A in the PNMT promoter. Based on previous findings (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to assume that this newly expressed protein in the PMA-treated cells might be Egr-1.FIG. 4Effect of PMA on Egr-1 protein expression in RS1 cell. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the consensus sequence of Egr-1 binding element (site A) was incubated with (lanes 2–7) or without (lane 1) nuclear extracts prepared from the untreated cells (lane 2) or the cells treated with PMA (80 nM) for 1 (lane 3), 4 (lane 4), 8 (lane 5), 16 (lane 6), and 24 h (lane 7), and the gel mobility shift assay was performed as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that Egr-1 protein was a component of this DNA-protein complex, the effects of antibodies against Egr-1 proteins on DNA-protein complex were examined. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of anti-Egr-1 antibody 588 (lane 2) or C-19 (lane 3), which recognize the carboxyl terminus of the 80–82-kDa form of Egr-1 protein, to the binding mixture caused a supershift of the slow migrating complex, thus decreasing the intensity of lower band (band 2, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, neither the migration pattern nor the intensity of this band was altered with the anti-Egr-1 antibody 675, which recognizes only the 88-kDa form of Egr-1 (lane 4). On the other hand, none of these anti-Egr-1 antibodies caused any supershift or reduction in intensity of the slow-migrating band (band 1) formed with nuclear extracts prepared from the PMA-treated cells (lanes 2–4). However, when the anti-SP1 antibody PEP2 was included in the binding mixture, a supershift of the fast-migrating complex (band 1), which has previously been shown to contain SP1 protein as a component (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was clearly observed (lane 5). These results indicated that Egr-1 protein was rapidly and transiently induced by treatment of the cells with PMA, and this newly expressed Egr-1 protein seemed to bind preferentially to the Egr-1 binding element site A in the PNMT promoter. Correlation of Egr-1 Expression with PNMT Gene Activation—To answer the critical question of whether the changes in Egr-1 expression observed here were directly related to the activation of PNMT promoter, the stimulatory actions of different concentrations of PMA on Egr-1 mRNA expression as well as luciferase expression were determined, and the correlation between these two parameters was examined by linear regression analysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, the treatment of RS1 cells with PMA caused the elevation of Egr-1 mRNA level as well as the enhancement of luciferase expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Both Egr-1 mRNA expression and luciferase expression were significantly enhanced by 4 nM PMA, and reached the maximum level at 40 nM. Within the concentration range used here, the elevation of Egr-1 mRNA level caused by PMA was clearly shown to be highly correlated (r = 0.99) with that of luciferase expression (Fig. 6B). In previous studies (26Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Stone R. Hass R. Bernstein S. Datta R. Sukhatme V.P. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Hass R. Brach M. Gunji H. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the expression of Egr-1 mRNA in U-937 leukemia cells has been shown to be enhanced by treatment of the cells with a phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and this enhancement of Egr-1 mRNA has also been shown to be reduced by pretreatment of the cells with a synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. In view of these findings, it seemed reasonable that the stimulatory action of PMA on luciferase activity as well as its stimulatory action on Egr-1 mRNA expression observed in RS1 cells might be repressed by dexamethasone, if the enhancement of Egr-1 expression was a prerequisite for the stimulation of PNMT gene expression. As shown in Fig. 7, both the stimulation of Egr-1 mRNA expression in the untransfected cells and that of luciferase expression in the transfected cells were repressed in the same extent by pretreatment of the cells with dexamethasone. These results suggested that the elevation of Egr-1 expression caused by PMA might be directly related to the stimulation of PNMT promoter activity. As further evidence for the relationship between Egr-1 expression and PNMT gene expression, the cells were transfected with the mutant PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct pRPmutALUC, in which the consensus sequence of Egr-1 binding site A at –165 bp in the PNMT promoter region was mutated, and the effect of PMA on the reporter gene expression in these transfected cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 8, the stimulatory action of PMA on luciferase expression was markedly reduced in the cells transfected with the mutant construct. Less than 2-fold increase in the luciferase expression was observed at 80 nM PMA, which was twice as high as the concentration required to cause the maximum stimulation of luciferase expression in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct. These results provided additional evidence for the correlation of Egr-1 expression with the stimulation of PNMT promoter activity in the RS1 cell. Previous study has shown that the expression of luciferase reporter gene is markedly enhanced by cotransfecting PC12-variant RS1 cells with the PNMT promoter-luciferase gene construct and the Egr-1 expression construct, thus suggesting that the transcription factor Egr-1 can activate PNMT gene expression in the adrenergic cell (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since Egr-1 protein is presumably overexpressed beyond its physiological range by introducing the exogenous gene construct into the cells, a role of Egr-1 as an intrinsic factor regulating PNMT gene expression still remains to be elucidated. To further examine a possible relationship between Egr-1 expression and PNMT gene expression in RS1 cells, the expression of endogenous Egr-1 was stimulated with a phorbol ester PMA in the cells transfected with PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, and the PNMT promoter activity was determined by measuring the reporter gene expression. Luciferase expression was shown to be markedly and transiently enhanced by treatment of the cells with PMA (Fig. 1), and this enhancement was observed in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). In contrast, PMA failed to cause any significant effect on luciferase expression in the cells transfected with the promoterless luciferase construct under the same conditions (data not shown). Thus, PMA seems to enhance the reporter gene expression through its specific action on the PNMT promoter. The effect of PMA on Egr-1 mRNA expression was examined to verify the possibility that the stimulation of PNMT promoter observed here is mediated by Egr-1. Treatment of the cells with PMA was shown to cause a marked and transient increase in the Egr-1 mRNA level (Fig. 3). Similarly, the expression of Egr-1 protein was significantly enhanced by treatment of the cells with PMA (FIG. 4, FIG. 5). Thus, the elevation of Egr-1 mRNA level caused by PMA is confirmed to be accompanied by the enhancement of Egr-1 protein expression in the RS1 cell. Previous study has shown that several DNA-protein complexes were obtained when the oligonucleotide probe containing the consensus sequence of Egr-1 binding site A was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from RS1 cells, and the intensity of each complex was specifically enhanced with the nuclear extracts prepared from the cells transfected with the functional Egr-1 expression construct (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the present study showed that two major DNA-protein complexes (bands 1 and 2) were obtained when the same probe was incubated with the nuclear extracts, and one of these complexes (band 2) specifically increased in intensity with the nuclear extracts prepared from the PMA-treated cells (Fig. 4). Further study using specific antibodies against SP1 protein or Egr-1 proteins showed that the fast-migrating complex (band 2), the intensity of which was markedly enhanced by treatment of the cells with PMA, contained the 80–82-kDa Egr-1 protein, and the slow-migrating complex (band 1) contained the SP1 protein (Fig. 5). Thus, PMA seems to specifically stimulate the Egr-1 expression. These results further indicate that the elevation of Egr-1 protein as well as Egr-1 mRNA level occurs prior to the enhancement of luciferase expression, thereby consistent with the interpretation that PMA enhances Egr-1 expression, leading to the activation of PNMT promoter in the RS1 cell. As further evidence that the stimulation of both Egr-1 expression and PNMT promoter activity was not merely coincidental and unrelated, the concentration-dependent effect of PMA on Egr-1 mRNA expression as well as PNMT promoter activity was examined to determine whether the elevation of luciferase expression was related to Egr-1 mRNA level. Both luciferase expression and Egr-1 mRNA expression increased as a function of PMA concentration (Fig. 6A), and these changes were shown to be tightly correlated (Fig. 6B). The effect of dexamethasone on luciferase expression as well as Egr-1 mRNA expression was examined, since the previous studies have suggested that the phorbol ester-induced stimulation of Egr-1 mRNA expression could be inhibited by dexamethasone (26Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Stone R. Hass R. Bernstein S. Datta R. Sukhatme V.P. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Hass R. Brach M. Gunji H. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone caused the repression of PMA-stimulated luciferase expression in the transfected cells, similar in extent to that of PMA-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression in the untransfected cells (Fig. 7). These findings suggest that dexamethasone causes the inhibition of PMA-stimulated luciferase expression as a consequence of inhibiting the stimulatory action of PMA on Egr-1 expression, thus providing further evidence that the elevation of Egr-1 mRNA level is directly related to that of luciferase expression. While the inhibitory actions of dexamethasone reported here seem to contradict an additional increase in the reporter gene expression which we have reported earlier (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in fact, this is not the case. In the previous study, Egr-1 expression and hence, luciferase expression induced by Egr-1 from the PNMT promoter, was determined by the Egr-1 expression plasmid. Dexamethasone caused an additional increase in luciferase expression presumably through the glucocorticoid response element located at –513 bp in the PNMT promoter. In contrast, the inhibitory action of dexamethasone on the reporter gene expression is exerted through the inhibition of PMA-induced activation of endogenous Egr-1 expression. By limiting the amount of Egr-1, dexamethasone thereby limits the transcriptional activity from the PNMT promoter. Mutation of the consensus sequence of the binding element in the promoter region of the gene is one of the most effective methods to verify the involvement of transcription factor in the regulation of that gene. We have previously shown that mutation of the consensus sequence of Egr-1 binding site A can markedly reduce both the binding of Egr-1 protein to the DNA sequence and luciferase expression in the cells cotransfected with the mutant PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct and the Egr-1 expression construct (42Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the effect of PMA on luciferase expression in the cells transfected with this mutant construct was examined to obtain additional evidence for the involvement of Egr-1 in the mechanism underlying the stimulatory action of PMA on the PNMT promoter observed here. In contrast to the cells transfected with the wild-type construct, the stimulation of luciferase expression by PMA treatment was markedly reduced in the cells transfected with the mutant construct (Fig. 8). This finding provides the most convincing evidence that the stimulatory action of PMA on the reporter gene expression is the result of increasing the availability and binding of Egr-1 protein to its target sequence in the PNMT promoter. The observations presented here indicate that a phorbol ester, PMA, causes the enhancement of luciferase expression in RS1 cells transfected with the PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, and that the stimulation of the PNMT promoter activity caused by PMA is attributed to its stimulatory action on the Egr-1 expression. It is therefore reasonable that the transcription factor Egr-1 plays a physiologically important role as one of the intrinsic factors regulating the PNMT gene expression in the adrenergic cell. Moreover, the present study provides further evidence supporting our previous hypothesis that the PNMT gene is one of the specific target genes for the transcription factor Egr-1. However, it still remains to be elucidated whether other transcription factor(s) may be involved in the regulation of PNMT gene expression, and if these factor(s) and Egr-1 may be working in concert. Further studies to address these critical questions are in progress."

Although plasma levels of G-Gly are equivalent to those of gastrin, G-Gly has essentially no acute effect on gastric acid secretion. However, we have observed that inhibition of gastrin amidation leads to increased plasma concentrations of G-Gly and enhanced gastric acid secretion. We hypothesized, therefore, that G-Gly might have a chronic effect to increase H+,K+-ATPase expression in gastric parietal cells. In the present studies, we observed that a 2-day preincubation with G-Gly significantly enhanced histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake by isolated canine gastric parietal cells but acutely administered G-Gly had no effect. On Northern blot analysis, both G-Gly and gastrin dose-dependently increased H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression with maximal induction (225 ± 35 and 170 ± 29% of basal, mean ± S.E.) achieved at concentrations of 10–9 m G-Gly and 10–8 m gastrin, respectively. Using an H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene-luciferase chimeric reporter construct transfected into primary cultured parietal cells, we observed that both G-Gly and gastrin increased luciferase activity in a manner similar to that obtained by Northern blot analysis. L365,260, a specific gastrin/CCKB receptor antagonist, completely reversed the stimulation of luciferase activity induced by gastrin but had no effect on G-Gly-stimulated activity. Gastrin increased [Ca2+]i, although G-Gly did not, however, genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) significantly reduced induction of luciferase activity by both G-Gly and gastrin.

These data indicate that G-Gly may have a functional role in potentiating gastric acid secretagogue action via enhanced expression of the gene responsible for H+ generation through action at a novel receptor that can be distinguished from the gastrin/CCKB receptor.

The cDNAs used as probes for Northern blots were the 2247-bp BamHI fragment of canine H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA cloned in our laboratory (13Song I. Mortell M.P. Gantz I. Brown D.R. Yamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the AccI-PstI fragment of the human UBCP cDNA lacking ubiquitin sequences (14Lund P.K. Moats-Staats B.M. Simmons J.G. Hoyt E. D'Ercoles A.J. Martin F. Van Wyk J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7609-7613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. P. Kay Lund, University of North Carolina). Earle’s balanced salt solution ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal precursor base pair(s) Relative quantification of a gene-specific mRNA was achieved by digital densitometry on a Loats Image Analysis System (Westminster, MD) as described previously (11Campbell V.W. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11381-11386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit mRNA (3.5 kb) were normalized by comparison with the mRNA levels of UBCP (600 bp), which have been established as suitable controls in this system. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Analysis—Construction of luciferase plasmids. Employing a 6-kb canine H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene (13Song I. Mortell M.P. Gantz I. Brown D.R. Yamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as a template for polymerase chain reaction, we synthesized a 653-bp fragment containing 34 bp of the first exon and 619 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the canine H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene. This fragment includes the promoter element (the 5′-GCTCCGCCTC-3′ sequence, bases –54 to –45 relative to the cap site) through which Sp1 confers basal transcriptional activity (15Muraoka A. Kaise M. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: A145Google Scholar). An H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene-luciferase vector chimera (pGL-dHK) was constructed by insertion of the 653-bp fragment into the NheI/BglII sites of a pGL-2 basic luciferase vector (GeneLight™ plasmid, Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfection—Purified parietal cells (0.8 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in Ham’s F-12-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1) containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in 12-well dishes coated with 1:5 diluted growth factor reduced Matrigel (Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA) for 16 h using a modification of the method of Chew (16Chew C.S. Ljungstrom M. Smolka A. Brown M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G254-G263PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice in Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% Me2SO, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin G for transient transfection. Parietal cells were incubated for 24 h in Opti-MEM-Lipofectin mixture (4:1) containing pGL-dHK and pCMV-βGal vector (a gift from Dr. M. Ubler of the University of Michigan). Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Transfected parietal cells were washed with Ham’s F-12-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1) and incubated with various test reagents for 2 h. After washing cells with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, 100 µl of luciferase lysis buffer was added to each well and a 60-µl aliquot of the resultant supernatnat was mixed with 100 µl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Luminescent intensity was measured for 10 s (Lumt LB9501, Lumat, Berthed, Germany) and luciferase activity expressed in relative light unites. β-Galactosidase activity from the co-transfected pCMV-βGal vector was quantified by measuring luminescent light which was derived from 20 µl of the supernatant incubated in 100 µl of Lumi-Gal 530 (Lumigen, Southfiled, MI) at 37 C for 1 h (17Beale E.G. Deeb E.A. Bio/Technology. 1992; 12: 320-323Google Scholar). Luminescent intensity representing β-galactosidase activity was measured for 2 s, and the luciferase activity of each sample was normalized for transfection efficiency by comparison to β-galactosidase activity. Samples in each experiment were analyzed in duplicate. Receptor Binding Assays—Leu15-G2–17-Gly was iodinated using an adaptation of the chloramine-T method as described previously (6Matsumoto M. Park J. Sugano K. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G315-G319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Isolated gastric parietal cells (2 × 106) were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with 125I-Leu15-G2–17-Gly and various cold ligands in Hanks’ buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.03% bacitracin, and 0.03% bovine trypsin inhibitor, then washed and centrifuged at 500 × g. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the total amount of label bound and the amount of label remaining bound in the presence of 1 μμ Leu15-G2–17-Gly. Nonspecific binding amounted to roughly 20% of the total amount of label binding in the absence of any added Leu15-G2–17-Gly. In a second set of experiments Leu15-G2–17-Gly was also labeled with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent according to the method of Langone (18Langone J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 221-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Intracellular Calcium Ion Concentration ([Ca2+]i) Measurement—[Ca2+]i in parietal cells was measured as described previously (19DelValle J. Tsunoda Y. Williams J.A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G420-G426PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified parietal cells (>95%) were incubated in 2 × 10–6 m fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in EBSS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, washed by centrifugation at 500 × g, and resuspended in EBSS. Fura-2/AM-loaded parietal cells (1 × 106) were transferred to a quartz cuvette into which the peptides under study were added directly. Fluorescence ratio (340/380 nm) was measured with a dual wavelength modular fluorometer (Spex-Fluorolog 2, Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). Aminopyrine Uptake—The accumulation of [14C]laminopyrine was used as an indicator of acid production by parietal cells (6Matsumoto M. Park J. Sugano K. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G315-G319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soll A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: G366-G375PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml aliquot of acutely isolated parietal cells (2 × 106) in EBSS was incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]aminopyrine and the various peptide under study. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were centrifuged and the radioactivity of the cell pellet was determined. For longer term studies, parietal cells (0.4 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in Ham’s F-12-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1) with or without added Leu15-G2–17-Gly (10–9 M) in 12-well dishes coated with 1:5 diluted growth factor reduced Matrigel for 2 days. Parietal cells were washed once with EBSS and incubated with 0.1 mCi of [14C]aminopyrine and various reagents for 60 min. Parietal cells were lysed with 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100 and the radioactivity of lysate was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. On the basis of our previous studies, we reasoned that although acute administration of G-Gly might not stimulate gastric acid secretion, more prolonged exposure could potentiate acid secretion mediated by other secretagogues. Thus, we cultured gastric parietal cells for 2 days with Leu15-G2–17-Gly and examined basal and histamine-stimulated acid production. Preincubation with a physiological concentration of Leu15-G2–17-Gly (10–9 m) significantly increased histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake, whereas basal uptake was not significantly altered (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed our previous observations that Leu15-G2–17-Gly had no acute effect on basal or secretagogue-stimulated acid secretion in our system (Fig. 1B). We postulated that the mechanisms by which prolonged increases in G-Gly concentrations in vivo are associated with increased acid secretion (8Dickinson C.J. Marino L. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G810-G814PubMed Google Scholar) might be mediated by an increase in H+,K+-ATPase gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that G17-NH2 and Leu15-G2–17-Gly induced H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit mRNA. A linear transformation of the densitometric analysis of the Northern blots indicated that both G17-NH2 and Leu15-G2–17-Gly significantly increased H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Leu15-G2–17-Gly achieved maximal induction (225 ± 34% of basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) at 10–9 m, and G17-NH2 reached its peak (170 ± 9% of basal, mean ± S.E., H = 7) at 10–8 m. The half-maximally effective concentrations (EC50) of Leu15-G2–17-Gly and G17-NH2 were estimated to be 5 × 10–11 m and 1.5 × 10–9 m, respectively, suggesting that Leu15-G2–17-Gly was approximately 30 times more potent than G17-NH2 in inducing H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit expression. Higher concentrations of Leu15-G2–17-Gly (>10–8 m) and G17-NH2 (10–7 m) resulted in a decline from peak levels of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit mRNA. We next examined the effects of G-Gly and gastrin on the transcriptional activity of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene promoter using a luciferase reporter construct. Both Leu15-G2–17-Gly and G17-NH2 significantly increased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner similar to that obtained by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Leu15-G2–17-Gly achieved maximal induction of luciferase activity (219 ± 58% basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) at 10–9 m, and G17-NH2 attained its peak (177 ± 34% of basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) at 10–8 m. The EC50 values for Leu15-G2–17-Gly and G17-NH2 were estimated to be 5 × 10–11 m and 1 × 10–9 m, respectively. In separate experiments, we explored the nature of the receptor/ligand interaction mediating the observed effects of gastrin and G-Gly on H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression. CCK8, which is equipotent with G17-NH2 in its affinity for gastrin/CCKB receptors (21Soll A.H. Amirian D.A. Thomas L.P. Reedy T.J. Elashoff J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), significantly induced luciferase activity. Maximal induction with CCK8 (197 ± 57% basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) was obtained at 10–7 m, which was a concentration 10-fold higher than the concentration of G17-NH2 that achieved similar results (Fig. 3B). G5–17-Gly, which lacks the amino-terminal three amino acids of G2–17-Gly, also induced luciferase activity (Fig. 3B), however, the concentration at which G5–17-Gly attained maximal induction (189 ± 54% basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) was 100-fold higher than that of Leu15-G2–17-Gly. G1–13, which has the identical amino-terminal sequence as G17-NH2 but lacks the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide amide, is not active as an acid secretagogue and does not bind to gastrin/CCKB receptors (7Hilsted L. Hint K. Christiansen J. Rehfeld J.F. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Pauwels S. Dockray G.J. Walker R. Marcus S. Gastroenterology. 1985; 89: 49-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Cabero J.L. Rehfeld J.F. Mardh S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 136: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, this amino-terminal fragment of gastrin also induced luciferase activity and maximal induction (160 ± 31% basal, mean ± S.E., n = 7) was achieved by 10–7 m (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the effects of gastrin peptides on H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression were mediated via gastrin/CCKB receptors, we utilized L365,260, a specific gastrin/CCKB receptor antagonist (24Chang R.S.L. Lotti V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4923-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 25Bock M.G. DiPardo R.M. Evans B.E. Rittle K.E. Whitter W.L. Veber D.F. Anderson P.S. Freidinger R.M. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). L365,260 (10–5 m) completely inhibited the induction of luciferase activity stimulated by the carboxyamidated peptides G17-NH2 (10–8 m) and CCK8 (10–7 m) (Fig. 4). In contrast, L365,260 (10–5 m) failed to inhibit luciferase activity induced by 8-bromo-cAMP, Leu15-G2–17-Gly, or G1–13. To determine whether gastric parietal cells possess a selective receptor for G-Gly, we undertook binding studies with 125I-Leu15-G2–17-Gly. Specific binding of 125I-Leu15-G2–17-Gly was dose-dependently displaced by Leu15-G2–17-Gly, G5–17-Gly, and G1–13 (Fig. 5). The estimated half-maximal inhibitory binding concentrations (IC50) of the peptides, Leu15-G2–17-Gly (3 × 10–8 m), G5–17-Gly (1.5 × 10–7 m), and G1–13 (2 × 10–7 m), were consistent with their relative potencies in the stimulation of luciferase activity. In contrast, G17-NH2 (10–6 m), CCK8 (10–6 m), and L365,260 (10–6 m) did not displace 125I-Leu15-G2–17-Gly binding to gastric parietal cells. 125I-Bolton-Hunter labeled Leu15-G2–17-Gly, which contains a bulky non-peptide moiety on the amino terminus, did not bind to gastric parietal cells despite its ability to bind carboxyl-terminal-specific antisera directed against G-Gly peptides. Mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is an essential signal transduction mechanism that mediates the effects of gastrin through gastrin/CCKB receptors in gastric parietal cells (19DelValle J. Tsunoda Y. Williams J.A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G420-G426PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamada T. Chiba T. DelValle J. Campbell V. Walsh J.H. Gastrin. Raven Press, New York1993: 151-168Google Scholar). As reported previously, G17-NH2 (10–8 m) significantly increased [Ca2+]i in parietal cells. In contrast, G2–17-Gly did not change [Ca2+]i at concentrations as high as 10–8 m (Fig. 6), suggesting that mobilization of Ca2+ does not mediate the effects of G-Gly on H.+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression. However, preincubation (30 min) with genistein (5 × 10–5 m), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (27Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya N. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), significantly reduced luciferase activity induced by both Leu15-G2–17-Gly and G1–13 (Fig. 7). Moreover, induction by G17-NH2 as well as CCK8 was also reversed by genistein. In contrast, genistein had no effect on 8-bromo-cAMP-induced luciferase activity.FIG. 7Effects of genistein on luciferase levels induced by gastrin peptides. Primary cultured canine parietal cells transfected with pGL-dHK were preincubated with (hatched bars) or without (solid bars) a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (2 × 10–5 m) and stimulated with various ligands (10–3 m 8-bromo-cAMP, 10–7 m CCK8, 10–8 m G17-NH2, 10–7 m G1–13, and 10–9 m G2–17-Gly) for 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many brain-gut peptide hormones require a carboxyl-terminal α-amide moiety to achieve full biological potency. These α-carboxyamidated peptides are synthesized from their glycine-extended processing intermediates by the action of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (EC 1.14.17.3) (28Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Gastrin, the major hormonal regulator of gastric acid secretion, also requires an α-carboxyamidated terminus for full potency as an acid secretagogue (29Tracy H.J. Gregory R.A. Nature. 1964; 204: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30Morley J.S. Tracy H.J. Gregory R.A. Nature. 1965; 207: 1356-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 31McGuigan J.E. Thomas H.F. Gastroenterology. 1972; 62: 553-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and G-Gly is converted to biologically active gastrin via the action of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase in gastric antral G-cells (1Sugano K. Aponte G.W. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11724-11729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hilsted L. Regul. Pept. 1991; 36: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although G-Gly is co-secreted with gastrin from G-cells (3Sugano K. Park J. Dobbins W.O. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: G502-G507PubMed Google Scholar) and achieves plasma levels roughly equivalent to those of gastrin (4DelValle J. Sugano K. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 1159-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Hilsted L. Hansen C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: G665-G669PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ciccotosto G.D. Shulkes A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G802-G809PubMed Google Scholar), its physiological relevance other than to serve as the immediate precursor for gastrin has remained obscure. Acutely administered G-Gly is a weak stimulant of gastric acid secretion in vitro (10,000-fold less potent than gastrin) (6Matsumoto M. Park J. Sugano K. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G315-G319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has no activity in vivo (7Hilsted L. Hint K. Christiansen J. Rehfeld J.F. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, in previous in vivo studies, we demonstrated that inhibition of gastrin amidation leading to increased tissue and plasma concentrations of G-Gly resulted in increased basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without a change in plasma levels of amidated gastrin (8Dickinson C.J. Marino L. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G810-G814PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies we were able to reproduce these disparate findings when we observed that a 2-day preincubation with G-Gly significantly increased histamine-stimulated acid production in cultured gastric parietal cells, whereas a short 20-min exposure to G-Gly had no effect. Thus, there appears to be an effect of prolonged exposure to G-Gly that results in enhanced parietal cell function that is not observed under acute condition. We hypothesized that the mechanism(s) responsible for the chronic effects of G-Gly might be mediated by induction of the gene encoding H+,K+-ATPase, the critical enzyme in H+ production (34Sachs G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Second Ed. Raven Press, New York1987: 865-881Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that physiological concentrations of G-Gly induce gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression, as evidenced by the dose-response relationship between G-Gly and induction of gene expression obtained by Northern blots and luciferase assays. Since luciferase assays generally indicate the transcriptional activities of a test gene (35Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the proximal 619-bp segment in the 5′-flanking region of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene contains the responsive DNA element that mediates its inducibility by G-Gly and gastrin. Gastrin/CCKB receptors mediate the gastric acid secretagogue effects of gastrin (20Soll A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: G366-G375PubMed Google Scholar) and gastrin/CCKB receptor antagonists reverse this effect. In the present study, specific inhibition of gastrin/CCKB receptors by L365,260 also reversed the induction of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit expression mediated by CCK8 and gastrin. In concert with this finding was observation that gastrin increased parietal cell [Ca2+]i which is an essential signal transduction mechanism generated by peptide action at gastrin/CCKB receptor (19DelValle J. Tsunoda Y. Williams J.A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G420-G426PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamada T. Chiba T. DelValle J. Campbell V. Walsh J.H. Gastrin. Raven Press, New York1993: 151-168Google Scholar). In contrast, the gastrin/CCKB receptor antagonist, L365,260, failed to inhibit G-Gly induced H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression and G-Gly did not mobilize [Ca2+]i even at high concentrations. Additionally, specific binding of 125I-Leu15-G-2–17-Gly to parietal cells was dose-dependently displaced by Leu15-G2–17-Gly, but not by G17-NH2 (10–6 m), CCK8 (10–6 m), nor L365,260 (10–6 m). Therefore receptors mediating the effects of G-Gly appear to be separate and distinct from those mediating the effects of gastrin. These observations are consistent with our previous report of selective G-Gly receptors that mediate cellular effects that can be distinguished from those of gastrin (9Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Genistein (27Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya N. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reversed induction of luciferase activity by G-Gly and gastrin. Thus, G-Gly may induce H+,K+ATPase α-subunit gene expression via a novel subtype of gastrin receptor that is directly or indirectly linked to tyrosine kinase activity. We attempted to examine the ligand binding properties of the apparent G-Gly receptor on parietal cells by using aminoand carboxyl-terminally altered G-Gly peptides for both binding and transcriptional induction assays. Although both aminoand carboxyl-terminally truncated G-Gly peptides (G5–17-Gly and G1–13, respectively) demonstrated the ability to induce H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression, their potencies were diminished 100-fold relative that of G2–17-Gly. Similar qualitative results were obtained in studies examining the displacement 125I-Leu15-G2–17-Gly from parietal cells; however, the EC50 of the various ligands in the binding displacement studies did not correspond to the EC50 values for transcriptional induction. The broad dose range for binding displacement indicates multiple affinity states for the G-Gly receptor as suggested in previous studies with AR42-J pancreatic cancer cell lines 2C. Seva, C. J. Dickinson, and T. Yamada, unpublished data. with the highest affinity receptor having a Kd (~10–10 m) as measured by Scatchard analysis (9Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), similar to the EC50 for transcriptional induction. Taken together our data suggest the requirement of both carboxyl- and amino-terminal ends of G17-Gly for full potency in action at the G-Gly receptor. Further studies are required for confirmation of this hypothesis. Our studies provided unique insight into the functional significance of the terminal products of prohormone post-translational processing. Through a cascade of reactions, many prohormones are processed to glycine-extended intermediates which serve as the substrates for the peptide α-amidation reaction. Whereas, in the past, this reaction was thought to be the biological activation step for carboxyl-terminally amidated peptides such as gastrin, our data suggest that the intermediate glycine-extended peptides may themselves have independent biological activities that are distinct from those of the amidated products. In the case of gastrin, G-Gly appears to complement the acid secretary action of gastrin by inducing the expression of H+,K+-ATPase, and it does so in concentrations which are equivalent to those of the circulating peptide. The physiological importance of this effect can be seen in our previous in vivo studies demonstrating that in the face of peptide α-amidation inhibition and diminished tissue concentrations of gastrin, acid secretory levels are, if anything, enhanced. At least part of this effect appears to be mediated by induction of H+,K+-ATPase expression. However, it is also possible that growth promoting effects of G-Gly peptides which we have previously reported (9Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) may also play a role in this phenomenon, perhaps by increasing the number of parietal cells, although this remains to be determined. In any event, the importance of both the substrate and product of the terminal α-amidating prohormone post-translational processing reactions must be considered in physiological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2064418360,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family of related proteins, is expressed by stromal fibroblasts and acts on epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion. To understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating normal KGF expression and how these might be altered in disease, the 5′-flanking region of this gene was cloned. The presence of two KGF transcription initiation sites was suggested by ribonuclease protection assay and confirmed by primer extension analysis. Examination of the genomic DNA sequence revealed the presence of the putative promoter sequences TATTTA and CCAAT, located 31 and 50 base pairs upstream, respectively, from the first of the two mRNA start points, and putative initiator sequences surrounding each transcription start site. Transient transfection into murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that the region required for basal level KGF promoter activity was located between bases –225 and +190. Inclusion of sequences between –1503 and –775 markedly reduced promoter activation, indicating the presence of negative regulatory element(s) in this region. A similar pattern of promoter activation was detected in human fibroblasts and in murine C2C12 myoblasts. In contrast, no chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was observed in macrophages and epithelial and lymphoid cells transfected with the same constructs. Northern blot analysis revealed a strong correlation between KGF RNA expression and promoter activation in all cells tested. Activation of the KGF promoter could be induced by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 and by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. Taken together, these results indicate the existence of cis-acting element(s) responsible for selective activation of the KGF promoter only in cells that express KGF mRNA and may provide a mechanistic basis for KGF gene expression during inflammation. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family of related proteins, is expressed by stromal fibroblasts and acts on epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion. To understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating normal KGF expression and how these might be altered in disease, the 5′-flanking region of this gene was cloned. The presence of two KGF transcription initiation sites was suggested by ribonuclease protection assay and confirmed by primer extension analysis. Examination of the genomic DNA sequence revealed the presence of the putative promoter sequences TATTTA and CCAAT, located 31 and 50 base pairs upstream, respectively, from the first of the two mRNA start points, and putative initiator sequences surrounding each transcription start site. Transient transfection into murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that the region required for basal level KGF promoter activity was located between bases –225 and +190. Inclusion of sequences between –1503 and –775 markedly reduced promoter activation, indicating the presence of negative regulatory element(s) in this region. A similar pattern of promoter activation was detected in human fibroblasts and in murine C2C12 myoblasts. In contrast, no chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was observed in macrophages and epithelial and lymphoid cells transfected with the same constructs. Northern blot analysis revealed a strong correlation between KGF RNA expression and promoter activation in all cells tested. Activation of the KGF promoter could be induced by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 and by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. Taken together, these results indicate the existence of cis-acting element(s) responsible for selective activation of the KGF promoter only in cells that express KGF mRNA and may provide a mechanistic basis for KGF gene expression during inflammation.

The KGF receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is a splice variant of the FGF receptor 2/bek gene (4Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The KGF receptor binds KGF and aFGF with high affinity and bFGF at a lower affinity (5Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Finch P.W. Florio C. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12767-12770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed only in epithelial cells, while FGF receptor 2 is present in a variety of different cell types (4Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 6Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A. M-L.

These responses may be indicative of a general induction of KGF transcript expression by inflammatory mediators and steroid hormones in many different tissues. Increased cell division caused by prolonged exposure to steroid hormones or chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer (9Preston-Martin S. Pike M.C. Ross R.K. Jones P.A. Henderson B.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7415-7421PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, interference with the mechanisms that regulate normal KGF expression may also play a role in tumorigenesis. In order to further elucidate the elements responsible for regulating KGF expression, we have cloned the human KGF promoter region, characterized its basal activity in mesenchymal cells, and demonstrated its transcriptional activation by interleukin 1 (IL1), interleukin 6 (IL6), and forskolin. Isolation of Genomic DNA Clones Containing the KGF Promoter Region—An amplified human placental genomic DNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to isolate clones containing the 5′-region of the KGF gene. The library was constructed from 8–22-kilobase (kb) fragments of a partial Sau3A digest of placental DNA inserted into the BamHI site of the EMBL3-SP6/T7 1 cloning vector. Plaque lifts of 1 × 106 recombinants were hybridized with a 324-base pair (bp) BamHI/EcoRI 32P-labeled fragment derived from the 5′-end (bp 145–465) of a human KGF cDNA clone (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Filters were washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 ºC for 2 × 30 min. Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and purified through secondary and tertiary rounds of screening. DNA Sequencing—A 1.67-kb EcoRI genomic DNA fragment, which contained 145 bp of sequence corresponding to the previously determined 5′-end of the human KGF cDNA (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and 1.5 kb 5′ to the transcription start sites was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) and a series of overlapping nested deletions prepared by exonuclease III digestion (10Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of both strands of this fragment were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-35S] dATP (DuPont NEN, Boston, MA). The sequence was compiled and analyzed using the MacVector 4.0 DNA sequence analysis program (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Ribonuclease Protection Analysis (RPA) of the KGF Transcript—A series of consecutive genomic fragments corresponding to the 5′-region of the KGF cDNA (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pGEM 3Zf(-) transcription vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled antisense transcripts were synthesized in vitro using either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). Samples of 10 μg of total cellular RNA were hybridized at 42 °C overnight with 1 × 105 cpm of the purified labeled transcripts. Hybrids were digested for 40 min. at 30 °C with RNases A and T1 (12Melton D.A. Kreig P.A. Regabliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Protected fragments were separated on 6% Polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels and detected by autoradiography. Primer Extension Assays—A 21-nucleotide antisense primer, corresponding to bases 134–114 of the human KGF cDNA sequence (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ΑTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/µg. Samples of 15 μg of total cellular RNA were hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotide (0.7 ng) by heating at 58 °C for 20 min in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 42 °C), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, and 0.5 mm spermidine. After cooling to room temperature, 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in 10 ml of the same buffer was added to the mixture, and the reaction continued at 42 °C for 30 min. After completion of the reaction, samples were phenol-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 99% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue. Construction of KGF:CAT Plasmids—A series of plasmids were prepared in which 191 bp of genomic DNA 3′ relative to the first start site of KGF transcription (corresponding to the remainder of exon 1A) and various amounts of DNA 5′ to the transcription start were inserted immediately upstream from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in the plasmid vector pCAT-Enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI). This vector contains an SV40 enhancer element downstream from the CAT reporter gene to allow verification of putative promoter sequences. Genomic DNA fragments for subcloning were prepared by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides: for the 5′-ends of the KGF inserts, 5′-ATAAGCTTAAGGTATTTATCGAAAAGCCC-3′ (bases –25 to –5), 5′-ATAAGCTTCTTCTAACTGCTTCAGAACCA-3′ (bases –225 to –205), 5′-ATAAGCTTCAAGTATAATACAACTGCTA-3′ (bases –280 to –260), 5′-ATAAGCTTCAATGTGAAACCATTTCCTCC-3′ (bases –755 to –775), 5′-ATAAGCTTTTGGTCTACATGCACCACCTG-3′ (bases –1144 to –1164), and 5′-ATAAGCTTTAGGAATTCTGAGCCTGCTCA-3′ (bases –1483 to –1503), and for the 3′-end of all four vectors, 5′-ATCTGCAGTTGCTAACAGCTGGATATATA-3′ (bases 171–190). The remaining deletion constructs were similarly generated. Amplified fragments were digested with HindIII and PstI and inserted 5′ to the CAT reporter gene using the same restriction endonuclease sites in the vector’s multiple cloning site. Cell Culture—M426 embryonic lung, 151 and 152 neonatal foreskin, and 202 and M413 dermal fibroblasts of human origin, and murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. Human epithelial cells (HeLa cervix carcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and A101 melanoma, MCF-7 breast carcinoma, EJ bladder carcinoma, and SK-Hep 1 hepatoma) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 50 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human Β lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBW25 and LBW26) (50Taylor K.A. Wetzel S. Lyles D.S. Pollok B.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6421-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), K562 erythroleukemia cells, Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells, and THP1 macrophages were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented as above. Transfection—Adherent cells were grown to approximately 50% confluency in 100-mm Petri dishes while suspension cells were cultured in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were transfected with the cationic lipopolyamine reagent Transfectam (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. CAT Assay—Transfected cells were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 ml of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cell lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles and divided into two aliquots: the first aliquot was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min and then assayed for CAT activity as described (13Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The second aliquot was used in the determination of β-galactosidase activity as described by Rosenthal (14Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase as substrate. RNA Preparation and Northern Hybridization Analysis—Total RNA and Northern blot analysis were performed as described in Ref. 38Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Probes used in hybridizations were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming and correspond to the exon I of the human kGF gene (15Kelley M.J. Pech M. Seuanez H.N. Rubin J.S. O'Brien S.J.

Rubin, J. Wong, and D. Ron, manuscript in preparation. As control for loading and transfer of RNAs, blots were hybridized with a cDNA probe corresponding to the full coding sequence of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (16Adams M.D. Dubnick M. Kerlavage A.R. Moreno R. Kelley J.M. Utterback T.R. Nagle J.W. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nature. 1992; 355: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Isolation and Characterization of the Human KGF Promoter Region—A 324-bp probe derived from the 5′-end (bp 145–469) of a human KGF cDNA clone (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) was used to identify KGF clones in a human placental genomic DNA library. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed that one of these clones contained an insert of approximately 15 kb, which could be excised from the vector using the XhoI sites in the vector multiple cloning site. The insert contained one internal BamHI site such that digestion with XhoI and BamHI together liberated fragments of 8.0 and 7.5 kb (Fig. 1). Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the internal BamHI site in the cloned insert corresponded to the unique BamHI site located at position 469 in the KGF cDNA sequence (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The 7.5-kb BamHI/XhoI fragment contained sequences 5′ to the BamHI site (Fig. 1). Polymerase chain reaction was used to compare the structure of the cloned genomic fragment with that of the KGF cDNA. A pair of oligonucleotide primers, designed to amplify bp 1–477 of the KGF cDNA, amplified an approximately 1100-bp fragment from the genomic template (data not shown), suggesting the presence of a 650-bp intron. By sequence analysis, the intron was found to be located between nucleotides 179 and 180 in the KGF cDNA (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and to conform to the consensus G(T/A)G sequence for 5′-donor and 3′-acceptor splice sites (17Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). All the genes encoding FGF family members consist of three exons encoding the primary translation product, with the intervening introns always present in the same position with respect to the protein coding sequences (15Kelley M.J. Pech M. Seuanez H.N. Rubin J.S. O'Brien S.J. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9287-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Abrahams J.A. Whang J.L. Tumolo A.

Lehtoma K. Varban M.L. Krishnan I. Chiu I-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, to avoid confusion, we have designated the newly identified KGF exon as exon 1A and will refer to the second exon (the first encoding protein sequence) as exon 1B (Fig. 1). Identification of the KGF Gene Transcription Initiation Sites—In order to determine whether the isolated genomic fragment contained the KGF promoter region, it was necessary to determine the KGF transcription start point(s). To map the 5′-end of the KGF transcript we initially used RPA with antisense RNA probes to four consecutive KGF genomic DNA fragments. Probe 1 corresponded to a 350-bp EcoRI/BglII. fragment containing the terminal 5′ 145 bp of a previously isolated cDNA clone (2Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and so would be protected to at least this extent. Probes 2–4 corresponded to consecutive BglII, BglII/BssHII, and BssHII/EcoRI fragments of approximately 350, 550, and 450 bp, respectively (Fig. 1). An antisense probe corresponding to the 324-bp EcoRI/BamHI fragment of KGF cDNA (bp 469–145) was included as a positive control. Labeled probes were hybridized with 10 pg of total RNA isolated from M426 fibroblasts or normal breast tissue. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, antisense RNA probe 1 yielded two RNase-resistant duplexes of approximately 150 and 165 bp. In contrast, the 324-bp antisense probe to the KGF cDNA was fully protected (Fig. 2). The same protection pattern for each probe was detected using the normal breast RNA, albeit to a lesser extent. This demonstrated that the signal obtained by hybridization with M426 RNA was not artifactual and could be reproduced using RNA isolated from a normal tissue. None of the antisense RNA probes to the other genomic fragments were protected by hybridization to either M426 or the breast RNA (data not shown). Primer extension was used to determine whether the boundary identified by RPA represented the first KGF exon. A radiolabeled 21-nucleotide antisense primer (corresponding to bp 134–114 of the KGF cDNA sequence) was hybridized to M426 RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Two cDNAs of 136 and 154 bp were detected (Fig. 3), establishing that the exon border detected by RPA represented the 5′-terminus of the KGF transcript. These experiments indicated that the isolated genomic DNA fragment contained the promoter region of the KGF gene. DNA Sequence Analysis of the KGF Promoter Region—The nucleotide sequence of the KGF promoter region is presented in Fig. 4. This sequence consists of 775 bp 5′ to the first transcription initiation site (designated +1) and 191 bp 3′ to this site. Most eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II contain a TATA sequence and a pentanucleotide sequence, CCAAT, commonly found 30 and 50–100 bp, respectively, upstream from the transcription start points (23Breathnack R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar, 24Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Inspection of the KGF promoter regulatory sequence revealed the presence of the putative transcriptional promoter sequences, TATTTA and CCAAT, located 31 and 50 bp respectively, upstream of the first mRNA start site. Many genes have initiator (Inr) elements at the transcriptional start points, in addition to or in place of the TATA element, which help direct efficient and accurate transcription (25Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding each KGF transcription start point is consistent (5 of 7 bp for the first and 4 of 7 bp for the second) with the consensus Inr element, CTCANTCT, in which transcription is initiated at the internal Ala residue (25Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Several transcriptional regulatory consensus sequences were identified within this region (Fig. 4), including binding sites for coupling factor 1 (bases –159 to –164) (26Riggs K.J. Merrell K.T. Wilson G. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1765-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor-A1 (bases –131 to –137) (27Kemler I. Schreiber E. Muller M.M. Matthias P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2001-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two potential binding sites for NF-IL6, which mediates the activation of target genes by IL1, IL6, and other inflammatory mediators (28Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), were also present. One of these, at bases –257 to –265, exactly matches the consensus, while the other, at bases –38 to –46, has one mismatch. A potential cyclic AMP response element (bases –39 to –46) as well as binding sites for activator protein-1 (bases –8 to –14 and –285 to –291) and activator protein-2 (bases –142 to –149) were also present, which differed by 1 bp from their respective consensus sequences (29Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee W. Mitchell M. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Other putative transcriptional regulatory sequences identified within this region include two half palindromic estrogen response elements (bases –39 to –43 and –574 to –578) (31Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar), two half-palindromic glucocorticoid response elements (bases –178 to –183 and –1379 to –1385) (31Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar), and a binding site for a silencer factor (bases –313 to –320) (32Weissman J.D. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4228-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). KGF Gene 5′-Flanking Sequences Drive Expression of a CAT Reporter Gene—In order to determine promoter activity and identify important regulatory domains within the 5′-flanking sequence of the KGF gene, a series of KGF:CAT fusion plasmids were constructed (Fig. 5). The 5′-ends of these constructs were –1503, –1164, –775, and –225 bp respectively, relative to the position of the first transcription start point. The 3′-end of each insert was +190 bp, 8 bp 5′ to the intron/exon junction of the first noncoding exon 1A of the KGF gene. These constructs were transfected into the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3, and CAT activity was measured. For comparison, cells were also transfected with two control CAT plasmids, one in which transcription was driven by the SV40 promoter and one that was promoterless. The results of multiple transfection experiments indicated that the –225/+190 construct gave the maximal level of CAT activity, 5.7-fold higher than the promoterless CAT plasmid (Fig. 5). The –775/+190 construct gave slightly lower CAT activity, indicating that the region between –225 and +190 was sufficient to confer basal level activity to the KGF promoter in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Transfection of the –1503/+190 and –11647+190 fusion constructs resulted in lower levels of CAT activity (65 and 75%, respectively) compared with the –225/+190 construct. This suggested the presence of one or more negative cis-regulatory elements located between bp –1503 and –775. Selective Activation of KGF CAT Promoter Constructs—Recognizing that our analysis of the human KGF promoter region had been thus far carried out using mouse fibroblasts, we wanted to extend the study of KGF promoter activity to human cell types. The –225/+190 KGF:CAT construct was therefore used to transfect four human fibroblast cell lines (151 and 152 (established from neonatal foreskin) and 202 and M413 (adult dermal fibroblasts)) and six epithelial cell lines (EJ (bladder carcinoma), A101 (melanoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), and SKHEP-1 (liver carcinoma)). A similar degree of CAT activation was directed by the –225/+190 KGF promoter construct in human fibroblasts to that obtained in NIH73T3 cells (Fig. 6A). CAT activity of deletion constructs –1503/+190, –1164/+190, and –775/+190 was also comparable between human and mouse fibroblasts (data not shown). This indicates that the basal KGF promoter region is subject to similar regulation in both human and murine fibroblasts. In contrast, no CAT activity was detected in extracts of any of the epithelial cells (Fig. 6A). Control experiments, in which the activity of the SV40 CAT control construct was between 10- and 40-fold over basal level, demonstrated that efficient transfection of these cells was achieved. Using Northern hybridization analysis we were able to demonstrate that KGF promoter activation correlated with expression of KGF mRNA. As shown in Fig. 6B, the major 2.4-kb KGF transcript was present in each of the fibroblasts but in none of the epithelial cells. In order to determine whether the KGF promoter was active in other cell types besides fibroblasts, human and murine cell lines of different origin were transfected with the –225/+190 KGF:CAT construct and tested for basal level promoter activation. Since this construct provided full basal level promoter activation without the interference of negative regulatory elements, it was used in all subsequent experiments. Among the cells tested, activation of KGF:CAT promoter constructs was detected in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, C2C12 myoblasts also expressed KGF RNA (Fig. 7B). No CAT activity or KGF transcripts were observed in monocytes (THP1), erythroleukemia (K-562), Burkitt lymphoma (Raji), or Epstein-Barr virus immortalized Β lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBW25 and LBW26) (Fig. 7B). Therefore, activation of the basal KGF promoter displays the same specificity for fibroblasts and myoblasts as KGF mRNA expression. Activation of the KGF Promoter by IL1, IL6, and Forskolin—In a previous report we demonstrated that IL1 and IL6 elevated the levels of KGF RNA in human fibroblasts (38Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether these cytokines could also activate the KGF promoter, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with the –225/+190 construct and stimulated with IL1 or IL6 for 40 h. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment with either cytokine significantly increased the level of CAT activity in these transfectants. No synergism was observed when cells were concomitantly treated with IL1 and IL6, suggesting that both cytokines may activate the KGF promoter via a common mechanism. No elevation in CAT activity was observed when cells transfected with a promoterless control plasmid were treated with either cytokine. The presence of a putative cAMP response element in the KGF promoter region suggested that transcription of the KGF gene could be modulated by alterations in intracellular cAMP levels. To test this hypothesis, NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with the –225/+190 construct were treated with forskolin (FSK), a potent activator of adenylate cyclase. Forskolin promoted a strong increase in CAT activity, indicating that an elevation in the levels of cAMP may result in the activation of the KGF promoter in fibroblasts (Fig. 8). Similar results were obtained in C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). In this study, we reported the isolation and characterization of genomic clones containing the 5′-flanking region of the human KGF gene. We have demonstrated that a basal promoter region between bases –225 and +190 was sufficient to drive the expression of a CAT reporter gene in fibroblasts and myoblasts. This would appear to indicate that this region contains a binding site(s) for a cis-acting regulatory element(s) responsible for conferring expression upon the KGF gene. Alternatively, basal KGF expression might be dependent on a number of different DNA binding factors, combinations of which are present in fibroblasts and myoblasts. KGF:CAT constructs that include sequences between bp –1503 and –775 have decreased promoter activity compared with the basal KGF promoter. This suggests the presence of inhibitory elements in the distal promoter region that may play a role in regulating basal levels of gene expression in the absence of inducing signals (33Zinn K.

Friedman N. Darnell J.E. Babiss L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 83: 7653-7657Google Scholar). The KGF promoter region contains the putative transcriptional promoter sequences, TATTTA and CCAAT, located 31 and 50 bp, respectively, upstream of the first mRNA start site. The TATA box is associated with the formation of stable preinitiation complexes that first involves the TATA binding protein, TFIID (39Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Through subsequent recruitment and positioning of other elements of the transcription machinery, the TATA box contributes to efficient and accurate transcription that initiates at precise downstream start points. Many promoters also contain Inr sequences in the vicinity of transcription initiation that appear to be essential for accurate transcription (25Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The sequences surrounding both KGF transcription start sites are also homologous to the consensus Inr (25Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription from the KGF promoter may rely on both TATA binding and a functional Inr. The KGF transcript is highly expressed in the dermis of cutaneous wounds, suggesting that KGF may be important for the controlled migration and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes associated with wound healing (7Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KGF is overexpressed in certain chronic inflammatory diseases 3P. W. Finch, unpublished data. and may contribute to the repair of epithelial tissue injured during prolonged inflammatory episodes. Transcription of the KGF gene is induced by the action of IL1 and IL6 (38Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two of the major mediators of natural immunity and tissue repair (40Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1988; 2 (1988): 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 41Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 588-602PubMed Google Scholar). Because these cytokines likely play a critical role in mediating acute inflammation associated with normal wound healing as well as in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases (42Hirano T. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1992; 62: S60-S65Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 43Dinarello C.A. Wolff S.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), further understanding of the mechanisms by which they induce KGF gene expression may have important clinical implications. NF-IL6 is a transcriptional activator induced by IL6 and IL1 and is implicated in the activation of genes involved in acute phase reaction, hemopoiesis, and inflammation (28Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 44Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The presence of sequences that are homologous to the consensus NF-IL6 response element within the proximal KGF promoter region (bases –257 to –265 and –38 to –46) suggests a mechanism through which the action of IL1 and IL6 could lead to induction of KGF gene expression. Support for this concept was provided by the demonstration that both cytokines induced KGF transcriptional activity in a promoter construct (-280/+190) that contained putative NF-IL6 sites. In contrast, no response to either cytokine was observed when a promoterless construct was transfected into fibroblasts or myoblasts. The fact that IL1 and IL6 did not synergize suggests that both cytokines may activate the KGF promoter via a common mechanism, perhaps mediated by NF-IL6. Taken together, these results may provide the basis for the mechanism responsible for the modulation of KGF RNA expression and promoter activation by IL1 and IL6 not only in vitro but also during inflammatory processess in vivo. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the KGF promoter is active in fibroblasts and myoblasts but inactive in certain hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Additionally, a strong correlation between promoter activation and KGF RNA expression was observed in all the cells tested. These results are consistent with in situ hybridization data of KGF gene expression during development in which KGF mRNA was detected not only in mesenchymal cells of a large number of organs and tissues but also in the myotomes of the somites and transiently in cleaved muscles (Ref. 45Mason J.J. Fuller-Pace F. Smith R. Dickson C. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).2 In contrast, the KGF signal was not detected in epithelial or immune cells, consistent with our data for KGF promoter activation. While KGF mRNA was detected in early myotomal cells and myoblasts of the developing muscle masses, it was not expressed by differentiated myotubes (45Mason J.J. Fuller-Pace F. Smith R. Dickson C. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). While the exact role of KGF in myogenesis is unclear, our results provide the ability to study the control of KGF gene expression during myoblast differentiation using the C2C12 myoblast differentiation pathway (46Crescenzi M. Crouch D.H. Tato F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Such studies may provide important insights into the role of KGF during this process. Expression of KGF mRNA in rat prostate and mouse seminal vesicle stromal cells is androgen-responsive, suggesting that KGF mediates the indirect control of epithelial cell proliferation by steroid hormones in these organs (8Yan G. Fukabori Y. Nikolaropoulos S. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 47Aland E.T. Rubin J.S. Young P. Chedid M. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Cunha G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to identify a consensus glucocorticoid response element (31Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar) in the KGF promoter regulatory region that could mediate this induction by androgens. It has been reported that transcriptional control by steroid hormone receptors can be mediated from half-palindromic recognition sequences by cooperation with adjacent cis-acting promoter elements (48Tora L. Gaub M.P. Mader S. Dierich A. Bellard M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3771-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 49Gaub M-P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In this regard, there is a sequence present at bases –178 to –183, which differs by 1 bp from the consensus half-palindromic glucocorticoid response element, as well as two half palindromic estrogen-response motifs present at bases –39 to –43 and –574 to –578. It is possible that the androgen and estrogen receptors contribute to the control of KGF expression through these sites by cooperation with other transcriptional factors binding adjacent promoter elements. In summary, we have isolated and characterized the basal KGF promoter region that can drive expression of a CAT reporter gene in fibroblasts and myoblasts. Several possible sites for interaction of transcription factors with cis-acting regulatory regions have been identified that may mediate the modulation of KGF gene transcription by proinflammatory cytokines (Ref. 38Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, this paper). Further characterization of these and other regulatory sites using DNase I protection analysis, gel mobility shift assays, and site-directed mutagenesis will identify which of these putative sites are important for basal and cell-specific KGF gene expression and which sites play a role in KGF induction by various extracellular signals. This will lead to a detailed understanding of the normal mechanisms that control KGF expression and may provide insight into aberrant KGF expression in chronic inflammatory and neoplastic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2055917202,"Abstract The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear transcription factor that is essential for development of the male urogenital tract. In the current work, we have characterized the mouse androgen receptor suppressor (mARS). A single, 20-base pair, region (TCCCCCCACCCACCCCCCCT) was sufficient for suppression in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. Northern analysis indicated that translational regulation is not necessary for the suppression. Analysis of the AR mRNA half-life indicated that the mARS does not affect AR RNA degradation. Gel mobility assays showed that the mARS is bound by multiple proteins that can recognize single-stranded DNA and RNA. In addition, differing proteins are expressed in distinct tissues. Purification of some of these proteins has shown that a doublet of 33 and 35 kDa binds to the G-rich strand and that a 52-kDa protein binds to the C-rich strand. Southwestern blots have confirmed that these proteins are indeed recognized by the mARS. The results of these experiments indicate that the AR 5′-untranslated region contains a suppressor element that can be bound by multiple proteins. The mARS appears to be acting either by altering transcription initiation or blocking transcription elongation. Characterization of this suppressor may provide insight into the physiological means by which the AR is regulated."

We also investigated the involvement of this kinase in the modulation of β3-AR gene expression by insulin. Long term exposure of 3T3-F442A adipocytes to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) decreased β3-AR mRNA content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with maximal changes observed at 6 h (6.5-fold decrease) and at 100 nM PMA. This inhibition was selective for β3-AR transcripts, since β1- and β2-AR mRNA content remained unchanged. Also, (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol saturation and competition binding experiments on adipocyte membranes indicated that PMA induced an ~2-fold decrease in β3-AR expression, while that of the two other subtypes was not affected. This correlated with a lower efficacy of β3-AR agonists to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Conversely, long term exposure to PMA did not alter adenylyl cyclase activity in response to guanosine 5’- O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or forskolin. The inactive phorbol ester 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate did not repress β3-AR mRNA levels. Inhibition of β3-AR mRNA by PMA was suppressed by the PKC-selective inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, and was not observed in PKC-depleted cells, indicating that PKC was involved in this response. mRNA turnover experiments showed that the half-life of β3-AR transcripts was not affected by long term PMA exposure. When 3T3-F442A adipocytes were pretreated with PMA for 24 h to down-regulate PKC, or with bisindolylmaleimide, the insulin-induced inhibition of β3-AR mRNA levels was reduced by 44-67%. These findings demonstrate that sustained PKC activation exerts a specific control of β3-AR gene expression and is involved, at least in part, in the modulation by insulin of this adrenergic receptor subtype.

https://openalex.org/W1596909474,"The α chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2Rα) is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation. To analyze the mechanisms controlling its expression in normal cells, we used the 5’-flanking region (base pairs −2539/+93) of the mouse gene to drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in four transgenic mouse lines. Constitutive transgene activity was restricted to lymphoid organs. In mature T lymphocytes, transgene and endogenous IL-2Rα gene expression was stimulated by concanavalin A and up-regulated by IL-2 with very similar kinetics.

These chains can combine to form different classes of IL-2R. β and γ heterodimers form intermediate affinity receptors that are required for signal transduction (3Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A.

In mature T cells, the primary signal inducing IL-2Rα expression is triggered by antigen through the T cell receptor (TcR)͘CD3 complex. Antigenic stimulation can be mimicked by mitogenic lectins, such as ConA or phytohemagglutinin (9Kimura A. Ersson B. Eur. J.

Among the T cell precursors, IL-2Rα gene expression is restricted to an early stage of thymic T cell differentiation. IL-2Rα+ cells belong to a heterogeneous subset of thymocytes that expresses neither CD4 nor CD8 (CD4-CD8- thymocytes) (15Ceredig R. Lowenthal J.W. Nabholz M. MacDonald H.R.

Upon activation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes in vitro with PMA and ionomycin, IL-2Rα expression declines to barely detectable levels. However, addition of IL-1 or IL-2 to such cultures induces a strong increase in IL-2Rα mRNA and cell surface protein. IL-1 and IL-2 can enhance IL-2Rα expression through independent mechanisms (17Lowenthal J.W. Howe R.C. Ceredig R. MacDonald H.R. J.

In the human gene only the region up to −1249 bp has been analyzed, whereas in the mouse gene, we have shown that a region further upstream plays a major role in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2Rα gene. Transient transfection experiments in PC60, a rodent CD4-CD8- T cell line in which IL-1 and IL-2 have a similar synergistic effect on IL-2Rα expression as in normal CD4-CD8- thymocytes (19Wilson A. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), have shown that the 5’-flanking region of the mouse IL-2Rα gene (bp −2539 to +93) fused to a reporter gene3( 2J. Di Santo and A. Wilson, personal communication. ) confers a response pattern to IL-1 and IL-2 that is very similar to that of the endogenous IL-2Rα gene. In agreement with the studies on the human gene, we have mapped weak IL-1 responsive elements between bp −585 and −54. However, the most important regulatory elements in the mouse gene are contained in the segment between bp −1835 and −802 (21Plaetinck G. Combe M.-C. Corthésy P. Sperisen P. Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown that three distinct elements near position −1.3 kb are required for IL-2 responsiveness (69Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Bucher P. Rusterholz C. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together with the data obtained from the analysis of the human gene, our results suggest that the IL-2Rα promoter proximal region mediates early responses to antigen or IL-1, while previously unrecognized elements further upstream are required for the later IL-2-induced rise in IL-2Rα transcription. To assess if the 5’-flanking region of the mouse IL-2Rα gene that we have analyzed by transient transfection of the cell line PC60 contains the cis-acting elements required for correct tissue-specific and inducible expression of IL-2Rα gene in normal cells, we have generated transgenic mice in which this region controls the expression of the bacterial CAT gene. We chose CAT as a reporter gene, despite the fact that it does not lend itself to analysis at the single-cell level (unless its expression is driven by very strong promoters), because previous reports had shown that CAT expression could be detected in normal lymphoid tissues (32Philip R. Liggitt D. Philip M. Dazin P. Debs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16087-16090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Miller A.E. Ennist D.L. Ozato K. Westphal H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6205-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, lacZ, a reporter gene that would have appeared more suitable for this study, is not expressed or is poorly expressed in normal lymphocytes (35Roederer M. Fiering S. Herzenberg L.A. Methods (Orlando). 1991; 2: 248-260Google Scholar, 36Brombacher F. Schäfer T. Weissenstein U. Tschopp C. Andersen E. Bürki K. Baumann G. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a complementary approach, we have screened a 11.9-kb region around the promoter of the IL-2Rα gene for DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS). DHS have been associated with sequences that control the transcriptional activity of neighboring genes, whereas general sensitivity to nuclease attack has been used to define open chromatin domains around genes that are transcriptionally active or can be activated upon stimulation or differentiation (37Elgin S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Laemmli U.K. Kas E. Poljak L. Adachi Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). DHS can be ubiquitous or cell type-specific. The latter class includes DHS that are present in cells in which the associated locus is silent but will be transcribed upon stimulation or differentiation, as well as DHS whose appearance correlates with gene expression. Generally, tissue-specific DHS map within or close to, cis-acting regulatory elements that behave as cell type-specific enhancers or locus control regions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ubiquitous DHS may mark the boundary of an active chromatin segment by isolating other transcription units from the effect of enhancer elements (40Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The mouse IL-2Rα-CAT fusion gene was isolated from plasmid pmIL-2RαPrCAT1 (21Plaetinck G. Combe M.-C. Corthésy P. Sperisen P. Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar) as a 3.9-kb fragment (see Fig. 1) and used to generate transgenic mice according to published procedures (41Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar, 42Beermann F. Hummler E. Schmid E. Schütz G. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The construct was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using glass powder (Geneclean, Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA), and dissolved in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 0.1 mM EDTA). One to two pl of DNA at 3 μg/ml were injected into pronuclei of fertilized oocytes derived from NMRI mice (IFFA-Credo, Les Oncins, France). Injected oocytes were transferred to foster mothers. The presence of the transgene in the offspring was assessed by Southern blot analysis (see below) of genomic DNA isolated from mouse tails (42Beermann F. Hummler E. Schmid E. Schütz G. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and digested with TaqI. A fragment of 2.6 kb indicated the presence of the transgene, while a fragment of around 6.0 kb was derived from the endogenous IL-2Rα gene. Comparison of the intensity of these two bands, evaluated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), allowed estimation of transgene copy number. Transgenic founders were crossed to NMRI mice. 6-12-week-old transgenic mice or nontransgenic littermates of either sex were used for the experiments. For the DNase-I hypersensitivity experiments, we used 2-3-month-old C57Bl/6 mice (IFFA-Credo). Lymph node and spleen cells were prepared by gentle homogenization. Spleen cells were sedimented onto Ficoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). These cells were used either directly (not cultured) or cultured at 1 ˣ 106 cells/ml with ConA (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma) for different times. Where specified, IL-2 was added at the indicated concentrations. T cells were purified by incubating cell suspensions from lymph nodes or spleen either with anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (53-6.7) mAb or with an anti-Thy1.2 (A15) mAb coupled to magnetic microbeads (MACS® Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) followed by two rounds of magnetic sorting with a magnetic cell separation device (MACS Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) (43Milteny S. Müller W. Weichel W. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). B cells were recovered in the flow-through. Cells were used either directly (not cultured) or after 80 h of culture at 1 ˣ 106 cells/ml with LPS (30 μg/ml; Escherichia coli 0127:B8, Life Technologies, Inc.) or with plastic-bound anti-CD3 mAb (145-C11), as described previously (44Soldaini E. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1707-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CD4-CD8- thymocytes were purified from thymi of 6-week-old mice, using a combination of complement-mediated cytotoxicity and magnetic bead depletion with goat anti-rat Ig-coated Dynabeads, as described previously (19Wilson A. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 4 ˣ 105/ml with PMA (3 ng/ml) and ionomycin (62.5 ng/ml) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 48 h in 96-well flat bottomed plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Where indicated IL-1β at 1 ng/ml and/or IL-2 at 200 units/ml were added. Anti-mouse IL-2 mAb S4.B6.1 (45Zurawski S.M. Mosmann T.R. Benedik M. Zurawski G. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3354-3360PubMed Google Scholar) was added to all the cultures, while anti-mouse IL-2Rα mAb 5A2 (46Moreau J.-L. Nabholz M. Diamantstein T. Malek T. Shevach E. Thèze J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was added only to cells cultured without IL-2. Bone marrow was prepared by flushing femur and hip bones with ice-cold PBS through a 26-gauge needle. Thymic stroma and lymphocytes were separated by gently squeezing total thymus in a loose-fitting glass homogenizer. Mouse kidney epithelial cells were prepared as described elsewhere (47Braun M. McCormack A. Webb G. Batchelor R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (44Soldaini E. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1707-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). IL-1 and IL-2 were human recombinant proteins, kindly provided by GLAXO (Geneva, Switzerland). For immunofluorescence analysis of IL-2Rα surface expression, the rat anti-mouse IL-2Rα mAb PC61 (48Lowenthal J.W. Corthésy P. Tougne C. Lees R. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar) was used, either conjugated with FITC, biotinylated, or as culture supernatant. PE-conjugated streptavidin or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig were used as second-step reagents (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). The purity of MACS-purified cells before and after culture was assessed by staining cells with PE-conjugated anti-CD4 (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) plus PE-conjugated anti-CD8 (Boehringer Mannheim) and FITC-conjugated F(ab’)2 sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenus Laboratories, Hawthorn, Australia). Samples were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the LYSYS II program. Protein extracts from fresh and cultured cells were prepared, and CAT activity was measured as described in Ref. 21Plaetinck G. Combe M.-C. Corthésy P. Sperisen P. Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar, except that extracts were heated at 60°C for 10 min before the assay. Tissues were flash frozen in dry ice and ethanol and stored at −80°C. Samples were homogenized in 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, freeze-thawed 3 times, and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm. Supernatants were heated at 60°C for 10 min and centrifuged for another 10 min at the same speed. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). CAT reactions were run at 37°C overnight. CAT activity was expressed as percentage of [14C]chloramphenicol converted to acetylated forms, as evaluated by PhosphorImager scanning. RNA was prepared by guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described previously using mouse IL-2Rα and β-actin probes, which, when hybridized with mRNA, generate RNase-resistant fragments of 414 and 138 nucleotides, respectively (19Wilson A. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To make cells permeable to DNase-I, we treated them with lysolecithin as described by Miller et al.(50Miller M.R. Castellot J.J.J. Pardee A.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended to 108/ml in buffer A (150 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 35 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2). One-third volume of a solution of 1 mg/ml of lysolecithin (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) in buffer A was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 70 s. Permeabilization was stopped by adding 20 volumes of ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted and resuspended to 108/ml in ice-cold buffer A containing 2 mM CaCl2. Aliquots of 107 cells were incubated with different amounts of DNase-I (Pharmacia) for 1 min at 20°C. Nuclease digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). Samples were incubated for at least 2 h at 37°C before extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol. Nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated from the aqueous phase and redissolved in Tris EDTA buffer. Their concentration was estimated by measuring A260. An aliquot was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel to check the quality of the DNA and the effect of DNase-I digestion. 60-80 μg of DNA from each sample were digested to completion with the indicated restriction enzymes and electrophoresed in 0.8-1% agarose gels in Tris borate buffer at 1-1.5 V/cm. DNA was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride-based membranes (ImmobilonTM transfer membranes, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to the indications of the manufacturer. To screen for DHS, we prepared probes using IL-2Rα genomic fragments C or D (see Fig. 6) as templates, with the random priming kit supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. Membranes were hybridized with QuickhybTM solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer at 65°C. Filters were autoradiographed for 1-7 days at −70°C with intensifying screens. To detect TcR rearrangements, blots were hybridized with an antisense RNA probe (86T1) specific for the constant region of the TcR β gene (51Hedrick S.M. Nielsen E.A. Kavaler J. Cohen D.I. Davis M.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) labeled by in vitro transcription with Riboprobe® Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). We have previously shown that the mouse IL-2Rα gene 5’-flanking region from bp −2539 to +93 confers a pattern of expression on a linked bacterial CAT gene that closely resembles that of the endogenous IL-2Rα gene in the rodent T cell line PC60 (21Plaetinck G. Combe M.-C. Corthésy P. Sperisen P. Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used this construct, referred to as IL-2Rα-CAT, to generate transgenic mice. Five transgenic mice (out of 40 live births) were identified by Southern blot analysis. They carried between two and 29 copies of the transgene (Fig. 1). All founders transmitted the transgene to offspring at a constant copy number. As expected, the transgenic mice appeared normal with regard to behavior, lifespan, and physiology. They contained normal numbers of lymphocytes with normal subset distributions (data not shown). The responses of the lymphocytes in in vitro culture conditions were indistinguishable from those of cells from nontransgenic littermates. To determine in which tissues the IL-2Rα-CAT transgene was expressed, organs were taken from mice of each transgenic line and analyzed. CAT activity was undetectable in extracts (100-500 μg) of liver, kidney, heart, brain, and ovary of any transgenic line (data not shown). Lack of transgene expression in these tissues correlates with the absence of IL-2Rα+ cells observed by Takacs et al.(52Takacs L. Osawa H. Törö I. Diamantstein T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1985; 59: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar) by immunohistochemistry. No constitutive CAT activity was detected in lymph nodes of any line, whereas one line (1028) expressed activity in the spleen. The transgene was also expressed in the bone marrow of two lines (1028 and 1041) and in the thymus of four out of the five transgenic lines (). Levels of CAT activity in thymi of different transgenic lines correlated with transgene copy number (r2 = 0.93; see Table I). Unexpectedly, when thymic lymphocytes and stroma were separated, constitutive CAT activity was found in the stroma fraction but not in the lymphocytes (data not shown, see “Discussion”).Table ITissue distribution of IL-2Rα-CAT transgene expressionCAT activity in 100 μg of protein extracted from different organs.

No CAT activity was found in 100-500 μg of extracts of lymph nodes, liver, kidney, heart, brain, and ovary from mice of any transgenic line. Since mature T cells express IL-2Rα only after activation (8Robb R.J. Munck A. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), we analyzed the inducibility of the IL-2Rα-CAT transgene in lymph node and spleen cells from mice of the different transgenic lines before and after stimulation with ConA and IL-2. The effectiveness of the stimulation was checked by FACS analysis of IL-2Rα cell surface expression (see footnote to Table II). More than 85% of the stimulated cells from spleen and lymph nodes were IL-2Rα+ and CD4+ or CD8+ (data not shown). As shown in Table II, CAT activity was induced in both cell populations in four transgenic lines. Levels of expression did not correlate with transgene copy number, suggesting that the site at which the integration of the transgene occurred affects its transcriptional efficiency. The only line (1018) in which transgene expression was not inducible was the one without detectable constitutive CAT activity in the thymus (see Table I). Its transgene may have been integrated into transcriptionally inactive chromatin. This line was not further analyzed. Cells taken fresh (Table II) or after culture without stimuli (data not shown) did not have detectable CAT activity, with the exception of spleen cells from mice of line 1028, which also displayed constitutive CAT activity in total spleen extracts (Table I).Table II- Open table in a new tab When we compared the time course of transgene expression to that of the endogenous IL-2Rα gene, we found a very similar pattern (Fig. 2). CAT activity and surface IL-2Rα expression were detectable after 16 h of culture and increased until 72 h. By 6 days of culture, both activities had fallen to substantially lower levels. Anti-CD3 antibodies induce T lymphocytes to express the IL-2Rα gene and to proliferate, whereas LPS is a B cell mitogen but does not stimulate IL-2Rα expression (53Loughnan M.S. Takatsu K. Harada N. Nossal G.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5399-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the IL-2Rα-CAT transgene showed the same specificity, we purified T and B cells from lymph nodes and cultured them on plastic-bound anti-"

The two subunit genes COL4A1 and COL4A2 are found closely linked in the human and murine genomes and are transcribed divergently from a common promoter. Previously, activating elements had been detected within both genes which are indispensable for efficient transcription. An additional negative regulatory element has now been identified within the third intron of the COL4A2 gene which is able to inhibit transcription of both COL4 genes from their shared promoter, as well as the nonrelated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The element exerts its inhibitory effect largely independently from its relative orientation and distance from the initiation site of transcription. Therefore, the element represents a silencer, which is named the “COL4 silencer.” The minimal functional silencer could be narrowed down by deletion mapping to a sequence element located within intron 3 of the COL4A2 gene. This motif is specifically recognized by a nuclear protein, named “SILBF,” and the binding site of which was determined by footprinting assays. Mutation studies and deletion analysis proved that the presence of this sequence element and its interaction with SILBF is not only essential but also sufficient for the silencing function. We assume that the COL4 silencer plays an important role in the control of overall expression and the balance of divergent transcription of both COL4 genes.

Analysis of the regulatory elements revealed that the COL4 promoter does not show any significant transcriptional activity, but depends on the presence of additional activating elements within both genes (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Pollner R. Fischer G. Pöschl E. Kühn K. Aren. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutational studies indicated that the promoter represents a region of two overlapping unidirectional promoters, sharing the same cis-acting elements (23Schmidt C. Fischer G. Kadner H. Genersch E. Kühn K. Posch] E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem.

The COL4 promoter is GC-rich and lacks a canonical TATA box motif, but careful analysis of functional cis-elements proved that short AT-rich motifs are essential for efficient transcription of both genes (25Heikkila P. Soininen R. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24677-24682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of cis-elements and trans-acting factors did not yet result in a conclusive description of the mechanisms responsible for the specific expression of the COL4 genes in basement membraneproducing cells. Some recent data indicate that the specific demethylation of some CpG sites in the COL4 genes may correlate with the onset of expression during differentiation of murine F9 teratocarcinoma cells (26Strickland S.

Silencing elements have been detected in numerous genes and are involved in the regulation of expression due to their ability to interfere with the formation of productive transcription initiation complexes (39Renkawitz R. Trends. Genet. 1990; 6: 192-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 40Jackson M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the initial analysis of the regulatory elements of human COL4 genes we recognized a fragment in the COL4A2 gene, which revealed an inhibitory effect on the transcription from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we describe the localization and further characterization of this novel silencing element, which is named the COL4 silencer. Constructs and Fragments—Numbering of all fragments from human collagen IV genes correponds to entry HSC0L4AI2 in the EMBL data base. The construct pTKCAT is identical with pBLCAT2 (53Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 155490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), and pNACAT and pBNaSACAT have been described previously (23Schmidt C. Fischer G. Kadner H. Genersch E. Kühn K. Posch] E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fragments SE (SphI-EcoRI, 1041–2184), SH (SphI-HindIII, 1041–1557), HE (HindIII-EcoRI, 1557–2184), SA (SphI-ApaI, 1041–1169), AAH (αpaI-HindIII, 1169–1557), AA (αpaI-αpaI, 1169–1317), and AH (ApaI-HindIII, 1317–1557) were isolated from clone p361 (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), cloned upstream of the HSV-TK promoter of pTKCAT, and resulted in the clones shown in Fig. 1B. Series of unidirectional deletions from either side were generated by treatment with ExoIII and mung bean nuclease following the supplier’s protocol (Stratagene) in clone pAH containing fragment AH subcloned in vector pBSIIsk– (Stratagene). The end points of deletion were determined by sequencing, and fragments were inserted in pTKCAT as described above and resulted in the clones shown in Fig. 1C. For the construction of pAH-NACAT and pAH-BNaSACAT, the fragment AH was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification with complementary oligonucleotides introducing additional SphI and SalI sites at the 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively. The product was cloned in pBNACAT and pBNaSACAT digested with SphI and SalI. Fragment Sil (1412–1484) was generated by polymerase chain reaction with complementary oligonucleotides introducing HindIII and EcoRI sites at the 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively. The product was cloned into the vector pBSIIsk– (Stratagene) resulting in pBS-Sil. pSil-TKCAT contains the HincII-BamHI insert of pBS-Sil cloned into the SalI and BamHI restricted pTKCAT. pSil-NACAT was constructed by cloning the SmaI-HincII insert of pBS-Sil into the blunt-ended HindIII site of pNACAT. Deletions were introduced in the constructs pAHdSil-NACAT (deletion of 1412–1484) and pAHdAH2-NACAT (deletion of 1427–1450) by a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy (51Pöschl E. Mayer U. Block D. Fox J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) introducing a HindIII or EcoRV site at the site of deletion, respectively. Fragment AH2 (1427–1450) was generated by annealing corresponding complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and subcloning into the SmaI site of pBSIIsk– (pBS-AH2). Oligonucleotide CANP-GCF, representing the binding site of GCF in the CANP gene, was taken from Ref. 43Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, and fragment CTC contains the binding site of CTCBF (24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fragment MCS represents the polylinker region of pUC18. Mutations of AH2 were generated by annealing two corresponding complementary oligonucleotides and subsequent cloning in pBSIIsk– and pNACAT. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—The culture of cell lines HT1080, SAO, F9, and HeLa, transient transfection assays, and determination of CAT activities were performed as described previously (22Pollner R. Fischer G. Pöschl E. Kühn K. Aren. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Schmidt C. Fischer G. Kadner H. Genersch E. Kühn K. Posch] E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Activities represent the mean of at least three parallel transfections, and relative activities were calculated based on the activity of pTKCAT, arbitrarily set as 100%. Nuclear Extracts and Gel Retardation Assays—Nuclear extracts from cultured HT1080, EW, and Jurkat cells, as well as isolated nuclei of HeLa cells (Computer Cell Culture Center, Mons, Belgium) were prepared as described (24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were fractionated by successive chromatography on heparin-agarose and DNA-cellulose as described (52Genersch E. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Herzog C. Kühn K. Pöschl E. EMBO J. 1994; 14: 791-800Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, SILBF was detected in fraction HA/500 (heparin-agarose, elution at 500 mM KCl) and CT/250 (DNA-cellulose, elution at 250 mM KCl). Fragments used in gel retardation assays were isolated from the corresponding clones (pBS-Sil, pBS-AH, pBS-AH2) by digestion with BamHI and HindIII, and fragments were labeled at the 5′-termini with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]αTP. Gel retardation assays and competition assays were done as described previously (24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Footprinting reactions were performed as described (50Henninhausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The XhoI-XbaI insert of pBS-Sil was used, and fragments were 5′-end-labeled either at the XhoI (upper strand) or XbaI site (lower strand) and incubated with fraction CT/250. The reaction products after DNase I digestion were purified and separated on sequencing gels. Dideoxy sequencing reactions were performed with clone pBS-Sil and primers KS (upper strand) and SK (lower strand). A Silencing Element Is Located in the Third Intron of the COL4A2 Gene—First indications of the presence of a negatively acting element were obtained during transfection studies with reporter gene constructs containing different fragments from the COL4A2 gene combined with the HSV-TK promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The organization of the COL4 gene locus is shown in Fig. 1A, and initial experiments for the localization of this element are summarized in Fig. 1B. The fragment SE, comprising a region from the first intron and extending to the third intron of the COL4A2 gene, was positioned upstream of the HSV-TK promoter in both orientations (pSE-TKCAT, pES-TKCAT) and was tested by transient transfection assays in human HT1080 cells (Fig. 1B). The activity was reduced to background levels (12% and 9%) when compared with the activity of the basic construct pTKCAT, set arbitrarily as 100%, and the promoterless construct p0CAT, as 8% (Fig. 1C). Fragments SH (pHS-TKCAT), AAH (pAAH-TKCAT, pHAA-TKCAT), and AH (pAH-TKCAT, pHA-TKCAT) also retained inhibitory activity, whereas fragments HE, SA, and AA revealed no effect on the transcription from the HSV-TK promoter. Therefore, a strong negatively acting element is localized within the fragment AH (ApeaI-HindIII, 1317–1557). The position of the inhibitory element was further narrowed down by deletion mapping of the fragment AH. Unidirectional deletions of the fragment AH were generated and combined with pTKCAT resulting in the constructs shown in Fig. 1C. All constructs were tested by transient transfection assays in HT1080 cells. The fragment in construct pHA(171)-TKCAT and all larger fragments retained inhibitory activity, whereas fragments in pHA(92)-TKCAT and pHA(71)-TKCAT lost inhibitory capacity on the HSV-TK promoter. Deletions of sequences upstream of position 1409 did not impair the silencing activity, as seen with pAH(148)-TKCAT and all constructs containing larger fragments. Deletion of sequences located more upstream in constructs pAH(126)-TKCAT, pAH(102)-TKCAT, pAH(72)-TKCAT, and pAH(40Jackson M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)-TKCAT resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory capacity. Therefore, functionally essential sequences must be located between position 1409 and position 1488. The fragment Sil (1412–1484) was selected for a more detailed analysis of the negatively acting element (see Fig. 5). The effect of the element is largely independent of its orientation relative to the initiation site of transcription, as can be seen in the constructs pHA-TKCAT and pAH-TKCAT, which reveal no significant difference in activities. Earlier experiments have shown that the silencing effect is moderately modulated by the distance from the start site of transcription (data not shown) and also exerts its effect when placed downstream of the transcription unit of the reporter gene (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These characteristics resemble typical features of enhancers (41Khoury G. Gruss P. Cell. 1983; 33: 313-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and silencers (42Brand A.H. Breeden L. Abraham J. Sternglanz R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1985; 41: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and, therefore, the element was named “COL4 silencer.” The COL4 silencer had been originally identified (11Pöschl E. Pollner R. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and localized (see Fig. 1) on the basis of its effect on transcription of the heterologous HSV-TK promoter. In order to elucidate its contribution to the regulation of collagen IV genes, the silencer, represented by fragment AH, was inserted in reporter constructs detecting transcription from the shared COL4 promoter either in the α1(IV) or α2(IV) direction as described previously (23Schmidt C. Fischer G. Kadner H. Genersch E. Kühn K. Posch] E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pNACAT contains the promoter and the first intron of COL4A2 with the CAT reporter gene linked to the second exon (see Fig. 5). pBNaSACAT contains the promoter, first exon with deleted translational start site, and part of the first intron of the COL4A1 gene, with the second exon of COL4A2 gene used as splice acceptor site (23Schmidt C. Fischer G. Kadner H. Genersch E. Kühn K. Posch] E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fragment AH was inserted upstream of transcription start sites, resulting in the constructs pAH-NACAT and pAH-BNaSACAT. These constructs were tested by transient transfection assays in HT1080 cells and compared with the constructs pTKCAT and pAH-TKCAT (Table I). Transcription from the HSV-TK (pAH-TKCAT) and the COL4A2 promoter (pAH-NACAT) was strongly inhibited to 8% and 15%, when compared with the activity of the reference constructs (pTKCAT, pNACAT). A weaker inhibitory effect was observed for the transcription in the α1(IV) direction in pAH-BNaSACAT (42%).Table IEffect of the COL4 silencer on different promoters in various cellsPromoterConstructsRelative activity in HT1080SAOF9/–F9/+HSV-TKpTK-CAT100(26)100(38)100(15)100(44)pAH-TKCAT8(3)8%66(15)66%107(24)107%34(22)34%α2(IV)pNACAT287(56)46(27)849(190)5171(1625)pAH-NACAT42(6)15%26(4)56%337(93)40%870(280)17%α1(IV)pBNaSACAT261(32)27(13)932(272)11024(1373)pAH-BNaSACAT110(36)42%22(10)81%574(161)62%792(360)7% Open table in a new tab The same constructs were also transfected to the osteosarcoma cell line SAO not expressing collagen type IV. The activities of the constructs pNACAT and pBNaSACAT are very low, when compared with the activity of the HSV-TK promoter in pTKCAT. Only a moderate decrease in activity was seen with all constructs containing the fragment AH (44%-29%). Therefore, cells not expressing collagen IV are not only less active in transcription from the COL4 promoter but the inhibitory effect of the silencer is diminished. The differentiation of murine teratocarcinoma F9 to parietal endoderm-like cells by treatment with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP is accompanied by the onset of expression of collagen IV, laminin, and nidogen (26Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 27Rogers M.B. Watkins S.C. Gudas L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). F9 cells were transfected with the same constructs, and activity was determined without (F9/-) or after treatment with retinoic acid/dibutyryl cAMP (F9/+). The activity of the HSV-TK promoter in pTKCAT was found to be very low, whereas the COL4 promoter was transcribed more efficiently, as represented by pNACAT and pBNaSACAT. Transcription in the α1(IV) and α2(IV) direction could be inhibited only partially (60% and 38% inhibition) by the COL4 silencer in F9/– cells. On the other hand, in F9/+ cells, the promoters were more efficiently transcribed, but, in parallel, the silencing effect of the AH fragment results in a stronger inhibition of activity. These data indicate that the COL4 promoter is used more efficiently in cells expressing collagen IV, like HT1080 and F9/+, but this effect is paralleled by a stronger effect of the COL4 silencer. Obviously, the balance of activating elements and the inhibitory COL4 silencer plays an important role in the control of transcription. A Nuclear Factor Binds Specifically to the COL4 Silencer and Mediates the Silencing Effect—The identification and analysis of the cis-acting COL4 silencer stimulated attempts to identify trans-acting nuclear factors potentially involved in mediating the silencing effect. The minimal fragment Sil (see Fig. 1C) was tested for its ability to bind nuclear factors by gel retardation assays (Fig. 2). Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were used because the COL4 silencer was also shown to exert its negative effect in these cells (see Fig. 5). The conditions for binding to labeled fragment Sil were optimized (data not shown) and resulted in the formation of two well detectable retarded complexes (Fig. 2A). The specificity of these complexes was tested by competition experiments using unlabeled fragments Sil, nonrelated MCS, or a fragment corresponding to the binding site of the factor CTCBF (24Fischer G. Schmidt C. Opitz J. Cully Z. Kühn K. Pöschl E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Only the slower migrating complex could be specifically competed by the addition of a molar excess of fragment Sil (lanes 2 and 3), but not by nonrelated sequences (lanes 4–7). This complex is therefore formed by the specific interaction with a nuclear factor, which was named SILBF. The faster migrating band represents S nonspecific DNA-protein complex. The binding site of SILBF was defined by footprinting experiments (Fig. 3). The fragment Sil was subcloned (pBS-Sil), and unilaterally labeled fragments were generated by 5′-end-labeling of the upper strand (XbaI) or the lower strand (XhoI). Dideoxy sequencing ladders were generated by using the primers KS and SK (Stratagene) for comparison with the DNase I-generated cleavage products, because 5′-termini of these primers correspond to the termini of the labeled fragments. Full protection of the binding site could only be enabled after enrichment of SILBF by successive chromatographic fractionation on heparin agarose (fraction HA/500, 500 mM KCl eluate) and calf thymus DNA-cellulose (fraction CT/250, 250 mM KCl eluate) (data not shown). Footprinting reactions were performed with increasing amounts of enriched SILBF, and products were separated on sequencing gels (Fig. 3). Two protected regions could be recognized in the coding strand which are separated only by a single base pair (Fig. 3A). The protected region corresponds to position 1429–1450. The noncoding strand revealed a protected region corresponding to position 1427–1449 (Fig. 3β). The sequences involved in interaction with SILBF are marked in Fig. 3 and define the minimal binding site of the factor between positions 1427 and 1450. Comparison of this sequence motif with published sequences in data bases reveal no obvious homologies to known motifs. A partial homology was detected with the binding motif of the negatively acting factor GCF (43Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but gel retardation and competition experiments, using the GCF binding motif from the human CANP gene, proved that SILBF is different from GCF (see Fig. 6A). We assume that SILBF represents a novel negatively acting factor. The fragment AH2 (1427–1450), representing the minimal binding site of SILBF, is included in fragment Sil (1412–1484). Comparison of both fragments by gel retardation (Fig. 2) resulted in the formation of similar complexes (Fig. 2, A and B). Only the slower migrating complexes could be competed specifically by unlabeled fragments (lanes 2, 3, and 9), but not by nonrelated sequences, like MCS (lanes 4, 5, and 10). The specific complex formed on fragment AH2 could also be competed by fragment Sil (lane 11). These data indicate that the same nuclear factor, SILBF, interacts spec"
https://openalex.org/W2010386145,"1-O-Alkyl-sn-glycerol (alkylglycerol) forms the backbone of complex ether-linked glycerolipids, including biologically active lipids such as platelet-activating factor. Synthetic alkylglycerol itself possesses several potent pharmacological activities and has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro. In spite of these properties, free alkylglycerol has been regarded only as a potential product of the inflammatory degradation of complex ether lipids rather than a natural cell constituent. To explore the possibility that endogenous alkylglycerol functions as a physiological regulator in normal cells, we measured its content, along with related monoglycerides and diglycerides, by high performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The content of free alkylglycerol increased up to 20-fold during the growth of MDCK cell cultures to a confluent density. The increase was greatest during the log phase of growth, in which the content of alkylglycerol rose from 6.0 ± 1.3 nmol/108 cells in preconfluent cultures to 23.6 ± 3.4 nmol/108 cells in confluent cultures. Analysis of the molecular species of alkylglycerol showed that the higher content in quiescent MDCK cells was due primarily to an increase in 1-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerol. In contrast, the levels of monoacylglycerol and the PKC activator diacylglycerol were lower in confluent, quiescent cultures than in preconfluent, proliferating cultures. A similar pattern of changes in the monoglyceride and diglyceride content was observed in interleukin-3-dependent CFTL-12 mast cells when cell proliferation was blocked by growth factor withdrawal.Growth of MDCK cells to a confluent density resulted in a decrease in particulate PKC enzyme activity to a level that was only 6% of that in proliferating cells. To explore whether the accumulation of cellular alkylglycerol contributes to growth-dependent changes in PKC activity, we examined the effects of adding alkylglycerol to the activity and subcellular distribution of the enzyme in MDCK cells. Treatment of cells with 1-O-dodecyl-en-glycerol resulted in a decrease in the activity of membrane-associated PKC activity and inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Alkylglycerol was also shown to inhibit the activity of purified PKC in vitro when present at levels similar to that of the diacylglycerol activator. We propose that the accumulation of alkylglycerol during the growth of MDCK cells to a confluent density contributes to the decrease in PKC activity. The control of cellular alkylglycerol levels may be a novel mechanism for the regulation of cellular physiology. 1-O-Alkyl-sn-glycerol (alkylglycerol) forms the backbone of complex ether-linked glycerolipids, including biologically active lipids such as platelet-activating factor.

Analysis of the molecular species of alkylglycerol showed that the higher content in quiescent MDCK cells was due primarily to an increase in 1-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerol. In contrast, the levels of monoacylglycerol and the PKC activator diacylglycerol were lower in confluent, quiescent cultures than in preconfluent, proliferating cultures. A similar pattern of changes in the monoglyceride and diglyceride content was observed in interleukin-3-dependent CFTL-12 mast cells when cell proliferation was blocked by growth factor withdrawal. Growth of MDCK cells to a confluent density resulted in a decrease in particulate PKC enzyme activity to a level that was only 6% of that in proliferating cells. To explore whether the accumulation of cellular alkylglycerol contributes to growth-dependent changes in PKC activity, we examined the effects of adding alkylglycerol to the activity and subcellular distribution of the enzyme in MDCK cells. Treatment of cells with 1-O-dodecyl-en-glycerol resulted in a decrease in the activity of membrane-associated PKC activity and inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Alkylglycerol was also shown to inhibit the activity of purified PKC in vitro when present at levels similar to that of the diacylglycerol activator. We propose that the accumulation of alkylglycerol during the growth of MDCK cells to a confluent density contributes to the decrease in PKC activity. The control of cellular alkylglycerol levels may be a novel mechanism for the regulation of cellular physiology. 1-O-Alkyl-sn-glycerol (alkylglycerol) 1The abbreviations used are: alkylglycerol1-O-Alkyl-sn-glycerolalkylacylglycerol1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerolalkyldiacylglycerol1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacyl-sn-glycerolPKCprotein kinase CMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyGLCgas-liquid chromatographyDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumILinterleukinBSAbovine serum albumin. forms the backbone of ether-linked glycerolipids such as 1-O-alkyl- and 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-linked choline and ethanolamine phospholipids and 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacyl-sn-glycerol (alkyldiacylglycerol). These include biologically active lipids such as platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylsre-glycerol, which is considered to be an agonist of protein kinase C (PKC) (1Ford D.A. Miyake R. Glaser P.E. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13818-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the naturally occurring bioactive compounds, many synthetic alkylglycerol-containing lipids possess pharmacological activity and are of current interest in biomedical research, including compounds with antineoplastic and platelet-activating factor antagonist activity. Unsubstituted alkylglycerol itself evokes a variety of biological responses. 1-O-Dodecylglycerol stimulates antibody production in mice (2Ngwenya B.Z. Foster D.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and activates macrophages (3Yamamoto N. St. Clair D.A. Homma S. Ngwenya B.Z. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6044-6049PubMed Google Scholar). This form of alkylglycerol also stimulates the differentiation of neurons (4Ved H.S. Gustow E. Pieringer R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and possesses antitumor activity (5Ando K. Kodama K. Kato A. Tamura G. Arima K. Cancer Res. 1972; 321: 125-129Google Scholar). 1-O-Alkyl-sn-glycerol 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacyl-sn-glycerol protein kinase C Madin-Darby canine kidney 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate high performance liquid chromatography gas-liquid chromatography Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium interleukin bovine serum albumin. Alkylglycerol has been regarded primarily as a product of the inflammatory degradation of complex ether lipids rather than a constitutive component of normal cells (3Yamamoto N. St. Clair D.A. Homma S. Ngwenya B.Z. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6044-6049PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto N. Ngwenya B.Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2008-2013PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have detected a substantial level of free alkylglycerol in unstimulated cultured cells (7Warne T.R. Robinson M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it serves a physiological role in normal tissues. The existence of the free compound in resting cells emphasizes the importance of determining the metabolic basis of the biological activities of alkylglycerol. Although the potency of the synthetic alkylglycerol suggests that its effects are due to metabolic rather than physical processes, little is known concerning its mechanism of action. McNeely et al. (8McNeely T.B. Rosen G. Londer M.V. Turco S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 259: 601-604Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) observed that alkylglycerol, derived from the hydrolysis products of the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani, inhibited isolated rat brain PKC in vitro. Our studies show that treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with synthetic alkylglycerol potently inhibits the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites during subsequent stimulation with TPA (9Robinson M. Burdine R. Warne T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The ability of alkylglycerol to modulate this signaling pathway in intact MDCK cells, together with its natural occurrence, suggests a potential bioregulatory role for the endogenous compound as a regulator of PKC. PKC plays a central role in a variety of cell processes including the regulation of cell growth (10Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar, 11Weinstein I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 307-316PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell growth has been associated with a shift in the activity of PKC from the membrane-associated form to the cytosolic form and thus a decrease in the constitutive activity of the enzyme in nonproliferating cells (12Miloszewska J. Trawiki W. Janik P. Moraczewski J. Przybyszewska M. Szaniawska B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Halsey D.L. Girard P.R. Kuo J.F. Blackshear P.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16130-16138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol, an important physiological activator of PKC, is elevated in proliferating as compared with quiescent cells (14Whatley R.E. Stroud E.D. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16130-16138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bocckino S.B. Wilson P.B. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1991; 1085: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting that its content contributes to the regulation of basal PKC activity during changes in cell growth status. In view of the ability of alkylglycerol to inhibit PKC in vitro and in vivo and its occurrence in unstimulated cells, we explored the possibility that its content contributes to growth-dependent changes in PKC activity. We determined that the content of alkylglycerol is specifically regulated during cell growth and accumulates in growth-inhibited cells. Contact-inhibited MDCK cells have increased levels of alkylglycerol and decreased levels of PKC activity. Furthermore, brief incubation of preconfluent MDCK cells with exogenous alkylglycerol reduces membrane-associated PKC activity and inhibits phorbol ester-stimulated redistribution of PKC. These results support a role for alkylglycerol as an endogenous regulator of PKC. Materials—Solvents were HPLC grade from Burdick and Jackson, Muskegon, MI. Benzene, benzoic anhydride, benzoyl chloride, and pyridine were from Aldrich. Prepacked silica columns (PrepSep-Si, 300 mg of silica) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. [l,2,-3H]Cholesterol (62.0 Ci/mmol) and [3H]arachidonic acid (60–90 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. [3H]Dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol was prepared from l-αdipalmitoyl[2-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine (50.0 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) by phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus, type XIII, Sigma) hydrolysis (18Mavis R.D. Bell R.M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2835-2841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other lipids, enzymes, and reagents, unless indicated, were from Sigma. Purified PKC from rat brain was from Calbiochem. l-O-Dodecyl-sn-glycerol was prepared by reacting dodecyl methanesulfonate with 2,3-isopropylidene-sn-glycerols by the method of Baumann and Mangold (19Baumann W.J. Mangold H.K. J. Org. Chem. 1964; 29: 3055-3057Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The alkylglycerol product was purified by preparative TLC in a solvent system of hexane:ether (80:20) and quantified by GLC. The purity was found to be greater than 98% by GLC. Cell Culture—MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and were passaged by trypsinization. MDCK cells were seeded at a density of 1–5 × 104 cells/cm2 using 10-cm diameter dishes (mass analysis of lipids and PKC determination) and 24-well multiwell plates (arachidonic acid release). The interleukin (IL)-3-dependent mast cell line CFTL-12 (obtained from Dr. J. Pierce, NIH, Bethesda) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and a supernatant (10% v/v) prepared from the culture medium of WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3. CFTL-12 cells were passaged by dilution and harvested after 4–6 day of culture (8.0 × 105 cells/ml). Measurement of Monoalkylglycerol, Monoacylglycerol, Alkylacylglycerol, and Diacylglycerol—Cells were rinsed twice with serum-free medium and fixed by the addition of methanol. [3H]Cholesterol (0.35 µCi) and [3H]dihexadecanoylglycerol (0.08 μCi) were added as internal standards and the total lipids extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 627-643Crossref Scopus (42871) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of cholesterol, alkylacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoalkylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol was performed as described previously (7Warne T.R. Robinson M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using solid phase extraction to isolate the combined lipid classes from total lipid extracts, followed by derivatization and separation of the compounds by normal phase HPLC as their benzoate (cholesterol and diglycerides) and dibenzoate (monoglycerides) derivatives. HPLC was performed using a Perkin-Elmer series 410 LC pump and LC-95 UV/visible LC spectrophotometer. For data collection, the detector was interfaced to Maxima 820 Chromatography Workstation on an NEC APCIV computer. The mass of benzoate derivatives was determined from their 230 nm absorbance and corrected for recovery using radiolabeled internal standard cholesterol and dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol as described (21Warne T.R. Robinson M. Lipids. 1990; 25: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For analysis of monoacylglycerol and monoalkylglycerol by GLC, cell lipids were separated by TLC using a solvent system of hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (40:60:1). The area corresponding to the combined monoacylglycerols and monoalkylglycerols was scraped and the lipids extracted and converted to 1-radyl-2,3-O-isopropylidine derivatives (22Wykle R.L. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3047-3058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Myher J.J. Kuksis A. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 1-alkyl-2,3-O-isopropylidine derivatives were separated from 1-acyl-2,3-O-isopropylidine by TLC using a solvent system of hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1) and were analyzed by GLC using a DB-23 capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The initial oven temperature was 180 °C and increased to 230 °C at 3.5 °C/min followed by an increase to 240 °C at 10 °C/min. Peaks were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of isopropylidine derivatives of standard alkylglycerol species. Arachidonic Acid Release—For experiments using MDCK cells grown in 24-well multiwell plates, preconfluent monolayers were trypsinized, and 1 × 105 cells were seeded in each well (15-mm) and used 24 h later when cells were 70–80% confluent. Cell lipids were labeled by incubating the monolayers for 3 h in 210 μl of DMEM containing 0.25% BSA (DMEM-BSA) with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid. Cells incorporated 70–85% of the label using this procedure. Cells were treated with alkylglycerol by adding the 1-O-dodecyl-sn-glycerol in 90 μl of DMEM-BSA for the appropriate time prior to stimulation. The medium was then aspirated, and the monolayers were rinsed once with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and incubated in the same medium for 5 min. TPA in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1%) was then added at a final TPA concentration of 100 nM, and the cells were incubated for the appropriate time. All incubations were at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Following incubation, the medium was aspirated and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Methanol was added to the wells, and the cells were scraped and transferred directly to vials for determination of radioactivity. Arachidonic acid release was determined as the total radioactivity accumulating in the medium as a percent of the total incubation radioactivity (cells plus medium). Measurement of PKC Activity—MDCK cells were homogenized in buffer A (2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 50 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.33 M sucrose and 25 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were scraped and collected in buffer A and disrupted by sonication. The suspension was separated into a cytosolic and membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min). The pellet (particulate) fraction was suspended in buffer A containing 5 mg/ml Nonidet P-40. Both the supernatant (soluble) and the particulate fractions were applied to DEAE-Sepharose columns, washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A, and the activity was eluted from the columns by adding buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl. The eluant was stored at –80 °C. PKC activity in each fraction was measured by the transfer of phosphorus from [γ-32P]αTP to a synthetic peptide (Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala-Lys-Lys). The incubation mixture (120 μl) contained 0.2 μg/μl peptide, 10 μμ [γ-32P]αTP (1,000 cpm/pmol), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.8 μg/ml diolein. Liposomes of phosphatidylserine and diolein were prepared by sonication in 20 mM Tris. Incubations were at 30 °C for 5 min and were initiated with 30 μl of column eluate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 m ATP, and the entire mixture was placed on ice. 100 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper that was washed three times in 75 mM phosphoric acid. The amount of radioactivity remaining bound to the paper was determined by scintillation counting. Protein kinase activity was determined as the pmol of phosphorus transferred to peptide per min with the activity in the absence of protein subtracted from each determination. PKC activity was expressed as the difference in activity in the presence and absence of calcium, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. For studies on the effects of alkylglycerol on the activity of purified PKC, phosphatidylserine and diolein were suspended in detergent micelles by sonication in 0.03% Triton X-100. Micelles containing alkylglycerol were prepared by suspending varying amounts 1-O-dodecyl-racglycerol in a constant volume of 0.03% Triton X-100. The final concentration of Triton X-100 in the assay was 112 μg/ml. Incubations were initiated with the addition of 0.012 μg of purified rat brain PKC. All other conditions and concentrations were as described above. Analysis of the Content of Alkylglycerol and Related Lipids in MDCK Cells—Our previous analysis of the monoradylglycerols and diradylglycerols of MDCK cells revealed the presence of alkylglycerol (7Warne T.R. Robinson M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In light of the biological activity of synthetic alkylglycerol and its ability to inhibit PKC in vitro (8McNeely T.B. Rosen G. Londer M.V. Turco S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 259: 601-604Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) we performed a detailed characterization of its content, along with related lipids, in MDCK cells. Alkylglycerol was isolated from total lipid extracts of MDCK cells by solid phase extraction and quantified, along with monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, and cholesterol, by normal phase HPLC as the benzoate derivatives (7Warne T.R. Robinson M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We observed that the content of alkylglycerol was highly dependent on the growth status of the cells. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of HPLC profiles from preconfluent, proliferating and confluent, quiescent cultures of MDCK cells. The 1-O-alkyl-2,3-dibenzoylglycerol derivatives of the alkylglycerol species elute from the HPLC as a group of peaks between 8 and 10 min and are greatly elevated in confluent cells. In contrast, diacylglycerol species, whose derivatives elute between 12 and 17 min, are reduced in confluent MDCK cells. The lower level of diacylglycerol in contact-inhibited MDCK cells is consistent with our previous study in which the species of diacylglycerol were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (21Warne T.R. Robinson M. Lipids. 1990; 25: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The higher levels of alkylglycerol in confluent cultures did not reflect an overall accumulation of monoglycerides since the content of monoacylglycerol was consistently low in MDCK cells and was reduced in confluent as compared with preconfluent cells. Fig. 2 shows the results of an analysis of the monoglyceride content of MDCK cells throughout the cell growth curve. The alkylglycerol content remained low throughout the initial stages of growth and increased dramatically as the rate of proliferation declined following mid-log phase of growth. The increase in alkylglycerol proceeded until the cultures formed a tight epithelium that was resistant to trypsinization, at which time the level had increased nearly 20-fold over that of low density cultures. Confluent cultures of MDCK cells were viable for several days of culture and maintained a high content of alkylglycerol but became resistant to trypsinization and determination of cell density. Table I compares the content of the monoradylglycerols and diradylglycerols in preconfluent and confluent MDCK cultures. In contrast to alkylglycerol, the monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol fractions are elevated in preconfluent cultures as compared with confluent cultures. The content of alkylglycerol in the total partial glycerides of MDCK cells increases from less than 1 mol % to greater than 15 mol % in confluent cultures. These results are based on quantitative analysis of the monoglycerides and diglycerides relative to the level of cholesterol, which was quantified along with the partial glycerides as the cholesterol-benzoate derivative. We also measured the content of the monoglycerides and diglycerides relative to the total cell number. The results are similar, since the content of cholesterol per cell was found to remain relatively constant during the growth curve.Table IEffect of cell density on the content of partial glycerides in MDCK cellsDensityMonoalkylglycerolMonoacylglycerolAlkylacylglycerolDiacylglycerolnmol/μmol cholesterolaPartial glycerides and cholesterol were measured by HPLC and corrected for recovery using radiolabeled dipalmitin and cholesterol as internal standards.Preconfluent4.26 ± 0.76 (5)6.25 ± 1.09 (5)29.31 ±2.89 (5)70.85 ± 2.42 (5)Confluent15.43 ± 2.87 (7)**2.33 ± 0.55 (7)**24.83 ±2.82 (7)46.91 ± 6.20 (7)*nmol/108 cellbPartial glycerides were measured by HPLC and corrected for recovery using radiolabeled dipalmitin as an internal standard.

Open table in a new tab The alkylglycerobenzoates, eluting in the 8–10-min region of the normal phase HPLC, were collected and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC to quantify individual alkylglycerol molecular species. As shown in Table II, the alkylglycerol consisted primarily of the 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, and 20:0 species. The 18:0 species was predominant, making up more than half of the total alkylglycerol. Although all species showed a net increase during density-dependent growth inhibition, the proportion of the 18:0 in the total alkylglycerol increased, and that of the 18:1 species decreased. To confirm the identities of the molecular species, alkylglycerol was isolated from high density cultures by TLC, converted to the isopropylidine derivatives, and analyzed by GLC. These results were similar to those obtained using HPLC analysis of the benzoate derivatives with the exception of some minor species identified by HPLC which were not detected by GLC.Table IIEffect of cell density on the molecular species of alkylglycerol in MDCK cellsSpeciesaDenotes the total number of carbons and double bonds in the alkyl moiety.Preconfluent HPLCConfluentHPLCGLC%total alkyl-GbMol percent of each species in the total alklyglycerol.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Content of Alkylglycerol and Related Lipids in CFTL-12 Cells—We wished to determine if the density-dependent changes in alkylglycerol and related lipids observed in MDCK cells also occur in other cell types whose growth can be regulated by means other than through contact inhibition. We therefore compared the content of monoglycerides and diglycerides in proliferating CFTL-12 cells with those in cells that were growth-inhibited by withdrawal from IL-3. CFTL-12 mast cells are derived from fetal mouse liver and are dependent on the continuous presence of the growth factor IL-3 for proliferation (24Brown M.A. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Falco J. Ihle J.N. Paul W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Culturing CFTL-12 cells in the absence of IL-3 for 48 h resulted in complete inhibition of proliferation without a loss of viability as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion. As shown in Table III, growth inhibition had effects similar to those observed for contact-inhibited MDCK cells. CFTL-12 cells made quiescent by withdrawal from IL-3 possessed 40% more alkylglycerol than proliferating cells. In contrast, the levels of monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol were both reduced in IL3-depleted, quiescent cells. Thus cell growth inhibition, whether by growth factor withdrawal in CFTL-12 cells or contact inhibition in MDCK cells, was associated with increased levels of a putative PKC inhibitor alkylglycerol and reduced levels of the PKC activator diacylglycerol.Table IIIEffect of cell growth status on the content of partial glycerides in CFTL-12 cellsGrowth statusMonoalkylglycerolMonoacylglycerolAlkylacylglycerolDiacylglycerolnmol/μmol cholesterolProliferating18.6 ± 2.112.6 ± 2.631.2 ± 4.727.1 ± 3.4Quiescent24.7 ± 2.2*7.1 ± 1.2*25.5 ± 4.816.2 ± 1.2** Open table in a new tab Effect of Cell Growth Status on PKC Activity and TPA-stimulated Arachidonic Acid Release in MDCK Cells—Growth-dependent changes in the activity and subcellular distribution of PKC have been demonstrated in several cell types.

https://openalex.org/W1971977331,"In order to analyze the structural requirement(s) for proteolytic cleavage, synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) sequence of the precursor to the D1 protein (pD1) of the photosystem II reaction center, with or without substituted side chain(s) around the cleavage site, were subjected to enzymatic analysis with partially purified processing protease from spinach. The efficiency of action as a competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic cleavage of the COOH-terminal extension, as well as the capacity to serve as a substrate, was used as an indication of effective binding to the protease. Neither a COOH-terminal fragment consisting of the 9 amino acids that are cleaved from pD1 by the protease nor a COOH-terminal fragment of the mature protein consisting of 15 amino acids inhibited the enzymatic processing of pD1. By contrast, a COOH-terminal fragment of pD1 consisting of 24 amino acids, which included the sequences of both the COOH-terminal extension and the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of the mature protein, was effective both as a competitive inhibitor and as a substrate. This result suggests that the structure formed by linkage between these two parts of the protein moiety is important in the substrate-enzyme interaction. Among substitutions around the cleavage site, the replacement of Leu-343 by Ala (L343A) specifically destroyed the ability of the oligopeptide to serve as either a substrate or an inhibitor, suggesting that the presence of the hydrophobic Leu residue is crucial for the formation of the recognition site. A series of six substitutions at Ala-345 had marked effects on the value of Vmax, without affecting the binding affinity, as represented by Km; the order of substitutions at residue 345 in terms of their effects on Vmax was Ala, Ser, Phe, Cys > Gly > Val ≫ Pro. With a Pro residue at position 345, the oligopeptide was practically inactive as a substrate. In order to analyze the structural requirement(s) for proteolytic cleavage, synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) sequence of the precursor to the D1 protein (pD1) of the photosystem II reaction center, with or without substituted side chain(s) around the cleavage site, were subjected to enzymatic analysis with partially purified processing protease from spinach. The efficiency of action as a competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic cleavage of the COOH-terminal extension, as well as the capacity to serve as a substrate, was used as an indication of effective binding to the protease. Neither a COOH-terminal fragment consisting of the 9 amino acids that are cleaved from pD1 by the protease nor a COOH-terminal fragment of the mature protein consisting of 15 amino acids inhibited the enzymatic processing of pD1. By contrast, a COOH-terminal fragment of pD1 consisting of 24 amino acids, which included the sequences of both the COOH-terminal extension and the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of the mature protein, was effective both as a competitive inhibitor and as a substrate. This result suggests that the structure formed by linkage between these two parts of the protein moiety is important in the substrate-enzyme interaction. Among substitutions around the cleavage site, the replacement of Leu-343 by Ala (L343A) specifically destroyed the ability of the oligopeptide to serve as either a substrate or an inhibitor, suggesting that the presence of the hydrophobic Leu residue is crucial for the formation of the recognition site. A series of six substitutions at Ala-345 had marked effects on the value of Vmax, without affecting the binding affinity, as represented by Km; the order of substitutions at residue 345 in terms of their effects on Vmax was Ala, Ser, Phe, Cys > Gly > Val ≫ Pro. With a Pro residue at position 345, the oligopeptide was practically inactive as a substrate.

Together with its homologous counterpart, the D2 protein, it forms a heterodimer, as in the reaction center of purple bacteria (3Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar), providing binding sites for the pigments and redox cofactors that are engaged in the primary and the secondary electron-transfer reactions (4Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. Vol. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 289-318Google Scholar). A Tyr residue on D1 also serves as the secondary electron donor of the photosystem (5Debus R.J. Barry B.A. Babcock G.T. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). An unusual property of this essential subunit of the PSII reaction center is, however, the extraordinarily high rate of its turnover in vivo(6Ellis R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 111-137Crossref Google Scholar, 7Mattoo A.K. Marder J.B. Edelman M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this metabolic cycle, the D1 subunit is synthesized by thylakoid-bound ribosomes on the stromal surface of membranes as a precursor protein, which has a short carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) extension (9Reisfeld A. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Minami E. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 839-846Google Scholar). This part of the protein is translocated immediately after synthesis into the lumenal space and then it is excised enzymatically with a half-time of several minutes, as clearly demonstrated by the results of analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled proteins (9Reisfeld A. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown by previous studies of the LF-1 mutant of Scenedesmus obliquues(11Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of genetically engineered mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), this COOH-terminal cleavage process is essential for the evolution of oxygen in photosynthesis. In a study with Synechocystis, it was proposed that a free carboxyl group at the COOH terminus of the D1 mature protein is, by itself, a ligand for the manganese cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). By contrast, genetically truncated mutant proteins that lack the COOH-terminal extension, both in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(13Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), as well as in Euglena gracilis in which no extension is encoded by the coding sequence for D1 (14Keller M. Stutz E. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 173-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), have been shown to be able to participate in photosynthesis, at least under the conditions tested to date. Thus, the biological function(s) of the COOH-terminal extension of the D1 protein is still obscure, although the cleavage process is absolutely essential if such an extension is present. photosystem II precursor to the D1 protein high performance liquid chromatography. The enzymatic cleavage of the COOH-terminal extension of the precursor to the D1 protein (pD1) occurs on the carboxyl-terminal side (C-side) of Ala-344, both in higher plants (15Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Takahashi Y. Nakane H. Kojima H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 273-280Google Scholar) and in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The extension consists of 9 amino acids in higher plants and of 16 amino acids in Synechocystis. To date, more than 45 psbA genes for the D1 protein have been sequenced. These genes come from a wide variety of organisms, from cyanobacteria to higher plants (17Zurawski G. Bohnert H.J. Whitfeld P.R. Bottomley W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6260-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Svensson B. Vass I. Styring S. Z.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1992: 3-11Crossref Google Scholar), but the deduced amino acid sequences are highly homologous. One striking feature of the sequences is that the amino acids upstream of the cleavage site are mostly conserved, whereas the COOH-terminal extension, which is cleaved off by the processing protease, is variable both in terms of its amino acid sequence and its length. Although there are minor variations in the upstream sequence, many of them appear to originate from only one gene, represented by psbAI of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This gene is one of three psbA genes in this organism, but its transcript has not yet been detected (20Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The protease involved in the cleavage of the COOH-terminal extension of pD1 has been extracted and purified from spinach, pea, and Scenedesmus, and its molecular and the enzymatic properties have been analyzed (21Taylor M.A. Packer J.C.L. Bowyer J.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 229-233Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. Vol. III.

A gene (ctpA) that seems to correspond to this enzyme has recently been identified in a cyanobacterium and sequenced (25Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, details of the characteristics and the mode of action of this enzyme have not been fully elucidated. For example, the inhibitors of this protease are very different from those of most proteases and the enzyme is now believed to be a new type of protease (23Bowyer J.R. Packer J.C.L. McCormack B.A. Whitelegge J.P. Robinson C. Taylor M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5424-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Satoh K. Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Regulation of Chloroplast Biogenesis. Plenum Press, New York1992: 375-382Google Scholar). Synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence of pD1 have been shown to be efficient substrates for the enzymatic reaction (27Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and they have been employed in analysis of the signals for recognition and binding (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a previous study, synthetic oligopeptides of different lengths were subjected to enzymatic analysis (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results suggested the importance of chain length, as well as of the positive charge on Asp-342, for the cleavage reaction by the enzyme in vitro(28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we synthesized oligopeptides that corresponded to the deduced COOH-terminal sequence of pD1 of spinach, but we replaced specific amino acid(s) around the cleavage site in order to analyze the requirement for conserved amino acids in the enzymatic reaction and to identify structural features in this region that are important for recognition. The results of this analysis clearly demonstrate that Leu-343 at the −2 position is essential for recognition of the substrate by the enzyme. The amino acid side chain at the +1 position, by contrast, seems not to be important for recognition or binding, but it does dramatically influence the rate of cleavage. It appears that the secondary structure around the cleavage site, rather than specific amino acids, is important for the proteolytic reaction. Preparation of the Enzyme The partially purified COOH-terminal processing protease was prepared from spinach thylakoids by the following procedure. Thylakoid membranes for extraction of the enzyme were prepared from spinach leaves as described elsewhere (29Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 218-222Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The crude enzyme was prepared by sonicating the thylakoid membranes (1 mg chlorophyll ml⁻1) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 at 25°C) buffer that contained 10 mM NaCl and 20 mM MgCl2 with a sonicator (Sonifier 250; Branson, Danbury, CT) at 40 W at a frequency of 20 kHz for 60 s at 0°C, with subsequent centrifugation at 188,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was diluted with two volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4 at 4°C) buffer and then applied to a hydroxylapatite column that had been pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-400 mM sodium phosphate. The active fraction from the hydroxylapatite column was concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM-10 membrane (exclusion limit, Mr = 10,000; Amicon, Beverly, MA), loaded onto a gel filtration column of Sephadex G-75 (SF), which had been pre-equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7 at 25°C) buffer that contained 100 mM NaCl and was then eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 4 ml per h. The resultant partially purified enzyme contained no other protease that cleaved pD1, as demonstrated by the absence of nonspecific cleavage products even after prolonged incubation (see, for example, Fig. 4). Substrate The substituted oligopeptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence of pD1, deduced from psbA gene of spinach (17Zurawski G. Bohnert H.J. Whitfeld P.R. Bottomley W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6260-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), were synthesized by a peptide synthesizer (model 431A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the protecting groups were removed by methods described by the manufacturer. After elimination of impurities by reverse-phase, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amino acid sequence of each purified oligopeptide was confirmed with a protein sequencer (model 477A, Applied Biosystems). pSPTB28, a pSP64 plasmid containing the psbA gene from tobacco was provided by Dr. Sugiura (Nagoya University). The pD1 protein was synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free translation system (NEK-129 Z10; DuPont NEN) in the presence of [35S]methionine from mRNA generated by transcription in vitro of EcoRI-linearized SPTB28 in an SP6 system (Amersham International, Amersham, United Kingdom), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (29Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 218-222Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe A. Price C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6304-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Assay of Proteolytic Activity The standard assay mixture (46 μl) contained the indicated amount of substrate, partially purified enzyme and 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7 at 4°C) buffer. In the standard procedure, the reaction mixture was incubated for a specified time at 25°C and then the reaction was terminated by addition of 9 μl of 18% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at ambient temperature (25°C). The supernatant (50 μl) was diluted with 130 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 4 μl of 0.1 mM salicylic acid and passed through a Millipore filter (pore size, 0.45 μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA). An aliquot of the filtrate (170 μl) was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described in (27Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained 2 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated pD1 and 20 μl of a solution of partially purified enzyme in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7 at 25°C) buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for 2 h, and then the reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of sample buffer for electrophoresis: 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 at 25°C) buffer containing 4.6% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on gels that contained 6 M urea as described elsewhere (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and then radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Analysis by HPLC The system consisted of an “intelligent” pump (type L-6210; Hitachi, Tokyo), an integrator (type D-2500; Hitachi), an optical detector (type L-4000UV; Hitachi) and a column oven (type L-5030; Hitachi). A reverse-phase, prepacked stainless-steel column (4.6 × 250 mm, Shin-pack CLC-C8M; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a guard column (Shin-pack G-C8 (4Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. Vol. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 289-318Google Scholar)) was used at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min⁻1 at 43°C. Two solutions were used for the elution: solution A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; and solution B, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile. Elution was conducted with the following program: 1) 0-0.5 min, solution A; 2) 0.5-20 min, increasing linear gradient from solution A to 20% (v/v) solution B; 3) 20-40 min, increasing linear gradient from the second step to 60% (v/v) solution B; 4) 40-46 min, decreasing linear gradient from the third step to solution A. Elution was monitored at 220 nm. The integrated area corresponding to the COOH-terminal 9 amino acids (9-mer) of pD1 analyzed by this system was estimated from data obtained with known quantities of a standard 9-mer peptide, which was synthesized by Kurabou Co. Ltd. (Neyagawa, Japan). As described in the previous study (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the deduced COOH-terminal sequence of pD1 of spinach (Fig. 1), which can be used as the substrate for the isolated COOH-terminal processing protease, also have an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic reaction with in vitro transcribed and translated full-length pD1 as substrate. The inhibition of COOH-terminal cleavage by the addition of the COOH-terminal oligopeptides can also be demonstrated for the cleavage reaction when COOH-terminal oligopeptides are used as substrate, as shown in Fig. 2. For example, the enzymatic COOH-terminal cleavage of a 24-mer (COOH-terminal 24 amino acids sequence of pD1; S-24) is inhibited by the addition of a 27-mer with substitution of Asp-342 by Asn (S-27N). The result suggests that S-27N still has affinity for the COOH-terminal processing protease, although its efficiency as a substrate is only about one-fifth of that of non-substituted 27-mer (S-27) (data not shown; see Ref. 28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Lineweaver-Burk plots of reaction rates versus concentrations of substrate. The substrate (S-24, COOH-terminal 24-mer) was incubated with partially purified enzyme for 5 h at 25°C, in the presence of 0 ( closedcircles), 417 ( opencircles), and 626 or 645 ( closedtriangles) μM synthetic oligopeptide as indicated: a, S-27N, COOH-terminal oligopeptide (27-mer) corresponding to the D1 precursor of spinach, with replacement of Asp-342 by Asn; b, M-15, COOH-terminal oligopeptide (15-mer) corresponding to the mature D1 protein of spinach. The rate of the enzymatic reaction ( V) is shown in relative units (nmol of 9-mer produced/h) based on quantification of the cleaved product by HPLC and known quantities of synthetic standard peptide (9-mer).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to understand the mechanism of inhibition by the substituted COOH-terminal oligopeptide (S-27N), the enzymatic reaction with S-24 as substrate was kinetically analyzed in Fig. 2 a. The concentration of S-27N in the reaction mixture was varied from 0 to 626 mM. Using the initial rate of COOH-terminal cleavage at 25°C, as determined by HPLC, we plotted the concentration of substrate versus the reaction rate as described by Lineweaver and Burk. The plot clearly indicated that inhibition by S-27N was competitive. Thus, S-27N bound to the enzyme at the same site as the substrate (S-24), although the cleavage reaction was not efficient, perhaps because of the absence of a negative charge at the 342th position, as discussed elsewhere (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reflecting this result, similar inhibition of the COOH-terminal cleavage of in vitro transcribed and translated radiolabeled pD1 was observed upon the addition of S-24 or S-27N to the reaction mixture, as shown in Fig. 3. In order to analyze the structural requirement(s) for the substrate in its interaction with the COOH-terminal processing enzyme, we examined the affinity for the enzyme of the COOH-terminal extension of 9 amino acids by itself (P-9), and that of the COOH-terminal fragment of the mature protein by analyzing their inhibitory effects on the enzymatic reaction with either pD1 or the COOH-terminal oligopeptide as substrate. As shown in previous studies (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and also in Fig. 3, the COOH-terminal extension of 9 amino acids (P-9) has, by itself, no effect on the COOH-terminal cleavage of pD1 by the isolated protease. The oligopeptide corresponding to the sequence of 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of the mature protein (N-15) was also ineffective as an inhibitor in the reaction with S-24 as substrate, over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 2 b). From this analysis, we concluded that both the COOH-terminal extension, which is cleaved off by the processing protease, and the well-conserved COOH-terminal sequence of the mature D1 protein have practically no affinity for the enzyme and, thus, it is the structure formed by the linkage between these two parts of the protein that appears to be important in the substrate-enzyme interaction. This conclusion is, in fact, rather general: the substrate usually has high affinity for the enzyme while the reaction product(s) usually has low affinity. Since results obtained in the preceding section indicated that the structure around the cleavage site of the substrate is important for recognition and binding, oligopeptides corresponding to the 19 COOH-terminal amino acids of the precursor to the D1 protein with specific amino acid substitution(s) around the cleavage site were synthesized and subjected to enzymatic analysis. In one oligopeptide, Leu-343, which is completely conserved in all the deduced sequences of D1 proteins reported to date, was replaced by Ala (L343A); in the second oligopeptide, Ile-346, which is not always conserved but is present in many cases in the sequence of pD1, was replaced by Ala (I346A); and in the third, both Leu-343 and Ile-346 were replaced by Ala so as to yield a sequence of 4 successive Ala residues between positions 343 and 346th (L343A and I346A). When each substrate was incubated with the partially purified enzyme, no cleavage product was formed with L343A and with L343A and I346A within a 24-h incubation (Fig. 4). By contrast, when I346A was used as substrate, the enzyme cleaved the polypeptide at the normal site, namely on the C-side of Ala-344, as shown by amino acid sequence analysis of the product that was detected by HPLC (data not shown). Kinetic analysis of the cleavage reaction with I346A yielded a Kmof about 300 μM, similar to the value for the control substrate (S-24), whereas Vmax was a little lower than that for S-24, suggesting that this substituted oligopeptide has affinity for the enzyme similar to that of the control substrate but that there is a decrease in the efficiency of turnover for unknown reasons. These results clearly indicate that the processing enzyme specifically recognizes the C-side of Ala-344 and, more importantly, that Leu-343 is an essential residue for the binding, possibly generating the intrinsic structure necessary for recognition and/or cleavage of the substrate by the processing enzyme. In the experiment for which results are shown in Fig. 5, the inhibitory effects of two of the substituted COOH-terminal oligopeptides described above were analyzed in the cleavage reaction with S-24 as substrate. The relationship between the reaction rate and the concentration is shown by double-reciprocal plots of the data. As is clearly shown in the figure, I346A was a typical competitive inhibition. By contrast, the inhibition caused by L343A was weak and of a non-competitive nature. These results confirm the conclusion that Leu at the 343th position plays a crucial role in the recognition of the substrate by the protease and they suggest that the structure of the substrate formed as a result of the presence of this residue is important in the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate. The site of cleavage of its substrate by the pD1-processing protease is on the C-side of Ala-344, as mentioned above (15Takahashi M. Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Takahashi Y. Nakane H. Kojima H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 273-280Google Scholar). Ala at the +1 position in the COOH-terminal extension is relatively highly conserved among species. However, in some cyanobacteria and in C. reinhardtii, this amino acid is replaced by Ser. In order to analyze the significance of this residue, the amino acid at the +1 position was replaced by Val, Gly, Cys, Phe, Ser, or Pro and cleavage reactions with these substrates were analyzed. Fig. 6 a shows the time course of COOH-terminal cleavage by the isolated processing protease of the six oligopeptides with a substitution at the +1 position. The COOH-terminal cleavage was completely prevented when Ala-345 was replaced by Pro (A345P), even after prolonged incubation (24 h), reflecting data obtained by analysis in vivo(12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Cys-substituted substrate (A345C) had a similar initial rate of cleavage (Vo) to the control (S-19; Ala at the +1 position) during incubation for less than 2 h. Unusual behavior was observed, however, after longer incubation, perhaps due to interactions between accumulated reaction products that contained NH2-terminal Cys residues. Substitution by Val (A345V) and by Gly (A345G) decreased the initial rate, whereas substitutions by Ser and Phe (A345S, A345F) gave similar kinetics to the control. In order to analyze the effects of these substitutions on the enzyme kinetics, values of Kmand Vmax were estimated from double-reciprocal plots of the kinetic data (Fig. 6 b), as summarized in Table I. The Vmax value for the oligopeptide with Val at position 345 was about 30% and that with Gly was about 50% of the control value. By contrast, the Kmvalues for all these substituted oligopeptides, except for A345P, were about 300 μM, being nearly the same value as that of the control. Thus, efficiency of cleavage can be summarized, in terms of the amino acid at position 345, as follows: Phe, Ala, Ser, Cys > Gly > Val ≫ Pro. Since the Kmis related to the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex, it can be concluded that the affinity of binding of the substrate to the enzyme was not appreciably affected by these substitutions at the +1 position, although the rate of cleavage was very seriously affected. We also replaced Glu-347 by Gln (E347Q), since a negative charge (Glu or Asp) at this position is relatively highly conserved among species and a substrate with two negative charges in symmetrical positions on either side of the cleavage site could be imagined to be important for recognition. However, this substitution did not influence the rate of cleavage or the Km, as shown in Table I.Table IKinetic data for the C-terminal cleavage of substituted oligopeptides Open table in a new tab Synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the deduced COOH-terminal sequence of pD1 can be used as substrates for the processing protease, as shown in previous studies (27Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The affinity of these oligopeptides for the processing enzyme can also be demonstrated by their inhibitory effects on the cleavage of in vitro transcribed and translated full-length pD1 (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The competitive nature of this inhibition was demonstrated in the present study by using another synthetic oligopeptide as substrate, as shown in Fig. 2. The COOH-terminal 27-mer with replacement of Asp-342 by Asn (S-27N) was a competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic cleavage of the COOH-terminal 24-mer. In the experiment for which results are shown in Fig. 4, amino acid side chain(s) around the cleavage site (C-side of Ala-344) were selectively replaced by Ala to examine the sequence requirement for precise cleavage of pD1. The results of our experiments indicated that the cleavage was absolutely accurate and was restricted to the C-side of Ala at the 344th position. The results also indicated that the presence of a hydrophobic side chain at the 343rd position (Leu-343) is crucial for enzymatic cleavage. A similar requirement has been reported for cysteine-type proteases, such as papain and calpain (32Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gerwin B.I. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3331-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these proteases, although their specificity is generally very wide, the presence of a hydrophobic residue around the cleavage site in the substrate, rather than the amino acids on either side of the cleavage site, is more important for proteolysis (32Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gerwin B.I. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3331-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One typical example is peptidase A from Streptococcus. In its substrates, the amino acid residues at the +1 and −1 positions are reported to be of secondary importance, whereas a bulky uncharged side chain at the −2 position is essential (33Gerwin B.I. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3331-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for substrate recognition by the enzyme seems to resemble that by the COOH-terminal processing protease analyzed in this study. We can speculate that the pD1-processing protease has a binding site near its catalytic domain that interacts hydrophobically with Leu at the −2 position of the substrate. However, the COOH-terminal pD1-processing protease has been shown to be insensitive to all the major classes of protease inhibitors, including those of cysteine-type proteases. Thus, it can be categorized as a new type of protease with a novel catalytic mechanism (21Taylor M.A. Packer J.C.L. Bowyer J.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 229-233Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. Vol. III.

As shown in the previous study (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and in Figs. 2 and 3, and also as generally expected, the affinity of the substrate for the processing protease decreased dramatically when the substrate was cleaved into the two products, namely the COOH-terminal extension and the COOH-terminal moiety of the mature D1 protein. This result suggests that the polypeptide bond at the cleavage site or the structure around the cleavage site formed by the linkage between the two parts of the molecule is important for the recognition, rather than the specific amino acid side chain(s). It was reported in the previous paper (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that a COOH-terminal oligopeptide consisting of 11 amino acids of pD1 was ineffective as a substrate, in spite of the fact that Leu-343 and Asp-342, known to be important for recognition, were present in the molecule. This earlier result also supports our interpretation. In the previous report, it was shown that the oligopeptide composed of the 16 COOH-terminal amino acids of pD1 (S-16) had decreased effectiveness as a substrate when compared with longer oligopeptides, perhaps because of insufficient chain length for the formation of a normal recognition site (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In considering the structure around the cleavage site, it is of interest to note that there is a conserved Pro residue, which is generally considered to break the helical structure of polypeptides, at the 340th position. The function of the pD1-processing protease resembles that of signal peptidases in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems whose functional roles have been examined in relation to the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins (34Fikes J.D. Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Klapper D.G. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3417-3423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Borchert T.V. Nagarajan V. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 276-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the major types of protease inhibitor have practically no effect on signal peptidases. In such peptidases, a small uncharged amino acid is present at the −1 position of the substrate and a Pro residue is usually present from the −4 to the −6 positions. In signal peptidases, it is believed that the presence of Pro in this region of the substrate may be crucial for efficient presentation of the cleavage site to the enzyme (34Fikes J.D. Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Klapper D.G. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3417-3423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Pro-340 plays a similar role in pD1, S-16 may have an insufficient β-turn structure because of its short chain-length, with resultant slow cleavage, as shown in the previous study (28Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on the similarities between the substrates of these two types of protease, we can speculate that the intrinsic structure formed by Leu-343 in the pD1 protein, perhaps in collaboration with Asp-342 and Pro-340 contributes to the signal that is recognized by the processing protease. The kinetic analysis of the reactions with COOH-terminal oligopeptides substituted at the +1 position indicated that rank order of Vmax for the cleavage reaction was: Ala, Phe, Ser, Cys > Gly > Val ≫ Pro. This order disagrees with the predictions of von Heijne's model (36von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar), in which it is proposed that small residues are associated with higher rates in the cleavage of signal peptides. However, the average probability values for the secondary structure around the cleavage site in the COOH-terminal extension for each +1 substituted oligopeptide of 38 amino acids, calculated by the GOR predictive method (37Garnier J. Osguthope D.F. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), indicated that the order of probable values of a β-extended structure is Val > Gly > Cys, Ser, Phe > Ala. This order is roughly consistent with the reverse of the order for the COOH-terminal cleavage of substituted oligopeptides in this study, suggesting that a moderate α-helical structure is necessary for presentation of the cleavage site to the enzyme. Nixon and Diner (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) genetically modified the D1 protein (psbAIII gene) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by site-directed mutagenesis at the +1 position relative to the site of cleavage. They demonstrated that the processing was blocked when Ser at the +1 position was changed to Pro (S345P). The result was interpreted to indicate that the manganese cluster was unable to assemble correctly in this mutant, which is deficient in photosynthesis (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In our study, the Pro-substituted COOH-terminal oligopeptide was not a potent inhibitor of the cleavage reaction (data not shown), suggesting that the Ala-Pro bond is not only resistant to the enzymatic cleavage but also causes an appreciable change in the recognition signal. On the other hand, the S345A, S345R, and S345L mutants of Synechocystis are able to grow photoautotrophically and evolve oxygen at rates comparable to that of the wild-type strain (12Nixon P.J. Trost T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have no corresponding data for these substitutions in vitro. However, the calculated low probability of forming a β-extended structure for the Arg and Leu substitutions is consistent with the interpretation discussed above, namely that a moderate α-helical structure in the substrate is necessary for proper presentation of the cleavage site to the enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicated that the +1 substitution does not influence the Kmvalue, although it greatly influences the Vmax value. Thus, this position is probably not important for binding to the enzyme. We reported previously that, when the COOH-terminal processing activity was assayed using in vitro transcribed and translated pD1 as substrate, the cleavage reaction was completely inhibited by the presence of 50 mM NaCl under our experimental conditions (24Satoh K. Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Regulation of Chloroplast Biogenesis. Plenum Press, New York1992: 375-382Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction with synthetic COOH-terminal oligopeptides as substrates, by contrast, was much less sensitive to the ionic strength of the reaction mixture.( 2F. Taguchi, Y. Yamamoto, and K. Satoh, unpublished observation. )2 This result suggests the possibility that the mechanism of substrate recognition differens to some extent between the two assay systems that use either a small oligopeptide or full-length pD1, respectively. A relatively higher value of Kmof about 300 μM and an apparent low turnover number, as estimated for the catalytic reaction with synthetic oligopeptides as substrates, might be related to the size of the substrate. Thus, in the catalytic reaction with pD1 as substrate, or in vivo, some charged residues situated upstream of the sequence, for example, on the lumenal extrusions between helices I and II or helices III and IV, might also contribute to the binding and stabilization of the enzyme-pD1 complex. These possibilities will be investigated in forthcoming analyses both in vivo and in vitro."

The analysis of the sequence periodicities in a large family of nucleosome core DNAs (Satchwell et al., 1986Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar has shown that nucleosome positioning depends on sequence preferences and not on absolute sequence requirements. In particular, the structural characteristics of the preferred DNA sequences and their preferred distributions have revealed that nucleosome localization is determined by the phased repetition of local anisotropically flexible sequences, as predicted in Trifonov and Sussmann, 1980Trifonov E.N. Sussmann J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3816-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar. This observation solves the problem of how nucleosomes can localize defined positions (Almer and Hörz, 1986Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; Richard-Foy and Hager, 1987Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L.

Cell. 1990; 60: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar on an essentially unlimited number of potential sites in genomic DNAs. Irrespective of the quality of the involved sequences, this statistical analysis has established that one important parameter in nucleosome localization is the repetition of the flexibility signals and their phasing, which was shown to be equal to the helical periodicity. In DNA, this helically phased periodic repetition defines the “rotational information,” as opposed to the continuous “translational” information, determined by the local sequence in its entirety. The localization of the histone octamer on DNA and the energetics of this process depend on the interaction with 14 helically phased DNA sites. Several properties of nucleosomes descend from this fact. In the case, for instance, of two alternative histone octamers/DNA interactions shifted by only one helical turn one relative to the other, 13 out of 14 DNA interaction sites remain the same, only a single lateral interaction site being different. Therefore, unless invoking the presence in the nucleosomes of DNA sequences with special properties or unusual structural features that could act as external boundaries or internal determinants, the rotationally based recognition mechanism has an intrinsic potential consequence; the repetition of signals may in principle favor multiplicity of alternative localizations that could differ by one or a few helical turns. In order to verify this theoretical model and its in vivo effects, we have studied the in vivo distribution of nucleosomes on a RNA polymerase II promoter: the Hansenula polymorpha methanol oxidase (MOX) 1The abbreviation used is: MOXmethanol oxidase gene promoter. methanol oxidase H. polymorpha is a methylotrophic yeast able to grow on methanol as a sole energy and carbon source. Growth on methanol leads to proliferation and enlargement of peroxisomes and synthesis of large amounts of peroxisomal enzymes involved in methanol metabolism (Veenhuis et al., 1983Veenhuis M. van Dÿken J.P. Harder W. Adv. Microbial Physiol. 1983; 24: 1-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. MOX is the most abundant of these enzymes and is encoded by the MOX gene, the transcription of which is completely abolished by catabolite repression (glucose or ethanol) and strongly enhanced when the cells grow in methanol (Roggenkamp et al., 1984Roggenkamp R. Janowicz Z. Stanikowsky B. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Mol. Genetics. 1984; 194: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Under these conditions, MOX makes out up to 30% of the soluble cell protein. The MOX gene has been sequenced (Ledeboer et al., 1985Ledeboer A.M. Edens L. Moat J. Visser C. Bos J.W. Verrips C.T. Janowicz Z.A. Eckart M. Roggenkamp R. Hollenberg C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3063-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, and three cis-regulatory regions that are occupied by DNA-binding proteins have been mapped and analyzed (Gödecke et al., 1994Gödecke S. Eckart M. Janowics Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Gene. 1994; 139: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. In addition, a region involved in glucose repression and derepression was identified to which an Adr1p homologue (FB2) may bind. 2G. Pereira and C. Hollenberg, unpublished observations. Early during derepression, low levels of transcription starting close to UAS1 and upstream to the FB2 binding site have been observed, which do not lead to Mox protein. Moreover, this transcription is abolished when the proper MOX transcription starts at a point downstream to the FB2 binding site. Whether FB2 plays a role in this transcription start point selection is unclear since this putative factor is present at nearly the same concentration in both repressed and derepressed cells. To be able to further understand the mechanism controlling the complex regulation of MOX, we have studied the chromatin structure of its promoter. We describe here the nucleotide-level localizations of four nucleosomes (termed –3, –2, –1, and +1, relative to the ATG) and of other proteins in the H. polymorpha MOX promoter. The low resolution localization of seven additional nucleosomes in the surrounding sequences is also reported. Unexpectedly, we observed that in vivo the –3 to +1 nucleosomes localize on multiple alternative positions characterized by (i) unique rotational phase and (ii) extensive overlapping of the alternative extremities.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were washed with 1 m sorbitol and suspended (1–5 × 107/ml) in 1 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, with nystatin 100 μg/ml. These conditions allow penetration of micrococcal nuclease or DNase-I into the spheroplasts and digestion of chromatin in the absence of lysis (Venditti and Camilloni, 1994Venditti S. Camilloni G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease was added at 20 units/ml, or as otherwise indicated; after 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 5 mm EGTA. Spheroplasts were digested with proteinase K in 0.2% SDS, extracted 3 times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 24:24:1 (v/v/v). Resuspended samples were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels to resolve the nucleosomal DNA ladder. Monomer DNA was eluted, in part treated with phosphatase, labeled at low specific activity with kinase, and run on denaturing Polyacrylamide to remove internally nicked monomeric molecules. Full-length denatured monomelic DNAs were recovered, purified, quantified by spectrophotometry, and used in multiple cycles of primer extension by Taq polymerase with a 5′-labeled oligonucleotide primer (as mapped in Fig. 3), thus locating the borders of the monomer-length micrococcal nuclease digestion products (the in vivo protected nucleosomal DNA), which contain the indicated oligo primers.FIG. 3Localization of nucleosomes in cellular chromatin.

DNase-I—DNase-I was subject to permeabilization as above (see legend to Fig. 4). The oligo used in the DNase-I footprint experiment was 1. Fig. 1 describes the chromatin structure (in glucose, repressed) of the MOX promoter. The micrococcal nuclease analysis was performed from both sides: with probe 1 from downstream upward (panel a) and with probe 2 from upstream downward (panel b). The results, mapped in panel c, show that (i) probe 1 identifies nine protected areas (numbered as –11 to –3, relative to the ATG) the sizes of which correspond to that of a nucleosome. The positions from –3 to –9 are indicated in the map. (ii) Between nucleosomes –3 and –4, a well defined hypersensitive region with a short central interruption is evident, which maps around the region previously identified as UAS1 (Gödecke et al., 1994Gödecke S.

Each panel is composed of (i) a size marker (lane M) (the 147-base pair marker band is indicated in all panels); (ii) a full-length monomer 146 ± 2 base pairs long purified and labeled (lane N); (iii) the result of the primer extension from a centrally located oligo to the micrococcal nuclease-induced cleavage sites, which identify the nucleosomal borders (lane β). For each monosome, both rightward and leftward primer extensions are reported. The borders are identified by their size (values at the right side of each panel). The lengths and positions of the protected DNA segments are easily determined summing up couples of values from the two sides, subtracting 20 (the size of the overlapping oligos) and choosing the values closest to the size of the monomer on which the analysis was performed (146 ± 2). The resulting matches are schematically shown in Fig. 3. In the primer-extension conditions chosen, no significant background due to abortive elongation or pausing was produced (Fig. 2). The map in Fig. 3 shows the localization of the borders and reveals a peculiar behavior of nucleosomal particles in vivo. Three out of four nucleosomes in this promoter occupy several alternative positions giving rise to a family of related alternatives rather than to a single position; only nucleosome –3 has one major and one quite minor position. The regions located between two adjacent nucleosomes can be alternatively engaged in the interaction with the upstream- or with the downstream-located particle. The number of helical turns engaged in these alternative occupancies increases moving from the UAS1 downward toward the coding region. The numerical analysis of the borders (as reported on the side of each lane β in Fig. 2) shows that the position of the downstream border of the downstream nucleosome of the –3 family (–3·2) is engaged with sequences that could be occupied, in an alternative series of nucleosomes, by the upstream extremity of the upstream nucleosome of the –2 family. The potentially common positions span 1 helical turn for the region common to the –3/–2 families, 3 helical turns for the –2/–1 families and 3 turns for –1/+1. We shall term these areas “internucleosome overlaps,” keeping in mind that the overlap is only potential, not actual, and refers to alternative occupancies. DNase-I—The existance of overlapping positions on the same rotational phases was confirmed by the DNase-I digestion profiles of the chromatin of nystatin-treated spheroplasts. The resulting pattern shows two types of variations relative to purified DNA (FIG. 4, FIG. 5). (i) The first are regions of markedly increased sensitivity corresponding to inter-nucleosome overlaps, spaced with areas of decreased sensitivity that correspond to nucleosomal central regions. These central regions, common to all the members of a family, span for less than 14 helical periods (see the distribution in Fig. 3) and encompass positions that are always occupied, in agreement with the micrococcal nuclease results. (ii) The second is a continuous series of helical-period-wise alternations of increased-decreased sensitivity to DNase-I spanning the whole analyzed region, including both the nucleosomal central regions and the internucleosomal overlaps. The very fact that periodicity of the DNase-I cleavage pattern is observed throughout indicates that the whole region is organized in nucleosomes, without rigidly defined linker regions. Fig. 4 shows the DNase-I pattern of in vivo chromatin (panel a, lanes 1–3) and of purified DNA (lanes 4–6). The helical-period-wise sensitivities are indicated by numbered dots on the gel image. The helical periodicity of the DNase-I cleavages is evident throughout, as clearly seen also on the scanning pattern (panel c). Fig. 5 shows the same type of analysis, extended to the most upstream nucleosome analyzed (-3), yielding the same results. If the linkers were completely devoid of nucleosomes, their cleavage pattern would in principle be similar to that of naked DNA. A close inspection of the internucleosomal overlap areas (i.e. in Fig. 4 the –1/–2 overlap) shows that the nucleosomal DNA is organized in helically phased DNase-I hypersensitive sites and that a few intermediate sensitive sites exist that are sensitive also on naked DNA (i.e. between –160 and –150 and between –110 and –102). This residual sensitivity could be due to incomplete occupancy (that is, in population terms, each linker site is unoccupied in a fraction of the molecules) or to local topological strain on the fraction of free DNA tracts. The footprint revealed by the DNase-I cleavage pattern between –203 and –160 is caused by an ADR1-like protein complex.2 The interaction takes place on DNA engaged on a nucleosome; the sequences involved are in the central region of the nucleosomal family –2 (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3). We have described the organization in families of nucleosomes in the H. polymorpha MOX promoter. The entire region is organized into nucleosomes. Sequences appearing in linker regions are not always nucleosome-free, but they can also be engaged in a nucleosome. Each DNA molecule contains one of several sets of possible nucleosomal patterns related to the helical periodicity of DNA. These results bear to the general problem of nucleosome localization and dynamics. In nucleosomes, DNA is wrapped around the histone octamer 1.8 times in a left-handed solenoid; topology-related aspects of DNA/nucleosome interaction are reviewed in Freeman and Garrard, 1992Freeman L.A.

The fact that both topological properties (of closed DNA systems) and intrinsic curvature (in open DNA systems) affect nucleosomal localization points to the relevance of the rotational information of DNA (as defined in the Introduction) in this process. In agreement, it was observed that in the Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast curved DNA (Costanzo et al., 1990Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Salina G. Negri R. J. Mol.

Limiting Multiple Positions—The fact that the structural code for rotational positioning is redundant (Travers, 1993Travers A.A. DNA-Protein Interactions.1st Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 1-27Crossref Google Scholar) implies that multiple positioning is intrinsically possible, underscoring a substantial freedom of choice by histone octamers when nucleating on a defined DNA area and in selecting one of several permitted positions. Therefore, obtaining unique nucleosome positioning requires additional elements. These have been reviewed extensively (Thoma, 1992Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and include defined DNA sequences acting as boundaries, dynamic processes, and asymmetries in the recognition sequences (as specifically discussed in terms of translational information in Travers and Klug, 1987Travers A.A. Klug A. Phil. Trans. R Soc. London. 1987; 317: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Satchwell and Travers, 1989Satchwell S.C. Travers A.A.

The nature and the role of translational information of DNA in causing unique nucleosomal positioning are difficult to define. It was proposed (Negri et al., 1994Negri R. Costanzo G. Buttinelli M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar that the translational message consists mostly in the equilibrium among the rotational signals present on each side of the center of symmetry of the histone octamer, the frequency of formation of a nucleosome on a defined DNA tract being determined by the sum of flexibility potentialities relative to a dyad central position. In other words, the elusive (Thoma, 1992Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) nature of the translational messages is explained by the fact that these could be a quantitative aspect of the rotational information. Evidence has been provided for a boundary role of systemspecific proteins (Fedor et al., 1988Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; Simpson, 1991Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar. In particular, clear examples of proteins acting in the localization process have been obtained in yeast, where it was observed that α2 repressor positions nucleosomes in TPR1/ARS1 chromatin (Roth et al., 1990Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In this same system, it was also shown that ABF1 contributes in reducing the number of possible alternative positions for the nucleosome located upstream of the α-domain, from the several positions observed in vitro to the largely dominant positions occupied in vivo on the chromosome (Venditti et al., 1994Venditti P. Costanzo G. Negri R. Camilloni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. The MOX Promoter—On this sequence, nucleosomes distribute themselves in families with limited multiplicity; their localization is not completely continuous (as observed in the C. fasciculata kinetoplast or in the S. cerevisiae 5 S gene systems mentioned above) and is not made of a series of unique positions. The average number of the components of each family is four to five, with the exception of nucleosome –3, whose family is composed by a major species (-3·2) and a quite minor one (-3·1). The unicity of this occupancy is predicted by the boundary model (Thoma, 1992Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this case the putative boundary is the UAS1 with its binding protein(s) (Gödecke et al., 1994Gödecke S. Eckart M. Janowics Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Gene. 1994; 139: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Thus, in the H. polymorpha MOX promoter, each “linker region” appears to be engaged in nucleosomal complexes. The different organization of this area relative to the central part of the nucleosomal body consists in the frequency of its occupancy. The DNA tract that corresponds to the central part of a nucleosome is always occupied, whereas the internucleosomal tracts interact in a more complex way: a few DNA helical periods may interact with the terminal or paraterminal part of the upstream histone octamer or with the terminal or paraterminal extremity of the downstream one. Protection/exposure of DNA in these tracts is more variable. The increased sensitivity to DNase-I of the borders of DNA-protein complexes (FIG. 4, FIG. 5) is a well known phenomenon. It is noteworthy that the binding of the Adr1-like protein factor on nucleosome –2, as revealed by the DNase-I footprint (FIG. 4, FIG. 5), is not prevented by the multiple localizations of this particle. This indicates that the organization of nucleosomes in families allows the correct exposure of the relevant DNA sequences as long as they show a unique rotational setting. In conclusion, the analysis of the multiple nucleosome positions in the MOX promoter and of their distribution show that the rotational information appears to be the major determinant of nucleosome positioning. Interference with the rotational information, as described in Negri et al., 1994Negri R. Costanzo G. Buttinelli M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, does actually alter nucleosome distributions in vivo and should provide an experimental basis to study nucleosome dynamics (a process that was shown to be an essential component of the topology of transcription in eukaryotes) (Wolffe et al., 1986Wolffe A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2041437728,"The expression of a 3-kilobase genomic rat whey acidic protein (WAP) clone (-949/+2020) in transgenic mice has been demonstrated previously to be copy number-dependent and independent of the site of integration (Dale, T., Krnacik, M. J., Schmidhauser, C., Yang, C. Q.-L., Bissell, M. J., and Rosen, J. M. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 905-914). The present study demonstrated that position-independent expression of the rat WAP -949/+2020 transgene was dependent on transgene spacing. Position-independent expression also was inhibited by an internal replacement of 49 base pair within the conserved GC-rich 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) with an identically sized nonspecific DNA sequence. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear factors isolated from mouse and human cells were shown to associate specifically with the rWAP 3'-UTR DNA, but not with the 3'-UTR containing the internal replacement or specific point mutations. Since a single copy of the 3'-UTR inserted 5' of the promoter could not rescue the 3'-UTR deletion, the 3'-UTR element does not appear to be functioning as either a classic enhancer or insulator element. However, the level of expression of rWAP transgenes was correlated with transgene association with the chromosomal scaffold in vivo."

It was previously found that low pH treatment could make the DHBV cores open to macromolecules without destroying DNA polymerase activity, which could not switch to any of several exogenously supplied templates (20Radziwill G.

These properties might result from an exceptionally tight association of the enzyme with its endogenous DNA. Until now, activity gel assay containing in situ denaturation/renaturation step has provided the only means by which hepadnavirus DNA polymerase proteins could be detected in association with enzymatic activities (21Bavand M. Laub O. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 626-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bavand M. Feitelson M. Laub O. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Oberhaus S.M. Newbold J.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6558-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a prerequisite for studying HBV DNA polymerase is the availability of a procedure to obtain the soluble protein without loss of its activity, no attempt to solubilize the enzyme had succeeded. Our endeavor to solubilize the enzyme activity from viral particles had previously failed when a liquid-phase denaturation/renaturation process was tested with guanidine hydrochloride or SDS (not shown). We have, however, recently discovered a process involving low pH treatment followed by incubation with a certain protease, which reproducibly achieved the desired effects. These results indicate that this enzyme can be truncated and thus function independently of other viral components. This is the report of the detection and solubilization of the DNA polymerase from natural HBV particles and makes possible new approaches to the study for hepadnaviral replication and its inhibition in vitro. Materials—HBV-infected sera taken from HBV-antigen carriers, in which human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus antigens were absent, were obtained from the Korean National Red Cross Blood Products Institute. HBV particles were purified from approximately 300 ml of each serum. Antiserum against virus particles, used in immunologic assay, was prepared by injecting the purified HBV particles into albino rabbits. Antiserum, used in Western blot analysis, against a fusion protein containing maltose-binding protein and RNase H domain of the HBV DNA polymerase gene product from Escherichia coli was a kind gift from Jung (24Lee H.J. Kwon Y.T. Rho H.M. Jung G. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 821-826Google Scholar). All radioactive [α-32P]dNTPs were purchased from Amersham Inc. Homopolymers as template-primers were obtained from P-L Biochemicals Inc. and DEAE-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of HBV Particles—All steps of the purification scheme were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The fresh HBV-infected sera were centrifuged in HANIL A50H-6 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to remove aggregated materials. To remove most of serum proteins, virions in the supernatants were pelleted with 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. Following immediate centrifugation in a HANIL A50H-6 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, the pellets were washed twice with TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). To disrupt surface proteins, the pellets were suspended in the initial serum volumes of TNE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. To concentrate cores, 27 ml of suspension solution containing virions was layered onto 6 ml of 20% sucrose in TNE buffer which had been layered on 5 ml of 60% sucrose in TNE buffer. Centrifugation in a SW 28 rotor (Beckman Co.) was performed for 16 h at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected and the HBV-positive fractions, identified by endogenous DNA polymerase assay, were pooled and dialyzed against TNE buffer. Pooled samples were layered onto a 15–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a SW 60 rotor for 6 h at 35,000 rpm. The 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed as described below. Fractions from the final sucrose gradient were also analyzed for the presence of core protein and other proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining as described previously (23Oberhaus S.M. Newbold J.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6558-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Core particles prepared in this manner (approximately 1011 virions/ml) were concentrated about 100-fold from sera of chronic HBV-antigen carriers and were stored at 4 °C. Endogenous DNA Polymerase Assay—The reaction (50 µl) was carried out in polymerase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 30 mm NH4C1, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 µm each of dGTP, dCTP, and dATP. Five μl of the particle sample and 1 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were added subsequently and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K in the presence of 1% SDS followed by extraction with saturated phenol twice. Radioactivities of the reaction products were measured on DEAE-cellulose (DE-81) paper disks (Whatman Co.) as described previously (25Grandgenett D.P. Rho H.M. J. Virol. 1975; 15: 526-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels after Sephadex G-50 chromatography. In Situ Activity Gel Assay and Reverse Transcriptase Assay in Liquid Phase—In situ activity gel assay was performed as described previously (22Bavand M. Feitelson M. Laub O. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a minor modification. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of 0.02% SDS with either 120 μg/ml of activated salmon sperm DNA for the detection of DNA-directed DNA synthesis or 130 μg/ml poly(rC)·oligo(dG)12–18 at a molar ratio of 1:10 for the detection of RNA-directed DNA synthesis. Viral preparations, purified to near homogeneity, were mixed with equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 1.34% SDS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.66 mm EDTA, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 2 mm PMSF), and boiled for 2 min before loading. Electrophoresis was carried out for 12~20 h at 15~20 mA at 4 °C. To recover enzymatic activity of the proteins, in situ renaturation was achieved by removing the SDS from the gel after extensive washes with ice-cold renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)). Gels were placed in a sealed bag with a reaction mixture containing 70 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μμ aphidicolin, and 1 μCi/ml of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol) for RT activity gels; or 10 μμ each of dGTP, dCTP, dTTP, and 1 μCi/ml of [α-32P]dATP for DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity gels. The bags were submerged and incubated in water bath with gentle shaking for 20 h at 37 °C. To stop the reaction and remove unincorporated dNTPs, gels were washed extensively with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% pyrophosphate. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Liquid-phase reverse transcriptase assay, using homopolymers as templates, was carried out as described previously (26Rho H.M. Gallo R.C. Cancer Lett. 1980; 10: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Solubilization of HBV DNA Polymerase from Viral Particles—Permeabilization of viral particles was performed as described previously (20Radziwill G. Zentgraf H. Schaller H. Bosch V. Virology. 1988; 163: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with a minor modification. An equal volume of 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5) was added to the HBV particle preparations which resulted in a pH approximately 3.0 in the solution, incubated at 30 °C for 30 s, and neutralized by addition of an appropriate volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). At once, permeability of viral particles was tested as described in legend of Fig. 2A (compare lanes 4 and 5). Further solubilization of HBV DNA polymerase from cores was performed by subtilisin-limited proteolysis. Low pH-treated sample (permeable particle) was incubated at 37 °C for 20–60 min in TNE buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (omitted as activity gel assay), 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.7 μg/ml subtilisin. The reaction was stopped by adding PMSF to a final concentration of 1 mm. All the reaction mixtures were assayed for reverse transcriptase and endogenous DNA polymerase reactions. DEAE-Sepharose Chromatography—The HBV particles treated as above were diluted and loaded on a 0.5 × 2-cm column of DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with starting buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm NaCl). The column was then washed with 10 ml of starting buffer, and the enzyme activity was eluted by raising the sodium chloride concentrations up to 500 mm in the buffer. Fractions (150 μl each) were collected, and 10-μl aliquots of each were assayed for the ability to incorporate [α-32P]dNTP into several substrates with incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. Identification of DNA Polymerase Activity in HBV Particles—In HBV particles, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the presence of HBV DNA polymerase activity was identified by using the endogenous DNA polymerase reaction, in situ activity gel analysis and Western blotting (Fig. 1). No contaminated DNA polymerase activity was detected in fractions prepared as above, and only in the HBV-positive fractions, two bands were detected in the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity gel assay: a very strong band at ~100 kDa and a very faint band at ~70 kDa (the molecular mass of these bands was calculated by extrapolating Klenow fragment and commercial SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein markers) (lane 2). This very faint band at ~70 kDa was not visible without long exposure (data not shown). Also, the two bands detected by RT activity gel assay appear to have the same apparent molecular masses as the two DNA-dependent DNA polymerase active bands (lane 5). These suggest that these two proteins exhibit both DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, and the majority of DNA polymerase in natural the HBV particle was the ~100 kDa. In addition, none of the HBV particle samples showed DNA polymerase activity without substrate (not shown), and endogenous DNA polymerase reaction product was shown at the top of the separating gel (lane 8). Therefore, viral nucleic acids were unlikely to be used as substrates in the activity gel assay. Effect of Low pH Treatment and Subtilisin Preincubation on HBV DNA Polymerase Activity and Detection of the Solubilized Enzyme—After low pH treatment, in contrast to Nonidet P-40 treatment, the endogenous DNA polymerase activity disappeared in the presence of exogenous DNase I or subtilisin (Fig. 2A), suggesting that viral capsids were open or disrupt and thus allowed DNase I and subtilisin to attack viral DNA and polymerase protein. Also, in situ activity gel analysis showed that ~100-kDa major active band gradually migrated into ~70 kDa by increasing the preincubation time with subtilisin (Fig. 2B). The alteration in the relative activities of ~100 and ~70 kDa suggests that smaller protein is the cleavage product of the ~100-kDa protein and perhaps has polymerase domain and RNase H domain (lane W). To determine whether the DNA polymerase in HBV particles can switch to an exogenous template, several exogenous substrates were tested for their ability to serve as template. Poly(rA)·oligo(dT) and poly(rC)·oligo(dG) were employed as reverse transcriptase substrates and poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase substrate (Fig. 3A). Due to absence of three dNTPs under the assay conditions employed, HBV-DNA polymerase was inactive on endogenous DNA template, and no incorporation of isotope into exogenous template occurred in reaction mixture with unmodified HBV particles (data not shown). However, after low pH treatment, as viral particles were preincubated with an appropriate amount of subtilisin, radioactive incorporation into exogenous templates was observed. These indicated that the HBV-DNA polymerase was dissociated from viral particles as a result of subtilisin incubation, and the released form had RT and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities. Alternatively, a defined template for DNA polymerase activity (12.5-kb αvaI-digested plasmid), and four dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP) were added to the reaction mixture and then the radioactive reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a agarose gel. The HBV-DNA polymerase was active on endogenous DNA template yielding 3.2 kb of radioactive HBV DNA (lower DNA bands on the gel), and incorporation of radioactivity into 12.5 kb exogenous DNA with 5′ protruding ends appeared after 20-min preincubation with subtilisin (upper DNA bands on the gel). Without low pH treatment or subtilisin preincubation, no incorporation of radioactivity into exogenous template was observed, regardless of exposure time (lanes C). These results indicate that HBV-DNA polymerase is probably released from the viral particles, since the 12.5-kb exogenous DNA template is too large to enter the viral particle. DEAE-Sepharose Chromatography of Released HBV-DNA Polymerase from Viral Particles—To confirm that HBV DNA polymerase is released from virus particle, the subtilisin-treated particle solution was carefully diluted and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Fig. 4A). Both DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities appeared together at 100 mm NaCl and preference of the released enzyme for several templates were similar to that of other retroviral reverse transcriptases (3Will H. Salfeld J. Pfaff E. Manso C. Theilmann L. Schaller H. Science. 1986; 231: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Rho H.M. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1979; 99: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, RT activity detected in these fractions was inactivated by antiserum against virus particles in immunologic assay (Fig. 4C). When unmodified HBV particle sample solution was also applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column, endogenous DNA polymerase activity was recovered in buffer wash fractions, and DNA polymerase activity on exogenous template was not detected in any fraction (data not shown). In activity gel analysis of the fractions, as shown in Fig. 4B, only ~70 kDa of DNA polymerase activity was observed, and ~100 kDa was not detected in any fraction. These results provide that ~70-kDa protein, a proteolytic product, is probably the solubilized DNA polymerase from the HBV particles and is active on the exogenous templates in liquid-phase. Our endeavor to solubilize the enzyme activity from the viral particles had failed when liquid-phase denaturation/renaturation process was tested with guanidine hydrochloride or SDS. We have, however, discovered a process involving low pH treatment followed by incubation with subtilisin. The data presented here provide several important pieces of information about the DNA polymerase in natural HBV particles. A useful method for purifying large quantities of viral cores without aggregation is devised as shown under “Experimental Procedures.” Previously, Kim et al. (28Kim S.H. Hong S.P. Kim S.K. Lee W.S. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2421-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have constructed HepG2-K8 cell producing HBV-like particles in our laboratory. Although the concentration of HBV particles in supernatants from transfected cell cultures is much lower than in sera of virus-infected individuals (29Heermann K.-H. Gerlich W.H. McLachlan A. Molecular Biology of the Hepatitis B Virus. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 109-144Google Scholar, 30Kim S.K. Jang S.K. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the above-mentioned method with minor modification resulting in 2000-fold concentration of virus-like particles has made it possible to detect DNA polymerase. 2H. J. Shin and H. M. Rho, unpublished observations. We have detected major ~ 100-kDa and minor ~70-kDa DNA polymerase activities in activity gel analysis and provided evidence that the ~70-kDa protein is the proteolytic cleavage product of the ~100-kDa DNA polymerase. Although the HBV DNA polymerase gene, if expressed as a single, full-length, unmodified protein, would have a predicted mass of 94 kDa (31Chang L. Pryciak P. Ganem D. Varmus H. Nature. 1989; 337: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Ou J.-H. Bao H. Shih C. Tahara S.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4578-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rho H.M. Kim K. Hyun S.W. Kim Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 172124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Schlicht H.-J. Radziwill G. Schaller H. Cell. 1989; 56: 85-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), there have been several reports in which less than full-length P gene product has been detected (22Bavand M. Feitelson M. Laub O. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Oberhaus S.M. Newbold J.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6558-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mack D.H. Bloch W. Nath N. Sninsky J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the ratio of the two bands changed at every preparation procedure and that ~70-kDa active band is often negligible. It indicates that these smaller proteins probably are by-products of particle preparation due to instability of putative P gene product or a certain contaminated protease. This study also shows that preincubating the low pH-treated HBV particles with subtilisin solubilize the DNA polymerase activity which can then switch to exogenous templates in liquid phase (Fig. 3). Radziwill et al. (20Radziwill G. Zentgraf H. Schaller H. Bosch V. Virology. 1988; 163: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that core particles are impermeant to exogenous template/primer, and even when they are treated to be permeable to such templates the DNA polymerase will not engage them. We have found that subtilisin-treated HBV particles were active not only on homopolymer templates but also on a large template which cannot enter the low pH-treated particles. The released form appears to be the 70-kDa band on activity gel, and the subtilisin-treated enzyme activity could be eluted by DEAE-Sepharose column. The eluted fractions still retained its polymerase activity, suggesting the possibility of partial purification of this enzyme. In addition, preference of the truncated enzyme for homopolymer templates is similar to that of other retroviral RT. This is supported by homologies between the amino acid sequence of the protein coded by the DNA polymerase gene and RTs of all retroviruses sequenced to date (19Toh H. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Nature. 1983; 305: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 33Rho H.M. Kim K. Hyun S.W. Kim Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 172124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study we introduce an effective method to release the DNA polymerase activity from the HBV particles. Although the nature of the tight association of the enzyme with the core particles is not clearly understood yet, low pH treatment followed by this proteolytic cleavage appears to be more powerful in permeabilizing core particles without destroying the enzymatic activity than low pH treatment alone. Despite the difficulties in studying the hepadnavirus P proteins, we have shown that it is possible to detect and to characterize viral enzyme activities as a soluble form.

https://openalex.org/W1965025631,"Studies with inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from multidrug-resistant (MDR 3) murine erythroleukemia (MEL/VCR-6) cells have provided evidence for down-modulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function by Ca2+-calmodulin (CLM). These studies showed that CLM in the presence or absence of Ca2+ had no effect on binding of [3H]vinblastine (VBL) by P-gp in inside-out plasma membrane vesicles. However, profound inhibition of ATP-dependent [3H]VBL efflux by these vesicles was demonstrated by the addition of subnanomolar concentrations of CLM (IC50 = 0.15 ± 0.02 nm). The addition of 1 mm Ca2+ reduced the inhibition of [3H]VBL efflux by CLM, shifting the concentration required for inhibition to the nM range (IC50 = 2.55 ± 0.35 nm). The inhibition of [3H]VBL efflux by 0.6 nM CLM was reduced with as little as 0.01 mm Ca2+, and no inhibition occurred with concentrations greater than 0.2 mm Ca2+. Binding of CLM, itself, to P-gp was demonstrated in two ways. The P-gp content of detergent-solubilized plasma membrane from MEL/VCR-6 cells could be appreciably depleted by treating this material with CLM-Sepharose beads as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting with anti-P-gp antibody (C219) before and after CLM-Sepharose treatment. Also, depletion of P-gp from solution by CLM was less in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. Blotting of P-gp after SDS-PAGE of plasma membrane from MEL/VCR-6 cells was also obtained using 125I-CLM as a probe. These results strongly suggest that the MDR 3 homolog of P-gp is a CLM-binding protein and that direct interaction of Ca2+-CLM with P-gp, while not affecting its binding of [3H]VBL, down-modulates the translocation of this agent in the presence of ATP.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following stable transfection with murine mdr 3 cDNA. These studies have documented temperature-dependent, osmotically sensitive intravesicular internalization of one or more multidrug resistance-related cytotoxic agents that was dependent upon the hydrolysis of ATP. Our own studies with inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from multidrug-resistant, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells overexpressing MDR 3 documented (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) additional properties and the kinetics of the interaction of vinblastine with P-gp and provided direct evidence for active P-gp-mediated transport. To further our understanding of P-gp function, we have examined the interaction between P-gp and various cytosolic regulatory proteins using our inside-out vesicle system (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One such interaction involves the Ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin (CLM), which among its many actions (19Cheung W.Y. Science. 1979; 207: 19-27Crossref Scopus (1849) Google Scholar, 20Klee C.B.

Our results appear to show that this protein markedly down-modulates P-gp function, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. We also present other evidence to suggest that these effects probably reflect a direct interaction of CLM with P-gp itself. Sources of Cells and Growth and Isolation Procedures—Multidrug-resistant murine MEL/VCR-6 cells were derived (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in cell culture during growth in the presence of VCR. This cell line had defective inward transport of [3H]VBL and overexpressed MDR 3 P-gp to the extent of 80-fold. For preparation of inside-out plasma membrane vesicles, parental and MEL/VCR-6 cells were obtained as ascites suspensions (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from BD2F1 mice following growth during VCR treatment (MEL/VCR-6 cells only). Plasma Membrane Vesicle Preparation—Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from MEL/VCR-6 cells by a previously described (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) procedure. Approximately 1 mg of vesicles was obtained from 2–2.5 × 109 cells. The inside-out orientation of the vesicles with respect to sidedness was 72% as determined by ecto-enzyme and endoenzyme assays (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14746-14752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of 0.2% Triton X-100. The purity of the vesicle preparations was determined to be 88–95% from an assessment (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14746-14752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of various organelle-specific enzyme markers and a protein determination (25Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Intravesicular volume of the vesicles was 2.7 ± 4 μl/mg of protein as determined by standard procedures (26Hissen P.J. Hilf R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 508: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transport Measurements—The procedure employed for measuring ATP-dependent internalization of [3H]VBL by inside-out plasma membrane vesicles with appropriate controls was the same as that used in our prior (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies. Twenty-μl aliquots of vesicles (50–70 µg of membrane protein) were incubated with or without [3H]VBL and 5 mm ATP at 37 °C with 30 μl of transport buffer (100 mm MOPS, 100 mm sucrose plus 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7) with or without a regenerating (13Horio M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3580-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) system in siliconized glass tubes. After termination, processing was as described (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blotting Procedures—Plasma membrane proteins were electrophoresed (27Laemmli V.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad Trans Blot Cell (28Towbin B. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 70: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44885) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using C-219 monoclonal antibody (Centocor) as described earlier (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE (see above) and transblotting, the membrane was also probed with 125I-CLM (bovine CLM) as described previously (23Liu M. Chen T-Y. Ahamed B. Li J. Yau K-W. Science. 1994; 266: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for autoradiography. Chemicals—[3H]VBL was obtained (specific activity, 10–15 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Corp. Calmodulin was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and [125I]calmodulin was obtained from NEM Corp. [3H]VBL was repurified (29Kuntebommanahalli N.T. Sehti V.S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5382-5385PubMed Google Scholar) to >98% by high performance liquid chromatography every 3–4 weeks. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Our earlier studies (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) documented a complex time course for ATP-dependent accumulation of [3H]VBL by inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from MEL/VCR-6 cells overexpressing MDR 3 P-gp consisting of both osmotically sensitive and insensitive components. The data were interpreted (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as rapid binding of [3H]VBL to P-gp and its subsequent transport (efflux) in the presence of ATP as distinctly separate events with the latter representing the rate-limiting step. Both binding and transport exhibited the same temperature dependence and saturability. Although the same rate of binding of [3H]VBL to P-gp occurred in the presence or absence of ATP, internalization of this vinca alkaloid in the form of osmotically sensitive accumulation was strictly dependent upon the hydrolysis of ATP. These properties are depicted by the time courses in Fig. 1A showing that the internalization of [3H]VBL by inside-out vesicles from MEL/VCR-6 cells occurred only in the presence of ATP. Rapid, initial binding of [3H]VBL by P-gp in these vesicles is only illustrated (broken line) in the figure for purposes of comparison. Other data in the figure (Fig. 1A) show that there was no rapid, initial accumulation and little internalization of [3H]VBL in inside-out vesicles prepared from parental MEL cells either in the presence or absence of ATP. In the same experimental system, we examined the effect of CLM on [3H]VBL efflux by inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from MEL/VCR-6 cells. These results are given in Fig. 1B and show profound inhibition of ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]VBL by CLM in the subnanomolar concentration range. Also, the data clearly suggest that the effect of CLM is on mediated transport of [3H]VBL rather than on its binding to P-gp, since unlike the effect of VRP and VBL (also shown in Fig. 1B) there is no characteristic (18Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) downward dislocation to the origin of the time course plot for efflux in the presence of CLM. The concentration response for CLM inhibition of ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]VBL in these vesicles is shown in Fig. 2. Inhibition is apparent (Fig. 2A) with as little as 0.1 nm CLM, and complete inhibition is seen at a concentration of CLM above 0.6 nM. The addition of 1 mm Ca2+ in the form of CaCl2 along with CLM reduced rather than enhanced the inhibition by CLM on ATP-dependent [3H]VBL efflux and shifted (Fig. 2B) the concentration-response curve for this inhibition to the nM range. In this case, the IC50 value for inhibition by CLM was shifted from 0.15 ± 0.02 nm (no Ca2+) to 2.55 ± 0.35 nM with 1 mm Ca2+. The concentration response for the effect of Ca2+ on the inhibition of [3H]VBL transport by CLM (0.6 nm) is given in Fig. 3. Reduction of inhibition was seen with as little as 0.01 mm Ca2+ (CaCl2) and approached maximum at concentrations above 0.2 mm Ca2+. In light of the above results, we sought to demonstrate a direct interaction of CLM with P-gp, which could account for the down-modulation of this ATPase. In the first experiment, it was shown that treatment of detergent-solubilized plasma membrane protein from MEL/VCR-6 cells with CLM-Sepharose beads removed P-gp from the solution. The solubilized protein was treated with either Sepharose 4B beads or CLM-Sepharose beads in the presence and absence of 1 mm Ca2+ and centrifuged to remove the beads. The data from a Western blot with C219 antibody show (Fig. 4) that treatment of the solubilized protein with Sepharose 4B had no effect on the appearance of the same 140-kDa protein blot found with the control (untreated) material. However, treatment with CLM-Sepharose in the absence of Ca2+ removed almost all of this protein, while treatment in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (CaCl2) removed somewhat less. These results are consistent with data from other experiments (Fig. 2) described above, which showed considerably less inhibition of [3H]VBL transport in the presence of Ca2+ and suggest that binding of CLM by P-gp in the presence of Ca2+ is markedly reduced. Second, 125I-CLM was used to probe a transblot of varying amounts of plasma membrane protein from MEL/VCR-6 cells following SDS-PAGE. This blot delineated (Fig. 5) a 140-kDa protein as did a blot of the same protein following SDS-PAGE carried out with C219 anti-P-gp antibody as a control. Also, only a faint protein band was delineated in this 140-kDa region with C219 antibody or with 125I-CLM, except with larger amounts of sample, when a transblot of plasma membrane protein from parental MEL cells (data not shown) was carried out after SDS-PAGE.FIG. 3Concentration dependence for the reversal by Ca2+ of CLM inhibition of ATP-dependent P-gp-mediated efflux of [3H]VBL by vesicles from MEL/VCR-6 cells. Vesicles were incubated at 37 °C and pH 7 with 100 nm [3H]VBL in the presence of 5 mm ATP with and without various concentrations of CaCl2. The average of two experiments with variance in the range of ±16% is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIG. 4Western blot analysis of P-gp in aliquots of detergent-solubilized plasma membrane protein from MEL/VCR-6 cells treated with and without CLM-Sepharose. Plasma membrane (5 mg/ml) in Tris-sucrose buffer was solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, diluted 5-fold with Tris-sucrose buffer, and centrifuged at 7,500 × g. Prior to SDS-PAGE, the solubilized membrane protein was treated for 1 h at 0–4 °C by shaking with Sepharose 4B or CLM-Sepharose plus or minus 1 mm CaCl2 and the eluate after centrifugation used for SDS-PAGE. 10 µg of membrane protein, precipitated with 1 volume of methanol, was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and applied to the gel (see text for additional information). Detection of P-gp was by enhanced chemiluminescence. The data shown are a typical result of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIG. 5A blot of P-gp in plasma membrane from MEL/VCR-6 cells with 125I-CLM following SDS-PAGE. Various amounts of plasma membrane protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and a transblot was probed with 125I-CLM (total dpm = 2.8 × 106). Radioautography of the blot utilized a 16-h exposure. A companion transblot of 25 μg of the same plasma membrane protein after SDS-PAGE was probed with C219 antibody. Detection of P-gp was by enhanced chemiluminescence (see text and legend of Fig. 4 for further details). The data shown are for one of several typical blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of all these experiments suggest that Ca2+-CLM binds to P-gp and the function of this plasma membrane protein in the form of [3H]VBL efflux is modulated by Ca2+-CLM. The data also suggest that this modulation is unrelated to any direct effect of bound Ca2+-CLM on the binding of [3H]VBL to P-gp. The data generated here with this inside-out vesicle system identify a property of P-gp hitherto unrevealed. Since the cytosol of tumor cells contains (30Tupper J.T. Zorgniotti F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 75: 12-22Google Scholar, 31Tsuruo T. Iida H. Kawabata H. Tsukagoshi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5095-5099PubMed Google Scholar) appreciable (0.1–1 mm) amounts of Ca2+, the effect of CLM demonstrated during these studies that would seem most relevant to its effect in situ is that measured in the presence of this divalent cation. As little as 0.01 mm Ca2+ added to this vesicle system significantly reduced the inhibition of [3H]VBL efflux by CLM. Overall, these results suggest that transport mediated by P-gp could be perturbed by a variation in the cytosolic concentration of either or both CLM and Ca2+. The increase in CLM or decrease in Ca2+ would down-modulate this function while a decrease in CLM or increase in Ca2+ would up-modulate. Both positive and negative regulatory effects of Ca2+ -CLM have been identified (19Cheung W.Y. Science. 1979; 207: 19-27Crossref Scopus (1849) Google Scholar, 20Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Richman P.G.

The results presented here suggest that Ca2+-CLM acts as a negative regulator of P-gp function in that the rate of transport of [3H]VBL by P-gp in the presence of CLM or Ca2+-CLM never exceeds that of P-gp alone, at least in this vesicle system. Our results take on additional meaning in light of an earlier report (31Tsuruo T. Iida H. Kawabata H. Tsukagoshi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5095-5099PubMed Google Scholar) documenting upward perturbation in Ca2+ levels in P-gp overexpressing MDR cells. Such perturbations in these cells could further enhance P-gp function through the interaction of Ca2+ with CLM as shown here. These results have other implications. For instance, the effect of many Ca2+ antagonists on MDR shown (3Beck W.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 26: 2879-2887Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

On the other hand, the reversal by many Ca2+ antagonists of MDR has not been shown (32Ford J.M. Hait W.N. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 155-199PubMed Google Scholar) to relate directly to their interaction with P-gp. Therefore, the effect of some of these may be accounted for by their interaction with CLM. Further work will be required to clarify these issues and to elucidate specific details of the interaction of Ca2+-CLM with P-gp."

In this report we demonstrate that the repression in vivo correlates with a direct physical interaction of the adenovirus protein with c-Jun in vitro. Interestingly, the 52R protein binds to the bZIP domain of c-Jun essential for dimerization and DNA binding but not to the c-Jun activation domain. This interaction does not prevent the promoter binding of c-Jun/AP-1. Moreover, the physical association between c-Jun and the TATA box-binding protein TBP is not disturbed by the 52R polypeptide. In fact, we show evidence that down-regulation of c-Jun activity by the adenoviral protein is due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of the c-Jun trans-activation domain. In vivo phosphorylation of the c-Jun activation domain is necessary for the interaction of c-Jun with specific cofactors such as CBP and therefore a prerequisite for the activation of target genes.

Moreover, early region 1A proteins are able to act as oncoproteins that cooperate with adenovirus E1B gene products to transform rodent cells in culture and, depending on the serotype (e.g. Ad12), to induce tumors in immunocompetent animals (Huebner et al., 1962Huebner R.J.

Region E1A of the in vivo oncogenic serotype Ad12 has a very complex expression pattern. Alternative splicing of a common precursor results in the generation of six mRNAs (13, 12, 11, 10, 9.5, and 9 S) which give rise to five different proteins (266R, 235R, 106R, 52R, and 53R) (Perricaudet et al., 1980Perricaudet M.

Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), contain any of the conserved regions (CR1, CR2, CR3) which are thought, in combination with the very amino terminus, to be essential for the trans-regulatory functions of the two larger E1A proteins (Lillie et al., 1986Lillie J.W.

Although the physiological roles of the 52R protein are still unclear, the study of its function(s) is of particular interest as Ad12 E1A virus mutants unable to express the 52R protein lose their transforming capacity. For example, the Ad12 host range mutant CS-1, which is adapted to efficient replication in Ad12 semipermissive simian Vero cells, is unable to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts and to generate tumors in newborn hamsters. Due to the loss of the splice acceptor site, a functional 52R protein cannot be expressed from Ad12 CS-1 (Murphy et al., 1987Murphy M. Opalka B. Sajaczkowski R. Schulte Holthausen H. Virology. 1987; 159: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Opalka et al., 1992Opalka B. Reith-Witowski M. Roy A. Gnauck J. Schulte Holthausen H. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Chimeric Ad5/Ad12 E1 genes are tumorigenic on condition that the Ad12 E1A amino terminus is included up to the leftmost border of CR3 (Jelinek et al., 1994Jelinek T. Pereira D.S. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 888-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jelinek and co-workers speculate that a so-called spacer segment, an Ad12 E1A-unique region of 60 nucleotides located between CR2 and CR3, may be involved in tumorigenicity. Interestingly, this spacer codes for the carboxyl-terminal end of the 52R protein (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The importance of the spacer region is shown in an additional report of Telling and Williams, 1994Telling G.C. Williams J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 877-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. These authors could show that hybrid Ad12 viruses, in which nucleotides 814-964 of the E1A gene (containing the spacer) were exchanged for the respective region of Ad5 E1A (containing no spacer), display wild-type transformation frequencies on baby rat and mouse kidney cells, but show a greatly reduced oncogenic capacity, as measured by tumor induction following virus inoculation in Hooded Lister rats. From these and other results the researchers drew the conclusion that the unique spacer region of Ad12 E1A is an oncogenic determinant of this virus. Since mutations in the spacer region also affect the 52R protein we started to characterize this Ad12 E1A-specific protein in detail. First characterization of the 52R protein revealed that it contains a striking structure in its second exon: a basic region showing a high homology with one of the DNA binding subregions of the proteins of the Fos family (Brockmann et al., 1993Brockmann D. Kröner G. Lehmann J. Esche H. Life Sci. Adv. 1993; 12: 13-22Google Scholar), followed by a cysteine-rich motif of the type C XC X3C XC (C = cysteine, X = other amino acid). We have shown that the 52R protein has a nonspecific DNA-binding activity for which both domains are essential (Brockmann et al., 1993Brockmann D. Kröner G. Lehmann J. Esche H. Life Sci. Adv. 1993; 12: 13-22Google Scholar). Moreover, using transient expression assays we could demonstrate that the 52R protein represses the trans-activating function of the cellular transcription factor AP-1 (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex consists mainly of proteins encoded by the different genes of the jun and fos families (for reviews, see Curran and Franza, 1988Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar and Angel and Karin, 1991Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). After forming homo- (Jun-Jun; c-Jun/AP-1) or heterodimers (Jun-Fos; c-Jun-c-Fos/AP-1) they bind to the TRE elements in the promoter regions of specific target genes (e.g. the human collagenase gene) and induce their expression (Angel et al., 1987Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar; Abate and Curran, 1990Abate C. Curran T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). For transcriptional activity c-Jun has to be stimulated by phosphorylation at two sites which are located in its trans-activation domain: Ser-63 and Ser-73 (Binetruy et al., 1991Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351:: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar; Smeal et al., 1991Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, Smeal et al., 1992Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Two specific enzymes belonging to the MAP kinase group, termed JNK1 and JNK2, are responsible for this phosphorylation (Hibi et al., 1993Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Depending on its composition, the activity of the AP-1 complex can be differentially regulated by two E1A proteins. The protein product of the 12 S mRNA represses the trans-activating activity of c-Jun-c-Jun and c-Jun-c-Fos dimers (Offringa et al., 1990Offringa R. Gebel S. van Dam H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas the Ad12 E1A 52R protein represses selectively the activity of c-Jun homodimers (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Down-regulation mediated by the protein translated from the 12 S mRNA depends on CR1 and is due to the inhibition of the binding of the transcription factor to its target sequence (Offringa et al., 1990Offringa R. Gebel S. van Dam H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Hagmeyer et al., 1993Hagmeyer B.M. König H. Herr I. Offringa R. Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3559-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 52R protein of Ad12 E1A does not contain CR1, indicating that the repression mechanism has to be different. Consistent with this assumption, band shift as well as in vitro footprint analyses have shown that the promoter binding of c-Jun homodimers is not prevented by the 52R protein (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore we have analyzed whether the 52R protein blocks the trans-activating activity of c-Jun by interacting physically with the transcription factor complex. In this report we demonstrate that the Ad12-unique E1A 52R protein binds to all three members of the Jun family of transcription factors (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD). The 52R protein associates with the bZIP regions of the Jun proteins containing the basic DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper structure. Furthermore, our results show that the 52R protein prevents the phosphorylation of the c-Jun trans-activation domain in vitro, suggesting that the 52R protein regulates c-Jun activity by disturbing its interaction with a specific kinase(s). The isolation of the Ad12 E1A-specific 52R protein and the generation of the plasmid pGEX-52R expressing the 52R protein (GST-52R) as fusion protein consisting of the glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum (NH2 terminus) as protein leader sequence and the 52R protein (COOH terminus) was described earlier (Brockmann et al., 1990Brockmann D. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1990; 179: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 1993). The c- jun gene, which was obtained from A. J. van der Eb, Laboratory for Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands, was subcloned into the vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate the plasmid pGEX-c- jun. The mutant pGEX-c- junTAD (amino acids 1-130), which expresses the c-Jun acidic trans-activation domain as GST fusion protein but which lacks the DNA-binding region and the leucine zipper, was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers corresponding to nucleotides 1-27 (5’-end) and to nucleotides 371-391 (3’-end, complementary sequence) of the c- jun open reading frame. The c- jun subfragment was cloned via BamHI restriction sites, which were synthesized on the 5’-ends of both primers, into the BamHI cloning site of the vector pGEX-2T. The mutant pGEX-c- junbZIP (amino acids 233-331), which contains the basic region necessary for DNA-binding and the leucine zipper involved in dimerization but which lacks the acidic trans-activation domain of c-Jun, was obtained by isolating an AvaI (nucleotide 1108 of the c- jun gene) (Angel et al., 1988Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar)/BamHI fragment from pGEX-c- jun. After generating blunt ends the subfragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the vector pGem-3Z (Promega), which was filled in using dNTPs and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Maniatis et al., 1982Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). From pGem-3Z-c- junbZIP a SmaI/AccI fragment was isolated and, after generating blunt ends, cloned into the filled in EcoRI site of the vector pGEX-2T. pGEX-c- junLZ, which expresses the c-Jun leucine zipper as GST fusion protein, was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using primers corresponding to nucleotides 832-858 (5’-end) and to nucleotides 969-996 (3’-end, complementary sequence; amino acids 278-331) of the c- jun open reading frame. pGEX-c- junDB expressing the basic DNA-binding domain of c-Jun as GST fusion protein was cloned in the same way using primers corresponding to nucleotides 748-765 (5’-end) and to nucleotides 816-837 (3’-end; complementary sequence; amino acids 250-279). The 3’-end primer carries two stop codons at its end. The human junB and the mouse junD genes were obtained from J. Schütte, University of Essen Medical School, Essen, FRG. The plasmids pGEX-c-Jun1/223Ala and pGEX-c-Jun56/223 were a gift of M. Hibi and M. Karin, University of California, San Diego, CA. The vector pGEX-(128/129) was a gift of M. A. Blanar, University of California, San Francisco, CA. This vector is a derivat of pGEX-2T and expresses a fusion protein consisting of the GST leader sequence, the recognition site for the anti-FLAG antibody (FLAG) and the recognition element for the catalytic domain of HMK which allows efficient phosphorylation of fusion proteins by HMK (Blanar and Rutter, 1992Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; Ron and Dressler, 1992Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain pGEX-(128/129)-52R the cDNA of the 52R protein was cloned in frame in the single EcoRI site following the coding region for the recognition element of the HMK. To obtain the fusion protein 6xHis-52R, which contains 6 histidine residues in front of the 52R protein, the 9.5 S cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of the vector pQE-8 (Qiagen). Induction of the fusion protein expression and its purification via nickel-chelate affinity chromatography were performed as described by Qiagen. pTM-hTFIID, coding for the human TATA box-binding protein TBP, was a gift of A. Berk, University of California, Los Angeles, CA. The correct reading frame of the 52R fusion protein as well as of the Jun mutants was confirmed by sequencing using the automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer of Pharmacia. HeLa cells and F9 embryonal carcinoma stem cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Whole cell extract of TPA-treated Jurkat cells (50 ng/ml, 30 min) was prepared as described by Hibi et al. (1993). For transfection of F9 embryonal carcinoma stem cells, Petri dishes were precoated with 0.2% gelatin. 24 h after seeding the cells, cells were transfected (Graham and van der Eb, 1973Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar; Parker and Stark, 1979Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid, 2 μg of a mouse c- jun expression plasmid (pRc/RSV-m-c- jun), and up to 6 μg of the 52R expression plasmid (pRc/RSV-9.5S). 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed by freeze-thaw treatments. The protein concentration of the cellular extracts was measured using the Bradford, 1976Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209427) Google Scholar method. Equal amounts of proteins were used to determine CAT activity (Gorman et al., 1982Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5283) Google Scholar). CAT activity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the 14C spots on thin-layer chromatography plates. In vitro transcription/translation was performed using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system of Promega and T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, depending on the vector and orientation of the cloned insert. Crude extracts prepared from 1 ml of bacteria culture expressing the respective GST fusion protein were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After gel electrophoresis proteins were electroblotted (Harlow and Lane, 1988Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) onto Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Corp.). Denaturing, renaturing, hybridization, and washing was performed as described by Ron and Dressler, 1992Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar. As radioactively labeled probe, the 52R protein, which was cloned into the vector pGEX-(128/129), was used. For kinasing (Blanar and Rutter, 1992Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; Ron and Dressler, 1992Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) GST-(128/129) or GST-(128/129)-52R were purified as described earlier (Brockmann et al., 1993Brockmann D. Kröner G. Lehmann J. Esche H. Life Sci. Adv. 1993; 12: 13-22Google Scholar). Thereafter the glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion proteins (10 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 60 μl of HMK buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 M NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2), containing 6 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (>185 TBq/mmol, Amersham) and 30 units of heart muscle kinase (Sigma). Free radioactivity and HMK were removed by washing three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM NaF. Radioactively labeled fusion proteins were eluted two times with 150 μl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) by rocking for 30 min at room temperature. Usually 1 × 106 cpm of the labeled fusion proteins were used for 1 ml of hybridization solution. Equal molar amounts of the different fusion proteins were used for the binding assays. The GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) and incubated with up to 1 × 105 cpm of in vitro translated Jun or TBP in incubation buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 1.8 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. After 1 h at 4°C the beads were washed five times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. For analysis of bound proteins, the beads were boiled in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204686) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. For protein binding inhibition experiments, the protein binding assays were performed in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of 6xHis-52R (compared to GST-c-Jun). Bovine serum albumin was added to the control reactions to keep the protein concentration constant in each assay. The solid-phase kinase assays were performed as described by Hibi et al. (1993). For kinase inhibition experiments the fusion protein 6xHis-52R was added at 20-fold molar excess to the reaction solution (compared to GST-c-Jun). Bovine serum albumin was added to the control reactions to keep the protein concentration constant in each assay. We have shown recently that the 52R protein down-regulates the trans-activation function of the cellular transcription factor c-Jun (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To study the repression in more detail we performed transient expression assays in F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells lacking endogenous c-Jun activity (Chiu et al., 1988Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, Chiu et al., 1989Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Consequently, the expression of a reporter plasmid, whose expression is driven by the c-Jun binding site of the human collagenase promoter (Col-TRE/TK-CAT; Fig. 1A) is undetectable in these cells (Fig. 1 B). Co-transfection of 2 μg of the mouse c- jun expression plasmid pRc/RSV-m-c- jun results in a 12-fold activation of the TRE-mediated CAT-enzyme activity (Fig. 1 B). This trans-activation function of c-Jun is repressed by the 52R protein (Fig. 1 B) after co-transfection of a respective expression vector (pRc/RSV-9.5S; Fig. 1A). Down-regulation of c-Jun activity is dosage-dependent. In the highest concentration used (6 μg pRc/RSV-9.5S) the c-Jun-dependent CAT enzyme expression is repressed approximately 5-fold (Fig. 1 B). pRc/RSV lacking the 52R cDNA has no influence on CAT expression from the reporter plasmid Col-TRE/TK-CAT (Fig. 1 B). Studying the repression mechanism we found that the 52R protein does not prevent the binding of c-Jun to its promoter target sequence (Brockmann et al., 1994Brockmann D. Feng L. Kröner G. Tries B. Esche H. Virology. 1994; 198: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore we speculated that the 52R protein might associate directly with c-Jun and disturb in this way the interaction between c-Jun and factors essential for transcriptional activation. To examine this possibility we performed far Western blot analyses. Protein lysates prepared from bacteria expressing the fusion protein GST-c-Jun (Fig. 2 B, lane 5) or the leader sequence GST (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Bacterial lysates which do not contain the GST leader sequence or the GST-c-Jun fusion protein were used as controls (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 4). Hybridization was performed with the 32P-labeled probe GST-(128/129)-52R. GST-(128/129) is a derivat of pGEX-2T and expresses a fusion protein consisting of the GST leader sequence and the phosphorylation site for HMK, which allows efficient phosphorylation of fusion proteins by HMK (Blanar and Rutter, 1992Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; Ron and Dressler, 1992Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). Control gels revealed that the affinity-purified probes were more than 95% pure (Fig. 2 D, lanes 4 and 7). As shown in Fig. 2 C, GST-(128/129)-52R hybridizes to the GST-c-Jun fusion protein (lane 5) but not to the GST leader sequence (lane 3) or to lysate proteins obtained from uninduced bacteria (lanes 2 and 4), indicating that the interaction is due to a specific association of the 52R protein with c-Jun. To exclude completely that the GST leader sequence is somehow involved in this interaction, we performed a far Western blot with radioactively labeled GST-(128/129) protein. No hybridization signals were obtained in these experiments (data not shown). These results clearly show that the 52R protein is able to bind directly and specifically to the cellular transcription factor c-Jun. To identify the domain of c-Jun involved in the association with the 52R protein we hybridized a far Western blot carrying two c-Jun deletion mutants (GST-c-JunTAD, GST-c-JunbZIP; Fig. 2 A) with GST-(128/129)-52R. GST-c-JunTAD expresses the acidic trans-activation domain of c-Jun while GST-c-JunbZIP contains the basic DNA-binding domain and the leucine zippe"

The sequence and topology requirements for this regulated splicing event were studied in the BC3H1 myogenic cell line using a minigene containing the 3’-end of the SERCA2 gene. In undifferentiated BC3H1 cells, the splice process is made inefficient by the presence of a weak muscle-type 5’-donor site (5’D1) and a long terminal intron. Both optimizing the 5’D1 and decreasing the length of the muscle-specific intron, induced muscle-type splicing in undifferentiated myogenic cells. Moreover, the induction of muscle-type transcripts was only observed when two competing processing sites, the polyadenylation site (pAu) used in non-muscle cells and the second neuronal 5’-donor site (5’D2), were weak. Indeed, making 5’D2 consensus induced neuronal-type splicing in undifferentiated myocytes and prevented the appearance of muscle-type transcripts. Similarly, replacing the polyadenylation site (pAu) with a strong site almost completely inhibited muscle-type splicing after myogenic differentiation.

Tissue-specific differential processing of the 3’-end of the SERCA2 mRNA gives rise to two distinct protein isoforms, which differ in their C-terminal part (4de la Bastie D. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K.

This divergence in the C-terminal part of the protein is responsible for a functional difference between SERCA2a and SERCA2b (8Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The muscle-specific SERCA2a has a lower Ca2+ affinity and a higher turnover rate for Ca2+ transport and for ATP hydrolysis compared with the SERCA2b isoform. It has recently been demonstrated that the last 12 residues in SERCA2b are of critical importance for eliciting the functional difference between the SERCA2 isoforms (10Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van Den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These isoforms have a tissue-specific expression pattern: the SERCA2b isoform is present in non-muscle tissues and in smooth muscle while SERCA2a is typical of heart, slow-twitch skeletal muscle and is also present in smooth muscle. Recent in situ hybridization studies have detected SERCA2a mRNAs very early during embryological development in the cardiogenic plate of the presomite rat embryo (day 10 post-cotum) (11Anger M.

The expression of the SERCA3 gene was recently shown to be particularly high in platelets, lymphoid cells, and in some endothelial cells (13Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L.

Tissue-dependent alternative processing of the SERCA2 transcripts gives rise to four different mRNAs (classes 1-4), which encode for the two different SERCA2 protein isoforms (Fig. 1 A). The class 1 mRNA is generated in the heart, slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle by a splicing process, removing an optional intron at the 3’-end of the SERCA2 messenger. The predominant non-muscle class 2 mRNA is formed by polyadenylation at a site that lies in between the muscle-specific 5’-donor and 3’-acceptor splice sites. The class 3 mRNA is found in all tissues and contains the muscle-specific intron while it is polyadenylated at a downstream site, which is also used in the class 1 messenger. Finally, the brain-specific class 4 mRNA is formed by a splicing event using a second 5’-donor splice site downstream of the muscle donor site and the same 3’-acceptor site as in class 1 mRNA. Class 1 encodes the muscle-specific SERCA2a isoform, while classes 2-4 all encode the non-muscle SERCA2b isoform. In a previous study (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we used a minigene containing the 3’-end of the SERCA2 gene to study the tissue-dependent mRNA processing. In transfected 10T1/2 and BC3H1 cells, the minigene transcripts were shown to be processed similarly to the endogenous SERCA2 gene transcripts. In undifferentiated BC3H1 myoblasts, SERCA2 minigene transcripts were not spliced, while muscle-type splicing was induced when the cells were allowed to differentiate into myocytes. In 10T1/2 fibroblasts, we could not observe muscle-type splicing, even when the class 2-specific polyadenylation site was deleted. However, muscle-type splicing in 10T1/2 fibroblasts was seen when the muscle-specific donor splice site was optimized and/or when the length of the muscle-specific intron was shortened. These experiments led us to propose that cis-acting elements present in the primary SERCA2 transcript render muscle-type splicing inefficient in non-muscle cells and that the splicing process becomes activated during myogenic differentiation by the expression of splice factors. In this study, we further tested this hypothesis and also characterized some of the spatial and sequence elements of the SERCA2 gene that are required for tissue-specific transcript processing. We focused on the donor sites (the muscle-specific upstream 5’D1 and the neuronal specific downstream 5’D2) and on the polyadenylation site located in the alternatively spliced intron (pAu). The strength of these sites was manipulated to assess their contribution to differentiation-dependent transcript processing. We also further explored the inverse relationship between intron length and efficiency of splicing. Our results indicate that regulated splicing, i.e. induction of splicing during myogenic differentiation, can only occur when all three sites (5’D1, 5’D2, and pAu) are weak processing sites and when the muscle-specific intron exceeds a critical length. BC3H1 mouse myoblasts (ATCC; CRL1443) and C3H/10T1/2 cells (ATCC; CCL226) were cultured as previously described (16De Smedt H. Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Parys J.B. Van Den Bosch L. Missiaen L. Verbist J. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7092-7095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For differentiation studies, the cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 in 175-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 3.5 mML-glutamine, 0.9% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 85 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 85 units of penicillin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). 3 days later, differentiation was induced by switching the BC3H1 cells to differentiation medium containing 0.5% (v/v) serum. The cultures were supplied with fresh differentiation medium 2, 4, and 7 days after the onset of differentiation. 10T1/2 fibroblasts were cultured in the same way as the BC3H1 cells except that 10% fetal calf serum was used in the growth medium. The construction of the minigene containing the 3’-end of the SERCA2 gene has been previously described (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The pCMβSERCA2 construct contains the 3’-end of the pig SERCA2 gene inserted behind a cytomegalovirus immediate early promotor and a SfaNI- EcoRI fragment of the rabbit β-globin gene. All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence numbers refer to the sequence published by Eggermont et al.(18Eggermont J. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1991; 271: 649-653Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mutations in the construct were introduced using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega). An XbaI- XbaI or an XbaI- AflII restriction fragment from pCMβSERCA2 were subcloned into the pALTER vector. In Mut1, the splice donor site 5’D1 (TG/GTAAAG) (where the diagonal line indicates the end of the exon and the beginning of the intron) was changed into a near consensus sequence (TG/GTAAGT). To create Mut4, a new AflII-site was introduced in the XbaI- AflII fragment at position 2653 by changing the T at this position into a C, thus obtaining C/TTAAG. By transferring the XbaI- AflII fragment from pALTER back to pCMβSERCA2, the AflII- AflII fragment (193 nucleotides) containing the upstream polyadenylation site (pAu) was deleted from the construct. A strong polyadenylation signal (SPA) was introduced by ligating a blunt-ended Asp718- XbaI fragment excised from a pUC-SPA vector (kindly provided by N. J. Proudfoot, Oxford, United Kingdom) into the blunt-ended AflII-site of Mut4. This resulted in Mut4,SPAu. A combination of Mut4,SPAu with Mut1 was obtained by removing the XbaI- XbaI fragment from Mut4 and exchanging it with the XbaI- XbaI fragment from Mut1, containing the optimized donor site. This resulted in the mutated construct pCMβSERCA2(Mut4,SPAu,Mut1). From this construct, an AflII- EcoNI fragment (1924 nt) from exon 23-24 was removed, and the vector was blunt-ended and recircularized, resulting in the construct pCMβSERCA2(Mut4,SPAu,Mut1,Del1). The SPA site was also inserted just before the downstream polyadenylation site pAd. Therefore, an Asp718 unique restriction site was introduced in the minigene at position 6305 just upstream of the pAd (Mut12). In this site, the blunt-ended Asp718- XbaI frag-ment excised from the pUC-SPA vector was ligated. This resulted in Mut12,SPAd. Different intron deletions, shortening the distance between the muscle-specific 5’-splice donor and 3’-acceptor site, were made. Del1 was created by removing the AflII- EcoNI restriction fragment (1924 nt) from exon 23-24, blunt-ending the vector by Klenow fill-in, and recircularizing it. For Del2, the BstEII- BstEII restriction fragment (1047 nt) was removed from exon 24, and the vector was recircularized. For making further intron deletions, a new unique restriction site was created by site-directed mutagenesis near the 5’-end of the intron (position 1842). At this position, a T was changed into a G, resulting in an Asp718 recognition site (GGTACC). This mutation was named Mut6. Del3 was created starting from Mut6 by removing an Asp718- BstEII restriction fragment (3104 nt) and blunt-ending and recircularizing the vector. In this way, the largest part of the intron was removed, only leaving 284 nucleotides. Del4, Del5, and Del6 were constructed by removing an Asp718- AflII fragment (1004 nt), an Asp718- XhoI fragment (2438 nt), and an Asp718- EcoNI fragment (2928 nt), respectively, from Mut6, blunt-ending, and religating the plasmid. The second donor site 5’D2 was mutated by first subcloning the AflII- XhoI fragment into pALTER. This donor site (AC/GTGAGT) was converted into a full-consensus donor site (AG/GTGAGT), which resulted in Mut7 after ligating the AflII- XhoI fragment back into the construct. A further modification of Mut7 was made by first exchanging the XbaI- XbaI fragment from Mut7 with the corresponding fragment from Mut6. This fragment contains an Asp718 site, which could then be used to remove an Asp718- SwaI fragment (824 nt) upstream of the consensus 5’D2. For analysis of in vivo splicing, all plasmids were stably transfected into BC3H1 cells or 10T1/2 cells using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method as described before (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from transfected or untransfected BC3H1 or 10T1/2 cells according to the Chirgwin procedure (19Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)-primed first-strand cDNA was synthesized typically in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 1 μg of total RNA, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 × Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Boehringer Mannheim), 20 units of RNase inhibitor (rRNasin, Promega), 200 ng of oligo(dT)15 (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Portions of the first-strand cDNA mix (25%) were then PCR amplified using Hot TubTM DNA polymerase (Amersham International, Amersham, UK). The PCR reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1 × Tub buffer (low Mg2+, Amersham International), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 25 pmol of each forward and reverse primer(s), and 2.5 units of Hot TubTM DNA polymerase. Each cycle consisted of 1 min denaturation at 95°C, 1 min annealing at 55°C, and 1 min extension at 72°C. The labeled amplification products (20 μl of the final PCR mixture) were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. To ensure that no contaminating genomic DNA was present in the cDNA samples, we performed control PCR amplifications starting from RNA samples. These controls were always negative. The SERCA2 primer sequences were derived from the pig genomic SERCA2 sequence (18Eggermont J. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1991; 271: 649-653Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and correspond to the following sequences: C2, 5’-AGACCAGAACATATCACT-3’ (nt 2267-2284, exon 22); P2, 5’-GAAACATGGATACTTGGC-3’ (nt 5858-5875, exon 25); U4, 5’-GGATCCTGTTCTGCTGCA-3’ (nt 3241-3258, exon 23); and S2, 5’-GCACTAACCACCACCATC-3’ (nt 3477-3494, exon 23). The U1 primer (5’-GAGGTTCTTCGAGTCCTT-3’) corresponds to nt 299-316 (exon 2) of the rabbit β-globin sequence as described by Van Ooyen et al.(20Van Ooyen A. Van Den Berg J. Mantei N. Weissmann C. Science. 1979; 206: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When two different antisense primers were used simultaneously in combination with the same sense primer, it was verified that the result was the same as when the antisense primers were used separately. BC3H1 is a myogenic cell line, which is well characterized with respect to muscle differentiation (21Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Edmondson D. Brennan T. Olson E. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that muscle-type class 1 mRNAs derived from the endogenous SERCA2 gene are induced during myogenic differentiation of BC3H1 cells (16De Smedt H. Eggermont J.A.

Van Den Bosch L. Casteels R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when BC3H1 cells were stably transfected with the pCMβSERCA2 minigene, class 1 mRNAs derived from the minigene were also observed during differentiation (Fig. 1 B and Van Den Bosch et al. (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Fig. 1 shows a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment performed on BC3H1 cells that were stably transfected with the pCMβSERCA2 construct. The relative position of the different primers used for PCR amplification is shown in Fig. 1A. For the amplification of muscle-specific class 1 messenger, the U1 sense primer located in exon 2 of β-globin and the P2 antisense primer located in exon 25 were used. This gives a 617-nt-long PCR-product specific for the class 1 mRNAs derived from the transfected minigene. For the amplification of class 2/3 messengers, the same sense primer (U1) was used in combination with the C2 antisense primer located in exon 22. In this way, a 414-nt-long fragment specific for class 2/3 mRNA was amplified. Fig. 1 B shows that in undifferentiated cells, only class 2/3 mRNAs could be detected and that starting from day 4, the class 1 mRNA gradually appeared during myogenic differentiation. We had previously observed that transfection of 10T1/2 fibroblasts with a SERCA2 minigene containing either an optimized 5’D1 site (Mut1) or a shortened intron (Del1) resulted in the formation of muscle-type class 1 mRNAs (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effect of the intron deletion on splice activation was shown to be a distance effect as the restoration of intron length with a non-related DNA fragment again prevented muscle-type splicing in 10T1/2 fibroblasts. We therefore wanted to investigate whether these modifications would interfere with the differentiation-dependent activation of splicing in BC3H1 cells. SERCA2 minigenes with an optimized 5’D1 (Mut1) or a shortened intron (Del1) or a combination of both modifications (Fig. 2 A) were stably transfected in BC3H1 cells. Minigene mRNAs before and after differentiation were analyzed via reverse transcriptase-PCR. Fig. 2B shows that in undifferentiated cells transfected with either the optimized 5’D1 or the shortened intron, besides the class 2/3 mRNAs, low levels of class 1 mRNAs could also be detected. Importantly, class 1 mRNAs for these two mutant constructs increased during differentiation as illustrated in Fig. 2 B. In contrast, a combination of both mutations resulted in the nearly exclusive formation of class 1 mRNAs in undifferentiated cells with no marked changes in mRNA profile during differentiation. From these data, we concluded that each mutation on its own slightly increased the likelihood of splicing in non-differentiated BC3H1 cells and that they did not interfere with the differentiation-dependent up-regulation of splicing. However, combining both modifications nearly maximally activated splicing in non-differentiated cells, suggesting an additive effect of these modifications on the splice process. Moreover, the combination of both modifications apparently provoked a maximal splice efficiency in undifferentiated cells as differentiation did not produce a further increase in the class1 mRNA level. We further examined whether regulated splicing was also affected by changing the 5’D2 site. This donor splice site is located downstream of 5’D1 (Fig. 3 A) and is only used in neuronal tissues and neuronal cell lines (18Eggermont J. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1991; 271: 649-653Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Plessers L. Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Casteels R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 650-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both 5’D1 and 5’D2 use the same 3’-acceptor site. At first sight, the 5’D2 site could be considered as a near consensus binding site as it deviates in only one position (−1) from the mammalian consensus sequence (5’D2, AC/GTGAGT; consensus, AG/GTRAGT). However, a statistical analysis of mammalian donor sites (25Shapiro M. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar) showed that a G at this position was strongly favored (78%), whereas a C in this position was only present in 3% of the analyzed sites. This prompted us to investigate whether the C at position −1 affected the processing strength of 5’D2. When 5’D2 was mutated to a consensus donor splice site (Mut7, AC/GTGAGT to AG/GTGATG), class 4 mRNAs were formed both in undifferentiated and differentiated cells (figure 3 B, lanes1 and 2). Moreover, no class 1 mRNAs could be detected after differentiation of BC3H1 cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes1 and 2). This indicates that 5’D1 and 5’D2 compete for the same 3’-acceptor site but that in the context of the wild type gene, 5’D2 is too weak to compete effectively with 5’D1 during differentiation. We then investigated whether the competition between 5’D1 and 5’D2 could be influenced by shortening the distance between both sites. We therefore made a construct in which the distance between 5’D1 and the consensus 5’D2 was shortened by deleting an Asp718- SwaI fragment of 827 nt (Mut7, Del7), thereby reducing the distance between 5’D1 and 5’D2 from 1473 to 646 nt. Undifferentiated cells transfected with this construct contained both class 1 and class 4 mRNAs (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes3 and 4). During differentiation, class 1 mRNAs were up-regulated, whereas the level of class 4 mRNAs did not change markedly, indicating that in this shortened construct, 5’D1 competes more efficiently with the consensus 5’D2. We previously demonstrated that deletion of the upstream polyadenylation site (pAu) did not result in the use of the upstream donor splice site in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This argues against a simple competition model between splicing and polyadenylation. We further investigated the effect of polyadenylation site strength on transcript processing in BC3H1 cells by replacing the upstream polyadenylation site with a strong SPA, as described by Levitt et al.(26Levitt N. Briggs D. Gil A. Proudfoot N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, deleting the upstream polyadenylation site (Mut4) did not interfere with the differentiation-dependent activation of splicing (lanes1 and 2). Class 2/3 mRNAs were the only detectable mRNAs in non-differentiated cells, and the class 1 mRNA was induced after differentiation. However, introducing the SPA at the pAu locus (SPAu) nearly completely abolished the differentiation-dependent up-regulation of splicing (lanes3 and 4). Polyadenylation at the upstream site became the predominant process, both in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of polyadenylation at the pAu blocked the differentiation-dependent formation of class 1 mRNAs. We then examined the processing pattern for a construct in which both the efficiency of splicing (optimized 5’D1 and shortened intron) and the efficiency of polyadenylation at the pAu (SPAu) were augmented. Fig. 4B (lane5) shows that in undifferentiated cells, the class 1 mRNA was the most abundant messenger, indicating that in this case splicing nearly completely outcompeted polyadenylation. Consequently, no further increase in class 1 mRNA was detected during differentiation (Fig. 4 B, lane6). To investigate the influence of the strength of the downstream polyadenylation site on splice regulation, we also inserted a strong polyadenylation site at the end of exon 25 immediately upstream of the pAd (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the presence of a strong downstream polyadenylation site did not significantly alter the differentiation-dependent splice pattern. This indicated that the strength of the downstream pAd is not important for splice regulation. Finally, we analyzed in greater detail how splicing is affected by changing the length of the terminal intron. Previous experiments had shown that deleting a large part of the terminal intron (Del1) resulted in the appearance of class 1 mRNAs in undifferentiated BC3H1 (Fig. 2) and in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This effect is not sequence dependent but distance dependent, as substituting the Del1 with a non-related sequence restored the normal transcript processing (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further explore the effect of intron length on splicing efficiency and splice regulation, deletions of different length were created within the terminal intron at different positions (Fig. 5 A). These constructs were then transfected into 10T1/2 cells. The amount of spliced SERCA2 transcript was found to be inversely related to the length of the remaining intron. Fig. 5 B shows that deletions of less than 1100 nt (Del2, Del4) had only a weak effect on splice activation, whereas longer deletions of over 1900 nt (Del1, Del5) resulted in a strong class 1 mRNA band. Interestingly, shortening the intron with 514 nt from 1464 nt (Del1) to 950 nt (Del5) only had a small effect on the class 1 mRNA level, whereas an additional deletion of 490 nt from 950 nt (Del5) to 460 nt (Del6) strongly increased the class 1 mRNA level in fibroblasts. The marked increase in class 1 mRNA in Del6 as compared with Del5 could not be attributed to the removal of a specific sequence element, as the same XhoI- EcoNI fragment was also removed in Del2 without any effect on class 1 mRNA levels. This suggested that once the intron was shortened below a critical length, splicing became very efficient in non-muscle cells. To further study the differentiation-dependent regulation of SERCA2 transcript processing, these deletions were transfected into BC3H1 myogenic cells. This resulted in the detection of class 1 messenger in undifferentiated cells in all cases. For the short deletions (Del4, Del2, Del1, and Del5), we could still detect a further up-regulation of about 65% of class 1 messenger during differentiation, indicating that they did not interfere with the differentiation-dependent up-regulation of splicing. In the long deletions (Del3, Del6), no further significant up-regulation could be detected during differentiation. It appeared that in these conditions, a maximal stimulation of splicing already occurred in undifferentiated conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 B where only the results for the shortest and the longest deletion are shown. In this study, the structural and spatial requirements imposed on the processing sites for obtaining a muscle-specific SERCA2 gene transcript were assessed by means of a mutational analysis of a minigene containing the SERCA2 3’-end. It was concluded from a previous study that the activation of splicing is the mechanism that is responsible for obtaining the class 1 transcript encoding the muscle-specific SERCA2a isoform (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we looked more specifically at the influence of the relative strength of splice and polyadenylation sites, which are involved in generating the different transcripts. This was done to further delineate the sequence requirements for obtaining a tissue-specific processing of the transcript. This knowledge is a prerequisite for unraveling the exact mechanisms regulating the differential transcript processing. We conclude from our data that regulated expression of the SERCA2 gene as observed during differentiation of BC3H1 cells (i.e. only class 2/3 mRNAs in non-differentiated cells and the induction of class 1 mRNAs during differentiation) depends on three conditions: (i) removal of the terminal intron is an inefficient process so that splicing is a very improbable event in non-differentiated cells; (ii) the processing sites (pAu and 5’D2) competing with the use of the muscle-specific splice sites are weak and do not interfere with muscle-type processing during differentiation; (iii) the efficiency of the muscle-type splice process is increased during differentiation. To obtain regulated SERCA2 transcript processing, splicing of the terminal intron has to be an inefficient process in non-differentiated cells. We have identified two factors that contribute to the low probability of splicing in non-differentiated cells. First, the 5’D1 splice donor site is a weak processing site. The 5’D1 site deviates from the consensus U1snRNP binding site in three positions (−2, +5, +6), suggesting that it is a weak site. When the 5’D1 site was optimized, splicing was induced in undifferentiated cells, implying that the wild type 5’D1 is indeed a weak site. Splicing was further up-regulated during differentiation, which indicates that changing the 5’D1 donor site to an optimal donor site increased the probability of splicing in non-differentiated cells but did not induce a maximal level of splicing in these conditions. The observation that optimizing the 5’D1 donor was on its own not sufficient for maximal splice up-regulation in non-differentiated cells suggested that other factors were involved in lowering the efficiency of terminal intron splicing. A second factor contributing to the inefficiency of splicing in non-differentiated cells is the long terminal intron in the SERCA2 transcript. An inverse relation was observed between the length of the intron and the efficiency of splicing in fibroblasts as well as in non-differentiated BC3H1 cells. The effect of the deletions cannot be ascribed to the removal of a specific regulatory sequence, as deleting stretches of approximately equal length but in different zones had nearly identical effects on splice activation. In addition, the normal splice pattern was restored by substituting the intron deletion (Del1) with a non-related sequence derived from λ-phage DNA (15Van Den Bosch L. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Mertens L. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also observed that reducing the intron from its original length of 3389 to 950 nt had only a small effect on splice activation, whereas a further reduction to 460 nt greatly increased splice efficiency. This suggests that there is a critical intron length between 460 and 950 nt, above which splicing becomes inefficient. Interestingly, this critical intron length correlates with the average terminal intron length (681 nucleotides) as observed in vertebrates (27Hawkins J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9893-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the relatively long terminal intron in the SERCA2 gene contributes to the inefficiency of splicing as observed in undifferentiated cells. An effect of intron length on splice efficiency has only been previously described for the splicing of the mouse μ heavy chain mRNA (28Tsurushita N. Korn L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2602-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Peterson M.L. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this model, it was shown that shortening the distance between exon C4 and exon M strongly promoted the splicing pathway relative to a competing polyadenylation process at a site located in the intervening sequence. A third potential site, which could be responsible for inefficient splicing in non-muscle cells, could be the branch point and 3’-acceptor site. However, the sequence of the branch point/3’-acceptor region of the SERCA2 gene fits reasonably well with the mammalian consensus sequence (SERCA2, GTG AT(Py)21CAG versus consensus, CT(G/C) AC(Py)20-40CAG) (30Stephens M.R. Schneider T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Lukashin A.V. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2511-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 3’-acceptor site was readily used in non-muscle cells when either the 5’D1 was optimized or when the intron was shortened. In view of this, we do not think that a block at the level of the branch point/3’-acceptor significantly contributes to the inefficiency of SERCA2 splicing. When splicing becomes activated during muscle differentiation, it has to compete with two other processes. First, the messenger can also be polyadenylated at the upstream polyadenylation site in the terminal intron; second, a neuron-specific donor site (5’D2) downstream of the muscle-specific donor site (5’D1) can be used. To explain why these sites are poor competitors for the muscle-type splicing in differentiated BC3H1 cells, we changed the strength of these processing sites. Replacing the upstream polyadenylation site by a well characterized strong synthetic polyadenylation site (26Levitt N. Briggs D. Gil A. Proudfoot N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) interfered with the normal SERCA2 transcript processing and nearly completely abolished the differentiation-dependent up-regulation of splicing. This experiment showed that a weak upstream polyadenylation site is a necessary condition for obtaining regulated transcript processing. The second donor site 5’D2 lies downstream of the muscle-specific 5’D1 and is only used in neuronal cells. Optimizing the 5’D2 donor site drastically altered the splicing pattern during myogenic differentiation, as class 1 mRNAs were no longer formed. However, the neuron-specific class 4 transcript could be detected both in undifferentiated and differentiated muscle cells, indicating that the consensus 5’D2 donor site completely outcompeted the more distal 5’D1 site. Therefore, the appearance of class 1 mRNAs during myogenic differentiation is only possible when both the upstream poly(A) site and the second donor splice site are weak processing sites. Splicing of the SERCA2 terminal intron is an improbable event in non-differentiated cells. Our data indicate that the limitations imposed by the weak donor site and the long terminal intron are overcome during myogenic differentiation. This is most likely due to trans-acting factors induced during differentiation that increase the likelihood of splicing such that it becomes the main processing event for the SERCA2 gene transcript. The selection and usage of the 5’-splice site is a complex process in which both snRNPs (U1snRNP, U5snRNP, and U6snRNP) and protein splice factors (like ASF/SF2 and SC35) are involved (for a recent review, see Horowitz and Krainer (32Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 100-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)). A critical step for 5’-splice site selection and usage seems to be the base pairing between the donor splice site and the 5’-end of the U1snRNA. Consequently, the usage of the 5’D1 donor site can be enhanced by factors that facilitate U1snRNP binding to the donor splice site. Eperon et al.(33Eperon I.C. Ireland D.C. Smith R.A. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SR proteins can stabilize binding of U1snRNP to 5’-splice sites. This stabilizing function may become especially important when the donor site diverges from the consensus binding sequence, as is the case for 5’D1. Trans-acting factors expressed during differentiation must also overcome the inhibitory effect of the long terminal intron. It has been demonstrated that splice factors of the SR family interact at the 5’-donor site via the U1-70K protein and also with the 3’-acceptor region via the U2AF65 protein, suggesting that SR splice factors may play a role in approximating donor and acceptor sites during spliceosome formation (33Eperon I.C. Ireland D.C. Smith R.A. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34Tian M. Maniatis T.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, whether SR proteins are involved in the activation of SERCA2 splicing either by up-regulating the use of the 5’D1 or by bridging the long distance between 5’D1 and the 3’-acceptor splice site remains an open question.

Compared with parental Rat1 cells, the cells expressing the truncated receptor exhibited enhanced sensitivity to insulin's biologic actions. All of these effects are now extended to transcriptional events, since we now show enhanced sensitivity to insulin stimulation of c -fos mRNA expression. These effects were insulin-specific, since insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation of glucose incorporation into glycogen, α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake, and thymidine incorporation into DNA were normal. In addition, the truncated receptor exhibited enhanced sensitivity only in vivo, but not in vitro, since the kinase activity of wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptor preparations was comparable between HIRΔ978 and parental Rat1 insulin receptors. Parental rat endogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors and transfected human insulin receptors form hybrid receptors as well as homologous tetrameric receptors. The normal heterotetrameric receptors possess kinase activity in vivo leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and its association with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase. Interestingly, preincubation with human-specific anti-insulin receptor antibody abolished the increased insulin sensitivity in glucose incorporation into glycogen in HIRΔ978 cells. Furthermore, microinjection of anti-IRS-1 antibody into HIRΔ978 cells inhibited insulin stimulation of DNA synthesis. In summary: 1) truncated receptors on the cell surface confer enhanced insulin sensitivity in vivo; 2) the normal heterotetrameric receptors are functionally active and couple to IRS-1 efficiently; and 3) IRS-1 is an important molecule transmitting insulin's biological signals in HIRΔ978 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2088642373,"Abstract Typically the internal promoter elements of tRNA genes are necessary and sufficient to support transcription. Here a sequence element preceding a Xenopus tRNA gene is shown to be required for transcription in late stage, but not early stage oocyte extracts. The constitutive tyrD gene is expressed in both early and late oocyte extracts, whereas the early oocyte-specific tyrCooc gene is only expressed in early extracts. An upstream promoter element (URR), between positions −42 and −14 of the tyrD gene, mediates this differential expression. The URR is required for tyrD transcription in late oocyte extracts. Placing the URR upstream of the tyrCooc gene allows this gene to be transcribed in late extracts. The URR is irrelevant to transcription in early extracts; transcription of tyrD or tyrCooc requires only the internal promoter sequences. This indicates the polymerase III transcriptional machinery changes during oogenesis, resulting in a stringent upstream sequence requirement. Mutations within the URR are shown to alter the preferred site of initiation by RNA polymerase III. Shifting the position of the URR upstream by one-half helical turn also repositioned the site of initiation, suggesting the URR directs the placement of the initiation factor complex or polymerase itself."
