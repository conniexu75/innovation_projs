A proportion of the UK population has been exposed to a bovine spongiform encephalopathy-like prion strain and are at risk of developing variant CJD. A hallmark of prion disease is the transformation of normal cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into an infectious disease-associated isoform, PrP(Sc). Recent in vitro studies indicate that anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies with little or no affinity for PrP(Sc) can prevent the incorporation of PrP(C) into propagating prions. We therefore investigated in a murine scrapie model whether anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies show similar inhibitory effects on prion replication in vivo. We found that peripheral PrP(Sc) levels and prion infectivity were markedly reduced, even when the antibodies were first administered at the point of near maximal accumulation of PrP(Sc) in the spleen. Furthermore, animals in which the treatment was continued remained healthy for over 300 days after equivalent untreated animals had succumbed to the disease. These findings indicate that immunotherapeutic strategies for human prion diseases are worth pursuing."

Inbreeding in animals can increase their susceptibility to pathogens, but direct evidence from wild populations is scarce1,2 and it is unclear whether all pathogens are affected equally. Here we analyse rescued California sea lions afflicted with a range of different pathogens, and find that sick animals have higher-than-normal parental relatedness, with the extent varying among disease classes. Our findings indicate that mortality in natural populations may not be entirely random and that inbred individuals could act as more effective reservoirs of infectious agents."
https://openalex.org/W2923970146,"Perceptual learning can occur as a result of exposure to a subliminal stimulus, without the subject having to pay attention and without relevance to the particular task in hand1 — but is this type of learning purely passive? Here we show that perceptual learning is not passive, but instead results from reinforcement by an independent task2,3. As this learning occurred on a subliminal feature, our results are inconsistent with attentional learning theories4,5 in which learning occurs only on stimuli to which attention is directed. Instead, our findings suggest that the successful recognition of a relevant stimulus can trigger an internal reward6 and give rise to the learning of irrelevant and even subliminal features that are correlated with the occurrence of the reward5,6."
https://openalex.org/W1975759605,"The nucleoprotein of measles virus consists of an N-terminal moiety, N(CORE), resistant to proteolysis and a C-terminal moiety, N(TAIL), hypersensitive to proteolysis and not visible as a distinct domain by electron microscopy. We report the bacterial expression, purification, and characterization of measles virus N(TAIL). Using nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and small angle x-ray scattering, we show that N(TAIL) is not structured in solution. Its sequence and spectroscopic and hydrodynamic properties indicate that N(TAIL) belongs to the premolten globule subfamily within the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. The same epitopes are exposed in N(TAIL) and within the nucleoprotein, which rules out dramatic conformational changes in the isolated N(TAIL) domain compared with the full-length nucleoprotein. Most unstructured proteins undergo some degree of folding upon binding to their partners, a process termed folding. We show that N(TAIL) is able to bind its physiological partner, the phosphoprotein, and that it undergoes such an unstructured-to-structured transition upon binding to the C-terminal moiety of the phosphoprotein. The presence of flexible regions at the surface of the viral nucleocapsid would enable plastic interactions with several partners, whereas the gain of structure arising from induced folding would lead to modulation of these interactions. These results contribute to the study of the emerging field of natively unfolded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2082887857,"To understand the physical processes that occur in nature we need to obtain a solid concept about the ‘fundamental’ forces acting between pairs of elementary particles. It is also necessary to describe the temporal and spatial evolution of many mutually interacting particles under the influence of these forces. This latter step, known as the few-body problem, remains an important unsolved problem in physics. Experiments involving atomic collisions represent a useful testing ground for studying the few-body problem. For the single ionization of a helium atom by charged particle impact, kinematically complete experiments have been performed1,2,3,4,5,6 since 1969 (ref. 7). The theoretical analysis of such experiments was thought to yield a complete picture of the basic features of the collision process, at least for large collision energies8,9,10,11,12,13,14. These conclusions are, however, almost exclusively based on studies of restricted electron-emission geometries1,2,3. Here, we report three-dimensional images of the complete electron emission pattern for the single ionization of helium by the impact of C6+ ions of energy 100 MeV per a.m.u. (a four-body system) and observe features that have not been predicted by any published theoretical model. We propose a higher-order ionization mechanism, involving the interaction between the projectile and the target nucleus, to explain these features."

Essential steps in this adaptive mechanism include AHR binding of ligand in the cytosol, translocation of the receptor to the nucleus, dimerization with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator, and binding of this heterodimeric transcription factor to dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) upstream of promoters that regulate the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The AHR is also involved in other aspects of mammalian biology, such as the toxicity of molecules like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin as well as regulation of normal liver development. In an effort to test whether these additional AHR-mediated processes require a nuclear event, such as DRE binding, we used homologous recombination to generate mice with a mutation in the AHR nuclear localization/DRE binding domain. These Ahrnls mice were found to be resistant to all 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced toxic responses that we examined, including hepatomegaly, thymic involution, and cleft palate formation.

Over the last 20 years, the mechanistic details of this adaptive signaling pathway have been well characterized (1Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 2Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 3Schmidt J.V.

Upon binding agonists, the AHR translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with another bHLH-PAS protein known as the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT). This heterodimeric complex interacts with dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) within the genome and up-regulates the transcription of a battery of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs). These regulated XMEs include the cytochrome P450sCyp1a1, Cyp1b1, and Cyp1a2 and the phase II enzymes Gst-a1 and Ugt1–06 (reviewed in Refs. 2Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).In addition to regulating an adaptive metabolic response, the AHR also mediates toxic responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and plays an important role in normal development. Early genetic and pharmacological experiments provided evidence that the AHR mediates toxic responses to TCDD and related pollutants (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Highly reproducible toxic endpoints in rodent species include thymic involution, hepatomegaly, epithelial hyperplasia, and teratogenesis. More recently, generation of null alleles at the Ahr locus in mice revealed that the AHR also plays an important role in normal mammalian development (6Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Applied Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt J.V. Su G.H.-T. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Across laboratories, the most reproducible phenotype associated with the homozygous null allele is a smaller liver. We have proposed that smaller liver size is the result of the persistence of a fetal vascular structure known as the ductus venosus (DV) (10Lahvis G. Lindell S. Thomas R. McCuskey R. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that smaller liver size is due to hepatocyte atrophy, resulting from partial shunting of portal blood flow directly to the vena cava. Importantly, the mechanistic role of AHR in the persistence of the DV as well as the appearance of other vascular aberrations is unknown.Our laboratory is interested in determining if the adaptive, toxic, and developmental pathways of AHR differ in any mechanistic aspect. In particular, we are interested in understanding whether cytosolic events, nuclear events, or DRE-mediated transcription play a role in TCDD-induced toxicity or in the establishment of a normal liver size. Although it may be assumed that all actions of AHR are dependent upon DRE-mediated transcription, a considerable body of evidence has been reported to the contrary. In this regard, signal transduction through cellular factors such as the cSrc kinase, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), ceramide, steroid receptors, NF-κB, and HIF1α has been reported to be modulated by AHR agonists in a manner that is independent of AHR DRE binding and transcriptional activation roles (11Enan E.

By examining the responses of these mutant animals to TCDD and through a comparison with other Ahralleles, we are able to define the relative importance of cytosolicversus nuclear events in various aspects of AHR biology.DISCUSSIONPrevious cell culture and in vitro analyses of AHR signaling have provided a detailed picture of the mechanism by which the ligand-activated AHR up-regulates the expression of certain XMEs through receptor-DRE interactions within the nucleus (44Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). However, this understanding of the DRE-linked transcriptional targets of AHR has not yet explained the variety of toxic events that occur in response to potent agonists like TCDD; nor have they been used to explain the aberrant liver/vascular development observed inAhr−/− mice. Although it may be simple to assume that these receptor dependent processes are related to DRE-driven transcription, several reports have suggested that the AHR may signal through DRE-independent pathways (11Enan E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, we are still in need of a formal proof to demonstrate that the mechanism by which XMEs are up-regulated is similar to the mechanism by which the AHR plays a role in TCDD toxicity or regulates aspects of mammalian development.In an effort to better understand the importance of DRE-independent signaling, we are constructing mutant mouse models that directly test the roles of receptor functional domains on various aspects of AHR biology in vivo. The AHRnls mouse was designed specifically to examine the role that cytosolic events play in TCDD-induced toxicity and AHR-dependent liver development. In this endeavor, we chose to first generate animals with an AHR protein that can be activated by ligand but that is not capable of translocating to the nucleus or binding to DREs. The rationale for such a model is that it can be used to identify AHR-mediated end points that do not require nuclear localization of the AHR. Put another way, with this model we may be able to identify cytosolic signaling pathways related to AHR biology, or we can provide evidence to refute their existence.Generation of this mouse model required consideration of the overlapping domain structure of the basic α-helix of AHR within the bHLH domain. This basic region encodes the nuclear localization motif that is revealed upon ligand binding, and it harbors the DRE contact residues by which the AHR interacts with its DNA half-site within these enhancers (20Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In early characterization studies, we demonstrated that the NLS mutation resulted in an AHR protein that interacts normally with chaperones but that could not translocate to the nucleus or bind to DREs upon exposure to agonists. To this end, we used immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the mutant protein remained cytosolic in the presence of an agonist. We then also used a battery of in vitro assays to demonstrate that the mutant protein was capable of interactions with its chaperones HSP90 and ARA9 (Figs. 1 and 2). Once the predicted consequences of our mutations were confirmed, we used homologous recombination in ES cells to replace the endogenous bHLH region of the Ahr locus (exon 2) with a mutated exon carrying the NLS amino acid substitutions.There are two major points regarding controls that arose during the course of these experiments. The first relates to genetic background. Because embryonic stem cells are derived from 129Sv mice that carry the d allele of Ahr, we utilized the C57BL/6-Ahrd animals for backcrossing and to generate control animals for these experiments. Mice harboring the wild-type d allele are not used as frequently as those strains harboring the more common b alleles due to the fact that the d allele encodes a receptor with a lower binding affinity for TCDD (49Okey A.B. Vella L.M. Harper P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this lower binding affinity exhibited by the d allele has been shown to be similar to the human AHR and thus may serve as a more relevant model for human toxicity (47Ema M. Ohe N. Suzuki M. Mimura J. Sogawa K. Ikawa I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27337-27343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major influence this parental allele had on our experimental design was that it necessitated the development of dosing protocols that would induce toxic end points in mice harboring this lower affinity receptor. Thus, it will be noted that the doses of TCDD used in these studies are about 5–10-fold higher than are commonly used in most mouse studies.The second point relevant to control animals is that although the AHR from the d allele and the nls allele display similar affinities for ligand, the nls allele is expressed at a lower level (Fig. 4). Our photoaffinity labeling of the AHR found in the livers ofAhrnls/nls mice indicated that the mutant protein was expressed at a level that was approximately one-half of that observed in Ahr+/+ mice. Fortunately, AHR expression in wild-type animals appears to be a direct function of gene copy number. 2M. K. Bunger, S. M. Moran, E. Glover, T. L. Thomae, G. P. Lahvis, B. C. Lin, and C. A. Bradfield, unpublished observation. Therefore, mice that were heterozygous for the d allele and the null allele served as controls (i.e. Ahr+/−).To determine whether nuclear events were required for the role of AHR in TCDD toxicity or normal liver development, we performed a number of toxicology experiments with theAhrnls/nls mice. First, we examined the toxic response of theAhrnls/nls mice by injecting the animals with TCDD and assaying for liver hypertrophy and thymic involution. We found that Ahrnls/nlsmice failed to exhibit these obvious liver and thymic end points, whereas the corresponding Ahr+/+ andAhr+/− controls were quite sensitive (Fig. 5,A and B). We also examined a TCDD-induced teratogenic response, namely the formation of cleft palate. To this end, we exposed embryonic day 12.5 palatal shelves directly to TCDD in culture. This protocol directly exposes palate tissue in culture to TCDD and eliminates issues related to maternal influence. Just like the hepatic and thymic responses, we observed that the palates fromAhrnls/nls animals were completely resistant to TCDD exposure, whereas the corresponding controls were sensitive (Table I). From these results, we conclude that nuclear localization is required for TCDD-induced liver hypertrophy, thymic atrophy, and cleft palate formation.We also assessed the role of cytosolic events in the developmental aspects of AHR biology. In this regard, all of the known developmental defects we have previously observed in Ahr−/−mice are also observed in theAhrnls/nls mice. To this point, theAhrnls/nls mice display a similar reduction in relative liver weight and moderate increases in heart and spleen weights. In more recent experiments, we have also observed that the livers of Ahrnls/nls display microvesicular fatty changes around day 6 after birth (7Schmidt J.V. Su G.H.-T. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Just as in the null allele these fatty changes resolve by adulthood (data not shown). Finally, the presence of a patent DV was observed in both theAhrnls/nls mice and in theAhr−/− mice (Fig. 6). Just as in the toxicology experiments described above, we are led to conclude that the nuclear localization of the AHR is an essential step in the receptor pathways that regulate liver development/DV closure.The Ahrnls/nls mice provided us with a model system to test the importance of cytosolic interactions in certain aspects of AHR biology. Given that it would be impossible to test each proposed model in our system (i.e. cSrc, ceramide, etc.), our strategy was to carry out experiments that would examine the relative importance of cytosolic versus nuclear signaling with regard to a few classic receptor-mediated end points (i.e. liver hypertrophy, thymic involution, cleft palate formation, and persistence of the DV). Although our results are not supportive of a role for cytosolic events for these end points, it is still possible that cytosolic signaling by the AHR is important in end points not examined here (e.g. chloracne, altered T-cell responses, etc.). It is also important to point out that we cannot rule out the possibility that cytosolic signaling does occur and that it is dependent upon the exact identity of residues Arg37, His38, and Arg39. In an effort to address such possibilities, we plan to make this mutant available to any laboratory interested in formally examining the influence of the nls allele on any proposed cytosolic mechanism. Finally, given that the NLS mutation eliminates nuclear localization, it remains possible that nuclear, yet non-DRE binding events are important in AHR biology. Nuclear events such as cross-talk with the hypoxia-inducible factor and interactions with steroid receptors are still potentially important mechanisms of TCDD action or AHR-mediated developmental signaling. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)1 regulates an adaptive metabolic response to a variety of planar aromatic chemicals that are widely dispersed in the environment. Over the last 20 years, the mechanistic details of this adaptive signaling pathway have been well characterized (1Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 2Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 3Schmidt J.V.

Upon binding agonists, the AHR translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with another bHLH-PAS protein known as the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT). This heterodimeric complex interacts with dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) within the genome and up-regulates the transcription of a battery of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs). These regulated XMEs include the cytochrome P450sCyp1a1, Cyp1b1, and Cyp1a2 and the phase II enzymes Gst-a1 and Ugt1–06 (reviewed in Refs. 2Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In addition to regulating an adaptive metabolic response, the AHR also mediates toxic responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and plays an important role in normal development. Early genetic and pharmacological experiments provided evidence that the AHR mediates toxic responses to TCDD and related pollutants (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Highly reproducible toxic endpoints in rodent species include thymic involution, hepatomegaly, epithelial hyperplasia, and teratogenesis. More recently, generation of null alleles at the Ahr locus in mice revealed that the AHR also plays an important role in normal mammalian development (6Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M.

In this regard, signal transduction through cellular factors such as the cSrc kinase, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), ceramide, steroid receptors, NF-κB, and HIF1α has been reported to be modulated by AHR agonists in a manner that is independent of AHR DRE binding and transcriptional activation roles (11Enan E.

In an effort to formally examine the possibility that aspects of AHR biology are mediated through cytosolic events that do not require the AHR to translocate to the nuclear compartment, we undertook the approach of using gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate a novel allele at Ahr that harbors a mutation that blocks both nuclear localization and DRE binding (designated asAhrnls). By examining the responses of these mutant animals to TCDD and through a comparison with other Ahralleles, we are able to define the relative importance of cytosolicversus nuclear events in various aspects of AHR biology. DISCUSSIONPrevious cell culture and in vitro analyses of AHR signaling have provided a detailed picture of the mechanism by which the ligand-activated AHR up-regulates the expression of certain XMEs through receptor-DRE interactions within the nucleus (44Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). However, this understanding of the DRE-linked transcriptional targets of AHR has not yet explained the variety of toxic events that occur in response to potent agonists like TCDD; nor have they been used to explain the aberrant liver/vascular development observed inAhr−/− mice. Although it may be simple to assume that these receptor dependent processes are related to DRE-driven transcription, several reports have suggested that the AHR may signal through DRE-independent pathways (11Enan E.

Thus, we are still in need of a formal proof to demonstrate that the mechanism by which XMEs are up-regulated is similar to the mechanism by which the AHR plays a role in TCDD toxicity or regulates aspects of mammalian development.In an effort to better understand the importance of DRE-independent signaling, we are constructing mutant mouse models that directly test the roles of receptor functional domains on various aspects of AHR biology in vivo. The AHRnls mouse was designed specifically to examine the role that cytosolic events play in TCDD-induced toxicity and AHR-dependent liver development. In this endeavor, we chose to first generate animals with an AHR protein that can be activated by ligand but that is not capable of translocating to the nucleus or binding to DREs. The rationale for such a model is that it can be used to identify AHR-mediated end points that do not require nuclear localization of the AHR. Put another way, with this model we may be able to identify cytosolic signaling pathways related to AHR biology, or we can provide evidence to refute their existence.Generation of this mouse model required consideration of the overlapping domain structure of the basic α-helix of AHR within the bHLH domain. This basic region encodes the nuclear localization motif that is revealed upon ligand binding, and it harbors the DRE contact residues by which the AHR interacts with its DNA half-site within these enhancers (20Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In early characterization studies, we demonstrated that the NLS mutation resulted in an AHR protein that interacts normally with chaperones but that could not translocate to the nucleus or bind to DREs upon exposure to agonists. To this end, we used immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the mutant protein remained cytosolic in the presence of an agonist. We then also used a battery of in vitro assays to demonstrate that the mutant protein was capable of interactions with its chaperones HSP90 and ARA9 (Figs. 1 and 2). Once the predicted consequences of our mutations were confirmed, we used homologous recombination in ES cells to replace the endogenous bHLH region of the Ahr locus (exon 2) with a mutated exon carrying the NLS amino acid substitutions.There are two major points regarding controls that arose during the course of these experiments. The first relates to genetic background. Because embryonic stem cells are derived from 129Sv mice that carry the d allele of Ahr, we utilized the C57BL/6-Ahrd animals for backcrossing and to generate control animals for these experiments. Mice harboring the wild-type d allele are not used as frequently as those strains harboring the more common b alleles due to the fact that the d allele encodes a receptor with a lower binding affinity for TCDD (49Okey A.B. Vella L.M. Harper P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this lower binding affinity exhibited by the d allele has been shown to be similar to the human AHR and thus may serve as a more relevant model for human toxicity (47Ema M. Ohe N. Suzuki M. Mimura J. Sogawa K. Ikawa I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27337-27343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major influence this parental allele had on our experimental design was that it necessitated the development of dosing protocols that would induce toxic end points in mice harboring this lower affinity receptor. Thus, it will be noted that the doses of TCDD used in these studies are about 5–10-fold higher than are commonly used in most mouse studies.The second point relevant to control animals is that although the AHR from the d allele and the nls allele display similar affinities for ligand, the nls allele is expressed at a lower level (Fig. 4). Our photoaffinity labeling of the AHR found in the livers ofAhrnls/nls mice indicated that the mutant protein was expressed at a level that was approximately one-half of that observed in Ahr+/+ mice. Fortunately, AHR expression in wild-type animals appears to be a direct function of gene copy number. 2M. K. Bunger, S. M. Moran, E. Glover, T. L. Thomae, G. P. Lahvis, B. C. Lin, and C. A. Bradfield, unpublished observation. Therefore, mice that were heterozygous for the d allele and the null allele served as controls (i.e. Ahr+/−).To determine whether nuclear events were required for the role of AHR in TCDD toxicity or normal liver development, we performed a number of toxicology experiments with theAhrnls/nls mice. First, we examined the toxic response of theAhrnls/nls mice by injecting the animals with TCDD and assaying for liver hypertrophy and thymic involution. We found that Ahrnls/nlsmice failed to exhibit these obvious liver and thymic end points, whereas the corresponding Ahr+/+ andAhr+/− controls were quite sensitive (Fig. 5,A and B). We also examined a TCDD-induced teratogenic response, namely the formation of cleft palate. To this end, we exposed embryonic day 12.5 palatal shelves directly to TCDD in culture. This protocol directly exposes palate tissue in culture to TCDD and eliminates issues related to maternal influence. Just like the hepatic and thymic responses, we observed that the palates fromAhrnls/nls animals were completely resistant to TCDD exposure, whereas the corresponding controls were sensitive (Table I). From these results, we conclude that nuclear localization is required for TCDD-induced liver hypertrophy, thymic atrophy, and cleft palate formation.We also assessed the role of cytosolic events in the developmental aspects of AHR biology. In this regard, all of the known developmental defects we have previously observed in Ahr−/−mice are also observed in theAhrnls/nls mice. To this point, theAhrnls/nls mice display a similar reduction in relative liver weight and moderate increases in heart and spleen weights. In more recent experiments, we have also observed that the livers of Ahrnls/nls display microvesicular fatty changes around day 6 after birth (7Schmidt J.V. Su G.H.-T. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Just as in the null allele these fatty changes resolve by adulthood (data not shown). Finally, the presence of a patent DV was observed in both theAhrnls/nls mice and in theAhr−/− mice (Fig. 6). Just as in the toxicology experiments described above, we are led to conclude that the nuclear localization of the AHR is an essential step in the receptor pathways that regulate liver development/DV closure.The Ahrnls/nls mice provided us with a model system to test the importance of cytosolic interactions in certain aspects of AHR biology. Given that it would be impossible to test each proposed model in our system (i.e. cSrc, ceramide, etc.), our strategy was to carry out experiments that would examine the relative importance of cytosolic versus nuclear signaling with regard to a few classic receptor-mediated end points (i.e. liver hypertrophy, thymic involution, cleft palate formation, and persistence of the DV). Although our results are not supportive of a role for cytosolic events for these end points, it is still possible that cytosolic signaling by the AHR is important in end points not examined here (e.g. chloracne, altered T-cell responses, etc.). It is also important to point out that we cannot rule out the possibility that cytosolic signaling does occur and that it is dependent upon the exact identity of residues Arg37, His38, and Arg39. In an effort to address such possibilities, we plan to make this mutant available to any laboratory interested in formally examining the influence of the nls allele on any proposed cytosolic mechanism. Finally, given that the NLS mutation eliminates nuclear localization, it remains possible that nuclear, yet non-DRE binding events are important in AHR biology. Nuclear events such as cross-talk with the hypoxia-inducible factor and interactions with steroid receptors are still potentially important mechanisms of TCDD action or AHR-mediated developmental signaling. Previous cell culture and in vitro analyses of AHR signaling have provided a detailed picture of the mechanism by which the ligand-activated AHR up-regulates the expression of certain XMEs through receptor-DRE interactions within the nucleus (44Whitlock Jr., J.P.

In the intestine, MGAT plays a major role in the absorption of dietary fat by catalyzing the resynthesis of triacylglycerol in enterocytes. This resynthesis is required for the assembly of lipoproteins that transport absorbed fat to other tissues. Despite intense efforts, a gene encoding an intestinal MGAT has not been found. Previously, we identified a gene encoding MGAT1, which in mice is expressed in the stomach, kidney, adipose tissue, and liver but not in the intestine. We now report the identification of homologous genes in humans and mice encoding MGAT2. Expression of the MGAT2 cDNA in either insect or mammalian cells markedly increased MGAT activity in cell membranes. MGAT activity was proportional to the level of MGAT2 protein expressed, and the amount of diacylglycerol produced depended on the concentration of MGAT substrates (fatty acyl CoA or monoacylglycerol). In humans, the MGAT2 gene is highly expressed in the small intestine, liver, stomach, kidney, colon, and white adipose tissue; in mice, it is expressed predominantly in the small intestine.

The absorption of triacylglycerol requires its hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen and resynthesis in enterocytes (Fig.1) (1Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in the intestinal lumen is catalyzed mainly by pancreatic lipase, which because of its preference for ester bonds at sn-1 andsn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone, generates fatty acids and sn-2-monoacylglycerols (2Brockerhoff H. Jensen R.G. Lipolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1974: 25-175Crossref Google Scholar). These hydrolysis products are taken up by enterocytes and are resynthesized into triacylglycerols, which are incorporated into chylomicrons for secretion and transport to other tissues (3Kuksis A. Lehner R. Mansbach II, C.M. Tso P. Kuksis A. Intestinal Lipid Metabolism. Kluwer, New York2001: 185-214Crossref Google Scholar). The resynthesis step is mediated mainly by the monoacylglycerol pathway, which accounts for ∼75% of triacylglycerol synthesis in the small intestine after a meal (4Johnston J.M. Rommel K. Goebell H. Bohmer R. Lipid Absorption: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects. MTP Press, Lancaster, UK1976: 85-94Google Scholar, 5Kayden H.J. Senior J.R. Mattson F.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46 (1703): 1965Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT)1 (E.C. 2.3.1.22), an enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes a reaction in which the fatty acyl moiety of a fatty acyl CoA is joined to monoacylglycerol (6Johnston J.M.

Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The role of MGAT1 in tissues other than the intestine is unknown but may relate to the preservation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissues where cycles of triacylglycerol degradation and resynthesis are prominent (10Mostafa N.

Human MGAT2 (hMGAT2) and mouse MGAT2 (mMGAT2) cDNA sequences were deduced from genomic sequences of sequencing databases (workbench.sdsc.edu) through their homology toMortierella rammaniana DGAT2 (GenBank accession numberAF391089) and deposited in GenBank (GenBank accession numbers AY157608and AY157609, respectively). The cDNA sequence of a truncated form of hMGAT2 (hMGAT2trunc; GenBank accession number NM_025098) was identified by BLAST data base searches. Primers were designed to amplify by PCR (Takara Ex Taq, Panvera, Madison, WI) the complete coding sequences of hMGAT2, hMGAT2trunc, and mMGAT2 from human intestine, human stomach, and mouse intestine cDNAs, respectively. Human cDNAs were purchased from Clontech. Mouse cDNAs were amplified from RNA pooled from the small intestines of three male C57BL/6J mice. hMGAT2 and hMGAT2trunc cDNAs were tagged with an N-terminal FLAG epitope (MGDYKDDDDG, epitope underlined) and expressed in Sf9 insect cells as described (12Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Nontagged versions of hMGAT2, hMGAT2trunc, and mMGAT2 cDNAs were also expressed. FLAG-tagged cDNAs for MGAT1 (GenBank accession numberAF384162) and DGAT2 (GenBank accession number AF384160) were expressed as controls. Typically, cells were infected with viruses for 3 days, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and homogenized by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Total membrane fractions (100,000 × g pellet) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, resuspended in homogenization buffer, and frozen at −80 °C until used. To assess protein expression, aliquots of membrane protein (2 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an antiserum against MGAT1 (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an antiserum against the C terminus (amino acids 265–284) of hMGAT2trunc, an antiserum against the C terminus (amino acids 314–332) of hMGAT2, an antiserum against DGAT2 (9Yen C.-L.E.

To determine the acyl acceptors for the potential acyltransferase activities, membrane proteins were assayed for 5 min in a final volume of 200 μl using [14C]oleoyl CoA (specific activity, ≅20,000 dpm/nmol) as an acyl donor. Each reaction contained 100 μg of membrane proteins, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 μm acyl donor, and 200 μm acyl acceptor. Nonpolar acyl acceptors (diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and cholesterol) were dispersed by sonication as phosphatidylcholine liposomes (molar ratio ≈0.2), and polar acyl acceptors (glycerol-3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine) were dissolved in water. Reactions were started by adding protein samples and terminated by adding 4 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Extracted lipids were dried, separated by TLC with hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v), visualized with iodine vapor, and identified with lipid standards. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film or scraped to assess the incorporation of radioactivity into lipid products. MGAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of the [14C]oleoyl moiety into diacylglycerol with 50 μm [14C]oleoyl CoA (specific activity, ≅20,000 dpm/nmol) and 100 μm exogenously addedsn-2-monooleoylglycerol, as described (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In some assays, [3H]sn-2-monooleoylglycerol or [14C]rac-1-monooleoylglycerol (specific activity, 18 μCi/μmol; final concentration, 100 μm; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was used with unlabeled oleoyl CoA (50 μm). To determine the dependence of MGAT2 activity on monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates, MGAT2 was assayed with various concentrations of oleoyl CoA or monooleoylglycerol in the presence of 100 μm[3H]sn-2-monooleoylglycerol or 50 μm [14C]oleoyl CoA, respectively. Stereoisomers of monoacylglycerol (rac-1- andsn-2-monooleoylglycerol) and fatty acyl CoAs (butyryl CoA (4:0), n-octanoyl CoA (8:0), lauroyl CoA (12:0), myristoyl CoA (14:0), palmitoyl CoA (16:0), stearoyl CoA (18:0), arachidoyl CoA (20:0), oleoyl CoA (18:1), linoleoyl CoA (18:2), and arachidonoyl CoA (20:4)) were from Sigma. rac-1-monoacylglycerols (monocaprin (10:0), monolaurin (12:0), monomyristin (14:0), monopalmitin (16:0), monostearin (18:0), monoarachidin (20:0), monoolein (18:1), monolinolein (18:2), monolinolenin (18:3), and monoarachidonin (20:4)) were from NuChek (Elysian, MN) and were dissolved in acetone as 2 mm stocks. For measurements of MGAT activity in human tissues, microsomes were purchased from Tissue Transformation Technology (Edison, NJ). The FLAG-tagged hMGAT2 was subcloned into pIRESneo2 vector (Clontech) and transfected into monkey kidney COS-7 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). cDNAs encoding LacZ, FLAG-tagged-MGAT1, and FLAG-tagged-DGAT1 (GenBank accession number AF078752) were expressed as controls. As described for insect cells, membrane fractions were prepared, and expression of FLAG-tagged proteins was verified by immunoblotting of membrane samples (20 μg) with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. MGAT activities in the membranes of transfected cells were assayed as described above. For immunocytochemistry, cells were grown and transfected on glass coverslips. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) for 2 min and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then incubated sequentially with 4 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h and with 10 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (CalBiochem) for 30 min. Antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Triton X-100. Human multiple tissue blots (Clontech) and a mouse multiple tissue blot (SeeGene, Seoul, Korea) were hybridized with 32P-labeled MGAT2 or MGAT1 cDNA probes. A probe specific to hMGAT2trunc was amplified by PCR from the intronic region that is present in the hMGAT2trunc cDNA but spliced out from the full-length hMGAT2 cDNA (see Fig. 2B). Blots were probed for actin expression to demonstrate the presence and integrity of RNA in different tissues. For quantitative real-time PCR, human cDNAs of were purchased from Clontech, except that of white adipose tissue, which was prepared from visceral fat of a surgical sample. Mouse cDNAs were prepared from adult male mice. Primers and probe sequences for hMGAT2 are: forward, 5′-GACCCCTCTCGGAACTACATTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGAACCACAAGGTCAGCAT-3′; and probe, 5′-CACCCCCATGGAGTCCTGGCAG-3′. Those for 18 S rRNA are: forward, 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′; reverse, 5′-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC-3′; and probe, 5′-CGCCCGTCGCTACTACCGATTGGT-3′. Real-time PCR was performed as described (13Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Ladha Z. Jensen D.R. Ferreira L.D. Pulawa L.K. McGuire J.G. Pitas R.E. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Genes encoding full-length human and mouse MGAT2 were originally identified as DGAT candidate (DC) genes (hDC5 and mDC5 in Ref. 12Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T.

Both open reading frames of hMGAT2 and mMGAT2 cDNA predict 334-amino acid proteins that share 81% amino acid identity and are both 52% identical to mMGAT1 (Fig.2A). The calculated molecular masses of hMGAT2 and mMGAT2 are 38.2 and 38.6 kDa, respectively. Like mMGAT1, both MGAT2s contain sequences similar to a domain of phosphate acyltransferases and two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (12Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity plots for both MGAT2s are similar to those for DGAT2 and MGAT1, which predict at least one transmembrane domain (amino acids 21–43) in the N terminus. The human MGAT2 gene is located on chromosome 11q13.5 (GenBank accession number NT_033927), and its mouse homologue is on chromosome 7 (GenBank accession number NW_000328). hMGAT2trunc, identified through a BLAST search, is a splice variant of the full-length human MGAT2 (hMGAT2). The mRNA encoding hMGAT2trunc (284 amino acids) shares all 6 coding exons with those of hMGAT2 (334 amino acids). However, an unspliced intron in hMGAT2trunc introduces 67 different amino acids at the C terminus and a premature stop codon that truncates the protein (Fig. 2B). To examine the biochemical activities of MGAT2 proteins, we expressed FLAG-tagged and nontagged versions of their cDNAs in insect cells. The FLAG-tagged versions of hMGAT2 and hMGAT2trunc migrated on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of ∼33 and ∼28 kDa, respectively (Fig.3A). Because MGAT2 shares sequence homology with MGAT1, we examined whether membranes expressing MGAT2 have MGAT activity. With either [14C]oleoyl CoA or [14C]monooleoylglycerol as the radiolabeled substrate, membranes expressing hMGAT2 or mMGAT2, but not hMGAT2trunc, incorporated more radioactivity into diacylglycerols than membranes expressing wild-type viral proteins (Fig. 3B), indicating that hMGAT2 and mMGAT2, but not hMGAT2trunc, have MGAT activity. The levels of MGAT activity were proportional to the amounts of membrane protein used in the assays (Fig. 3C). MGAT activity in membranes expressing hMGAT2 was further confirmed by its dependence on MGAT substrates; MGAT activity increased with the concentration of MGAT substrates (either fatty acyl CoA or monoacylglycerol) (Fig. 3D). For hMGAT2 expressed in insect cell membranes, the calculated Km forsn-1-monooleoylglycerol was ∼45 μm. When the concentration of oleoyl CoA was varied, the curve for hMGAT2 activity was sigmoidal, with an initial lag phase between 0.4 and 25 μm, suggesting cooperative kinetics. Although these kinetics prohibited analysis by a Lineweaver-Burk plot, the oleoyl CoA concentration that resulted in a half-maximal rate appeared to be in the range of 40–45 μm. The acyltransferase activity of hMGAT2 appeared to be specific for monoacylglycerol as the acyl group acceptor. No acyltransferase activity was found in hMGAT2-expressing membranes when glycerol-3-phosphate, lysophosphatidate, lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, or diacylglycerol was used as the [14C]oleoyl CoA acceptor (not shown). In MGAT assays, membranes expressing hMGAT2 incorporated slightly more radiolabeled substrates (either [14C]oleoyl CoA or [3H]monooleoylglycerol) into triacylglycerols than membranes expressing wild-type viral proteins, especially when fatty acyl CoA was provided at high concentrations (>50 μm; not shown). This suggested that hMGAT2 possesses a minor DGAT activity. However, because the DGAT activity decreased (whereas MGAT activity increased) as the viral infection progressed (not shown), the DGAT activity may reflect the endogenous DGAT in insect cell membranes that incorporates radiolabeled diacylglycerol (generated by MGAT2) into triacylglycerol. We also expressed hMGAT2 and control cDNAs transiently in COS-7 cells (Fig.4A). FLAG-tagged hMGAT2 demonstrated a perinuclear and reticular staining pattern (Fig.4B), suggesting a cellular distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum and possibly a minor portion in other organelles such as the Golgi apparatus. When assayed with [14C]oleoyl CoA andsn-2-monooleoylglycerol as substrates, COS-7 cell membranes expressing hMGAT2 incorporated significant amounts of radioactivity into diacylglycerol (Fig. 4C), indicating that these membranes possessed MGAT activity. In contrast, MGAT activity was not detected in control membranes, except in those expressing DGAT1, which appeared to possess a low level of MGAT activity, as reported (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether hMGAT2 could acylate different stereoisomers of monoacylglycerol. In assays using [14C]oleoyl CoA as the acyl donor and eitherrac-1-monooleoylglycerol orsn-2-monooleoylglycerol as the acyl acceptor, hMGAT2, like mMGAT1, had activity with both monoacyglycerol stereoisomers, and both enzymes appeared to prefer the sn-2-isomer (Fig.5A). We then determined whether hMGAT2 utilizes different monoacylglycerols as substrates. In assays using [14C]oleoyl CoA as the acyl donor, both hMGAT2 and mMGAT1 utilized a variety of monoacylglycerols, and their activities were lowest with monoacylglycerols containing long chain saturated fatty acids (Fig. 5B). We also determined whether hMGAT2 preferred specific fatty acyl CoAs as substrates. In assays using [3H]sn-2-monooleoylglycerol as the acyl acceptor, hMGAT2 utilized a variety of fatty acyl CoAs, and MGAT activities were lowest with CoA derivatives containing long chain saturated fatty acids (Fig. 5C). In human tissues, MGAT2 was highly expressed in the liver, small intestine, colon, stomach, and kidney, whereas MGAT1 was expressed in the liver and kidney (Fig.6A). In mice, MGAT2 was expressed exclusively in the small intestine (among 13 tissues examined), whereas MGAT1 mRNA expression was highest in the stomach and kidney (Fig. 6B). The hMGAT2 probe hybridized primarily with two human mRNA transcripts of ∼3.0 and ∼7.2 kb, whereas the mMGAT2 probe hybridized with an ∼1.8-kb transcript. The hMGAT2 probe also hybridized with a third transcript of 1.3 kb in several tissues, including the stomach (Fig. 6A). In an independent set of cDNA samples, quantitative real-time PCR showed that hMGAT2 expression levels were highest in liver, stomach, and small intestine, with lower levels in colon and kidney. Low MGAT2 expression levels were also found in both human and mouse white adipose tissue (not shown). The size and tissue distribution of the hMGAT2trunctranscript was assessed by probing with the intron that is spliced from hMGAT2 but retained in hMGAT2trunc (Fig. 2B). This probe hybridized mainly with the minor 1.3-kb mRNA transcript in the stomach (Fig. 6C); lower expression levels of this transcript were also found in the colon and small intestine (not shown). We next measured MGAT activity in membranes from various human tissues. As reported in other species (15Grigor M.R. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman A.G. Kuksis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), high MGAT activity levels were found in human small intestine (Fig. 6D). However, significant levels of MGAT activity were also detected in human liver, with lower levels in kidney and lung. Despite the crucial role that MGAT is hypothesized to play in the absorption of dietary fat in the intestine, a gene encoding an intestinal MGAT had not been found. In this study, we identified a gene encoding MGAT2, an MGAT that is highly expressed in the small intestine, liver, stomach, and colon in humans and predominantly in the small intestine in mice. MGAT2 is a homologue of MGAT1, which is not expressed in the small intestine. The full-length human and mouse MGAT2 cDNAs clearly encode MGAT enzymes. Expression of either cDNA in insect cell membranes catalyzed diacylglycerol synthesis with either [14C]monoacylglycerol or [14C]oleoyl CoA as a substrate. In addition, the human MGAT2 cDNA catalyzed diacylglycerol synthesis when expressed in membranes of COS-7 cells. MGAT2 expression in insect cells increased diacylglycerol accumulation, and this increase depended on the amount of expressed protein in the assay. Additionally, MGAT activity of human MGAT2 expressed in insect cells depended on the concentration of either MGAT substrate. Finally, the MGAT2 activity was specific for diacylglycerol synthesis because MGAT2 utilized only monoacylglycerol as a fatty acyl group acceptor. Although MGAT2 did not acylate sn-1,2 diacylglycerol inin vitro assays, our results do not exclude the possibility that MGAT2 may also possess a weak DGAT activity. The biochemical properties of MGAT2 share features with those reported for MGAT enzymes in previous studies. MGAT activities in the small intestine and livers have been well characterized in many species (10Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Coleman R.A.

Kuksis A. Itabashi Y. Lipids. 1993; 28: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and MGAT enzymes have been partially purified from the rat small intestine and livers of suckling animals (18Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Bhat B.G. Bardes E.S.-G. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of hMGAT2 (∼38 kDa) in this study is similar to that reported for an MGAT that was purified from rat intestinal villi (18Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). (Of note, an MGAT2 homologue exists in rats (GenBank accession number XM_218952) that shares 93.3% amino acid identity with mMGAT2.) Additionally, the Km for monoacylglycerol (∼45 μm) we observed for hMGAT2 is consistent with previous observations for hepatic MGAT activities in different species (8Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grigor M.R. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Sansbury K. Millington D.S. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1251-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of monoacylglycerol normally found in cell membranes has been estimated to be much lower than this Km (11Xia T. Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R414-R419PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activity of this enzyme depends on increases in monoacylglycerol concentration in the adjacent membrane. Finally, the sigmoidal shape of the curve for hMGAT2 activities with different oleoyl CoA concentrations, which is indicative of an allosteric enzyme regulated by specific effectors or cooperative binding of substrate to multiple sites (10Mostafa N.

Biochem. 1972; 26: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), has been observed in other studies (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Coleman R.A. Lipids. 1994; 29: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar). The substrate specificities of hMGAT2 were similar to those of mMGAT1. When expressed in insect cell membranes, both enzymes preferredsn-2-monooleoylglycerol rather thanrac-1-monooleoylglycerol as the acyl acceptor. In addition, both enzymes were active with a broad range of monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA substrates. In assays with differentrac-1-monoacylglycerols as oleoyl CoA acceptors, both enzymes utilized a broad range of rac-1-monoacylglycerols, and the patterns of activity for monoacylglycerols containing different fatty acyl groups were similar. Both enzymes exhibited a drop in activity as the length of the saturated fatty acyl group increased from 16:0 to 20:0, suggesting that the enzymes are less active when the monoacylglycerol contains a long chain saturated fatty acyl group. In contrast, activities were higher with monoacylglycerols containing long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Likewise, when monooleoylglycerol was the acyl acceptor, MGAT1 and MGAT2 were similarly active for a broad range of fatty acyl CoA substrates. Both enzymes appeared to prefer unsaturated rather than saturated long chain fatty acyl CoAs. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MGAT enzymes preserve unsaturated fatty acids, such as essential fatty acids, by preferentially incorporating them into triacylglycerol for storage (10Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Coleman R.A. Lipids. 1994; 29: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,11Xia T. Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R414-R419PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, these findings may reflect limitations in our expression and assay systems. For example, only one concentration of substrates was tested in these assays. A more detailed kinetic analysis will be required before definitive conclusions concerning the substrate specificity of MGAT2 can be made. In both humans and mice, MGAT2 was highly expressed in the small intestine, identifying it as an intestinal MGAT. In mice, MGAT2 was expressed predominantly in the small intestine. In humans, however, MGAT2 was also expressed in other tissues, including stomach, colon, kidney, white adipose tissue, and adult liver. The hepatic activity was unexpected. In rats, MGAT activity has been detected in livers from suckling pups, but not at high levels in adults (8Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, MGAT activity has not been reported previously in adult human liver. Our studies demonstrate that MGAT activity is present in human liver and kidney, although at lower levels than in small intestine. A discrepancy exists between the MGAT2 mRNA expression levels and enzyme activity levels in human livers, possibly reflecting post-transcriptional regulation of the enzyme. Recently, Cao et al. (25Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar) reported a mouse intestinal MGAT that is identical to mMGAT2 in this study. Consistent with our findings, they found that MGAT2 was highly expressed in the mouse small intestine, with lower expression levels present in the white adipose tissue. However, they also reported expression of MGAT2 in mouse kidney, stomach, and liver. We did not find this and, in contrast, have reported that MGAT1 is expressed in these tissues in mice (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the collective data reported here and in other studies (9Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar) indicate that MGAT enzymes in both human and mouse are expressed mainly in small intestine, stomach, kidney, adipose tissue, and liver. The tissue distributions of MGAT1 and MGAT2 expression, however, differ between species. The functional significance of the hMGAT2trunc mRNA is unclear. This species, which appears to arise from nonsplicing of the fourth and fifth coding exons, was found only in humans. The incomplete splicing leads to a premature stop codon, and the truncated protein was not active in MGAT assays. It is unlikely that the hMGAT2trunc mRNA is an artifact of cDNA library preparation because a probe specific for this transcript detected hMGAT2trunc expression in tissues. Interestingly, the 1.3-kb hMGAT2trunc transcript was highly expressed in human stomach, suggesting that hMGAT2trunc has functional significance in this tissue. Speculations for its function include a regulatory role for the inactive truncated protein or a catalytic function that we did not examine. An additional possibility is that the hMGAT2trunc mRNA produces a functional message after a regulated terminal splicing event. In summary, we have identified and characterized a gene encoding an intestinal MGAT. Since MGAT functions intracellularly in enterocytes, the inhibition of an intestinal MGAT offers the possibility of blocking fat absorption without resulting in the accumulation of fat in the intestinal lumen, which leads to steatorrhea. The discovery of the MGAT2 gene will facilitate studies to examine whether MGAT2 plays a role in fat absorption in the small intestine and to determine whether MGAT2 is a feasible pharmaceutical target for blocking intestinal fat absorption and treating obesity.

Stimulation studies with human basophils using SmEA fractions and natural and recombinant IPSE as well as neutralization and immunodepletion studies using antibodies to recombinant IPSE demonstrate that IPSE is the bioactive principle in SmEA leading to activation of basophils and to expression of IL-4 and IL-13. Regarding the mechanism of action, blot analysis showed that IPSE is an IgE-binding factor, suggesting that it becomes effective via cross-linking receptor-bound IgE on basophils. Immunohistology revealed that IPSE is enriched in and secreted from the subshell area of the schistosome egg. We conclude from these data that IPSE may be an important parasite-derived component for skewing the immune response toward Th2. The eggs of the parasitic trematodeSchistosoma mansoni are powerful inducers of a T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response and immunoglobulin E (IgE) production.S. mansoni egg extract (SmEA) stimulates human basophils to rapidly release large amounts of interleukin (IL)-4, the key promoter of a Th2 response.

The definition of parasite-derived products capable of skewing the immune response toward Th2 would not only enhance our understanding of the defense mechanisms involved in helminth infections but may also lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of immediate-type hypersensitivity diseases such as asthma. However, in contrast to our increasing understanding of how pathogen-derived products can initiate Th1-type immune responses, there is so far little detailed knowledge about the nature of the parasite-derived molecule(s) and the underlying mechanisms that trigger and/or amplify a Th2-type reaction. In S. mansoni infection, a critical role in inducing a polarized Th2 response is played by the egg stage of the parasite (1Pearce E.J. Caspar P. Grzych J.-M. Lewis F.A. Sher A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), since a Th2 response and IgE production are only observed after egg deposition or following injection of schistosome eggs (2Vella A.T. Pearce E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2283-2290PubMed Google Scholar) or extracts thereof (3Okano M. Nishizaki K. Abe M. Wang M.M. Yoshino T. Satoskar A.R. Masuda Y. Harn Jr., D.A. Allergy. 1999; 54: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) into naive animals. By contrast, the initial larval (schistosomula) and adult worm stages rather induce a response skewed to Th1. It is now firmly established, both in vivo and in vitro, that the cytokine profile present during an immune reaction is an important element in directing the response to Th1 or Th2 and that IL-4 is the key cytokine responsible for biasing the immune reaction toward a Th2 phenotype (4Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 5Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Davis M.M. Fazekas de St. Groth B. J. Exp.

Grosveld G. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In the human system, basophils are a prominent source of IL-4 and IL-13; these cells secrete large amounts of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to IgE-receptor cross-linking or activation by a combination of IL-3 and C5a (8Ochensberger B. Rihs S. Brunner T. Dahinden C.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4039-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eglite S. Pluss K. Dahinden C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2183-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, human basophils can be viewed as “innate Th2-type” effector cells, since IL-4 and IL-13 are expressed in a very restricted manner without production of any of the cytokines involved in Th1-type immune responses. We therefore wondered whether saline-soluble S. mansoni egg antigen extract (SmEA) can directly trigger human blood basophils to release IL-4, thus providing a potential mechanism for biasing the immune response to Th2 during the egg stage of S. mansoni infestation. Indeed, our previous studies showed that basophils from healthy nonsensitized donors from Northern Europe rapidly degranulate and release histamine, sulfidoleukotrienes, and considerable amounts of IL-4 as well as IL-13 in response to exposure to SmEA (10Falcone F.H. Dahinden C.A. Gibbs B.F. Noll T. Amon U. Hebestreit H. Abrahamsen O. Klaucke J. Schlaak M. Haas H. Eur. J.

Dahinden, unpublished data. SmEA thus obviously contains a basophil-degranulating IL-4-inducing principle, prompting us to further characterize this activity. Subsequent studies revealed that the active principle is an excretory/secretory glycoprotein interacting with IgE on basophils in an antigen-nonspecific way (11Haisch K. Schramm G. Falcone F.H. Alexander C. Schlaak M. Haas H. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we present the isolation, sequencing, and cloning of the bioactive product, which was named IL-4-inducing principle from S. mansoni eggs (IPSE). Finally, as unambiguous proof of the identity of the cloned S. mansoni product, we demonstrate that the recombinant protein has full biological activity. S. mansoni eggs were purified as previously described (12Doenhoff M.J. Pearson S. Dunne D.W. Bickle Q. Lucas S. Bain J. Musallam R. Hassounah O. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1981; 75: 41-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SmEA was prepared by the methods of Boros and Warren (13Boros D.L. Warren K.S. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 488-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and Carter and Colley (14Carter C.E. Colley D.G. J. Parasitol. 1978; 64: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Dr. F. Yousif (Schistosome Biological Supply Program, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Imbaba, Egypt). Human basophils were purified by a previously described three-step procedure (15Haisch K. Gibbs B.F. Korber H. Ernst M. Grage-Griebenow E. Schlaak M. Haas H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 226: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and used at a mean purity of 99%. Purified basophils were incubated in round-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37 °C in humidified air containing 6% CO2 at 106 basophils/ml in a final volume of 100 μl of culture medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum). Since IL-3 enhances Fcε RI-mediated (16Brunner T. Heusser C.H. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and SmEA-mediated (10Falcone F.H. Dahinden C.A. Gibbs B.F. Noll T. Amon U. Hebestreit H. Abrahamsen O. Klaucke J. Schlaak M. Haas H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) IL-4 production of basophils, all wells were supplemented with IL-3 except the wells to which ionomycin was added. The cells were incubated with various stimuli at the concentrations indicated. If not stated otherwise, the supernatants were collected after 18 h and stored at −20 °C until further investigation. Degranulation of basophils was assessed via cytospin preparation and May- Gruenwald staining. IL-4 and IL-13 levels in culture supernatants were determined using two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Eli-Pair; Diaclone, Besancon, France) essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sensitivities for IL-4 and IL-13 detection were 0.55 and 1.56 pg/ml, respectively. Histamine was determined using the methyl-histamine radioimmune assay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% T, 4% C) under reducing and nonreducing conditions according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For protein detection on the gels, silver staining was performed (18Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). For blotting analysis, separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) via semidry blotting (30 min, 0.8 mA/cm2) (19Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Free binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in 0.1 mTris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The membranes were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled Aleuria aurantia agglutinin (AAA; 1:5000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or with antibodies (at the concentrations indicated) in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Lectin and antibody binding was visualized by a substrate/chromogen mixture of 0.033% (w/v) nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.017% (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 9.5 (20Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). IPSE was purified by cation exchange and affinity chromatography. First, 2 mg of SmEA in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, were bound to a HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences). Elution of bound proteins was carried out using a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl. Effluent and eluate fractions were analyzed for their IL-4-inducing effect (applied volume: 5 μl/106 basophils) and (after speedvac concentration) for their protein banding pattern. The latter was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Fractions containing IPSE were pooled and concentrated, and for affinity chromatography, the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by using Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). For affinity chromatography, AAA (2 mg; Vector Laboratories) was coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose HiTrap columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After application of pooled IPSE-containing fractions and washing, bound material was eluted with 0.1 ml-fucose in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Fractions containing IPSE were pooled, concentrated by Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal filters, and stored at −80 °C. N-terminal sequencing of the first 20 aa of the purified IPSE was performed on an Procise 492 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at Chromatec Ltd. (Greifswald, Germany). mRNA was isolated from 1 × 106S. mansoni eggs using the μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 μg of mRNA were obtained and used for construction of a cDNA library in λ ZAP II by means of the Lambda ZAP II XR library construction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cDNA library of S. mansoni eggs had 70% inserts and a titer of 6 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml. The other SmE-library was constructed as previously described (21Oliveira G.C. Kemp W.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This library has been extensively used for the generation of egg stage expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (22Oliveira G.C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 108-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For screening of the cDNA libraries, a sequence-specific 30-mer oligonucleotide (for sequence, see Fig. 3) was labeled with Dig-ddUTP using the Dig oligonucleotide 3′-end labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). The labeled oligonucleotide was detected via an AP-conjugated anti-Dig antibody (1:5000; Roche Diagnostics). Plaque lifts and hybridization were performed as described by Sambrook and Russell (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C in 5× SSC, 1% (w/v) blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 0.1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% (w/v) SDS. Prior to detection of bound oligonucleotide, filters were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and twice for 15 min at 55 °C with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Positive phage clones were isolated, and the pBluescript SK plasmids containing the inserts were obtained by in vivo excision using the helper phage Exassist (Stratagene). Automated sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA was performed by cycle sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing ready Reaction Kit on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant IPSE was expressed as a His tag fusion protein (His-IPSE) in E. coli. cDNA coding for IPSE was subcloned into the pProEX HTb expression vector (Invitrogen) coding for 6 N-terminally located histidine residues and a cleavage site for TEV protease. For this purpose, PCR was performed with IPSE-specific primers containing an AT clamp and the following restriction sites (underlined): EheI for the sense primer (5′-ATATATGGCGCCGATTCATGCAAATATTGTC-3′) andHindIII for the antisense primer (5′-ATATATAAGCTTTCATCAGTTCATATGC-3′), respectively. Conditions for PCR were as follows: denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 44 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C (30 cycles). Subcloning and confirmation of DNA sequences followed standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). E. coli cultures containing the recombinant plasmid were grown at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.8, and then expression of His-IPSE was induced by 0.6 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. After incubation for an additional 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 25% sucrose. His-IPSE was recovered as insoluble inclusion bodies after breaking the cells by passaging them twice through a French press (at a gauge reading of 1000 p.s.i.) and subsequent centrifugation at 7000 × g. The insoluble fraction was washed once with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% deoxycholate and once with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and subsequently solubilized in 8m urea, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. His-IPSE was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using the Hampton Research FoldIT Screen (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA), optimal buffer conditions for refolding of the denatured His-IPSE were obtained. Briefly, purified His-IPSE was refolded by dialysis at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml against FoldIT buffer 3 (modified to pH 10.5) and subsequently against a physiological buffer such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Monoclonal antibodies and murine antiserum to His-IPSE were raised by Labsoft Diagnostics AG (Halle, Germany). To obtain monoclonal antibodies, aliquots containing 28 μg of His-IPSE emulsified in 100 μl of saline (154 mm) and 300 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant were intraperitoneally administered to 10-week-old female BALB/c mice. The intraperitoneal immunization was repeated after 9 weeks (28 μg of antigen with incomplete adjuvant). The third (after further 2 weeks) and the fourth injection (3 days thereafter) of IPSE (each 28 μg) were administered in saline (murine antiserum to IPSE was raised by a similar immunization protocol). One day after the last booster injection, the animals were killed and blood was taken for antiserum preparation. The fusion was performed according to a standard procedure using the mouse nonsecretory cell line P3X63Ag8.653 as fusion partner. Liver sections (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material) of mice infected with 150 S. mansoni cercariae 7 weeks previously were incubated overnight with the monoclonal anti-IPSE antibody 74 1G2 (undiluted culture supernatant) or (as negative controls) with murine IgG (100 μg/ml in PBS; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or PBS only. Subsequently, the sections were incubated for 1 h with AP-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:100; Dianova), followed by staining with Neufuchsin (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and hematoxylin (Merck). All steps were carried out according to routine protocols. Sequence data were analyzed with DNASIS software (Amersham Biosciences). The GenBankTM data base (NCBI) was searched for homologous sequences using the nucleotide and protein BLAST programs. Secondary structure predictions were performed online using the “Protein Predict server” available on the World Wide Web at maple.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein. The nucleotide sequence of IPSE was submitted to the GenBankTM data base and has been assigned GenBankTM accession number AY028436. The optimal pH for binding the IL-4-inducing activity to the cation exchange matrix (SP-Sepharose) was determined in pilot experiments (not shown). At pH 5.0, nearly all activity was retained by the matrix, whereas the majority of irrelevant proteins were found in the effluent. A linear salt gradient (0–1 m KCl) was employed for eluting the bound material. Under these conditions, the peak of the IL-4-inducing activity was found to elute within the eluate fractions representing only a minor proportion of the total protein (Fig.1, a and b). To assign the IL-4-inducing activity to a particular component, SDS-PAGE analysis and extended silver staining of speedvac-concentrated chromatographic fractions of SmEA were performed under nonreducing conditions, revealing a faint diffuse double band at 40 kDa that shifted to about 20 kDa under reducing conditions. The staining intensity of the 40-kDa double band correlated with the IL-4-inducing activity of the active fractions (not shown). Previous molecular mass determinations of the IL-4-inducing activity using electroelution of gel sections of SmEA separated by SDS-PAGE indicated a range between 31 and 66 kDa (11Haisch K. Schramm G. Falcone F.H. Alexander C. Schlaak M. Haas H. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), further suggesting that the 40-kDa double band or one of its components might represent the bioactive principle. Earlier investigations had indicated that the active principle is a protein because of its sensitivity to protease digestion (11Haisch K. Schramm G. Falcone F.H. Alexander C. Schlaak M. Haas H. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since schistosome extracts contain numerous glycosylated components (24Van Dam G.J. Circulating Gut-associated Antigens of Schistosoma mansoni: Biological, Immunological, and Molecular Aspects. CIP-Gegevens Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Den Haag, The Netherlands1995: 21-46Google Scholar), we asked whether the active principle is a glycoprotein and, thus, could be purified by lectin affinity chromatography. To address this point, pooled active fractions from cation exchange chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with a panel of nine labeled lectins with various glycan specificities. Indeed, two lectins bound to the 40-kDa double band (the putative active principle). One of them, AAA, seemed most suitable for affinity chromatography, since it reacted only with one additional irrelevant band of ∼30 kDa that appeared in the late active fractions and was also present in the adjacent inactive fractions (data not shown). To exclude this irrelevant band, only the early active fractions were pooled for further purification. On AAA affinity chromatography, the effluent fractions were inactive, whereas the fractions eluted with 0.1 mml-fucose contained IL-4-inducing activity (Fig. 2,a and b). SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 2c) or by blotting with labeled AAA (Fig.2d) revealed that the eluate fractions contained only the double band that correlated in its intensity with the IL-4-inducing activity of the respective fractions. The eluate fractions did not contain other components detectable by staining, indicating a high purity of the isolated material. Thus, the active principle is most likely a glycoprotein of ∼40 kDa containing α-linked fucose. Attempts to separate the two bands at 40 kDa were not successful. Nevertheless, N-terminal sequencing of the pooled eluate fractions from AAA-Sepharose revealed an unequivocal sequence with minimal background for the first 20 N-terminal aa, suggesting that the double band represents different posttranslational forms of the same protein. Two aa in positions 3 and 6 could not be identified due to a low signal consistent with the presence of cysteines, as later confirmed by sequencing the IPSE cDNA (Fig. 4). A similarity search did not reveal any sequences with significant homology in the public databases, with the exception of one EST (NCBI nucleotide data base, NCBI accession number AI820476) from an S. mansoni egg cDNA library, sharing an overall similarity of 81% with the N-terminal sequence and 100% identity for aa 7–16. To obtain the complete nucleotide sequence, two different S. mansoni egg cDNA libraries (SmE-library A and SmE-library B) were screened via plaque lift assay by hybridization. A nondegenerate 30-mer oligonucleotide spanning 10 homologous nucleotide triplets coding for aa 7–16 was chosen as a probe (Fig. 3). A total of 12 identical clones was isolated (six from each library). The complete sequence (Fig. 3) consisted of 489 nucleotides. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 405 nucleotides with a predicted coding capacity for 134 aa including a signal sequence of 20 aa. The mature protein of 114 aa had two putative N-glycosylation sites at aa 44 and 60, respectively, and seven cysteine residues. Importantly, all 20 aa of the predicted N terminus of the mature protein completely matched the aa sequence determined by N-terminal sequencing of the purified natural product. Upon screening the NCBI protein and nucleotide data banks, there was a sequence identity of 92% with the EST sequence mentioned above but no other significant similarities, indicating that related proteins have not yet been identified. The molecular mass of the active principle calculated from the sequence was 13.2 kDa, which is far below the apparent molecular mass of the unreduced purified double band at 40 kDa. To confirm that IPSE cDNA encoded the active principle, recombinant IPSE was expressed in E. coli as a His tag fusion protein. His-IPSE was recovered from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions in 8m urea and purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography. The protein was refolded by dialysis against the FoldIT buffer 3 (Hampton Research) adjusted to pH 10.5 and then against PBS. Refolding was performed at a low protein concentration (0.1 mg/ml), because higher concentrations led to severe protein losses due to precipitation. As assessed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, refolded His-IPSE formed dimers that could be reversed into monomers under reducing conditions (Fig.4a). When tested on human basophils, His-IPSE had a pronounced IL-4-inducing activity (Fig.4b) and was in this respect equivalent to its natural counterpart. The dose-response curve had its maximum at 24 ng/ml or 0.75 nm, respectively, and displayed a bell-shaped form that is similar to that of IgE-mediated basophil activation. The identity of the recombinant protein with natural IPSE was further proven by the following experiments. A mouse antiserum raised against His-IPSE was strongly reactive with both recombinant and natural IPSE but showed no cross-reactivity to other components of SmEA (Fig.5a). Moreover, when basophils were stimulated with SmEA or (data not shown) with His-IPSE, the addition of a murine antiserum against His-IPSE dose-dependently inhibited IL-4 production (Fig.5b). Finally, immunodepletion using the IgG fraction of murine anti-His-IPSE antiserum (10 μl) bound to protein G-Sepharose (4 Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences; 100 μl of gel slurry as obtained from the manufacturer) removed the IL-4-inducing capacity from SmEA (100 μg). In contrast, the IgG fraction of normal mouse serum as a control had no effect (data not shown). Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that the recombinant material corresponds to IPSE. SmEA leads to a general activation of basophils including degranulation and mediator release (10Falcone F.H. Dahinden C.A. Gibbs B.F. Noll T. Amon U. Hebestreit H. Abrahamsen O. Klaucke J. Schlaak M. Haas H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To study whether all of these bioactivities are due to IPSE, basophils were incubated with whole SmEA, pooled SmEA fractions, and recombinant His-IPSE in parallel (Fig. 6). Pools 1 and 2, corresponding to effluent and early eluate fractions, respectively, from cation exchange chromatography, were devoid of IPSE. Pool 3, corresponding to the late eluate fractions, contained IPSE at a purity of at least 70%. Degranulation was observed when basophils were treated with SmEA anti-IgE, pool 3, or recombinant IPSE but not following incubation with pool 1 or 2. Degranulated basophils often formed considerable cell clusters, obviously due to agglutination. With regard to mediator release, pool 3 and recombinant IPSE, like SmEA and anti-IgE, induced discharge of histamine, IL-4, and IL-13, whereas pools 1 and 2 did not have any effect. Note that the production of IL-13 was studied in the absence of IL-3 because the latter cytokine alone induces considerable production of IL-13. Together with the complete abrogation of SmEA-induced IL-4 induction through murine anti-His-IPSE antiserum (see above), these findings strongly indicate that IPSE is the only bioactive component in SmEA that activates basophils for degranulation, mediator release, and expression of immunoregulatory cytokines. Earlier studies had demonstrated that IgE has to be present on basophils for IPSE to become effective. To elucidate whether IPSE might act as an IgE-binding factor, blotting experiments were performed, where His-IPSE was submitted to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with various concentrations of human IgE. Subsequent incubation with AP-conjugated anti-human-IgE antibody revealed that IgE was dose-dependently bound by IPSE. Analogous results were obtained when solid-phase IgE was incubated with increasing amounts of His-IPSE (Fig. 7). Biacore experiments confirmed these findings. 3S. Blindow, T. Weimar, and G. Schramm, unpublished data. Thus, these results clearly indicate that IPSE is an IgE-binding factor. We had earlier observed that IL-4-inducing activity is released from live schistosome eggs kept overnight at 37 °C in culture medium (11Haisch K. Schramm G. Falcone F.H. Alexander C. Schlaak M. Haas H. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that IPSE is a secreted molecule. To further address this point, immunohistological localization of IPSE was performed in formalin-fixed liver sections of schistosome-infected mice using the monoclonal anti-His-IPSE antibody 74 1G2. This antibody stains the subshell area of schistosome eggs and binds to a variety of circumoval inflammatory cells both intracellularly and/or extracellularly. Interestingly, the subshell area stained strongest in eggs that were surrounded by relatively few inflammatory cells (developing granulomas?), with the cells themselves being not or minimally IPSE-positive. In contrast, the eggs stained weaker in large advanced granulomas, with many circumoval cells being strongly positive. This suggests that during granuloma development"

Spectral analyses of SRP and RNC association as a function of concentration allowed us to measure, at equilibrium, Kd values of 0.05–0.38 nm for SRP·RNC complexes with different signal sequences. Competitive binding experiments with nonfluorescent RNC species revealed that the nascent chain probe did not alter SRP affinity and that SRP has significant affinity for both nontranslating ribosomes (Kd = 71 nm) and RNCs that lack an exposed signal sequence (Kd = 8 nm). SRP can therefore distinguish between translating and nontranslating ribosomes. The very high signal sequence-dependent SRP·RNC affinity did not decrease as the nascent chain lengthened. Thus, the inhibition of SRP-dependent targeting of RNCs to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane observed with long nascent chains does not result from reduced SRP binding to the signal sequence, as widely thought, but rather from a subsequent step, presumably nascent chain interference of SRP·RNC association with the SRP receptor and/or translocon.

In mammalian cells, ribosomes are found both in the cytoplasm and at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 These two classes of ribosome differ in the nature of their translation products, with membrane-bound ribosomes synthesizing secretory or membrane proteins that are being translocated across or integrated into the ER membrane cotranslationally. The structural feature that distinguishes the cytoplasmic ribosomes from the membrane-bound ribosomes is the presence in the latter of a nascent chain that contains a signal sequence. When a nascent chain signal sequence emerges from the ribosome, it is recognized and bound by a ribonucleoprotein termed the signal recognition particle (SRP) (for review, see Ref. 1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The binding of SRP to the signal sequence-containing ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) temporarily prevents it from synthesizing protein. The resulting “elongation-arrested complex” then diffuses to the ER membrane where a GTP-dependent interaction with the SRP receptor initiates a series of events which includes the binding of the RNC to the site of cotranslational translocation and integration at the ER membrane (the translocon), the release of the signal sequence from the SRP, the release of SRP and the SRP receptor from the translocon, and the resumption of protein synthesis by the ribosome (for review, see Refs. 1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 3Wild K. Weichenrieder O. Strub K. Sinning I. Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After targeting is complete, nascent chain translocation or integration then proceeds at the translocon (for review, see Ref.4Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). SRP therefore has a critical regulatory role in the cell because it is responsible both for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized proteins and for the conversion of a cytoplasmic ribosome to a membrane-bound ribosome. In doing so, SRP functions in multiple ways to effect RNC targeting to the ER membrane, including the selection of appropriate RNCs, the regulation of RNC translation, and specific interactions with the SRP receptor and translocon at the membrane. Although much progress has been made, and models are abundant, the molecular mechanisms that accomplish each of these functions are still largely undefined experimentally. The necessity to discriminate accurately between ribosomes with and without signal sequences is especially interesting because there is no consensus for the sequences that can serve as signal sequences (5von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The signal sequence binding site on SRP is therefore promiscuous, yet it must simultaneously be exceptionally accurate to avoid improper trafficking of the nascent chains. These conflicting demands are most likely resolved thermodynamically by discrimination between satisfactory and unsatisfactory sequences which is based on the binding affinity between the SRP and the putative signal sequence. This model would predict that legitimate signal sequences in RNCs would bind much more tightly to SRP than would other nascent chain sequences. Soon after the discovery of SRP, Walter and colleagues (6Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) examined the binding of SRP to ribosomes with nascent chains that either contained or lacked signal sequences. Their experiments yielded an estimate ofKdless than 8 nm for SRP bound to an RNC with a preprolactin (pPL) nascent chain, and aKd less than 50 μm for nontranslating ribosomes. Because these binding affinities were estimated using a nonequilibrium sedimentation velocity technique, the authors noted that the above values represent the minimal binding affinities. Thus, these early experiments demonstrated a high affinity interaction between SRP and RNCs which was signal sequence-dependent, but no rigorous thermodynamic analysis of these interactions has been done. Elongation arrest was also identified early as a property of SRP when experiments revealed that SRP inhibits translation of secretory proteins, but not cytoplasmic proteins, in the absence of ER microsomes (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 6Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because some nascent chains become translocation-incompetent when they become too long, elongation arrest was proposed as a mechanism for slowing translation and thereby prolonging the time during which an RNC could be targeted successfully to the ER membrane. For example, the targeting of RNCs with pPL nascent chains to ER microsomes was shown to be abolished when the nascent chain exceeded 140 residues in length, presumably because SRP affinity for the RNC had been reduced by the lengthening and folding of the nascent chain which interfered with SRP access to the signal sequence (7Siegel V. Walter P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have here employed fluorescence techniques to monitor directly the association of SRP with various RNC complexes. This approach has allowed us to quantify for the first time the interactions of SRP with the signal sequence, the nascent chain, and the ribosome at equilibrium, and hence to obtain accurate measurements of theKd values for complexes containing SRP. The resulting data reveal that some long standing views about the mechanisms involved in SRP-dependent ribosome selection and targeting need to be revised. The following new conclusions are among those revealed by the fluorescence experiments. The RNC·SRPKd is more than 100-fold smaller than estimated previously; SRP has different affinities for different signal sequences; SRP binds more tightly to translating ribosomes than to nontranslating ribosomes because of a conformational change in the ribosome that is recognized by the SRP; and SRP binds with very similar affinity to signal sequence-containing RNCs with short and long nascent chains. Hence, in contrast to current dogma, the inability of RNCs with long nascent chains to target to the ER membrane is not the result of a failure of SRP to bind to the signal sequence. Plasmids coding for golden hamster BiP, rat preproinsulin I (pPI), and chimpanzee α-globin were generous gifts from Dr. Linda Hendershot (8Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Dr. Sandra Wolin (9Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and Dr. David Andrews (10Falcone D. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), respectively. The pPLss coding sequence was prepared by Dr. Veronica Worrell by fusing the signal sequence of bovine pPL (11Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to a long stretch of Bcl-2 which lacks a lysine codon (12Thrift R.N. Andrews D.W. Walter P. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An amber stop codon was introduced into the coding sequences of pPL, pBiP, pPI, and globin using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primary sequence of each protein and derivative was confirmed by the DNA sequencing of its plasmid. Truncated mRNAs coding for peptides of defined length were transcribed in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (13Krieg U.C. Johnson A.E. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2033-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using either plasmid DNA cut in the coding region with a particular restriction endonuclease or PCR-produced DNA fragments of the desired length. SRP was purified as described previously (14Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), except that the sucrose density sedimentation was omitted. SRP proteins and SRP RNA were purified and reconstituted as before (15Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Janiak F. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SRP concentration was determined using ε280 nm = 1.0 × 106m−1cm−1 Yeast Lys-tRNALys andNε-[6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminohexanoyl]-Lys-tRNALys(εNBD-Lys-tRNALys) were purified and prepared as detailed earlier (17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli tRNALys and a derivative with a single base change in the anticodon which converted the tRNALys into a tRNA that recognizes the amber stop codon (generously provided by Dr. Greg Beckler, Promega Corp.; here termed tRNAamb) were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase as described earlier for SRP RNA (16Janiak F. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5830-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resulting RNA samples were purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Pharmacia FPLC equipped with a Mono Q HR 10/10 column. The RNA was eluted in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5), 5 mmMgCl2 with a 115-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0.48 to 1.0 m. The fractions containing functional tRNAamb were detected by aminoacylation assays (18Johnson A.E. Adkins H.J. Matthews E.A. Cantor C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), except that MgCl2 was at 6 mm, and no KCl was added; most of the tRNAamb eluted near 0.55 m NaCl. The fractions with the highest tRNAamb content were aminoacylated with [14C]Lys, chemically modified with NBD, purified, and stored as described previously with the above changes (17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The resulting amber suppressor tRNAs have exhibited excellent suppression efficiencies with a variety of mRNAs, often exceeding 50% even for amber codons located far into the coding sequence (data not shown). As seen previously (17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the NBD modification has no detectable effect on the ability of Lys-tRNAamb to function in protein synthesis. Truncated mRNAs were translated for 25 min at 26 °C in a wheat germ extract as described previously (17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 20Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Translations (250 or 500 μl total volume) contained 0.60 pmol/μl of either εNBD-[14C]Lys-tRNALys/amb or unmodified [14C]Lys-tRNALys/amb. Following translation, RNCs were purified by gel filtration at 4 °C using a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5-cm inner diameter × 20 cm) and an elution buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 140 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (Buffer A). A slow flow rate was used during gel filtration to ensure the removal of noncovalently bound fluorophores (see Ref. 17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The radioactivity and A260 of a 70-μl aliquot of each 550-μl fraction were used to identify those fractions containing the RNCs that elute in the void volume, and only the leading half of the void volume peak was pooled. For competitive binding experiments, nontranslating ribosomes were prepared by incubating wheat germ extract with 2 mmpuromycin for 15 min at 26 °C and then purifying the ribosomes by gel filtration as above. Nonfluorescent RNCs were prepared as above, except that translations included unmodified [14C]Lys-tRNALys/amb instead of NBD-labeled Lys-tRNA. Prior to addition to NBD-RNC samples, nontranslating ribosomes and nonfluorescent RNCs were concentrated using a Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Translations (25 μl) of various RNCs were performed as before without added tRNA and with [35S]Met for nascent chain detection. After 25 min at 26 °C, cycloheximide and then SRP were added to 1 mm and 40 nm, respectively. Following another 10-min incubation at 26 °C, 3–4 eq of high salt- and EDTA-washed microsomal membranes were added (14Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). After incubating for 5 min at 26 °C in the presence of membranes, each sample was layered on a 50-μl cushion (0.5 m sucrose in Buffer A) and sedimented for 3 min at 4 °C and 20 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge (30 ° rotor). The pellets were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, whereas the supernatants were precipitated in acid before resuspension in sample buffer. The protein contents of the membrane and supernatant pellets were analyzed on a 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and radioactivity was detected and quantified using a Bio-Rad FX PhosphorImager. Steady-state fluorescence intensity was monitored using an SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorometer with a two-grating excitation monochromator, a single grating emission monochromator, and a 450-watt xenon lamp. Samples were excited at 468 nm (4-nm bandpass), and emission was detected at 530 nm (4-nm bandpass). All spectral measurements were done at 4 °C in Buffer A using 4 × 4-mm quartz microcuvettes. Sample mixing in these cuvettes was accomplished as described previously (21Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The sample compartment of the fluorometer was flushed with a stream of N2 to minimize condensation on the cold cuvettes. After each addition of titrant and mixing, no spectral measurements were made for at least 10 min. This delay was sufficient to ensure that the samples had reached equilibrium in terms of both ligand binding and temperature and that all condensation had evaporated. To prevent RNC adsorption to the walls of the cuvette during the titration, the interiors of the cuvettes were coated with purified phosphatidylcholine (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For spectroscopic analysis, 250-μl samples of purified NBD-labeled RNCs (usually ∼1 nm) in Buffer A were titrated at 4 °C by the sequential addition of known amounts of SRP in small volumes. After each addition, the emission intensities of the NBD and blank samples were measured after reaching equilibrium. After blank subtraction and then dilution correction, the net NBD emission intensity (F) at each point in the titration was compared with the initial intensity (F0) of the sample in the absence of SRP. At the end of each titration, the amount of [14C]Lys in each cuvette was measured to determine the actual concentration of nascent chains. To correct for the significant background signal (mostly light scattering) observed with samples lacking NBD, we initially performed two translations in parallel, one with εNBD-Lys-tRNA and one with Lys-tRNA to serve as a blank. NBD and blank samples with equivalent background signals were then created from the separate RNC pools by equating (by dilution) either their absorbances at 260 nm (because ribosomes are responsible for the observed light scattering in these samples) or their emissions at 485 nm (λex = 468 nm) (17Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The signal of the blank was then routinely subtracted from the signal of the fluorescent sample to yield the net NBD emission intensity. In later experiments, blank samples contained only ribosomes that had been purified by the gel filtration of wheat germ extract (the same amount used in the NBD translation) because the presence of residual tRNA, mRNA, nascent chains, and SRP after purification and titration did not detectably alter the amount of light scattering. The total concentration of NBD-RNCs in a purified sample was determined directly by counting the [14C]Lys present in the solution using a scintillation counter and experimentally determined counting efficiencies. The number of RNCs equaled the number of [14C]Lys in all but the pPLss samples because there is one εNBD-[14C]Lys/ribosome-bound nascent chain when the probe is incorporated using the amber suppressor. In the case of pPLss, the number of nascent chains was twice the number of [14C]Lys because each pPLss nascent chain contains two lysines, and only one-fourth of the incorporated lysines are εNBD-[14C]Lys because of the competition between εNBD-[14C]Lys-tRNALys and endogenous Lys-tRNALys (13Krieg U.C. Johnson A.E. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2033-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ribosome concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm (1 A260 unit = 23.1 pmol (24Sperrazza J.M. Russell D.W. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). We have previously derived equations to analyze the competitive binding of a ligand to two alternate receptors, one of which is labeled with a fluorescent probe. The dissociation constant for the unlabeled competing receptor is obtained by analysis of the dependence of a spectral change on the concentrations of ligand and receptors (25Bock P.E. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15079-15086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Abrahamson J.K. Laue T.M. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Janiak F. Dell V.A. Abrahamson J.K. Watson B.S. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, because every sample contains more than one ribosomal species that can bind to SRP, the titration data have been analyzed using either the cubic equation (Equation 2), which relates the spectral change to two simultaneous receptor binding equilibria, or the quartic equation (Equation 10), which was derived for three competing equilibria (see Fig. 1B). In both cases, fluorescence data were expressed as the fractional change in the initial fluorescenceΔF/F0=(F−F0)/F0Equation 1 where F0 is the net initial emission intensity of NBD-RNCs and F is the net dilution-corrected intensity observed at a given SRP concentration. Fluorescence studies of SRP binding to NBD-RNCs with nontranslating ribosomes as a competitor were performed by measuring the fluorescence change in the presence of excess nontranslating ribosomes. NBD-RNCs at a total concentration of [N]0 in the sample and a large excess of nontranslating ribosomes at a total concentration of [R]0 were titrated with SRP, and the change in NBD-RNC emission was measured as a function of the total SRP concentration ([S]0). Data from these titrations and titrations with no excess ribosomes were analyzed using the cubic equation (Equation 2) to obtain the maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax/F0) and the dissociation constants for the SRP·NBD-RNC (Kn) and the SRP·ribosome (Kr) complexes that best fit the data. For the nonlinear least squares analyses, the parameters (Kn, Kr, and ΔFmax/F0) were fit with the stoichiometric factors n and r, the number of SRP binding sites/NBD-RNC or nontranslating ribosome, respectively, set to 1, an assumption that fits the titration data very well. Although the cubic equation has been published previously using different nomenclature (28Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the equation with our nomenclature is shown below (Equation 2), where the fraction of sites on NBD-RNC occupied by SRP is ΔF/ΔFmax.D1(ΔF/ΔFmax)3+D2(ΔF/ΔFmax)2+D3(ΔF/ΔFmax)+D4=0Equation 2 D1=n[N]0(Kr−Kn)/KnEquation 3 D2=[S]0(Kn−Kr)/Kn+n[N]0(Kn−2Kr)/Kn+Kn−Kr−r[R]0Equation 4 D3=[S]0(2Kr−Kn)/Kn+n[N]0Kr/Kn+Kr+r[R]0Equation 5 D4=−[S]0Kr/KnEquation 6 For competitive ligand binding to three receptors, one of which is fluorescent, a quartic equation was derived from the equilibrium constants and conservation equations where the SRP·ribosome concentration is termed [RS], the SRP·nonfluorescent RNC concentration is designated [US], the SRP·NBD-RNC concentration is termed [NS], and ΔF/ΔFmax = [NS]/n[N]0. In addition to the parameters in the cubic equation, the quartic includes Ku(Kd for SRP·nonfluorescent RNC) andu (number of SRP binding sites/nonfluorescent RNC).Kn=(n[N]0−[NS])([S]0−[NS]−[RS]−[US])/[NS]Equation 7 [RS]=Kn[NS]r[R]0/(n[N]0Kr+[NS](Kn−Kr))Equation 8 [US]=Kn[NS]u[U]0/(n[N]0Ku+[NS](Kn−Ku))Equation 9 Substitution of Equations 8 and 9 into Equation 7 and rearrangement gave Equation 10 for ΔF/ΔFmax as a function of the total concentrations of all of the interacting species and binding parameters. For the nonlinear least squares analyses, the dissociation constants for the various SRP·ribosomal species and the maximum change in emission intensity (ΔFmax/F0) were fit simultaneously by the quartic equation (Equation 10) with the stoichiometric factors (n, r, and u) fixed at 1.m1(ΔF/ΔFmax)4+m2(ΔF/ΔFmax)3Equation 10 +m3(ΔF/ΔFmax)2+m4(ΔF/ΔFmax)+m5=0m1=n[N]0Equation 11 m2=n[N]0(C3+C4−1)−[S]0−Kn+r[R]0C1+u[U]0C2Equation 12 m3=n[N]0(C3C4−C3−C4)−[S]0(C3+C4−1)−Kn(C3+C4)+r[R]0(C1C4−C1)+u[U]0(C2C3−C2)Equation 13 m4=−n[N]0C3C4+[S]0(C3+C4−C3C4)Equation 14 −KnC3C4−r[R]0C1C4−u[U]0C2C3m5=[S]0C3C4Equation 15 C1=Kn/(Kn−Kr)Equation 16 C2=Kn/(Kn−Ku)Equation 17 C3=Kr/(Kn−Kr)Equation 18 C4=Ku/(Kn−Ku)Equation 19 The validity of the quartic equation was confirmed by finding indistinguishable fits to the data by a model in which the expressions for the equilibrium constants and conservation equations were solved simultaneously by SCIENTIST software (Micromath Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The above equations provide exact solutions for the variousKd values and ΔFmax/F0 that are valid for all concentrations of the interacting species. These exact equations are necessary for the analysis of tight binding interactions such as those studied here, where simplifying assumptions regarding equivalence of free and total concentrations cannot be made. The equations are generally applicable to the analysis of interactions at equilibrium where one ligand binds independently (noncooperatively) to two (Equation 2) or three receptors (Equation 10), one of which is fluorescent. All nonlinear least squares analyses were performed with the SCIENTIST program. All reported estimates of error represent ± 2 S.E. The Kd values for SRP complexes with NBD-pPL86-RNC and nontranslating ribosomes were determined by combining all of the individual titration data sets in the presence and absence of excess free ribosomes and analyzing them simultaneously by nonlinear least squares fitting of the cubic equation using the SCIENTIST fitting program (28Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, the data from multiple independent experiments were combined and analyzed simultaneously to determine the Kd values using the quartic equation. Many different preparations of purified SRP and translation components have been used in our experiments over several years, and we observed little dependence of the Kd values on sample origin. To determine most accurately the affinity of SRP for ribosomes with various nascent chains, it is necessary to measure theKd of each complex at equilibrium. Nonequilibrium techniques estimate the extent of complex formation in a sample by first separating the complex from the unbound species and then measuring the amount of complex. Kd values calculated from such data are typically much higher than the true dissociation constants because the complex dissociates during the separation process. For example, we found thatKd values for aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP ternary complexes determined using nonequilibrium techniques were 10–1,000-fold higher than the actual equilibrium dissociation constant (26Abrahamson J.K. Laue T.M. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Janiak F. Dell V.A. Abrahamson J.K. Watson B.S. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because nonequilibrium methods may substantially underestimate SRP affinity for signal sequences and ribosomes, we have chosen to measure Kd values at equilibrium. The optimal approach for quantifying the amounts of bound and unbound species in a sample at equilibrium is to use a spectroscopic technique that can distinguish between the bound and free species without separating them. Here we positioned a fluorescent probe in the signal sequence with the expectation that SRP association with the signal sequence would alter the environment of the fluorophore and hence its fluorescence signal. As shown below, this expectation was realized, and we were able to measure directly the fraction of signal sequences bound to SRP in a sample. Another advantage of using a nondestructive spectroscopic technique to monitor binding is that the sample can be examined over time to ensure that the spectral signal has reached a constant value and hence that the sample is at equilibrium. Kd values are determined experimentally from the concentration dependence of complex formation, and hence it is necessary to examine samples with measurable amounts of both free and bound RNCs and SRP. Because Walter et al. (6Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) showed that the Kd for SRP binding to signal sequence-containing RNCs was less than 8 nm, significant amounts of both free and bound species would be observed only in samples containing nanomolar con"
https://openalex.org/W2044157798,"Tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) is a prototype member of the adamalysin family of transmembrane metalloproteases that effects ectodomain cleavage and release of many transmembrane proteins, including transforming growth factor-α. Growth factors that act through tyrosine kinase receptors, as well as other stimuli, induce shedding through activation of the Erk mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway without the need of new protein synthesis. How MAP kinase regulates shedding by TACE is not known. We now report that the cytoplasmic domain of TACE is phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation. We also identified a naturally expressed smaller polypeptide corresponding to most of the cytoplasmic domain of TACE. This protein, which we named SPRACT, is derived through alternative translation of the TACE-coding sequence and is, similarly to TACE, phosphorylated in response to growth factor and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that growth factor-induced phosphorylation of TACE occurs only on serine and not on threonine or tyrosine. Tryptic mapping experiments coupled with site-directed mutagenesis identified Ser819 as the major target of growth factor-induced phosphorylation, whereas Ser791undergoes dephosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation. The phosphorylation of Ser819, but not the dephosphorylation of Ser791, depends on activation of the Erk MAP kinase pathway. Increased SPRACT expression or mutation of the TACE cytoplasmic domain to inactivate growth factor-induced phosphorylation did not detectably affect growth factor-induced shedding of transmembrane transforming growth factor-α by TACE.

The subsequent release of the polypeptide from the cell can have profound consequences not only at the cellular physiological level but also at a more tissue-wide or even systemic level. For example, transmembrane L-selectin is an adhesion protein for leukocytes, and ectodomain cleavage of L-selectin may therefore down-regulate inflammation by limiting neutrophil accumulation and lymphocyte activation (5Kishimoto T.K.

Because shedding plays such an important role in the regulation of cellular functions, its dysregulation can contribute to disease conditions. Thus, ectodomain cleavage of transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 and consequent release of soluble TNF-α is thought to contribute to cachexia and arthritis, which cannot be induced by transmembrane TNF-α (9Beutler B.

However, despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying ectodomain processes are poorly understood. Ectodomain shedding also regulates the activities and roles of transmembrane growth factors such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and its family members. These growth factors are expressed at the cell surface as transmembrane proteins, yet can also be released as soluble growth factors as a result of their ectodomain shedding (12Pandiella A.

Both the soluble and the transmembrane forms of these growth factors can activate the receptors, i.e. the EGF/TGF-α receptor or related transmembrane tyrosine kinases (13Derynck R. Adv.

Thus, transmembrane TGF-α or related growth factors only exert autocrine activity and stimulate receptors on adjacent cells and are most likely unable to induce receptor internalization. In contrast, release of soluble ligand following ectodomain shedding allows the cell to induce biological effects, e.g. TGF-α-mediated proliferation, on non-adjacent cells and allows for ligand-induced internalization of the receptors. In addition to these two modes of ligand signaling depending on ectodomain shedding of the transmembrane growth factor, their receptors can also be subject to ectodomain cleavage, thereby down-regulating ligand-induced receptor activation (22Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Thus, growth factors and activated tyrosine kinase receptors rapidly induce ectodomain shedding of TGF-α and other transmembrane proteins through induction of the Erk MAP kinase signaling pathway without the need for new protein synthesis (32Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA-induced ectodomain shedding of TGF-α or its family member heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and TNF-α is also mediated through activation of the Erk signaling pathway (32Fan H.

In addition, activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, often a result of inflammatory mediators or physiological stress, also leads to ectodomain shedding (32Fan H. Derynck R.

Thus, inhibition of both Erk and/or p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways strongly suppresses ectodomain shedding of diverse transmembrane proteins in response to various stimuli (32Fan H. Derynck R.

Inhibitor studies and functional experiments have revealed that the cleavage of TGF-α and various other transmembrane proteins is mediated by cell surface metalloprotease(s) (30Arribas J. Coodly L.

Functional inactivation through gene targeting has subsequently implicated a role for the transmembrane protease TACE in ectodomain shedding of not only TNF-α but also L-selectin and TGF-α in vivo (31Peschon J.J.

TACE, a member of the adamalysin (ADAM) family of transmembrane metalloproteases and also known as ADAM 17, is a prototype “sheddase.” Its characterization and studies on the mechanisms of activation may therefore provide models for how other adamalysins function. The protein sequence of TACE consists of an extracellular metalloprotease domain flanked upstream by a prodomain and downstream by a cysteine-rich disintegrin domain, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain (45Black R.A.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). The prodomain serves as an inhibitor of the protease in its zymogen state and is removed at the late Golgi processing stage (47Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although it was originally thought to play a role in substrate recognition, the disintegrin domain has been shown to be required for shedding of an interleukin 1 receptor only among several TACE substrates tested (42Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol.

The regulation of ectodomain shedding by TACE and the ability of MAP kinase signaling pathways to activate shedding without the need for new protein synthesis suggest that the cytoplasmic domain may act as a signal transducer that regulates shedding by the protease domain of TACE in response to intracellular activities. Interestingly, the 130-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of TACE, like several other ADAM members, has a potential Src homology 3 ligand protein-binding motif (45Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J.

This sequence or a proximal region of TACE interacts with mitotic arrest deficient 2, although the physiological relevance of this interaction is unknown (48Nelson K.K. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, the PDZ domain-containing protein PTPH1 has been shown to interact with the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic domain and to possibly down-regulate TACE function (49Zheng Y. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42463-42470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation plays a critical role in intracellular signaling. It has been reported that PMA, an artificial shedding activator, can induce TACE phosphorylation (45Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L.

Interestingly, MDC9, which shares sequence similarity with TACE in its cytoplasmic domain, is phosphorylated by protein kinase Cδ (51Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K.

In one study this phosphorylation was shown to regulate the induction of HB-EGF shedding by PMA (51Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), whereas other findings indicate that PMA may activate HB-EGF shedding through the Erk MAP kinase signaling pathway instead (33Gechtman Z.

We now show that growth factor or PMA stimulation leads to enhanced phosphorylation of TACE through activation of the Erk MAP kinase signaling pathway. We also identified an alternative translation product of TACE that we name SPRACT. SPRACT corresponds to most of the cytoplasmic domain of TACE and similarly to TACE undergoes regulated phosphorylation. We show that TACE is phosphorylated on serines upon growth factor or serum stimulation. We identified the major site of phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation, as well as another serine, which shows decreased phosphorylation upon stimulation. The function of these phosphorylation sites and the role of SPRACT remain to be characterized. Recombinant acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and EGF were purchased from Calbiochem.

Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Four polyclonal anti-TACE antibodies were used throughout the course of this study. A rabbit antiserum from QED Bioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA), and a goat antiserum from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) both recognize a carboxyl-terminal sequence. The antibody from QED Bioscience was found preferable for analyzing endogenous TACE because of a higher affinity to protein A-agarose beads in immunoprecipitation and a cleaner background in Western blotting as compared with the antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The blocking peptide for the antisera as well as normal rabbit IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant TACE cytoplasmic domain fused to glutathioneS-transferase, and a polyclonal antiserum against the extracellular domain of TACE were generous gifts from Dr. Blobel (Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York) (52Lum L.

The expression vector for the wild type TACE was constructed by PCR amplification of the human TACE cDNA cloned in a bacteriophage λ vector that was provided by Dr. Roy Black (Immunex, Seattle, WA). The PCR-amplified cDNA was inserted into the pRK5 vector, which uses the human cytomegalovirus promoter to drive expression of an inserted gene in mammalian cells. Deletion and single or multiple amino acid substitution mutants of the TACE coding sequence were constructed using PCR-based approaches. The sequences of wild type and mutant TACE coding sequences in all expression plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing performed at the University of California, San Francisco, Biomolecular Resource Center. Information on the plasmid design and construction will be provided upon request. Expression plasmids for constitutively activated MEK1 (ΔN-S218E-S222D) (54Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S.

Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), respectively. The HeLa S3 cell line and HEK293 cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm proline and 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of CHO and HEK293 cells was achieved using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The EC2 cell line that lacks the expression of catalytically active TACE as a result of targeted gene inactivation,i.e. the taceΔZn/ΔZn mutation, was kindly provided by Dr. Roy Black (Immunex). EC2 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using LipofectAMINE and the Plus reagent (Invitrogen). K562, THP-1, and U937 cell lines were obtained from the University of California San Francisco Tissue Culture Facility and cultured in RPMI medium supplement with 10% FBS. CHO cells, grown in 6-well plates, were transfected with expression vectors for wild type or mutated TACE and cultured in serum-free medium overnight (32Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of TACE proteins with [35S]cysteine/methionine was performed as described previously (32Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect phosphorylation of TACE in vivo, HeLa S3 cells at 90% confluency in 6- or 10-cm dishes or CHO cells in 6-well plates transiently transfected with a TACE expression vector were subjected to overnight serum starvation before 32P labeling, washed with phosphate-free DMEM, and cultured with the DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences or Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. To observe induced TACE phosphorylation, FGF (final concentration, 10 ng/ml), EGF (final concentration, 10 ng/ml), dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS) (final concentration, 20%) or PMA (final concentration, 20 nm), with or without the MEK inhibitor U0126 (final concentration, 10 μm), was added into the labeling medium. When FBS was used, an equal volume of phosphate-free DMEM was added to control wells. The cells were cultured for an additional 15 min, and labeling was terminated by placing the culture plates on ice and washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenanthroline as well as “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation of TACE in the cell extract with antibodies from rabbit and protein A-conjugated agarose beads was carried out by rotating on a platform at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by three washes with the above lysis buffer. Protein G beads were used for immunoprecipitation using an anti-TACE antibody from goat. In selected experiments analyzing the nature of SPRACT, 10 μm TAPI-1 was included in the steps of cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation. The imm"

In this study, the regulation and the functional role of the retinoblastoma family proteins pRb, p107, and p130 in the cellular response to oxidative stress were investigated. Treatment of endothelial cells with H2O2 induced rapid hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family proteins. This event did not require p53 or p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 and was not associated with cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase down-modulation. Four lines of evidence indicate that H2O2-induced hypophosphorylation of pRb, p107, and p130 was because of the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). First, cell treatment with two phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A, prevented the hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family proteins, at concentrations that specifically inhibit PP2A. Second, SV40 small t, which binds and inhibits PP2A, when overexpressed prevented H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family proteins, whereas a SV40 small t mutant unable to bind PP2A was totally inert. Third, PP2A core enzyme physically interacted with pRb and p107, both in H2O2-treated and untreated cells. Fourth, a PP2A phosphatase activity was co-immunoprecipitated with pRb, and the activity of pRb-associated PP2A was positively modulated by cell treatment with H2O2. Because DNA damaging agents inhibit DNA synthesis in a pRb-dependent manner, it was determined whether the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family proteins played a role in this S-phase response. Indeed, it was found that inhibition of PP2A by SV40 small t over-expression prevented DNA synthesis inhibition induced by H2O2. Oxidative stress induces cell death and growth arrest.

Accumulation of ROS, which include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals, can inflict damage to DNA, proteins, and fatty acids. It is generally believed that oxidative stress caused by ROS plays a causal role in aging as well as in numerous pathologies, including tissue ischemia and reperfusion, cancer, diabetic vasculopathy, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and pulmonary fibrosis (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7348) Google Scholar, 2Mates J.M. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D339-D345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). To cope with the burden of oxidative damage, a series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses have evolved that neutralize ROS (2Mates J.M. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D339-D345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cells also deploy “adaptive responses” aimed at minimizing the damages caused by ROS. Mammalian cells respond to oxidative stress with an increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes and activation of protective genes. To defend against DNA oxidation induced by ROS, proliferating cells arrest their cell cycle, preventing the mutated DNA from being replicated and transferred to daughter cells. This delay in cell growth also allows the cells to repair the damaged DNA and to set up an adaptive response to counteract further oxidative damage. According to whether or not damaged DNA is repaired, cells either resume cell growth or enter a status of permanent growth arrest. Thus, growth arrest is a crucial component of the cellular response to oxidative stress. Moreover, ROS can also induce cell death, either by apoptosis or by necrosis, according to the level of oxidative stress experienced by the cell and its genotype (3Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Formation of ROS is not always associated with cell damage but is also induced during many physiologic cellular processes, including the regulation of signal transduction, gene expression, and proliferation (4Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). For instance, activated growth factor receptors increase intracellular ROS (5Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Moreover, fibroblasts expressing a constitutively active isoform of Ras produce large amounts of ROS, and the mitogenic activity of cells expressing Ras is inhibited by treatment with antioxidants (6Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Therefore, depending on the concentration, the molecular species, and the subcellular localization, ROS exert two physiopathological effects, damage to various cell components and activation of specific signaling pathways. The retinoblastoma family of growth-inhibitory proteins is an integral part of the mechanisms that regulate cell growth in normal conditions as well as after exposure to genotoxic stimuli. It consists of three members: the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the related p107 and p130 (also known as p130pRb2) (7Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 8Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Collectively, these proteins are called “pocket” proteins because they have a domain, named the pocket, that can bind and regulate the activity of several cellular proteins. The family of E2F transcription factors is one major target of the pocket proteins. E2F plays an important part in cell cycle-regulated gene expression because it modulates, either positively or negatively, the transcription of a number of genes that are required for DNA synthesis (9Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The ability of the pocket proteins to bind proteins such as E2F is abolished through cell cycle-regulated serine/threonine phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In the G1 stage of the cell cycle, pRb is hypophosphorylated. At the G1 to S-phase transition, it receives additional phosphates, and phosphorylation increases even further as cells progress through S and G2. Not only pRb, but also p107 and p130, can be phosphorylated and thereby inactivated in a similar fashion (7Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 8Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of CDKs, like p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (hereafter named p21), provide another level of regulation (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar, 11Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). High levels of p21 lead to the inhibition of CDKs and, in turn, to the accumulation of the pocket proteins in their under-phosphorylated form. Certain genotoxic stimuli elicit the activation of p53, which, in turn, transactivates the transcription of the p21 gene. Alternatively, oxidative stress induces p21 protein levels, triggering the stabilization of p21 mRNA in a p53-independent manner (12Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about how phosphates are removed from the serine/threonine residues of the pocket proteins. During the cell cycle, pRb is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) at mitotic exit and a physical binding between select forms of phosphorylated as well as hypophosphorylated pRb can be found with the isotype α of PP1 (13Tamrakar S. Rubin E. Ludlow J.W. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D121-D137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another major cellular phosphatase that could potentially contribute to dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (14Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 15Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353 (Pt 3): 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). PP2A consists of a catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) and a structural subunit (PP2A-A). These two proteins form a core dimer to which a multitude of regulatory PP2A-B subunits associate. PP2A-B subunits regulate phosphatase activity, substrate specificity, and localization to cellular compartments (14Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 15Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353 (Pt 3): 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Recently, Voorhoeve et al. (16Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) described the cloning of a PP2A component that specifically associates with p107, leading to the subsequent dephosphorylation of p107. Moreover, p107 is rapidly dephosphorylated in response to UV, and this phenomenon appears to be mediated through activation of a PP2A-related phosphatase (17Voorhoeve P.M. Watson R.J. Farlie P.G. Bernards R. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, elevated cAMP in NRK-52E cells causes a marked reduction of pRb phosphorylation, and this dephosphorylation is blocked by the PP1 and PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) at concentrations selective for PP2A (18Feschenko M.S. Stevenson E. Nairn A.C. Sweadner K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Understanding the cellular responses to oxidative stress will provide useful insights into the mechanisms of aging, tissue damage because of ischemia, and transformation as well as into the pathogenesis of a variety of aging-related diseases. In the present study, the regulation and functional role of pocket proteins in the cellular response to oxidative stress was investigated. The results obtained showed that following oxidative stress pocket proteins undergo PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation. PP2A core enzyme physically interacts with pRb and p107, and a PP2A phosphatase activity that is co-immunoprecipitated with pRb is positively modulated by cell treatment with H2O2. This event may be part of an intra-S-phase response that leads to a reduction of the rate of DNA synthesis. Cells and Drug Treatment—Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics) were maintained in EGM-2 (Bio-Whittaker). Cells were used between passage 4 and 6. H2O2 (30% w/w solution, Sigma) was administered to the cells as a solution in phosphate-buffered saline. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, Sigma) and 1,3-bis(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU, Sigma) were dissolved in water, whereas OA (Sigma) and calyculin A (CL-A, Sigma) were dissolved in 10% Me2SO. Aphidicolin was resuspended in Me2SO. For S-phase synchronization, cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml aphidicolin for 14 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for one additional hour in pre-warmed medium. Retroviral Infection—Phoenix-ampho cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultivated and transfected with pBABE-puro (19Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) or pBABE-puro E6 as described by Pear et al. (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). The medium containing the emerging retrovirus was harvested 36–48 h after transfection. To assay for infectious virus, HUVEC were infected and selected in puromycin-containing medium (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma). pBABE-puro E6 was generated from pGST-E6 with standard techniques (21Lechner M.S.

Mumby M.C. Rundell K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are a kind gift from K. Rundell (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.). Adenovirus infection was carried out as previously described (23Gaetano C. Catalano A. Palumbo R. Illi B. Orlando G. Ventoruzzo G. Serino F. Capogrossi M.C. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1624-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HUVEC were infected with 100 plaque-forming units/cell and cultured for an additional 18 h before further treatment. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by standard procedures. The following antibodies, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology unless differently specified, were used to detect the proteins of interest: anti-pRb (C15 or G3–245, BD PharMingen), anti-p107 (C-18), anti-p130 (C-20), anti-p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene Research Products), anti-p21 (C-19), anti-cyclin A (BF683), anti-cyclin E (C-19), anti-cyclin D1 (A-12), anti-cyclin D2 (C-17), anti-cyclin D3 (C-16), anti-CDK4 (C-22), anti-CDK2 (C-22), anti-CDK6 (C21), anti-CDK1 (C17), anti-E2F1 (C20), anti-p16 (H-156), anti-p18 (N-20), anti-p27 (C-19), anti-p57Kip2 (C-20), anti-PP2A-C (610555, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-PP2A-A (C-20), anti-α-tubulin (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), anti-phospho-pRb antibodies (pT356, 44–578; pT821, 44–582; pT826, 44–576, BIOSOURCE International). Flow Cytometry—HUVEC were incubated for 10 min with 20 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma) and then fixed with 70% ethanol. Cell cycle analysis was performed by combined BrdUrd and propidium iodide staining using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer (24Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F.

Cell Quest software was used to determine the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (25Cenciarelli C. De Santa F. Puri P.L. Mattei E. Ricci L. Bucci F. Felsani A. Caruso M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5203-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm NaF and protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science), followed by 30 min of incubation on ice and clearing by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. After pre-reclearing with A/G-agarose for 15 min, supernatants were immunoprecipitated for 2–3 h at 4 °C with protein A/G-agarose and 1 μg of relevant antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed three times with wash buffer containing 60 mm Na2HPO4, 17 mm NaH2PO4, and 35 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with relevant antibodies. Kinase Assay—Kinase assays were performed as previously described (25Cenciarelli C. De Santa F. Puri P.L. Mattei E. Ricci L. Bucci F. Felsani A. Caruso M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5203-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in the previous section using 5 μg of the following antibodies: anti-cyclin D1 (M-20), anti-cyclin D2 (C-17), anti-CDK4 (C-22), anti-CDK2 (M2) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following substrates were used: Histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) was used with anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates and Rb-769 (pRb 769–921 domain, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used with anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin D2, and anti-CDK4 immunoprecipitates. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by exposure to BioMax film (Kodak) and quantified using GS710 calibrated densitometer imaging (Bio-Rad) and Quantity one 4.1.1 software (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Whole cell extracts were prepared from HUVEC after treatment with 800 μm H2O2 or solvent alone for 15 min. Cell extracts were then incubated for 4 h at 30 °C in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.09% β-mercaptoethanol) in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm NaF), followed by Western blotting as previously described. Endogenous pRb was detected by Western blotting using a specific pRb antibody (C15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation-PP2A Assay—HUVEC were suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described above, using 1 μg of the following antibodies: anti-Rb C15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PP2A-C (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel). After two washings with lysis buffer, beads were washed twice with PP2A phosphatase buffer with no Ca2+ and Mg2+ that favors PP2A over PP2B and PP2C phosphatase activities (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02% mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Phosphatase activity was assayed using the serine/threonine phosphatase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions (26Bennin D.A. Don A.S. Brake T. McKenzie J.L. Rosenbaum H.

Oxidative Stress Induces Protein Hypophosphorylation—Oxidative stress has been shown to induce endothelial cell death and growth arrest. To investigate the possible role of pocket proteins in mediating the response to oxidative stress, pocket protein phosphorylation was analyzed in proliferating HUVEC treated with 800 μm H2O2 for increasing periods of time. Western blotting analysis of cell extracts derived from these cells showed that, upon 2 h of treatment with H2O2, the hyperphosphorylated, slower migrating forms of pRb disappeared with reciprocal increase of the hypophosphorylated, faster migrating forms. This pRb hypophosphorylation was already present after 30 min of treatment, was almost complete after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1A), and was maintained for up to 24 h of incubation with H2O2 (not shown). Treatment of HUVEC with H2O2 concentrations ranging from 200 to 800 μm for 1 h demonstrated that the phenomenon was dose-dependent and as little as 200 μm H2O2 was sufficient to induce a partial, jet reproducible pRb hypophosphorylation (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal 42-amino acid peptide of pRb has been shown to be specifically cleaved off during drug-induced or receptor-mediated apoptosis, generating an apoptosis-specific form of pRb that migrates in close proximity to the dephosphorylated form (29Tan X. Wang J.Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 116-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This possibility was ruled out, using an antibody raised against the C-terminal 15-amino acid peptide of pRb, which recognizes the full-length but not the cleaved form of pRb. Moreover, pRb hypophosphorylation did not seem to be directly linked to apoptosis; Fig. 1B shows that following 1 h of incubation of HUVEC with 400 μm H2O2, pRb was largely hypophosphorylated. However, in keeping with previous results obtained in murine and human fibroblasts (30Barnouin K. Dubuisson M.L. Child E.S. Fernandez de Mattos S. Glassford J. Medema R.H. Mann D.J. Lam E.W. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 332 (Pt 1): 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), H2O2 concentrations up to 400 μm were sublethal and exposure to 800 μm H2O2 was necessary to induce cell death of most cells within 24 h (data not shown). To analyze the phosphorylation of specific pRb sites upon H2O2 treatment, pRb phospho-specific antibodies were used. Two pRb phosphate acceptors, threonine 826 (Thr-826) and threonine 356 (Thr-356), are phosphorylated by CDK4-cyclin D1, whereas threonine 821 (Thr-821) is phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A or CDK2/cyclin E (32Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 33Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts derived from proliferating HUVEC treated with 200–800 μm H2O2 for 1 h showed that the signal detected using phospho-specific antibodies to Thr-356, Thr-821, and Thr-826 was greatly diminished in H2O2-treated cells (Fig 1C). Then it was tested whether the phosphorylation of other members of the retinoblastoma gene family, namely p107 and p130, was regulated by H2O2. Following treatment of HUVEC with H2O2, a rapid, dose-dependent accumulation of the faster/hypophosphorylated forms of p107 and p130 was observed, with kinetics comparable with that of pRb (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, pocket protein hypophosphorylation seems to be a specific event, because the phosphorylation patterns of E2F1 (Fig. 1B) and E2F4 (data not shown) were not altered by H2O2 treatment. To assess whether pocket protein hypophosphorylation was caused by the H2O2-induced red/ox imbalance, the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was used. Indeed, preincubation of HUVEC with 10 mm NAC for 30 min totally prevented pRb hypophosphorylation induced by H2O2 treatment (not shown). It was also tested whether pocket protein hypophosphorylation was induced by other interventions that cause intracellular red/ox imbalance. The alkylating agent 1,3-bis(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) is an inhibitor of glutathione reductase that blocks the conversion of oxidized to reduced glutathione (34Frischer H. Ahmad T. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 89: 1080-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 35Noda T. Iwakiri R. Fujimoto K. Aw T.Y. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Incubation of HUVEC with 0.5 mm BCNU for 2 h caused pocket hypophosphorylation; this phenomenon was inhibited by preincubation with 10 mm NAC. NAC treatment was shown to prevent the decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione induced by BCNU treatment (35Noda T. Iwakiri R. Fujimoto K. Aw T.Y. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicating a direct relationship between BCNU-induced red/ox imbalance and pocket protein hypophosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Taken together these experiments indicate that oxidative stress causes rapid pocket protein hypophosphorylation. Pocket Protein Hypophosphorylation Is Not Associated with Cyclin/CDK Down-modulation and Is p53-independent—Next it was investigated whether pocket protein hypophosphorylation in response to H2O2 was mediated by a down-modulation of the cyclin/CDK targeting pocket proteins. When protein levels were measured by immunoblotting, it was found that one hour of H2O2 treatment (200–800 μm) induced a significant pRb hypophosphorylation in the absence of any modulation of the protein levels of CDK 1, 2, 4, and 6 and of cyclin E, A, D1, -2, and -3 (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous observations (30Barnouin K. Dubuisson M.L. Child E.S. Fernandez de Mattos S. Glassford J. Medema R.H. Mann D.J. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13761-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), cyclin D1 and D2 accumulation decreased at later time points, but this event clearly followed pocket protein hypophosphorylation (not shown). CDKs are negatively regulated by two classes of CDK inhibitors, the CIP/KIP and the INK4 families of proteins (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). It was determined whether the protein levels of CDK inhibitors were modulated by oxidative stress. Expression of p16INK4a, the first isolated member of the INK4 family of inhibitors, was barely detectable in HUVEC (not shown), in keeping with other low passage primary cells (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). p18INK4c, another INK4 inhibitor, was readily detectable by Western blotting, but its expression was not modulated in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2A). p27kip1 and p57kip2, cyclin/CDK inhibitors of the CIP/KIP family, were not modulated as well. It has been shown that oxidating agents can induce p21 up-regulation, via both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar, 11Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Gorospe M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13761-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, no p53 or p21 up-regulation was observed after 1 h of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). Positive regulation of p53 or p21 was indeed observed following longer H2O2 treatment, but it clearly followed pocket protein hypophosphorylation (not shown). To further investigate the role of p53 and p21, pocket protein phosphorylation was examined in cells that do or do not express the viral oncoprotein E6 of human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16-E6), which can bind p53 and induce its degradation (36Munger K. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HUVEC were infected with a retroviral vector encoding HPV16-E6 or the backbone vector alone; whereas p53 protein was readily detectable in cells infected with backbone virus, it was undetectable in HPV16-E6 expressing cells. In these cells, as reported in other systems (37Tang H.Y. Zhao K. Pizzolato J.F. Fonarev M. Langer J.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1572-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), p21 steady-state protein levels were strongly down-modulated as a consequence of p53 low levels of expression. Following incubation with 800 μm H2O2 for 1 h, pocket proteins accumulated in their hypophosphorylated form with similar efficiencies both in HPV16-E6 and in backbone virus-infected cells (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained in SV40 T antigen expressing HUVEC and in HEK-293 cells, where p53 is inactivated by SV"

Their function is crucial for the maintenance of the normally low cytosolic free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) in resting cells and to counteract the transient increases in [Ca2+]i generated during Ca2+signaling (1Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The spatially and temporally distinct demands on Ca2+ influx and efflux mandate the proper spatial distribution and abundance of the PMCAs across the plasma membrane. This is of particular importance in polarized cells such as neurons or epithelial cells where Ca2+ signaling often must be restricted to the pre- and post-synaptic membrane (neurons) or where Ca2+ influx and efflux must be spatially segregated between the apical and basolateral membrane (Ca2+ transporting epithelia). However, the molecular determinants and the mechanisms by which PMCAs are targeted to distinct membrane domains are unknown. Mammalian PMCAs are encoded by four separate genes giving rise to PMCA isoforms 1–4. Isoform complexity is further enhanced by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts, such that over 20 distinct PMCA variants exist in the mammalian proteome (2Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing affects two major regions of the protein (splice sites A and C): the first intracellular loop between membrane-spanning domains 2 and 3, and the COOH-terminal tail which corresponds to a major regulatory region of the pump and contains its calmodulin-binding site (Fig.1). Alternative splicing at site A does not change the overall reading frame of the pump; instead, varying numbers of amino acids (from 14 to 45 in human PMCA2) are optionally inserted into the intracellular loop separating membrane-spanning segments 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). Splicing at site A is most complex in PMCA2 where the optional insertion of three separate exons leads to splice variant 2w (all three exons included), 2x (only the third exon included), 2y (only the first two exons included), and 2z (none of the alternative exons included) (2Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The functional effect of alternative splicing at site A is unknown, although it has been noted that the changes occur close to a phospholipid-binding domain of the pump (3Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Heim R. Hug M. Iwata T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first intracellular loop also participates in the pump mechanism as the so-called A (actuator) domain (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The main splice variants (termed “a” and “b”) generated at the COOH-terminal site differ in their primary amino acid sequence due to a change in reading frame. Functionally, the most notable consequence of COOH-terminal splicing is a difference in calmodulin regulation of the respective pump variants (2Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 6Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, the extreme COOH-terminal sequence of the b splice variants (but not of the a-forms) has been shown recently to interact with several PDZ proteins including members of the synapse-associated protein family (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), NO synthase I (8Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Röthlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-2 (NHERF2) (9DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Differential interaction with specific PDZ proteins may be one mechanism for the membrane targeting or retention of specific transporters or receptors. We recently reported (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that PMCA4b is almost exclusively localized in the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells where it may interact with the PDZ protein synapse-associated protein 97. By contrast, we found that a GFP-tagged PMCA2b isoform was mainly targeted to the apical membrane where it co-localized with NHERF2 as a specific interaction partner (9DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we first set out to test the hypothesis that alternative splicing affecting the COOH-terminal tail may lead to differential membrane targeting of PMCAs. By using recombinant protein expression and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we find that the PDZ binding tail is dispensable for basolateral or apical membrane targeting, suggesting that COOH-terminal splicing plays no primary role for the proper localization of PMCA isoforms. Surprisingly, however, alternative splicing at site A influences apical or basolateral localization of PMCA2. PMCA2w, but not -2x or -2z, is targeted to the apical membrane, and this is true regardless of whether the COOH-terminal splice corresponds to the a or b variant. Our data suggest for the first time a role for alternative splicing at site A of PMCA2, indicating the importance of this splicing event for differential membrane targeting of the calcium pump in polarized cells. GFP-PMCA4b encoding human PMCA4x/b fused at its NH2 terminus to GFP was generated by cloning an XhoI fragment carrying the full-length PMCA4x/b sequence into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The PMCA4x/b sequence was PCR-amplified using pMM2-PMCA4b (3Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as template together with primers 4b-start (5′-ggg ggctcgaga acg aac cca tca gac cgt gtc ttg cc-3′) and 4b-stop (5′-ccc cctcga gtc aaa ctg atg tct cta ggc tct gta g-3′) containingXhoI recognition sequences (underlined). The full-length coding sequence of PMCA2x/b was first assembled as a NotI fragment in pBluescript-KS using reverse transcriptase-PCR and cDNAs cloned previously (4Heim R. Hug M. Iwata T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To generate full-length cDNAs for PMCA2w/b and PMCA2z/b, a BstEII-SphI fragment encompassing the alternative splice site A region in PMCA2x was replaced by corresponding cassettes containing the 2w and 2z sequence, respectively. The NotI fragments carrying the full-length PMCA2w/b, -2x/b, or -2z/b coding sequence were then excised from pBluescript-KS and subcloned into the NotI site of pSPORT-1 (Invitrogen). Finally, the PMCA2 sequences were cloned asMluI-SalI (2w/b and 2x/b) orMluI-KpnI fragments (2z/b) into the modified pMM2 expression vector (3Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to generate pMM2-PMCA2w/b, pMM2-PMCA2x/b, and pMM2-PMCA2z/b. To create constructs for GFP-PMCA2w/b and GFP-PMCA2x/b, the full-length PMCA2w/b and PMCA2x/b sequences were released as SacII/XbaI fragments from the original pBluescript-KS vectors and cloned into a modified pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech) containing consecutive hemagglutinin and His6 tags (10Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) between the GFP and the respective PMCA sequences. To make constructs GFP-PMCA2w/bΔ6 and GFP-PMCA2x/bΔ6, a GFP-PMCA2b plasmid described previously (9DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used as starting material because it allowed access to a convenient downstream restriction site. First, an ∼250-bpEcoRI-SalI fragment encoding the COOH-terminal 72 residues was replaced by a corresponding PCR-generatedEcoRI-SalI fragment carrying a translational stop codon six residues upstream of the original terminus. An ∼2.3-kbBglII fragment containing the NH2-terminal ∼750 codons was then excised from this plasmid and replaced by corresponding BglII fragments from GFP-PMCA2w/b and GFP-PMC2x/b to create the constructs GFP-PMCA2w/bΔ6 and GFP-PMCA2x/bΔ6, respectively. The expression vector pMM2-PMCA2z/a has been described previously (11Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The expression vector pMM2-PMCA2w/a was generated by a three-way ligation combining SalI-KpnI-digested pMM2 plasmid DNA, an ∼1.3-kbSalI-ScaI fragment from GFP-PMCA2w/b (containing the 5′ end coding sequence including the “w” insert at splice site A), and an ∼2.4-kb ScaI-KpnI fragment from pMM2-PMCA2z/a (containing the 3′ region and a-tail sequence at splice site C). The chimeric PMCA construct GFP-PMCA4x/2btail was made by replacing an ∼350-bp BamHI fragment specifying the COOH-terminal residues from 1100 to 1205 in GFP-PMCA4b with a BamHI fragment specifying the corresponding COOH-terminal sequence from plasmid GFP-PMCA2b (9DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The final construct encodes a GFP-tagged chimeric PMCA consisting of residues 1–1100 of PMCA4 (x splice variant) fused to the COOH-terminal 112 residues of PMCA2 (b splice variant). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing in the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. A schematic representation of all constructs is shown in Fig. 2. COS-1 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on 6-well plates (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (all cell culture reagents from Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE PlusTM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After ∼48 h, the cells were rinsed, lysed as described (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration in the lysates determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). About 30 μg of the lysates from untransfected (control) and transfected cells were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose following standard Western blotting procedures (12Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 10.8.1-10.8.21Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween + 5% milk before detection of the PMCAs using specific antibodies. Monoclonal Pan-PMCA antibody 5F10, monoclonal anti-PMCA4 antibody JA9, and affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PMCA2 antibody NR-2 were obtained from John Penniston and Adelaida Filoteo (Mayo Clinic) and used at dilutions of 1:2000, 1:600, and 1:5000, respectively. Secondary goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma and used at 1:5000 dilution. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, washing, and detection of the signals was done as described previously (13Usachev Y.M. Toutenhoofd S.L. Goellner G.M. Strehler E.E. Thayer S.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1756-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Type I MDCK epithelial cells (ATCC number CCL-34, Manassas, VA) were grown to confluence on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000TM (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis, Rockville, MD) diluted in DPBS + Ca2+/Mg2+ (DPBS + CM, Invitrogen). After five brief washes in DPBS + CM, coverslips were further fixed and permeabilized in pre-chilled methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. The cells were blocked in DPBS + CM containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PMCA2 antibody NR-2 (1:1000, final concentration 0.8 μg/ml) or monoclonal Pan-anti-PMCA antibody 5F10 (1:800). After washing 3 times for 5 min in DPBS + CM, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:800, and all antibodies for immunofluorescence were diluted in blocking buffer. 4′,6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was also added to the secondary antibody application at a dilution of 1:500 (final concentration 20 μg/ml) to stain nuclei. After final washing, coverslips were mounted in Prolong mounting media (Molecular Probes). Confocal micrographs were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope using an Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective and captured using LSM510 software version 2.8 (Zeiss). Images were imported and edited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. MDCK cells were grown to confluence as a monolayer on glass coverslips, transfected with PMCA2 expression constructs and prepared for immunofluorescence as described above using anti-PMCA2 antibody NR-2 and Pan-PMCA antibody 5F10 followed by Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 secondary antibodies, respectively. Confocal images were captured on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope as mentioned above. Images of the apical most 2-μm section of 20 representative cells from each transfection were collected, applying the same detector gain, zoom, amplitude offset and gain, transmission percent, pinhole size, and scan speed for each image collected within the frame mode and using an average from two images. By using the circular-shaped fixed area tool, an arbitrary area was selected that encompassed a majority of the collected apical images of each cell without incorporating any of the area outside of the apical domain (such as the lateral “rim” of the cell). This fixed circle-shaped area was then placed on the apical domain of the apical images in order to collect the mean fluorescence intensity (using the green channel) per given surface area for each of the 20 images from each of the different transfections. Choosing a circle that encompasses most of the membrane is essential as it yields an unbiased sampling of the entire apical domain as a whole and negates any effects (such as sampling microdomains with exceptionally high or low abundance of apical protein expression) that would skew the overall mean intensity for a given image. Each cell could then be represented by a number equal to the mean apical fluorescence intensity of that cell. These numbers were used to construct a line graph showing the mean intensity for each of the 20 cells from a given transfection and were also displayed in a bar graph showing the averages of the 20 mean fluorescence intensities for each of the PMCA2 transfections. We noted previously that endogenous PMCA4b was almost exclusively expressed in the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 284: F122-F132Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas a significant amount of GFP-tagged PMCA2b was found at the apical membrane where it co-localized with its binding partner NHERF2 (9DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed difference in membrane targeting is not due to the NH2-terminally added GFP moiety, we expressed GFP-PMCA4b in MDCK cells and compared its localization to that of GFP-PMCA2b. Both GFP-tagged proteins were readily expressed in transiently transfected COS cells as determined by Western analysis using isoform-specific antibodies (Fig.3). When expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, GFP-PMCA4b was still targeted to the basolateral membrane (Fig.4A), whereas the GFP-PMCA2b construct was prominently present at the apical membrane in addition to labeling the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4B). Thus, the difference in membrane localization of these two PMCA isoforms is not due to the presence of the GFP moiety at their NH2terminus.Figure 4Different membrane localization of PMCA isoforms. GFP-tagged PMCA4b (A) and PMCA2b (B) constructs were transiently expressed in MDCK cells, and their localization was determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy.A, GFP-PMCA4x/b is localized to the (baso-) lateral membrane (right panel, en face view of section at middle height) with virtually no staining of the apical membrane (left panel,apical section).

FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The differential localization of PMCA2b and PMCA4b might therefore be dependent upon different protein-protein interactions by their COOH-terminal tails. To test this hypothesis, we generated a chimeric construct (GFP-PMCA4x/2btail, see Fig. 2) in which the GFP-PMCA4b COOH-terminal tail downstream of residue 1100 was replaced by the corresponding tail of PMCA2b. When expressed in polarized MDCK cells, the localization of this chimera was indistinguishable from GFP-PMCA4b,i.e. the chimeric pump was exclusively found in the basolateral membrane (Fig. 5). Thus, the presence of the PMCA2b COOH-tail does not impart apical targeting on a chimeric protein with its NH2-terminal segment derived from PMCA4. Although PMCA2 and PMCA4 differ at many sequence positions throughout their length (their overall identity amounts to about 75%), the most obvious divergence between these isoforms occurs at splice site A. Indeed, we noted that our basolaterally targeted GFP-PMCA4b construct corresponded to the 4x/b variant, whereas the apically targeted GFP-PMCA2b construct corresponded to the 2w/b form (see Fig. 1 for a scheme of the splice variants). To test if the splice site A configuration might be involved directly in the different membrane targeting, we constructed expression vectors for each of the known human splice site A variants of PMCA2b,i.e. hPMCA2w/b, -2x/b, and -2z/b (Fig. 2). To rule out any possible effect of the NH2-terminal GFP moiety, these vectors were made without any tag to represent the wild-type full-length PMCA2 variants. Western blots of equal amounts of total cell lysate from transfected COS cells showed that all constructs were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3). When expressed in polarized MDCK cells, PMCA2x/b and PMCA2z/b were primarily localized in the basolateral membrane (Fig. 6,middle and right panels), whereas PMCA2w/b showed prominent apical localization in addition to basolateral staining (Fig.6, left panel). This difference in membrane localization was readily seen by taking confocal “en face” sections at different depths of the cells and is best illustrated in the x:z images shown in Fig. 6. Because all three constructs correspond to the b splice variant at their COOH-terminal end and are identical except for the insertion of 45 (w-form), 14 (x-form), or 0 (z-form) amino acid residues in their first intracellular loop, the observed differences in membrane localization must be due to the changes that occurred at splice site A, specifically to the insertion of 31 extra residues in the w splice form. The experiment using a chimeric GFP-PMCA4x/2b-tail construct (see Fig. 5) had already shown that the COOH-terminal tail is not the major determinant for apical versus basolateral targeting of the PMCAs. However, the presence of a functional PDZ-binding sequence may still be required for faithful membrane targeting of the pumps. To test if this is the case, we expressed GFP-PMCA2w/b and GFP-PMCA2x/b constructs lacking their six COOH-terminal residues (Figs. 2 and 3), thus rendering them unable to interact with PDZ proteins. As shown in Fig.7, GFP-PMCA2w/bΔ6 and GFP-PMCA2x/bΔ6 were still faithfully targeted to the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively, as predicted from their splice site A configuration. Similarly, GFP-PMCA4x/bΔ6 was targeted only to the basolateral membrane (not shown), as had been observed for the corresponding full-length PMCA4x/b isoform (Fig. 4A). We conclude that a functional PDZ-binding domain at the COOH terminus is not required for targeting of the PMCAs and hence that PDZ protein interactions are dispensable for directing the pumps to their membrane destination. If the insertion of the 31 extra amino acids of the w splice variant were indeed a major determinant of apical targeting of PMCA2, we would expect all w variants to be targeted to the apical membrane irrespective of the splice configuration at their COOH termini. To test this hypothesis, we generated expression vectors for full-length PMCA2w/a and PMCA2z/a (Figs. 2 and 3). When these constructs were transfected into MDCK cells, PMCA2z/a localized to the basolateral membrane, whereas PMCA2w/a showed prominent apical localization (Fig.8). Thus, the targeting of PMCA2w/a and PMCA2z/a is identical to that of PMCA2w/b and PMCA2z/b, respectively. To obtain a more quantitative assessment of the apical/basolateral targeting of the different splice site A variants, we determined the apical membrane fluorescence intensity in multiple randomly selected cells transfected with either PMCA2w/b, 2x/b, 2z/b, 2w/a, or 2z/a as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A plot of the relative fluorescence intensity in a fixed area of the apical membrane is shown in Fig. 9A for 20 individual cells from each transfection experiment, and the averaged apical fluorescence intensity for each PMCA2 construct is displayed in Fig.9B. The data illustrate the negligible localization of PMCA2x/b, -2z/b, and -2z/a in the apical membrane, in contrast to the abundant presence of PMCA2w/b and -2w/a in this membrane compartment. The results also show that PMCA2w/b and PMCA2w/a are about equally abundant in the apical membrane, further supporting the primary importance of the w splice configuration in determining PMCA2 membrane distribution.Figure 9Quantitative evaluation of apical membrane fluorescence of PMCA2 splice site A variants expressed in polarizedMDCK cells. MDCK cells were transfected with PMCA2w/b, -2x/b, -2z/b,- 2w/a, or -2z/a and stained with PMCA2-specific antibody NR-2 followed by anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody. Cells were imaged under the confocal fluorescence microscope, and images were captured of apical membrane sections of multiple randomly selected transfected cells. The fluorescence intensity per area was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the data for 20 individual cells from each transfection are plotted in arbitrary units inA. The average apical fluorescence intensity for each PMCA2 construct was calculated from the data in A and is graphically displayed in B.

This is achieved through subcellular compartmentalization and expression of an appropriate “tool kit” of Ca2+ transporting, buffering, and signaling molecules (19Berridge M.J. Lipp P.

Although the PMCAs are thought to be primarily responsible for the global maintenance of the low resting [Ca2+]i, recent data suggest that they participate in local Ca2+handling and help shape the duration and spreading of subplasmalemmal Ca2+ signals (8Schuh K.

Accordingly, many PMCA isoforms and splice variants are differentially expressed and localized in several tissues and cell types. For example, auditory and vestibular hair cells of the inner ear almost exclusively express PMCA2a in their apical stereocilia. In the basolateral membrane, these same cells express mainly PMCA1b (25Dumont R.A. Lins U. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Kachar B. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5066-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the retina of the mouse, PMCA1 is highly abundant in the synaptic terminal and inner segment of photoreceptors but absent from the outer segment, and PMCA2 is concentrated in the synaptic membrane of rod bipolar cells in the inner plexiform layer (26Krizaj D. DeMarco S.J. Johnson J. Strehler E.E. Copenhagen D.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 451: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Differential localization in distinct membrane domains may be one of the distinguishing features among PMCA isoforms and splice variants. Because the most pronounced difference between PMCA splice variants occurs between the a and b COOH-terminal splice variants, it was tempting to speculate that their different tails carry the information for differential membrane targeting. Moreover, only the b variants are known to interact with PDZ domains (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Contrary to findings with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and other transporters (30Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R.

Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), our results show that the targeting of PMCAs in polarized MDCK cells is independent of their splice site C configuration and does not require a functional PDZ-interacting COOH-terminal tail. Instead, we have uncovered an important role for changes at splice site A in directing PMCA2 variants to the apical versus basolateral membrane. Only the variant with the largest insert of 45 residues (PMCA2w) was apically directed, whereas PMCA2x (14-residue insert) and PMCA2z (no extra amino acids inserted) were localized in the basolateral membrane. The importance of the splice site A configuration for apical/basolateral targeting of PMCA2 is supported by recent isoform detection and cellular localization studies. The apical stereociliary membrane of auditory and vestibular hair cells is highly enriched for the PMCA2w/a variant (25Dumont R.A. Lins U. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Kachar B. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5066-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lactating mammary glands, PMCA2 is also expressed at very high levels in the apical membrane of epithelial cells where it is believed to play an essential role in transcellular Ca2+ transport into the (milk) lumen. In this tissue, the splice form corresponds to PMCA2w/b (33Reinhardt T.A. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C796-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Reinhardt T.A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1595-C1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in both cases where PMCA2 shows apical localization in polarized cell types, its splice configuration corresponds to the w variant at site A. By contrast, the splice site C configuration appears to be of lesser importance as it is a in one cell type but b in the other. Interestingly, Dumont et al. (25Dumont R.A. Lins U. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Kachar B. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5066-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently identified a novel PMCA2 splice site A variant expressed in the apical stereocilia of frog cochlear hair cells. This variant, termed “v,” encodes an even longer insert of 57 amino acids, consisting of the 45 residues found in the w variant and an additional 12 residues encoded by a separate exon. In mammals, however, a PMCA2 splice site A variant corresponding to frog PMCA2v has never been observed. Our knowledge concerning the spatial organization of Ca2+extrusion mechanisms at the plasma membrane is limited. Although the molecular characterization of the two major transport systems, the PMCAs and the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, has advanced rapidly over the last few years (reviewed in Refs. 2Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 35Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, and 36Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which these proteins are targeted to specific membrane domains and assembled into functional units with other Ca2+signaling molecules remain to be elucidated. How could the w insert at splice site A alter the membrane targeting of PMCA2? Two different but not mutually exclusive possibilities are as follows: 1) a change in the interaction of the pump with specific lipids, and 2) a difference in protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, the splice site A insert is situated immediately NH2-terminal to a phospholipid-sensitive region in the first cytosolic loop of the pump (37Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The 31 extra amino acids of the w splice form may alter the structural properties of the adjacent phospholipid-sensitive region and/or membrane-spanning domains to enable their preferential interaction with lipids enriched in apical membranes. The w insert is rich in hydrophobic (Ala and Leu) as well as in helix-breaking (Gly and Pro) residues (3Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Heim R. Hug M. Iwata T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and may thus assume a unique structural conformation. This structural motif may be involved in specific protein-protein interactions, e.g. with proteins involved in apical targeting or apical protein retention. A differential yeast two-hybrid screen with the first cytosolic loop of the w and x (or z) splice variants as bait may provide an attractive future approach to this problem. Finally, alternative splicing at site A of PMCA2 appears to be highly regulated. In IMR32 neuroblastoma cells, a specific and rapid switch from the 2w to the 2x variant occurs upon KCl depolarization. This splice switch is dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+, is independent of new protein synthesis, and can be observed within 30–45 min of cell stimulation (38Zacharias D.A. Strehler E.E. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1642-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although differential membrane distribution of PMCA2x and 2w variants has not been investigated in IMR32 cells, it is of interest that depolarization and a rise in Ca2+ are triggers of (neuronal) differentiation. Perhaps the alternative splice switch at site A of PMCA2 allows the cell to quickly re-distribute PMCA2 to membrane domains where they are needed. In neurons, this could be at newly forming synaptic sites in the dendrites. In epithelial cells of the mammary gland or the distal kidney, the PMCA2w splice form may be targeted to apical membranes in response to hormonal regulation of transcellular Ca2+ flux. Thus, alternative RNA splicing affecting the first cytosolic loop of PMCA2 appears to be a means for the regulated re-deployment of this Ca2+ pump to different membrane domains. We are grateful to Billie-Jo Brown and Anne Vrabel for help with the construction of the PMCA2b expression plasmids and to Aida Filoteo and Dr. John Penniston (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) for antibodies against the PMCAs. We thank Dr. Steve DeMarco for experimental advice and for teaching one of us (M. C.) how to operate the confocal microscope."

Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Perhaps related to these changes in proteoglycans are age-related increases in the water content of the dermis (11Pearce R.H. Grimmer B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1972; 58: 347-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and in the content of mobile water (17Richard S. Querleux B. Bittoun J. Jolivet O. Idy-Peretti I. de Lacharriere O. Leveque J.-L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 705-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although dermal proteoglycans are present in much lower abundance than collagen, evidence indicates that these molecules are important in the physiology of skin. For example, the small proteoglycan decorin binds to type I collagen (18Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and targeted disruption of decorin results in aberrant collagen fibrils and in a reduction in the tensile strength of skin (20Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Similarly, a patient with a variant form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was found to have a substantially reduced amount of dermal decorin (21Fushimi H. Kamayama M. Shinkai H. J. Int. Med. 1989; 226: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that decorin and versican are the major proteoglycans extracted from human skin (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A truncated form of decorin is abundant in extracts of postnatal skin, whereas fetal skin extracts contain little, if any, of this molecule (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Evidence presented herein indicates that this molecule is a catabolic fragment of decorin. This molecule is now referred to as decorunt to reflect its origin. In addition, data are presented showing that decorunt has a greatly reduced capacity to bind to type I collagen. The detection of a catabolic fragment of decorin in adult human skin, but not in fetal human skin, suggests that there are age-related increases in decorin turnover in this tissue and/or that decorunt is a nonmetabolized end product of decorin turnover that accumulates with age in skin. The sources of reagents for proteoglycan extraction and isolation and for SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were as described elsewhere (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additional reagents were obtained from the following sources. Monoclonal antibody 6B6, which recognizes an epitope in the core protein of decorin, was purchased from Seikagaku America. Antiserum to the carboxyl terminus of decorin and monoclonal antibodies 5D1, 3B3, and 6D6 against discrete epitopes in the core protein of decorin have been described previously (22Roughley P.J. White R.J. Magny M.-C. Liu J. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Pringle G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11558-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-VRKVTF antiserum was raised by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) against the synthetic peptide CGGVRKVTF conjugated to ovalbumin. Serum that had been clarified by centrifugation was used to probe immunoblots. Immobilon-N positively charged transfer membrane was obtained from Millipore, and octyl-Sepharose CL-4B was purchased from Sigma. Samples of fetal and adult human skin were obtained in accordance with the policies established by the Institutional Review Board of Case Western Reserve University as previously described (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fetal skin samples were obtained through the Central Laboratory for Human Embryology, University of Washington. Adult skin samples were obtained through the Tissue Procurement Core Facility, Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University. Because the human tissues used for this work were classified as discarded tissues, informed consents of the donors were not required. These procedures were as reported previously (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans were isolated by anion exchange chromatography and fractionated into large molecules (primarily versican) and small molecules (primarily decorin and decorunt) by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography with 4 mguanidinium chloride, 0.57 CHAPS,1 0.05 msodium acetate, pH 6.0, as the eluent. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by dot blot with appropriate antibodies. Selected fractions were pooled and concentrated with Centricon centrifugal concentrators to volumes less than 100 ॖl. Proteoglycans were precipitated by addition of 20 volumes of cold absolute ethanol followed by overnight incubation at −20 °C. Precipitated material was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C (12,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge). Each pellet was rinsed once with cold 20:1 ethanol:water by brief vortexing and centrifuged again. The final pellet was reconstituted in distilled water (0.1–0.5 ml depending on its size) and lyophilized to dryness. The samples were reconstituted in distilled water as before, and small aliquots were withdrawn for determination of total glycosaminoglycan by the Safranin O procedure (24Carrino D.A. Arias J.A. Caplan A.I. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 485-495PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then split into aliquots based on glycosaminoglycan content, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. For separation of decorin from decorunt, the small proteoglycans from Sepharose CL-2B were fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on octyl-Sepharose by a modification of a previously published procedure (25Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples corresponding to 25–300 ॖg of glycosaminoglycan were reconstituted in 1 ml of 2 mguanidinium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.3, and applied to a 2-ml column. The column was rinsed with 10 ml of the same solution, and the effluent was collected as unbound material. The column was then eluted with gradients of 2 and 6 mguanidinium chloride, both in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.3. The gradient consisted of 23 ml of each solution, and fractions of 0.45 ml were collected. The fractions were assayed by 6B6 dot blot of aliquots. Decorunt elutes in the unbound fraction (not shown), whereas decorin and the small amount of biglycan in the human skin proteoglycan samples are resolved by the gradient (25Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate fractions were pooled, and all pools, including the unbound material, were brought to 0.57 CHAPS by the addition of CHAPS from a 107 solution. The samples were concentrated, precipitated, and assayed as described above. The proteoglycan samples were reconstituted after lyophilization and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE on 5–17.57 gels, electrotransfer, and immunoblot analysis were performed as done previously (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that Immobilon-N transfer membrane was used. For detection of decorunt on immunoblots, positively charged transfer membrane is necessary because of the previously reported poor binding of decorunt to Immobilon-P and nitrocellulose (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hence, all of the immunoblots in this study were performed with Immobilon-N. Coomassie Blue-stained bands on SDS-PAGE gels were excised and washed extensively with 407 acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8. The gel pieces were dried in a SpeedVac before digestion overnight at 37 °C with 10 ॖl of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 20 ng/ॖl in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8. The digestion was terminated by the addition of 10 ॖl of 27 trifluoroacetic acid, which also extracted the peptides out of the gel. After a 1-h extraction at room temperature, the peptides were purified from the buffer with miniaturized C-18 reversed phase tips (ZiptipsTM, Millipore). The peptides were eluted directly onto the sample target. The matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was used on an AnchorchipTM target (Bruker Daltonik). For post-source decay experiments, the matrix α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid was used. Mass spectrometric studies were performed with a Bruker Scout 384 Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The instrument was used in the positive ion mode with delayed extraction and an acceleration voltage of 25 kV. The peptide samples were analyzed with the reflector detector, and 50–100 single-shot spectra were accumulated for improved signal-to-noise ratio. The spectra were internally calibrated with autolysis fragments of trypsin. For samples digested with endoproteinases Lys-C and Glu-C, external calibration was used. The BIAcoreTM2000 system was used to characterize the interaction between decorin/decorunt and type I collagen (bovine dermal collagen I; Invitrogen). The carboxymethylated dextran surface on the chip (CM5 sensor chip; BIAcore) was activated with 35 ॖl of 50 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide and 35 ॖl of 200 mmN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 ॖl/min. Collagen type I (35 ॖl at 3 ॖg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0) was immobilized at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 ॖl/min. One surface containing no coupled protein was used as a blank. The remaining activated groups were blocked with 40 ॖl of 1 methanolamine, pH 8.5. The immobilization of collagen I resulted in ∼600 resonance units (1000 resonance units = 1 ng/mm2). The binding assay was performed at 25 °C with different concentrations of decorin or decorunt (2-fold dilution series) ranging from 0.31 to 20 ॖg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.0057 Tween 20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The surface was regenerated with two injections of 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 9.2, and one injection of 2m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, for decorin. Decorunt was more easily removed, so in this case the buffer at pH 9.2 was exchanged for the same buffer with pH 8.5 to spare proteins at the chip surface. To assess the influence of the glycosaminoglycan chain upon binding, experiments were performed without and after digestion of the proteoglycan samples with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 milliunit/ॖg of proteoglycan in 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 for 4 h). Removal of the glycosaminoglycan was verified by SDS-PAGE. Skin specimens were fixed in 107 neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. The sections were blocked with bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 6B6 mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-VRKVTF antiserum, or nonimmune rabbit serum. The sections were then washed and incubated with appropriate second antibody conjugated with peroxidase. Peroxidase was visualized with the VIP substrate kit, which was purchased from Vector Laboratories. Photographs were taken with Kodak T-MAX 100 film on an Olympus BH-2 microscope. In all, skin samples from 10 different donors were examined by immunohistochemistry. These samples ranged in age from fetal to 82 years old. Previous analysis of proteoglycans extracted from human skin revealed that decorin is the major proteoglycan present and that versican is also present at all ages examined and is found at its highest abundance in fetal skin (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, human skin also contains a truncated form of decorin now referred to as decorunt. The core protein of decorunt is ∼17 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). That decorunt is related to decorin is indicated by the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of these molecules, which are identical (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular characteristics of decorunt, the molecule was analyzed on immunoblots with probes that recognize different regions of decorin (Fig.1). Both molecules are recognized by monoclonal antibody 6B6 in all adult skin proteoglycan samples tested (Fig. 2). The lack of strong decorunt reactivity in fetal skin proteoglycans (Fig. 2) is consistent with the virtual absence of decorunt from fetal skin, as has been described previously (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The exact epitope for 6B6 has not been reported. However, with CNBr-treated human skin decorin, 6B6 is found to recognize a large fragment containing the glycosaminoglycan (data not shown). This places the 6B6 epitope somewhere between the amino terminus of the mature core protein (amino acid 31) and the first methionine residue of the mature core protein (amino acid 148) (Fig.1).Figure 2Reactivity of decorin and decorunt with monoclonal antibody 6B6. Proteoglycans were isolated from adult human skin of the indicated ages and anatomic sites and from fetal human skin (combined trunk and scalp skin) of 120 days estimated gestational age. The proteoglycan samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to Immobilon-N. The blot was probed with 6B6. brs, breast; abd, abdomen; fac, face.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoblot analysis was also performed with an antiserum that was raised against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of decorin (amino acids 348–359) (22Roughley P.J. White R.J. Magny M.-C. Liu J. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For both of the samples of adult skin proteoglycans that were tested, this antiserum recognizes decorin, as expected but does not recognize decorunt (Fig.3). This result is obtained both with intact proteoglycans and with core proteins generated by treatment of the samples with chondroitinase ABC prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Further analysis of decorunt was performed with three monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes have been mapped to different regions of the core protein of decorin (23Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Pringle G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11558-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three of these antibodies recognize human skin decorin in the samples tested (not shown). Antibody 6D6, the epitope of which is residues 270–273, does not recognize decorunt (not shown). Antibody 3B3 (residues 173–180) also does not recognize decorunt, whereas antibody 5D1 (residues 150–157) is able to recognize decorunt (data not shown). The locations of the epitopes for 3B3 and 5D1 suggest that the carboxyl terminus of decorunt lies between residues 157 and 173 of decorin (Fig. 1). This corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼15–17 kDa, which correlates well with the value from SDS-PAGE (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The first approach to characterize decorunt by mass spectrometry was to take the chondroitinase-treated sample and measure its mass by MALDI-TOF MS. However, the sample was found to contain multiple components, and decorunt showed a broad heterogeneous peak that could not be accurately assigned (∼17 kDa). To obtain a more detailed picture of the cleavage site, decorunt was mapped at the peptide level after enzymatic digestion with combinations of various endoproteinases. Trypsin and Lys-C were first used, but the resulting peptide maps did not contain any unknown peptide masses in the measured mass range of 750–3500 Da. The amino-terminal part of decorin was covered by more than 20 peptides (Fig. 4) with the most carboxyl-terminal peptide being AHENEITKVR (residues 157–166) with one missed cleavage. The next peptide to be detected is VTFNGLNQMIVIELGTNPLK (residues 168–187) with a monoisotopic mass of 2201.20 Da. This peptide was easily detected in intact decorin but was absent from the decorunt. Thus, the cleavage site appears to be located within this sequence. The absence of unknown peptides might be a result of the cleavage site being positioned at the beginning of this sequence, which would thereby produce a peptide too small for detection. To provide further information, aliquots were digested with a different endoproteinase having a different specificity, endoproteinase Glu-C. The peptide map of this digest contains a strong signal from a mismatched peptide with a mass of 1091.74 Da. This peptide mass fits perfectly (expected mass, 1091.69) with the peptide ITKVRKVTF (residues 162–170). To confirm the identity of the peptide, a tandem mass spectrometry experiment was performed with post-source decay to fragment the peptide. The corresponding post-source decay spectrum is shown in Fig.5, where the b and y ion series are annotated and cover 6 of 9 amino acids. The same cleavage site was identified in decorunt isolated from four different samples of skin from individuals of 20, 34, 48, and 68 years of age. The cleavage site would not be detected by trypsin or Lys-C digestion, because the peptide VTF (365.2 Da) is too small to be accurately detected by MALDI-TOF MS because of high matrix signals in this part of the spectrum.Figure 5Post-source decay MALDI-TOF mass spectrum annotated with b and y ions matching the neoepitope sequence ITKVRKVTF obtained after digestion with chymotrypsin. The b ion series covers a sequence tag of six amino acids, TKVRKV, the y ion series covers VKRV, and the c8 ion represents the loss of Phe from the intact peptide. The average mass error, calculated by linear mass calibration, was 0.16 Da. The presence of immonium ions from Arg, Val, Ile, and Lys residues further supports the inferred sequence. Abs. Int., absolute intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding properties of decorunt and decorin for collagen I were studied with surface plasmon resonance. The binding and dissociation curves obtained at various decorin/decorunt concentrations are shown in Fig. 6. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) for decorin were experimentally estimated to be 1.2 and 2.9 nmfor intact and chondroitinase-treated decorin, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for decorunt were 268 and 228 nm. The decorin constants were obtained by conventional (Langmuir 1:1) curve fitting with drifting base line, whereas no good fit was obtained with any model for decorunt. There are several potential explanations for this. For example, perhaps there are two conformations of decorunt that act differently in binding to collagen, or decorunt might change conformation after binding. However, at steady state affinity (especially in the case of chondroitinase-treated decorunt), the plateau level just at the end of the injection phase can be used to provide a rough estimate of the KD value. Because the response from decorunt was significantly lower, the dilution series starts at twice the concentration to obtain significant signals for kinetic evaluations. The difference in binding affinity is ∼100-fold between decorin and decorunt. The removal of the glycosaminoglycans had only marginal effects on the KD values. For decorin, this value increased from 1.2 to 2.9 nm, whereas for decorunt it decreased from 268 to 228 nm. Additionally, a reduced response was observed in the case of decorunt. A neoepitope antiserum was generated against the VRKVTF carboxyl terminus of decorunt. This polyclonal rabbit antiserum recognizes decorunt in every adult skin proteoglycan sample tested (Fig. 7). Importantly, anti-VRKVTF does not recognize intact decorin, which is present in all of the skin proteoglycan samples tested, as indicated by a companion blot probed with 6B6 as a control (Fig. 7). Anti-VRKVTF also does not detect decorunt in the sole fetal skin proteoglycan sample tested (Fig.7), which is consistent with the absence of decorunt from fetal skin (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With adult skin proteoglycan samples treated with chondroitinase ABC prior to electrophoresis, anti-VRKVTF is observed to recognize the core protein of decorunt but not the core proteins of decorin (not shown). Incubation of anti-VRKVTF antiserum with 10 ॖmCCGVRKVTF, the synthetic peptide used for generation of anti-VRKVTF, effectively abrogates binding of the antiserum to decorunt on an immunoblot (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that anti-VRKVTF specifically recognizes the VRKVTF carboxyl terminus of decorunt. Immunohistochemical staining of normal adult human skin indicates the presence of decorin and decorunt in the extracellular matrix of the dermis (Fig. 8). There does not appear to be any specific staining of either decorin or decorunt in the epidermis. Although immunostaining for decorin is strong throughout the entire dermis, immunostaining for decorunt is weak in the outer dermis and strong elsewhere in the dermis (Fig. 8). For both decorin and decorunt, there is a fibrillar pattern of immunostaining, wherein the molecules seem to be co-localized with the collagen fibrils of the dermis. In our previous analysis of the proteoglycans of human skin, a truncated form of decorin was detected in adult skin but not in fetal skin (16Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This observation is based on analysis of eight samples of fetal skin ranging in age from 80 to 120 days estimated gestational"
https://openalex.org/W2058437764,"The most potent known naturally occurring Bowman-Birk inhibitor, sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 (SFTI-1), is a bicyclic 14-amino acid peptide from sunflower seeds comprising one disulfide bond and a cyclic backbone. At present, little is known about the cyclization mechanism of SFTI-1. We show here that an acyclic permutant of SFTI-1 open at its scissile bond, SFTI-1[6,5], also functions as an inhibitor of trypsin and that it can be enzymatically backbone-cyclized by incubation with bovine β-trypsin. The resulting ratio of cyclic SFTI-1 to SFTI-1[6,5] is ∼9:1 regardless of whether trypsin is incubated with SFTI-1[6,5] or SFTI-1. Enzymatic resynthesis of the scissile bond to form cyclic SFTI-1 is a novel mechanism of cyclization of SFTI-1[6,5]. Such a reaction could potentially occur on a trypsin affinity column as used in the original isolation procedure of SFTI-1. We therefore extracted SFTI-1 from sunflower seeds without a trypsin purification step and confirmed that the backbone of SFTI-1 is indeed naturally cyclic. Structural studies on SFTI-1[6,5] revealed high heterogeneity, and multiple species of SFTI-1[6,5] were identified. The main species closely resembles the structure of cyclic SFTI-1 with the broken binding loop able to rotate between a cis/trans geometry of the I7–P8 bond with the cis conformer being similar to the canonical binding loop conformation. The non-reactive loop adopts a β-hairpin structure as in cyclic wild-type SFTI-1.

Over recent years there has been much interest in the discovery of circular proteins in higher organisms (1Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and in the development in synthetic approaches to cyclize proteins (2Li P. Roller P.P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In general, backbone cyclic peptides have several advantages over their non-cyclic counterparts. They are resistant to attack by exopeptidases, making them less vulnerable to degradation and can have an increased thermal stability (3Iwai H. Pluckthun A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Also, unfavorable entropic losses upon binding to target proteins are significantly reduced, resulting in a thermodynamically more efficient binding interaction (1Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These biological advantages of backbone cyclized peptides may lead to their use as scaffolds for the design of stable pharmaceuticals and pesticides (4Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2002; 5: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). The new generation of circular peptides/proteins discovered in the last few years differs from previously known cyclic peptides such as cyclosporins in that the latter are generally not direct gene products but are synthesized in bacteria by multifunctional enzymes and often contain non-conventional amino acids (5Gewolb J. Science. 2002; 295: 2205-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By contrast, recently discovered circular miniproteins such as the plant cyclotides (6Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) are gene products that are post-translationally processed to cyclize their conventional peptide backbone (7Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although in vitro cyclization procedures are now being developed for the synthetic production of circular proteins, little is known about the mechanisms and driving force behind in vivo cyclization of naturally occurring cyclic proteins. This is in part because limited knowledge about the locality of the NH2- and COOH termini of putative linear precursors of cyclic proteins makes predictions about cyclization mechanisms difficult. More than 50 naturally occurring backbone cyclized proteins have now been reported (1Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), with three of these being proteinase inhibitors: MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II from Momordica cochinchinensis (8Finkenstadt W.R.

The Bowman-Birk (BB) inhibitor SFTI-1, shown in Fig. 1, is the focus of the current study and is the smallest known cyclic plant peptide. It is the most potent and only known cyclic BB inhibitor, having a Ki value for trypsin in the sub-nanomolar range (10Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J. Konarev A.V. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R.

Commun. 2002; 292: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cyclic backbone of SFTI-1 does not appear to be essential for the high potency, because we recently showed that SFTI-1[1,14], an acyclic permutant of SFTI-1, with a break in the backbone chain between residues 1 and 14 (see Fig. 1), also has a very high affinity for trypsin (11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J. Condie B.A. Otvos L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although its Ki value is apparently about 20-fold weaker than the cyclic form, this difference is not highly significant due to the difficulties of accurately determining Ki values for such potent inhibitors (15Waltham M.C. Holland J.W. Robinson S.C. Winzor D.J. Nixon P.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Zablotna et al. (14Zablotna E. Kazmierczak K. Jaskiewicz A. Stawikowski M. Kupryszewski G. Rolka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) also recently reported that there is essentially no difference between the inhibitory potencies of cyclic SFTI-1 and this particular acyclic derivative. Thus, it would appear that structural conservation of the reactive loop of SFTI-1[1,14], rather than the cyclic backbone, is essential for potency and that a slight disordering of the open termini in the non-reactive loop of SFTI-1[1,14] does not significantly reduce binding efficiency to trypsin. Although the role of cyclization is not certain, it has been suggested that the cyclic backbone of native SFTI-1 possibly evolved to protect it against degradation by proteases to allow SFTI-1 to function over an extended in vivo lifetime (11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J. Condie B.A. Otvos L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of cyclization for SFTI-1 may therefore have potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry and for the design of improved peptidic drugs. Nothing is known so far about the cyclization mechanism for SFTI-1 in planta, and there are no data describing enzymes with the specificity necessary to perform this task. Here we describe an in vitro enzymatic mechanism for the cyclization of a linear precursor of SFTI-1, SFTI-1[6,5] (Fig. 1), that is open at the scissile bond, i.e. the bond that would normally be cleaved in homologous substrates. Although this mechanism, based on the reversible equilibrium between species containing an intact and a cleaved peptide bond, is generally applicable to many serine proteinase inhibitors, SFTI-1 is the first example of an inhibitor in which the peptide bond resynthesis results in a backbone cyclic peptide. The gene sequence of the putative precursor protein of SFTI-1 is unknown, and the demonstration of enzymatic cyclization of a linear analogue of SFTI-1 potentially provides insight into a theoretically possible in vivo precursor. In the current study we have gained a structural insight into five conformers/isomers of this putative acyclic precursor and have determined full three-dimensional structures for two of the conformers, which we compare with the structure of SFTI-1. In addition, anti-trypsin activity assays were carried out for SFTI-1[6,5], and the products of a 1:1 reaction mixture of trypsin and SFTI-1[6,5] have been analyzed. The results have provided an insight into potential mechanisms of cyclization of SFTI-1 in vitro and in vivo. Solid-phase Synthesis of Acyclic SFTI-1[6,5]—The solid phase synthesis of SFTI-1[6,5] was carried out as described for another acyclic SFTI-1 variant (11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J. Condie B.A. Otvos L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptide was air-oxidized in 0.1 m of ammonium bicarbonate solution, pH 8.0, for 12 to 24 h and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a conventional C18 column and a water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid elution system. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry verified the mass of SFTI-1[6,5] with an m/z value of 766.3 for the doubly charged peak. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples prepared for NMR spectroscopy contained ∼2 mm SFTI-1[6,5] in 20 mm sodium phosphate (H2O/D2O, 90/10%, v/v) at pH 4.5. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra recorded over the temperature range 280–310 K revealed that the dispersion of peaks was optimal at 286 K. Homonuclear two-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded at 286 and 298 K on a Bruker DMX750 spectrometer. NOESY and TOCSY spectra used a WATERGATE scheme (16Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) for water suppression. The mixing times for the NOESY spectra were 200 and 300 ms, and the mixing time for the MLEV17 sequence (17Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) was 80 ms. Water suppression in the DQF-COSY experiment was achieved using selective low power irradiation of the water resonance during a relaxation delay of 1.3 s. 16,384 data points were collected for one-dimensional spectra, and 4,096 data points in the t2 and 512 increments in the t1 dimension were collected for two-dimensional experiments. NOESY, TOCSY, and E.COSY spectra were recorded in D2O at 286 K. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra at 286 K over a period of 12 h on a sample immediately after dissolution in 99.996% D2O. A sequence-specific resonance assignment was performed by standard methods (18Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Cis proline residues were identified by strong Hα(i)/Pro-Hα(i+1) NOE signals in the NOESY spectrum, whereas a trans conformation was evidenced by unambiguous Hα(i)/Pro-Hδ(i+1) NOE signals and the absence of Hα(i)/Pro-Hα(i+1) connectivities (18Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). 3JNHα coupling constants were obtained from a high resolution one-dimensional spectrum and from line-shape analysis of the anti-phase cross-signal splitting in a high digital resolution DQF-COSY spectrum using a Lorentzian function for peak fitting. The χ1-angles for side-chain rotamers were obtained from line-shape analysis of Hα–Hβ couplings in an E.COSY spectrum together with NOE intensity patterns between resolved HN–Hβ protons. Secondary chemical shifts were obtained using published random coil values (19Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), and specific corrections for residues preceding a proline (19Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) were taken into account. Structure Calculations—Distance constraints were derived from the intensities of cross-peak signals from NOESY spectra at 286 K recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms. The spectrum at 298 K was used to resolve ambiguities due to spectral overlap. Distance restraints were divided into three groups according to the relative NOESY cross-peak intensities: strong, upper distance limit of 2.7 Å; medium, upper distance limit of 3.5 Å; weak, upper distance limit of 5.0 Å. All structures were calculated using X-PLOR 3.851 (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.851. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) with a modified ab initio simulated annealing protocol (21Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The structure calculation strategy was based on a three-stage simulated annealing protocol (22Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Neudecker P. Schweimer K. Nerkamp J. Scheurer S. Vieths S. Sticht H. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 25: 22756-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For details see the Supplementary Material. An iterative approach using several rounds of structure calculations with subsequent distance analysis was used to solve ambiguities in NOE cross-peak assignments. Dihedral angle constraints were introduced in the later rounds of structure calculations. Distance constraints for hydrogen bonds were generated based on deuterium exchange data and by examination of structure families calculated without hydrogen-bond constraints. The 20 structures with lowest overall energies from the final 50 structures were retained for further analysis. Structures were visualized using the program MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Trypsin Assays—Trypsin assays were carried out at 303 K as described by Korsinczky et al. (11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J. Condie B.A. Otvos L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The concentration of SFTI-1[6,5] was determined by amino acid analysis. SFTI-1[6,5] (0–150 nm) and trypsin (42 nm) were preincubated together for3hat303K.The reactions were initiated by addition of substrate and monitored at 405 nm with readings taken every 2 min with shaking between readings using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 250. All reactions were carried out in duplicate, and the corresponding Ki value was determined using a tight-binding equation (26Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mass Spectroscopy/Monitoring of the Trypsin-dependent Interconversion of SFTI-1[6,5] to SFTI-1—SFTI-1[6,5] and bovine β-trypsin (Type XIII l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, EC 3.4.21.4) were incubated together at 303 K in a 1:1 ratio (350 nm each), at pH 8.0, 50 mm Tris HCl, 25 mm CaCl2. 20-μl aliquots were taken in duplicate after 2 min and every 15 min for the first 2 h and every 30 min for the next 2 h and then every hour. The reaction was stopped by a sudden pH drop to <1 by immediate addition of 5 μl of trifluoroacetic acid to the aliquots with vigorous shaking. The samples were subjected to LC-MS analysis, using an electrospray Qq time of flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated under positive ion detection conditions: declustering potential of 80 V, focusing potential of 250 V, declustering potential 2 of 10 V, and ion spray sprayer level of 5000 V. Extracted ion chromatograms for the doubly protonated SFTI-1[6,5] (m/z 766.3) and SFTI-1 (m/z 757.3) were constructed, and the ratio of the two peaks was calculated using both peak area and height. The integrity of the initial measurements was determined by re-measuring the amounts of SFTI-1 and SFTI-1[6,5] from the initial reaction aliquots 1 day after the initial readings. An unchanged result for the two peptides proved that trifluoroacetic acid addition did not degrade either SFTI-1 or SFTI-1[6,5] and did completely stop the trypsin reaction. Isolation of SFTI-1 from Sunflower Seeds—Sunflower seeds (about 1 week prior to maturation) were ground with dry ice, and the mixture was defatted with chilled petroleum spirit (10Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J. Konarev A.V. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The mixture was filtered, and a water extraction was made from the dried solid phase. The water extract was divided in two portions, and to eliminate possible protease activity one portion was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to drop the pH to <1. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm the supernatants of both extracts were directly subjected to LC-MS analysis and yielded identical results. Multiple SFTI-1[6,5] Conformers/Isomers—The conformation of SFTI-1[6,5] in aqueous solution, pH 4.5, was determined using NMR spectroscopy. The two-dimensional spectra contained more signals than expected for a 14-amino acid peptide (Fig. 2). Because the peptide was chemically pure, the additional spin systems must derive from multiple solution conformations (cis/trans isomerization of the three proline residues), or co-eluting isomers. Careful analysis showed that five conformers/isomers, called A1, A2, B, C1, and C2 (Fig. 3), were present in sufficient quantities to exhibit signal sets that were detected in both TOCSY and NOESY spectra. These five conformers/isomers can be viewed as three major species, A, B, and C, two of which (A and C) split further into two conformers each due to cis/trans isomerization of P8 or P9 in the NH2-terminal part of the peptide. Species A and C are conformers of SFTI-1[6,5], and species B is an isomer, with an altered D14 configuration. For consistency and for comparison with cyclic SFTI-1, we retain the original numbering scheme, starting at G1, but note that SFTI-1[6,5] is a linear peptide with a sequence from the NH2 to COOH termini of S6–I7... T4–K5.Fig. 3Schematic summary of the identified species (A–C) of SFTI-1[6,5]. The top panel shows SFTI-1[6,5] in one-letter amino acid code, and the disulfide bond between residues C3 and C11 is represented as a bold line. The double line between residues P9 and I10 indicates the break between the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments of signal sets. The right lower panel shows residues K5–I10 of species A, B, and C (COOH-terminal signal sets) highlighting some key residues. The segments ct, tt, and tc (NH2-terminal signal sets), containing residues S6–P9, are shown in the left lower panel. Dotted lines indicate the sequential connections between I10 and P9 of species A, B, and C with the corresponding segments ct, tt, and tc to form the five different conformers/isomers, including the sub-species of A (A1 and A2) and C (C1 and C2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Species A, the major species of SFTI-1[6,5], exists as two conformers (A1 and A2) (Fig. 3) evidenced by two sets of spin systems for residues S6 to P9 that differ only in cis/trans isomerization of P8, with the trans conformation (A2) being more abundant. For species B all three Xaa-Pro bonds adopt a trans conformation as for A2, but the backbone chemical shifts are notably different from those of species A (Fig. 2). The most striking feature that distinguishes species B from all the other species is the presence of an iso-aspartate residue at position 14, as deduced from the clear absence of a Hα(i)HN(i+1) sequential NOE, together with strong Hβ(i)HN(i+1) NOEs. Furthermore, the high 3JHαHN coupling constant (>9 Hz) of residue 14 of species B correlates with an extended φ-angle of 120 ± 40°. This angle is easier to fulfill if the non-binding loop is extended by the additional methylene group resulting in a more relaxed ring structure. Species C exhibits an F12/P13 cis orientation, and the four NH2-terminal amino acids (S6–P9) adopt two different conformations: one with P8 and P9 both in the trans orientation (C1), and one with P8 in the trans and P9 in the cis orientation (C2) (Fig. 3). For the NH2-terminal segment of C2, only the two proline residues could be definitively assigned. Out of the three species, A exhibits backbone chemical shifts that most closely resemble the corresponding shifts of native cyclic SFTI-1 (Fig. 4), and A1 exhibits the same geometry for all three prolines as cyclic SFTI-1 (11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J. Condie B.A. Otvos L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1JBL). Secondary Structure of SFTI-1[6,5] Conformers/Isomers—A summary of the secondary chemical shifts from I10 to T4 for all three SFTI-1[6,5] species relative to those of cyclic SFTI-1 is given in Fig. 4. Consecutive downfield shifted Hα resonances, indicative of extended structure, were found for G1 to C3 of both cyclic SFTI-1 and the SFTI-1[6,5] species A, with another distinctive downfield shifted value for C11. Species C exhibits consecutive upfield shifted Hα resonances for residues F12 to D14, indicating helical or turn-like structure. For species B, no indications of regular secondary structure were found. These findings were supported by an analysis of the 3JNHα coupling constants. For species A they were >8 Hz for C3, C11, and I10, representing residues in an extended structure. For species B F12 and iso-D14 had coupling constants >8 Hz, and for species C only C11 exhibited a coupling constant typical of an extended conformation. No coupling constants <6 Hz, which are typical of an α-helix, were detected for any of the three species. Slow exchanging amide protons were only detected for I10, F12, G1, and R2 of species A. Further evidence for a β-sheet like structure for species A was deduced by a strong Hα–Hα NOE between the two cysteine residues. In summary, evidence for regular secondary structure could only be deduced for species A, indicating a small anti-parallel β-sheet. Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were performed for the four conformers and one isomer of SFTI-1[6,5]. Input data and structure statistics are summarized in Table I. The structure calculations provided well-defined structures for the two conformers of species A with a backbone r.m.s.d. for the final 20 structures of 0.49 Å for A1 and 0.45 Å for A2 (protein data bank codes: A1, 1O8Z; A2, 1O8Y).Table IStructural and energetical statistics for the conformers / isomers of SFTI-1[6,5]Conformers/isomersSpeciesABCA1A2BC1C2NOEs6373364735θ-Angle restraints33211χ1-Angle restraints33222Hydrogen-bonds44Energy statistics over 20 structureskcal/molOverall30.05 ± 0.1729.91 ± 0.0329.93 ± 0.0532.86 ± 0.9234.09 ± 1.12Bond length1.07 ± 0.011.05 ± 0.0051.05 ± 0.0081.25 ± 0.111.29 ± 0.08Bond angles26.22 ± 0.1026.12 ± 0.0326.16 ± 0.0727.74 ± 0.5028.86 ± 0.86Improper1.88 ± 0.011.89 ± 0.0021.89 ± 0.0041.99 ± 0.132.08 ± 0.16van der Waals0.84 ± 0.040.84 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.031.54 ± 0.351.64 ± 0.31NOEs0.04 ± 0.060.005 ± 0.010.003 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.320.23 ± 0.23Angle restraints0.0 ± 0.00.00001 ± 0.000060.000003 ± 0.000010.0005 ± 0.00210.00004 ± 0.0001Atomic RMSDs values from the average structuresÅOverallBackbone0.4920.4502.3242.1042.288Heavy atoms1.2061.0673.4623.1523.089C11-3Backbone0.1340.0931.1571.0020.916Heavy atoms0.9400.8322.3612.0771.906 Open table in a new tab Species A exhibits a hairpin structure that is similar for both conformations (A1/A2) and closely resembles the corresponding region of cyclic wild-type SFTI-1, i.e. a short double-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet connected by the disulfide bridge and stabilized by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5). The difference between the two conformations is the cis/trans isomerization of P8. The I7–P8 bond shows a cis orientation in the minor conformer A1, essentially maintaining the binding loop orientation, even though the backbone is open between residues K5 and S6. In the major conformer A2, P8 is in a trans configuration, giving the binding loop an extended conformation (Fig. 5). The structure calculations for species B and the two conformations of species C did not result in convergent structures due to limited NOE information. However, it could be deduced, from chemical shift data and the absence of certain characteristic NOEs, that the small β-sheet found for both conformations of species A is not present in species B and C. Trypsin Catalyzed Cyclization of SFTI-1[6,5]—Although trypsin is normally used to facilitate proteolysis, i.e. peptide bond cleavage, this equilibrium reaction is in principle reversible, and we were interested to see if presentation of an acyclic precursor species would result in cyclization. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of SFTI-1[6,5] with bovine β-trypsin was incubated at 303 K (pH 8). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken over a 24-h period, and LC-MS analysis confirmed that cyclic SFTI-1 was indeed produced. The ratio of the intact and cleaved form of SFTI-1 was determined by quantitative analysis of the peaks with masses corresponding to SFTI-1[6,5] and cyclic SFTI-1 (Fig. 6). After 2 min of reaction time, cyclic SFTI-1 could be detected. A steady state was reached after ∼130 min and resulted in ∼90% SFTI-1 to 10% SFTI-1[6,5] (Fig. 6). Coelution experiments with added synthetic SFTI-1 and SFTI-1[6,5] confirmed that the resulting molecules are indeed the cleaved and intact inhibitor. The above procedure was repeated starting with cyclic SFTI-1 under the same conditions. After a reaction time of ∼2 h, cleaved SFTI-1[6,5] in a yield of about 7% was recovered. Therefore, a ratio of cyclic SFTI-1 to SFTI-1[6,5] of ∼9:1 was reached regardless of whether the reaction was initiated with SFTI-1 or SFTI-1[6,5]. Isolation and Verification of the Cyclic Nature of SFTI-1 in Sunflower Seeds—The previously reported isolation procedure of SFTI-1 from sunflower seeds (10Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1968925987,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) and protein kinase C (PKC) are two distinct enzyme families associated with diacylglycerol. Both enzymes have cysteine-rich C1 domains (C1A, C1B, and C1C) in the regulatory region. Although most PKC C1 domains strongly bind phorbol esters, there has been no direct evidence that DGK C1 domains bind phorbol esters. We synthesized 11 cysteine-rich sequences of DGK C1 domains with good sequence homology to those of the PKC C1 domains. Among them, only DGKγ-C1A and DGKβ-C1A exhibited significant binding to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Scatchard analysis of rat-DGKγ-C1A, human-DGKγ-C1A, and human-DGKβ-C1A gaveKd values of 3.6, 2.8, and 14.6 nm, respectively, suggesting that DGKγ and DGKβ are new targets of phorbol esters. An A12T mutation of human-DGKβ-C1A enhanced the affinity to bind PDBu, indicating that the β-hydroxyl group of Thr-12 significantly contributes to the binding. TheKd value for PDBu of FLAG-tagged whole rat-DGKγ (4.4 nm) was nearly equal to that of rat-DGKγ-C1A (3.6 nm). Moreover, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced the irreversible translocation of whole rat-DGKγ and its C1B deletion mutant, not the C1A deletion mutant, from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells. These results indicate that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate binds to C1A of DGKγ to cause its translocation.

We synthesized 11 cysteine-rich sequences of DGK C1 domains with good sequence homology to those of the PKC C1 domains. Among them, only DGKγ-C1A and DGKβ-C1A exhibited significant binding to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Scatchard analysis of rat-DGKγ-C1A, human-DGKγ-C1A, and human-DGKβ-C1A gaveKd values of 3.6, 2.8, and 14.6 nm, respectively, suggesting that DGKγ and DGKβ are new targets of phorbol esters. An A12T mutation of human-DGKβ-C1A enhanced the affinity to bind PDBu, indicating that the β-hydroxyl group of Thr-12 significantly contributes to the binding. TheKd value for PDBu of FLAG-tagged whole rat-DGKγ (4.4 nm) was nearly equal to that of rat-DGKγ-C1A (3.6 nm). Moreover, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced the irreversible translocation of whole rat-DGKγ and its C1B deletion mutant, not the C1A deletion mutant, from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells. These results indicate that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate binds to C1A of DGKγ to cause its translocation. diacylglycerol kinase Chinese hamster ovary diacylglycerol green fluorescent protein N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (−)-indolactam-V ingenol 3-benzoate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate 1,2-di-(cis-9-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine protein kinase C 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate high pressure liquid chromatography N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK)1 and protein kinase C (PKC) both interact with the second messenger diacylglycerol (DG) (1Houssa B. van Blitterswijk W.J.

DGK phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid, whereas PKC is allosterically activated by DG in the presence of phosphatidylserine. Therefore, DGK may inhibit the activation of PKC by attenuating DG levels, contributing to the regulation of intracellular signal transduction. To date, nine subtypes of mammalian DGKs have been cloned (3–15). All DGK isozymes consist of a conserved catalytic domain and two or three cysteine-rich C1 domains designated as C1A, C1B, and C1C (16Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These isozymes are classified into five classes according to the other functional domains (Fig. 1). The class I isozymes (DGKα, -β, and -γ) have calcium binding domains (EF-hands). The class II isozymes (DGKδ and -η) have a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus, and their catalytic region is split into two domains unlike the other DGK isozymes. DGKε has a simple structure and is classified as a class III isozyme. The class IV isozymes DGKζ and ι have a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate homology domain and four ankyrin repeats. DGKθ, which has three C1 domains unlike other DGK and PKC isozymes, is the only isozyme in class V. The similarity between DGK and PKC isozymes in structure is in the cysteine-rich C1 domains. Recent investigations using NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography have revealed the three-dimensional structure of C1B domains of PKCα, PKCγ, and PKCδ (17Hommel U. Zurini M. Luyten M. Nat.

Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Each PKC C1 domain has six conserved cysteines and two histidines in the typical core structure HX12CX2CX13–14CX2CX4HX2CX7C (where X is any amino acid) that coordinates two atoms of zinc in a tetrahedral geometry (21Hubbard S.R.

We previously synthesized the 50-mer core structure of the C1 domains of all PKC isozymes and showed that most of the C1 domains of conventional and novel PKC isozymes strongly bind phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) with dissociation constants (Kd) in the nanomolar range (23Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Fukuda H. Wender P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 2073-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The core structure of DGK C1 domains, HX10–12CX2–6CX9–19CX2CX4HX2–4CX5–10C, is slightly different from that of PKC C1 domains, but the six cysteines and two histidines are precisely conserved. In particular, DGKβ-C1A, DGKγ-C1A, DGKδ-C1A, DGKδ-C1B, DGKη-C1A, and DGKθ-C1C have the same core structure as the PKC C1 domains (Fig. 2) and are deduced to show a significant phorbol ester binding affinity. However, there have been no reports that DGK isozymes bind phorbol esters. Ahmed et al. (25Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lee J. Montries C. Harden N. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that human-DGKα expressed in Escherichia coli or in COS-7 cells did not bind PDBu. Sakane et al. (26Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-I. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) also detected no specific PDBu binding in either rat-DGKβ or human-DGKγ expressed in COS-7 cells. On the other hand, a recent investigation by Shirai et al.(27Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) clearly showed that DGKγ expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane irreversibly following 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) treatment. They also suggested that the C1A domain of DGKγ is responsible for this translocation based on the point mutation of each C1 domain. These results prompted us to examine the phorbol ester binding ability of each DGKγ C1 domain, and we have reported recently (28Shindo M. Irie K. Ohigashi H. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that rat-DGKγ binds PDBu with high affinity as a preliminary communication. Further detailed studies on the C1 domains of several DGK isozymes other than those of rat-DGKγ have been carried out along with the C1A peptide of human-DGKγ which Sakaneet al. (26Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-I. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) employed. These additional data have been compiled to give this full report. The following spectroscopic and analytical instruments were used: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), Applied Biosystems Voyager-DETM STR (20 kV); peptide synthesizer, PioneerTM peptide synthesizer model 9030 (Applied Biosystems); and HPLC, Waters model 600E with model 2487UV detector. MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were carried out as follows; each peptide dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution (50 pmol/μl) was mixed with saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a ratio of 1:1. One microliter of the resultant solution was subjected to the measurement. Angiotensin I and ACTH-(7–38) were used as external references. HPLC was carried out on a YMC-packed SH-342-5 (ODS, 20 mm inner diameter × 150 mm) column (Yamamura Chemical Laboratory) for preparative purposes. [3H]PDBu (17.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science. COS-7 cells were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Unless otherwise noted, reagents were purchased from Sigma, Allexis, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, or Nacalai Tesque. The 49–52-mer peptides corresponding to the cysteine-rich sequences of DGK isozyme C1 domains (Table I and Fig. 2) were synthesized in a stepwise fashion on 0.1 mmol of preloaded Fmoc-Gly-PEG-PS resin (Applied Biosystems) by PioneerTMusing the Fmoc method as reported previously (23Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Fukuda H. Wender P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 2073-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The coupling reaction was carried out using each Fmoc amino acid (0.4 mmol),N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (HATU) (0.4 mmol) (29Carpino L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4397-4398Crossref Scopus (1380) Google Scholar), andN,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.8 mmol) inN,N-dimethylformamide for 30 min (flow rate, 30 ml/min). After completion of the chain assembly, each peptide resin was cleaved, and the resultant crude peptide was precipitated by diethyl ether. The crude peptide was purified by gel filtration, followed by HPLC as reported previously (23Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem.

Each purified peptide exhibited satisfactory mass spectrometric data.

Open table in a new tab The plasmid for FLAG-tagged DGKγ-(1–789) (FLAG-DGKγ) was generated by PCR using BS412 (rat-DGKγ) as a template as reported previously (28Shindo M. Irie K. Ohigashi H. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cDNA of DGKγ-(1–789) was digested with MunI andBamHI and then subcloned into the EcoRI andBglII sites of pTB701-FL, a mammalian expression vector, to express fusion protein with the N-terminal FLAG epitope. Transient transfection into COS-7 cells was performed by electroporation as reported previously (28Shindo M. Irie K. Ohigashi H. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were cultured at 37 °C for 48 h and were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline(−), followed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and sonicated on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was saved for the PDBu binding assay described below. The PDBu binding assay was carried out using the procedure of Sharkey and Blumberg (30Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification (23Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar,24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A.

The standard assay mixture (250 μl) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes contained 50 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.4, 50 μg/ml 1,2-di-(cis-9-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (phosphatidylserine dioleoyl), 3 mg/ml bovine γ-globulin, [3H]PDBu (17.0 Ci/mmol), and each DGKγ C1 peptide or FLAG-DGKγ. For determination of PDBu saturation curves for Scatchard analysis, concentrations of free [3H]PDBu between 1 and 50 nm were used. For chemically synthesized DGK C1 peptides, metal coordination was carried out in a helium-purged distilled water solution (pH 5.5–6.0) of each C1 peptide. Five mol eq of 10 mm ZnCl2in helium-purged distilled water was added to the peptide solution, and the solution (174 μm) was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 10 min. After 10 μl of the peptide solution was diluted with 990 μl of helium-purged distilled water, the resultant solution (1.5–2.9 μl) was added to the standard assay mixture described above (247.1 μl), and the solution was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. For FLAG-DGKγ, 5 μl of the enzyme solution after homogenization was similarly added and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. To the tubes was added 187 μl of 35% (w/w) poly(ethylene glycol) (average molecular weight, 8000), and the mixture was vigorously stirred. The tubes were allowed to stand at 4 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant of each tube was removed, and its radioactivity was measured to determine the free [3H]PDBu concentration. The remainder of the supernatant of each tube was removed by aspiration. The tips of the tubes were cut off, and the radioactivity in the pellets was measured to determine the bound [3H]PDBu. Specific binding represents the difference between the total and nonspecific binding. The nonspecific binding for each tube was calculated from its measured free [3H]PDBu concentration and its partition coefficient to the pellet (about 3%). In competition experiments using rat-DGKγ-C1A, various concentrations of an inhibitor in ethanol solution were added to the reaction mixture mentioned above. The effective concentration of [3H]PDBu and rat-DGKγ-C1A was 20 and 5 nm, respectively. The final ethanol concentration of the mixture was less than 2%. Binding affinity was evaluated by the concentration required to cause 50% inhibition of the specific [3H]PDBu binding, IC50, that was calculated by a computer program (Statistical Analysis System) with a probability unit procedure (31James H.G. Council K.A. Helwig J.T. SAS User's Guide. SAS Institute, Cary, NC1979: 357-360Google Scholar). The binding constant (Ki) was calculated from the IC50 values and Kd for PDBu of rat-DGKγ-C1A by the method of Sharkey and Blumberg (30Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar). Domain deleted mutants of DGKγ were produced using an ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid (BS465) encoding rat-DGKγ (27Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with anXhoI site in the 5′ terminus and a SmaI site in the 3′ terminus was used as a template. The sense and antisense primers for producing a C1A-deleted mutant (ΔC1A-DGKγ) were 5′-GTGAAAACATACTCCAAAGCCAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCCATCCCCCTTGGAG-3′, respectively. The primers for a mutant DGKγ lacking the C1B region (ΔC1B-DGKγ) were 5′-GATGGTGGGGAGCTCAAAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGCATCACCTCACCGCTC-3′. The sequence was confirmed by verifying sequences. Each C1A- or C1B-deleted mutant of DGKγ cDNA was subcloned into SalI and SmaI sites in pEGFPC1. Plasmids (∼5.5 μg) were transfected into 1.0 × 106 cells by lipofection using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. After being cultured at 37 °C for 16–24 h, the cells were spread onto glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Experiments were performed 16–48 h after the transfection. The culture medium was replaced with HEPES buffer composed of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose at pH 7.3 (Ringer's solution). Translocation of the GFP fusion protein was triggered by a direct application of a 10 times higher concentration of TPA into the Ringer's solution to obtain the appropriate final concentration. The fluorescence of the fusion protein was monitored with a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM 410 invert, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 488 nm argon excitation using a 515–535 nm bandpass barrier filter. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. DGK isozymes have cysteine-rich C1 domains quite similar to those of PKC isozymes (1Houssa B. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem.

DGKβ-C1A, DGKγ-C1A, DGKδ-C1A, DGKδ-C1B, DGKη-C1A, and DGKθ-C1C have the same core structure as the PKC C1 domains, where six cysteines and two histidines are conserved in the pattern HX12CX2CX13–14CX2CX4HX2CX7C. Table II summarizes the percentages of sequence homology of all DGK C1 domains to the 20 residues. Human-DGKβ-C1A, rat-DGKγ-C1A, and human-DGKγ-C1A have perfect sequence homology to all conventional and novel PKC isozyme C1 domains. The C1 domains, which show more than 50% sequence homology, are rat-DGKβ-C1A, human-DGKβ-C1A, rat-DGKγ-C1A, human-DGKγ-C1A, human-DGKδ-C1A, human-DGKδ-C1B, hamster-DGKη-C1A, hamster-DGKη-C1B, human-DGKθ-C1A, and human-DGKθ-C1C that might bind PDBu. We have thus synthesized these cysteine-rich sequences of ∼50 amino acid residues with a PioneerTM peptide synthesizer using HATU as an activator for Fmoc chemistry by a method reported previously (23Irie K.

Because our recent investigation found that some C1 domain fragments of PKC isozymes suffered from temperature-dependent inactivation (24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Konishi H.

Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2487-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the incubation temperature of the binding assay was set at 4 °C for the DGK isozyme C1 peptides. The specific binding to PDBu of the DGK C1 peptides is summarized in Fig.3. Only the DGKβ-C1A and DGKγ-C1A peptides showed significant binding at 20 nm, whereas other DGK C1 peptides with over 50% sequence homology to PKC C1 domains were completely inactive even at 100 and 500 nm (data not shown). Rat-DGKγ-C1A and human-DGKγ-C1A showed quite similar PDBu binding although their sequences were different. In a control experiment, rat-DGKγ-C1B did not show any binding. Scatchard analyses of rat-DGKγ-C1A and human-DGKγ-C1A for PDBu binding gave Kd values of 3.6 ± 0.5 and 2.8 ± 0.1 nm with Bmax values of 31.2 ± 4.5 and 44.1 ± 7.8%, respectively (Fig.4, a and b). These values are close to those of most PKC C1 peptides (0.45–7.4 nm) (24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Fukuda H. Wender P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 2073-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that whole DGKγ shows strong PDBu binding affinity. The binding affinity of human-DGKβ-C1A was also great (Kd = 14.6 ± 1.7 nm;Bmax = 42.9 ± 1.3%). However, theKd of rat-DGKβ-C1A (202 ± 13 nm) with a Bmax value of 8.3 ± 1.0% was considerably larger than that of human-DGKβ-C1A (Fig. 4, cand d). The weak PDBu binding affinity of human-DGKβ-C1A (Kd = 14.6 nm) compared with human-DGKγ-C1A (Kd = 2.8 nm) suggests that the Ala-12 residue is responsible for the decrease in binding affinity because the Thr-12 residue is strictly conserved in the conventional and novel PKC isozymes that show strong PDBu binding (24Shindo M.

The Thr-12 residue along with the Leu-21 and Gly-23 residues of PKCδ-C1B is shown to be involved in the phorbol ester binding in the x-ray structure (20Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To prove this, the A12T mutant of human-DGKβ-C1A was synthesized, and its PDBu binding affinity was tested. The Kd value for PDBu of the A12T mutant was 4.9 ± 1.0 nm with a Bmax value of 42.4 ± 2.8% (Fig. 4e), suggesting that the Thr-12 residue plays a significant role in the PDBu binding of DGKβ-C1A. FLAG-tagged whole rat-DGKγ (FLAG-DGKγ) was expressed in COS-7 cells to investigate whether whole rat-DGKγ as well as rat-DGKγ-C1A peptide binds PDBu. After homogenization and centrifugation of the COS-7 cells, the supernatant was saved for PDBu binding assay. Scatchard analysis of FLAG-DGKγ in the PDBu binding was performed with the incubation temperature set at 30 °C as for whole PKC isozymes (24Shindo M. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Konishi H.

We have investigated the disulfide-forming pathway of a single-chain porcine insulin precursor (PIP). Here we further studied the folding pathway of HPI in vitro. While the oxidized refolding process of HPI was quenched, four obvious intermediates (namely P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively) with three disulfide bridges were isolated and characterized. Contrary to the folding pathway of PIP, no intermediates with one- or two-disulfide bonds could be captured under different refolding conditions. CD analysis showed that P1, P2, and P3 retained partially structural conformations, whereas P4 contained little secondary structure. Based on the time-dependent distribution, disulfide pair analysis, and disulfide-reshuffling process of the intermediates, we have proposed that the folding pathway of HPI is significantly different from that of PIP. These differences reveal that the C-peptide not only facilitates the folding of HPI but also governs its kinetic folding pathway of HPI. Detailed analysis of the molecular folding process reveals that there are some similar folding mechanisms between PIP and HPI. These similarities imply that the initiation site for the folding of PIP/HPI may reside in the central α-helix of the B-chain. The formation of disulfide A20–B19 may guide the transfer of the folding information from the B-chain template to the unstructured A-chain.

The A-chain contains two α-helices (IleA2–ThrA8 and LeuA13–TyrA19, designated helix 2 and helix 3, respectively) and the B-chain consists of a central α-helix (SerB9–CysB19, designated helix 1), flanking turns, and extended N- and C-terminal segments. In the native structure, the N terminus of the A-chain is closely proximate to the C terminus of the B-chain. A and B chain are tethered by two interchain disulfide bridges (A7–B7 and A20–B19). The third disulfide bridge (A6–A11) is intra-A-chain disulfide. The three disulfide bonds are important in maintaining the native conformation and biological activities of the insulin molecular. The contributions of these bridges to the structure, stability, and activity of hormone have been investigated in analogues lacking selected disulfide bridges (7Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Hu S.Q.

Internal cystine A6–A11 is close to the hydrophobic core and its substitution with Ser or Ala resulted in the unfolding of helix 2 (10Weiss M.A. Hua Q.X. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G.

The interchain disulfide linkage A7–B7 is fully exposed on the surface, and its substitution with Ser leads to a marked decrease in the thermodynamic stability and extent of folding as compared with that of the substitution of internal cystine A6–A11 (7Hua Q.X.

Whereas removal of A7–B7 or A6–A11 results in only segmental unfolding, cystine A20–B19 appears to be integral to the overall structure and necessary for the biosynthetic expression (13Guo Z.Y.

Disulfide isomers retaining this core disulfide bridge exhibit native-like partial folds with nonnegligible biological activity.

Although the functional form of human insulin is double-chain, human insulin was synthesized in vivo as a single-chain preproinsulin with a signal peptide at the N terminus of the B-chain and a connecting peptide between the B- and A-chain (15Steiner D.F. Trans. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1967; 30: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Steiner D.F. Cunningham D. Spigelman L. Aten B. Science. 1967; 157: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Following cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence in the endoplasmic reticulum, the nascent polypeptide folds and is packaged into secretary granules as a proinsulin. Its C terminus of B-chain connects the N terminus of A-chain by the connecting peptide consisting of two bibasic amino acids at each end of the C-peptide of 31 amino acids (17Steiner D.F. Cho S.

Diabetes. 1978; 27 Suppl. 1: 145-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human proinsulin (HPI)1 is shown in Fig.1. Processed by a specific set of protease, proinsulin is converted into insulin and C-peptide in the B-cell granule (19Davidson H.W. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Davidson H.W. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Due to the flexibility of the C-peptide, there is still no report of the crystal or solution structure of the proinsulin, although proinsulin could be co-crystallized in a 1:1 complex with insulin (21Low B.W. Fullerton W.W. Rosen L.S. Nature. 1974; 248: 339-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Steiner D.F. Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Models of HPI structure were proposed in the 1970s, suggesting that the flexible C-peptide runs across the surface of A-chain (22Steiner D.F. Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Snell C.R. Smyth D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6291-6295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Weiss et al.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8389-8401Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) also showed by comparative 1H NMR and photochemical dynamic nuclear polarization studies that the insulin moiety of proinsulin is similar to insulin and that the connecting peptide is largely unstructured. Since the discovery by Anfisen in 1960s (25Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5137) Google Scholar) that the folding information of proteins resides in the primary amino acid sequences, great efforts have been devoted to the study of the molecular mechanism of protein folding. Two important questions in the mechanism of protein folding are still not clear: (i) how the folding is initiated and (ii) what pathway it follows. For the latter question, one can characterize the intermediates appearing in the folding process (26Matthews C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 653-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,27Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 631-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Disulfide linkages are always important factors in maintaining the native conformation of many single-domain globule proteins containing disulfide bonds, and their pairings are always coupled to the formation of the functional structure during the oxidized refolding of such proteins (28Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of disulfide bonds could be used as a useful tool in probing the protein-folding pathway (30Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar).

Although insulin is one of the best characterized proteins in their structure and function, its in vitro disulfide folding pathway remains far from understood due to the difficulties brought by its double-chain structure. Early studies by Steiner et al. (54Steiner D.F. Clark J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that proinsulin exhibits the expected property of spontaneously reforming its native structure in alkaline solution after complete reduction in urea, which supported the view that the single-chain proinsulin is the biosynthetic precursor of insulin. We recently studied the disulfide-forming pathway of a single-chain porcine insulin precursor (PIP) and suggested that reduced PIP proceeds through two pathways to reach the native PIP (55Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since insulin is synthesized and folded as a single chain proinsulin in vivo (16Steiner D.F.

The results have shown that there are some differences in the folding behavior between HPI and PIP, indicating that C-peptide has a profound impact on the molecular mechanism of HPI refolding. The studies on the refolding process of the captured intermediates of HPI, on the other hand, show that some fundamental similarities exist in both folding mechanism of HPI and PIP. We demonstrate that the length of the connecting peptide has a profound effect on the mechanism of folding. Whereas PIP folds in distinct steps via one- and two-disulfide intermediates (55Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), HPI is first caught in kinetic traps, forming at least four nonnative disulfide isomers, which then rearrange to the native state. Recombinant HPI with purity greater than 98% was kindly provided by Lilly and confirmed by HPLC on a reverse phase C8 column. Protein concentration of HPI, reduced/denatured HPI, and all of the intermediates was quantified by a spectrometer and calculated with the absorption constant A278 (1 cm, 1.0 mg/ml) = 0.65 according to Ref. 56Frank B.H.

The snakeskin dialysis tube with a molecular mass cut-off of 3,500 daltons was the product of Pierce. IAA, GSH, and GSSG were ultrapure and obtained from Amerresco. Ultrapure dithiothreitol and l-Arg were purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure urea and guanidine-HCl were the products of Promega. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were of HPLC grade. All of the other reagents used in the experiment were of analytical grade. Purified HPI was dissolved in 100 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7), containing 8 m guanidine-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Reduction of the protein was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the buffer was immediately exchanged to 10 mm HCl by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at −80 °C for later use. The refolding of reduced and denatured protein was initiated by diluting the frdHPI with the refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, different concentrations of GSH and GSSG, with or without l-Arg) at a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The refolding reaction was carried out at 16 °C for 16 h and quenched by adding trifluoroacetic acid to pH 1.0, and then the mixture was analyzed on HPLC using a C4 reverse phase column to quantify the refolding yield. The impacts of different redox constitutions, pH, andl-Arg on the refolding yield of HPI have been tested, and an optimized refolding condition with the best yield of HPI was selected to carry out the in vitro studies of the disulfide-refolding pathway of HPI. Refolding of frdHPI was initiated by adding frdHPI in the prewarmed (16 °C) refolding solution (100 mmTris, pH 10.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 5 mm GSSG) at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The refolding process was quenched by acid or iodoacetic acid in a time course manner. For the acid quenching method, aliquots of protein solution were removed at different refolding times and quickly mixed with an equal volume of 2% trifluoroacetic acid to lower the pH to 1.0. For the iodoacetic acid method, the refolding reaction was quenched by adding one-fourth volume of freshly prepared 0.5m IAA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the carboxymethylation reaction was performed at room temperature for 5 min. To observe the temporal distribution of refolding intermediates, the IAA-quenched solution was adjusted to pH 1.0 with trifluoroacetic acid and immediately analyzed by HPLC. For large scale preparation of the trapped intermediates, the solution containing IAA-trapped intermediates was dialyzed against 50 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) at 4 °C and thereafter lyophilized. Then the refolding mixture was separated by HPLC on a reverse phase C4 (Sephasil peptide, ST 4.6/250 mm; Amersham Biosciences) column. Unless otherwise indicated, the solvent A used in HPLC was water containing 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, and the solvent B was 60% acetonitrile containing 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid. The linear elution gradient was 40–80% of solvent B in 30 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/ml, and the monitoring wavelength was 280 nm. The corresponding peaks were collected manually and lyophilized. Then the partially separated intermediates were further purified by a semiprepared C8 (Sephasil peptide, ST 4.6/250 mm; Amersham Biosciences) column and characterized by an analytical C8 column (ZORBAX SB, 4.6/150 mm; DuPont) on reverse-phase HPLC. Two endoproteinases, Lys-C and V8, were utilized to digest the intermediates of HPI in order to characterize their disulfide linkages. Lys-C and V8 cleave at the carboxyl terminus of Lys and Glu, respectively. There are two lysine residues and eight glutamic acids in the amino acid sequence of HPI. In general for the enzyme digestion, 10 μg of the intermediates was dissolved in 10 μl 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), and 1.5 × 10−3 units of Lys-C or 0.5 μg of V8 was added. HPI was used as a positive control in each of the enzyme digestion. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 16 h and quenched by adding 90 μl of 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. Then the digestion mixture was immediately analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on C8 column (ZORBAX SB-C8, 5μ, 4.6/150 mm; DuPont). The elution gradient was 25–65% of solvent B linear in 35 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the detector wavelength was set at 210 nm. Isolated intermediates of HPI with three isomeric disulfide bridges were dissolved in 5 mm HCl, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml. Before the folding of the intermediates, protein solution and a 2-fold concentration of refolding buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm GSH, 10 mmGSSG) were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, respectively. The folding reaction was initiated by mixing them with equal volume and carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots of the folding solution were removed in a time course manner and mixed with an equal volume of 2% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the folding process. Then the mixture was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column (Sephasil peptide, ST 4.6/250 mm;Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 50–80% of solvent B in 30 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the detector wavelength was 230 nm. All of the samples were dissolved in 10 mm HCl except for the IAA-modified frdHPI in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0). The protein concentration was all adjusted to 0.25 mg/ml by UV absorption at 278 nm. Circular dichroism measurements were performed on a Jasco-700 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. For the far-UV CD spectra, samples were scanned from 190 to 250 nm and accumulated twice at a resolution of 1.0 nm with a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. The cell length was 0.1 cm, and the stepwise increase was 0.1 nm. For the near-UV CD spectra, samples were scanned from 250 to 310 nm and accumulated twice at a resolution of 1.0 nm with a speed of 50 nm/min. The cell length was 1.0 cm. All of the CD data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity. The secondary structure contents of the samples were estimated by using the software J-700 for Windows Secondary Structure Estimation, Version 1.10.00 (JASCO Corp.), equipped with the Jasco-700. To optimize the refolding conditions, the concentration of GSH and GSSG, the pH, and the absence or presence of the l-Arg have been tested. After a series of tests, we have found that several factors in the optimized refolding condition of HPI are obviously different from those of PIP, although the difference of two molecules in sequence is only the length of connecting peptide. First, l-Arg was not absolutely required for the refolding of HPI, whereas the yield of PIP was lower than 15% in the absence of l-Arg. Even oxidized by air, HPI could fold spontaneously with a high yield up to 50%. Thus, it is clear that HPI refolds more efficiently than PIP in vitro. Second, predominance of GSSG in the redox buffer is required for the high yield of HPI, whereas GSH is required for PIP. Table I shows the recovery of refolded native HPI reached as high as 84% when the frdHPI was diluted in the refolding buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, and 5 mm GSSG at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and incubated at 16 °C for 16 h. Thus, the optimum was used in the in vitrorefolding study of HPI.Table IRefolding yield of HPI under different oxidized conditionsThe pH of the refolding bufferGSH/GSSGRefolding percentage withoutl-ArgRefolding percentage withl-Arg1-aThe refolding buffer contains additional 0.5m L-Arg.mm10.00/018.739.75/013.415.45/0.535.529.35/150.351.75/579.457.61/176.771.01/584.070.10.5/580.164.80/580.766.37.01/5<5.0ND1-bND, not determined.8.01/5<5.0ND8.71/527.2ND9.51/576.7ND10.01/584.0ND10.51-cThe buffer reagent was 100 mM Glycine/NaOH instead of Tris-HCl.1/584.6ND11.21/587.8NDThe refolding percentage was calculated from the peak area integration of the refolded HPI on HPLC with the frdHPI used for the refolding as a reference.

The protein concentration of HPI was 0.1 mg/ml, and the refolding reaction was carried out at 16 °C for 16 h. After the refolding process was initiated by adding frdHPI into the refolding buffer, the reaction was quenched at different time points by lowering the pH to 1.0 with trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was analyzed immediately by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column. The temporal distribution of the refolding intermediate species is shown in Fig. 2. Four obvious intermediates, designated by elution time, P1, P2, P3, and P4, were observed during the refolding process of HPI. In the first 2 min of the refolding, only a very small proportion of the intermediates as well as the frdHPI can be identified by HPLC. The SDS-PAGE results (data not shown) of the deposits and the supernatants of the acid-quenched refolding mixture showed that intermediates during this period were easily acid-precipitated. Analysis of the precipitate of the refolding mixture at different time points by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) showed that they were mostly disulfide-linked intermolecular aggregation. These aggregated species always act as off-pathway intermediates and hence prevent the HPI refolding efficiency to reach a full scale. After 2 min of the refolding process, HPI and the four intermediates begin to dominate the folding intermediate species. Fig.3A shows the recovery curve of the native HPI calculated from the HPLC chromatography, and Fig.3B shows the time-dependent distribution of the four intermediates. The contents of all of the intermediates came to a climax at 6 min, and then the content of P1 decreased slowly, whereas P2 and P4 decreased more quickly. Although there are some minor intermediates other than P1, P2, P3, and P4 at 2 min of the folding, it is very difficult to identify them due to the lower contents.Figure 3Time-dependent recovery of nativeHPI (A) and the refolding intermediates (B). The percentage of HPI refolding was calculated from the peak area integration on HPLC relative to the reduced HPI used for the refolding. The refolding percentage at 16 h was not indicated in this curve, since there is little difference from that at 90 min. The yield of intermediates was expressed as the percentage of the total reduced HPI used for the refolding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The refolding process was also quenched by IAA and observed by HPLC as shown in the right lane of Fig. 2.

SAPK/JNK activation requires the phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues in its Thr-Pro-Tyr motif, and SEK1 and MKK7 have been identified as the dual specificity kinases. In this study, we generated mkk7−/− mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in addition tosek1−/− cells and compared the two kinases in terms of the activation and phosphorylation of JNK. Although SAPK/JNK activation by various stress signals was markedly impaired in both sek1−/− andmkk7−/− ES cells, there were striking differences in the dual phosphorylation profile. The severe impairment observed in mkk7−/− cells was accompanied by a loss of the Thr phosphorylation of JNK without marked reduction in its Tyr-phosphorylated level. On the other hand, Thr phosphorylation of JNK in sek1−/−cells was also attenuated in addition to a decreased level of its Tyr phosphorylation. Analysis in human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected with a kinase-dead SEK1 or a Thr-Pro-Phe mutant of JNK1 revealed that SEK1-induced Tyr phosphorylation of JNK1 was followed by additional Thr phosphorylation by MKK7. Furthermore, SEK1 but not MKK7 was capable of binding to JNK1 in 293T cells. These results indicate that the Tyr and Thr residues of SAPK/JNK are sequentially phosphorylated by SEK1 and MKK7, respectively, in the stress-stimulated ES cells.

This MAPK is activated not only by many types of cellular stresses, including changes in osmolarity, heat shock, and UV irradiation, but also by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1औ and tumor necrosis factor-α). The activated SAPK/JNK phosphorylates transcription factors c-Jun, Jun D, and activating transcription factor-2 to regulate gene expression for the stress response. Activation of SAPK/JNK requires the phosphorylation of Tyr and Thr residues located in a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in the activation loop between VII and VIII of the kinase domain. The phosphorylation is catalyzed by the dual specificity kinases SEK1 (also known as MKK4) and MKK7 (SEK2), which are capable of catalyzing the phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues in vitro (1Davis R., J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Targeted gene-disruption experiments in mice demonstrate that both SEK1 and MKK7 are required for embryonic development.Sek1−/− embryos die between embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E12.5 with impaired liver formation (3Yang D.

Furthermore, we have recently reported that SEK1 is crucial for hepatocyte growth factor-induced activation of SAPK/JNK in developing hepatoblasts of mouse embryos. On the other hand, mkk7−/−embryos die between E11.5 and E12.5 with similar impairment of liver formation and SAPK/JNK activation (6Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Ohata S. Kitagawa D. Nishitai G. Seo J. Tanemura S. Shimizu N. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Aoki J. Arai H. Iwatsubo T. Mochita M. Watanabe T. Satake M. Ito Y. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 332-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results clearly show that both SEK1 and MKK7 play indispensable roles in hepatoblast proliferation during mouse embryogenesis. Distinct biochemical properties between SEK1 and MKK7 may be critical for the indispensable roles of the two activators of SAPK/JNK in vivo. In this regard, several in vitro experiments have shown that SAPK/JNK is activated synergistically by SEK1 and MKK7 (7Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lisnock J. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Franz B. Parsons J. O'Keefe S.J. LoGrasso P.

J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The synergistic activation may be related to the enzymatic properties of the two MAPKKs: SEK1 prefers the Tyr residue and MKK7 prefers the Thr residue of the MAPK. We have also reported that the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in response to stress signals is attenuated with a decreased level of its Tyr phosphorylation insek1−/− mouse ES cells that retain MKK7 at the same level as the wild-type cells (10Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SAPK/JNK activation by UV irradiation and Fcε-receptor stimulation was also attenuated in themkk7−/− mast cells. Despite the impaired SAPK/JNK activation in the mkk7−/− cells, the expression of SEK1 was strongly up-regulated, and SEK1 protein was phosphorylated upon stimulation (11Sasaki T. Wada T. Kishimoto H. Irie-Sasaki J. Matsumoto G. Goto T. Yao Z. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Suzuki A. Katada T. Nishina H. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, both SEK1 and MKK7 seem to be required for the synergistic and functional activation of SAPK/JNK in a variety of mammalian cells. To reveal the molecular mechanism of the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK by SEK1 and MKK7 in living cells, we generatedmkk7−/− mouse ES cells by gene targeting, in addition to sek1−/− ES cells, and further investigated the contribution of SEK1 and MKK7 to the activation and phosphorylation of the MAPK. Our present results clearly show that both SEK1 and MKK7 are required for the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in response to various stimuli in ES cells. Furthermore, we propose a sequential phosphorylation mechanism of SAPK/JNK by the two activators, SEK1 and MKK7, in the stress-stimulated living cells. A 17-kbp DNA fragment of mkk7 gene was isolated from a genomic 129/J mouse library. Targeting vector 1 contained a 585-bp short arm, a 6.7-kbp long arm, three loxP sequences, and a hygromycin resistance cassette (Hyg) in antisense orientation to mkk7 transcription. Targeting vector 2 contained a 709-bp short arm, a 5.2-kbp long arm, and a neomycin resistance cassette (Neo) in antisense orientation tomkk7 transcription. The linearized targeting vector 1 was electroporated into E14K ES cells. ES cell colonies resistant to hygromycin (0.2 mg/ml; Invitrogen) were screened for homologous recombination by PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, for 40 cycles) using primers specific for mkk7genomic sequences and Hyg as described below. Next, themkk7+/hyg ES cells were transfected with Cre recombinase expression vector, and cell colonies sensitive to hygromycin were screened for deletion of the region containing exons 4–13 and Hyg by PCR. The linearized targeting vector 2 was electroporated into mkk7+/del ES cells. Retargeted ES cell colonies resistant to G418 (0.3 mg/ml; Invitrogen) were screened for homologous recombination by PCR using primers specific for mkk7 genomic sequences and Neo as described below. As a result, two mkk7neo/del clones (001 and 002) were independently obtained. Both clones lack MKK7 completely, and they are henceforth referred to as mkk7−/−ES cells in this manuscript.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells onto a 35-mm dish and transfected 1 day later with 4 ॖg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were stimulated and subjected for the assays of SAPK/JNK activity, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. ES cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish and cultured overnight. As chemical and physical stresses, the cells were stimulated by sorbitol (0.5 m; Wako), anisomycin (3 ॖg/ml; Sigma), nocodazole (0.5 ॖg/ml for 1 h; Sigma), UV light (1 kJ/m2), and heat shock (44 °C for 10 min). SAPK/JNK proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h using the anti-SAPK/JNK polyclonal Ab (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The SAPK/JNK activity in the precipitated fractions was measured with glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as an in vitrosubstrate in the presence of 60 ॖm[γ-32P]ATP as described previously (12Nishina H.

To detect the phosphorylation of Tyr and Thr residues in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif of endogenous SAPK/JNK, ES cells were plated at ∼2 × 107 cells onto a 150-mm dish and mixed with 2 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 17 Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaCl, 0.057 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 100 ॖmNa3VO4, 20 ॖg/ml of leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm benzamidine). The cell lysates were incubated with anti-SAPK/JNK Ab and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immuno-complexes were washed several times with the lysis buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

The bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for the development of immunoblots using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second Ab according the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Endogenous SEK1 and MKK7 were immunoprecipitated with anti-SEK1 (KN-001) and anti-MKK7 (KN-004) mAbs and detected with anti-SEK1 (C-20) and anti-MKK7 (T-19) Abs, respectively. All experiments were repeated at least three times with different batches of the cell samples, and the results were fully reproducible. Hence, most of the data shown are representative of several independent experiments. To examine the role of MKK7 in SAPK/JNK regulation, we generatedmkk7−/− ES cells using two targeting vectors in the process of mkk7+/+,mkk7+/hyg, mkk7+/del, andmkk7neo/del construction as follows (Fig.1). First, the exons 4–13 region ofmkk7 gene was deleted from one allele using targeting vector 1 and Cre recombinase (Fig. 1A). Second, another allele ofmkk7 was disrupted by replacing the site of activating phosphorylation in exon 9 with neomycin resistance cassette using targeting vector 2 (Fig. 1B). As a result, two clones (001 and 002) of mkk7neo/del ES cells that completely lack 48-kDa MKK7 were independently obtained (Fig. 1, C andD). Thus, the null-mutant mkk7neo/delclones are used as mkk7−/− ES cells in this study. To examine the role of MKK7 in stress-induced activation of SAPK/JNK, mkk7−/−ES cells were incubated under various conditions, together withsek1−/−and wild-type cells. Fig.2 shows the time courses of SAPK/JNK activity in response to a protein synthesis inhibitor (A, 3 ॖg/ml of anisomycin), heat shock (B, 44 °C for 10 min), UV irradiation (C, 1 kJ/m2), and hyperosmolar stress (D, 0.5 m sorbitol) in the two MAPKK mutant and wild-type ES cells. These stresses markedly stimulated SAPK/JNK activity in wild-type ES cells. Such stimulation, however, was severely impaired in both MAPKK mutant cells, although the cells contained SAPK/JNK at the same level as wild-type cells (see Fig.4C). Thus, the stress-induced full activation of SAPK/JNK seems to require both SEK1 and MKK7 in ES cells.Figure 4Stress-induced Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of endogenous SAPK/JNK in wild-type, sek1−/−, and mkk7−/−ES cells. ES cells were stimulated with 0.5 m sorbitol (lanes 2,6, 10), 1 kJ/m2 of UV irradiation (lanes 3, 7, 11), and 3 ॖg/ml of anisomycin (lanes 4, 8, 12) and further incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Cell lysates were prepared, and endogenous SAPK/JNK and SEK1 were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-SAPK/JNK (C-17) polyclonal Abs (A–C) and anti-SEK1 (KN-001) mAb (D andE), respectively. The Thr phosphorylation (A) and Tyr phosphorylation (B) of SAPK/JNK, together with phosphorylated SEK1 (D) were determined using anti-phospho Abs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IB, immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The impairment of SAPK/JNK activation observed in the two MAPKK mutant cells was further investigated with the different concentrations of sorbitol. As shown in Fig. 2E, the concentration-dependent activation curve of SAPK/JNK had a very steep upstroke at ∼0.15 m sorbitol in wild-type ES cells. Interestingly, such steep activation of SAPK/JNK was markedly attenuated in mkk7−/− andsek1−/− ES cells without significant change in the half-maximum effective concentration of sorbitol. Impairment of SAPK/JNK activation in the two MAPKK mutant cells was also observed in other stress signals, including a microtubule-disruptive reagent, nocodazole, and genotoxic stresses, such as etoposide and arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (data not shown). The above results in Fig. 2 suggest that SEK1 and MKK7 synergistically contribute in the stress-induced stimulation of SAPK/JNK in ES cells. To elucidate the qualitative difference of the two MAPKKs, SEK1 and MKK7 expression vectors were transfected into sek1−/− ormkk7−/− ES cells (Fig.3). SEK1 could rescue the impaired SAPK/JNK activation in response to UV irradiation and heat shock insek1−/− ES cells (Fig. 3A). However, MKK7 isoforms α1, γ1, and γ2, could not restore the SAPK/JNK activation in sek1−/− ES cells. On the other hand, MKK7 α1 and γ1, but not SEK1, could rescue the impaired SAPK/JNK activation in response to heat shock, anisomycin, and nocodazole in mkk7−/− ES cells (Fig.3B). These results clearly show that SEK1 and MKK7 serve different functions in the stress-induced SAPK/JNK activation in ES cells. It has recently been reported that the phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif of SAPK/JNK is required for the full activation of the MAPK and that SEK1 and MKK7 preferentially phosphorylate the Tyr and Thr residues, respectively, in vitro (7Lawler S.

Therefore, we examined the stress-induced phosphorylation state of endogenous SAPK/JNK insek1−/− and mkk7−/−ES cells together with wild-type cells. The three cell types were stimulated with 0.5 m of sorbitol (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 6, and 10), 1 kJ/m2 of UV irradiation (lanes 3, 7, and 11), and 3 ॖg/ml of anisomycin (lanes 4, 8, and12). The endogenous SAPK/JNK was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific Abs. In a series of the present experiments, these ES cells expressed almost the same amounts of SAPK/JNK (Fig. 4C). The existence of stress-induced Thr and Tyr phosphorylation within the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif of SAPK/JNK in wild-type cells could be detected with anti-phospho-Thr-Pro and anti-phospho-Tyr Abs, respectively (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 10–12). Interestingly, Thr but not Tyr phosphorylation was almost completely abolished in mkk7−/− cells (Fig.4, A and B,lanes 2–4) in which stress-induced phosphorylation of SEK1 was retained at the same level as wild-type cells (Fig. 4, D and E, lanes 5 and6). On the other hand, the Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK was greatly impaired in sek1−/− cells (Fig.4B, lanes 6–8) in accordance with our previous report (10Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Thr phosphorylation was also markedly attenuated in sek1−/− cells (Fig.4A, lanes 6–8), although this mutant contained the same amount of 48-kDa MKK7 as wild-type cells (Fig.1D). These results indicate that SEK1 phosphorylates the Tyr residue of SAPK/JNK and that MKK7 preferentially phosphorylates the Thr residue of Tyr-phosphorylated SAPK/JNK rather than its non-phosphorylated form. In other words, MKK7-induced Thr phosphorylation requires the prior phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK at the Tyr residue by SEK1 in the stress-stimulated ES cells (see Fig.8C). In ES cells, SEK1 and MKK7 clearly contributed to the dual phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in response to stress stimuli, and the MKK7-induced Thr phosphorylation seemed to require the prior Tyr phosphorylation by SEK1. Therefore, we further investigated the action of SEK1, which was supposed to be involved in the prior Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. For the analysis, we used a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T) for transient transfection because of low efficiency of transfection into ES cells. HA-tagged JNK1 was co-expressed with FLAG-dnSEK1, which lacks kinase activity, in the cells using pCMV5 mammalian vectors. In a series of the experiments, the expression of HA-JNK1 was almost constant (Fig. 5C). Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of exogenous HA-JNK1 in response to 1 kJ/m2 of UV irradiation was measured. UV irradiation induced the Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of HA-JNK1 (Fig. 5,A and B, lane 3); however, not only Tyr but also Thr phosphorylation was lost in the dnSEK1-expressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 4). These results clearly show that the stress-induced Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK requires the prior Tyr phosphorylation by SEK1 in living cells. Next, we investigated the contribution of the Tyr residue in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif of SAPK/JNK, phosphorylation of which was supposed to proceed before the Thr modification by MKK7 in the sequential phosphorylation. For the analysis, we constructed three kinds of HA-JNK1 mutants (APF, APY, and TPF), in which the Thr (T)-Pro (P)-Tyr (Y) motif was replaced with Ala (A), and Phe (F), respectively. The HA-JNK mutants and wild type were expressed in 293T cells by transfection, and the phosphorylation and kinase activity were measured. In a series of the experiments, the expression of HA-JNK1 was almost constant (Fig. 6C). The UV-induced Thr and Tyr phosphorylation and its ability to phosphorylate glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as substrate could be detected in the wild-type HA-JNK1/TPY (Fig. 6, lane 1). Tyr phosphorylation of the HA-JNK/APY mutant was also detected (Fig.6B, lane 3), although its kinase activity was completely lost (Fig. 6D, lane 3). Interestingly, the Thr phosphorylation could not be detected in the HA-JNK1/TPF mutant, in which the Tyr residue was replaced by Phe (Fig.6A, lane 4). These results clearly show that the stress-induced Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK requires the phosphorylated Tyr residue in living cells. To understand the molecular mechanism of the prior Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK by SEK1, we examined the association of SAPK/JNK with SEK1. HA-JNK1 was co-expressed with FLAG-SEK1 and FLAG-MKK7γ2 in 293T cells using pCMV5 mammalian vectors (10Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were stimulated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix and analyzed for the phosphorylation of SEK1 using anti-phospho-SEK1 and anti-FLAG Abs. The expression of HA-JNK1 was almost constant (Fig. 7C). The different ratios of FLAG-SEK1 and FLAG-MKK7γ2 expression vectors induced varied expression levels of FLAG-SEK1 and FLAG-MKK7γ2 proteins, but the sum of the expressed proteins was almost constant in each of the experiments (Fig. 7A). FLAG-SEK1 was phosphorylated in response to anisomycin in the presence and absence of HA-JNK1 (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of FLAG-SEK1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with HA-JNK1; however, FLAG-MKK7γ2 was not (Fig. 7, D andE). The interaction between SEK1 and SAPK/JNK seemed to be comparable with that observed between JIP-1 and SAPK/JNK (data not shown). These results clearly show that SAPK/JNK interacts more preferentially with SEK1 than with MKK7 and suggest that the interaction might be responsible for the prior Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK by SEK1 (see Fig.8C). We also examined whether the above interaction is observable in ES cells that did not overexpress the HA-JNK1 and FLAG-SEK1/MKK7γ2. However, we could not detect their direct interaction in the native ES cells or in mouse tissues, including brain and liver (data not shown). This may be because of low expression levels of the endogenous proteins. Alternatively, endogenous SEK1 may localize near or exist as a non-associated form with SAPK/JNK in native cells, and there may be a molecular mechanism for releasing SEK1 rapidly after the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. It has been reported in in vitro experiments that synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK requires the phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues within the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif by the two different activators, SEK1 and MKK7 (7Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lisnock J. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Franz B. Parsons J. O'Keefe S.J. LoGrasso P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3141-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Fleming Y. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N. Paterson A. Goedert M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although the two MAPKKs are capable of catalyzing both phosphorylations, SEK1 prefers the Tyr phosphorylation and MKK7 prefers the Thr phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 8A). In a previous study, we reported that SEK1 is essentially required for synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in murine ES cells because the activation by various stresses was markedly attenuated in sek1−/− murine ES cells (10Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This attenuation was accompanied with a decreased level of the Tyr phosphorylation. In the present study, we also generatedmkk7−/− ES cells and compared the two mutant ES cells in terms of the activation and phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. Our present results not only confirm the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK reported previously but also indicate the unique properties of SEK1 and MKK7 in the stress-induced phosphorylation of the MAPK as follows. First, MKK7 seemed to be a selective MAPKK for the synergistic activation and the Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. The mutantmkk7−/− ES cells had a defect in synergistic SAPK/JNK activation in response to a variety of stimuli (Fig. 2). This defect could be selectively rescued by the introduction of MKK7 isoforms (α1 and γ1) but not by SEK1 (Fig. 3B). Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK observed in wild-type cells was almost completely abolished in mkk7−/− ES cells (Fig.4A, lanes 2–4; see also Fig.8C). Second, the properties of MKK7, which preferentially catalyzes Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, seemed to be dependent on another MAPKK, SEK1, because the Thr phosphorylation was greatly impaired in sek1−/− ES cells, which retain MKK7 expression (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8). This idea was supported by the additional results as follows. 1) Inhibition of SEK1 by the expression of its dominant-negative form (dnSEK1) blocked Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in addition to Tyr modification. 2) The SAPK/JNK mutant (TPF), which lacks phosphorylatable Tyr residue, could not be phosphorylated at the Thr residue. 3) SEK1 could associate SAPK/JNK more preferentially than MKK7 and make a complex of SEK1 and SAPK/JNK without MKK7. Thus, we present a novel activation mechanism that SEK1-induced Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK is followed by additional Thr phosphorylation by MKK7 in stress-stimulated ES cells (Fig. 8C). In other words, MKK7 preferentially phosphorylates the Thr of Tyr-phosphorylated SAPK/JNK. On the other hand, SEK1 catalyzes Tyr phosphorylation of the MAPK in a manner independent on MKK7-induced Thr phosphorylation. Tournier et al. have recently reported that the two MAPKKs, MKK7 and SEK1, differently contribute in various stress-induced activation of SAPK/JNK using primary murine embryo fibroblasts isolated from sek1−/−,mkk7−/−, and dual deficient mice (14Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Their report shows that MKK7 is more important than SEK1 in the activation of SAPK/JNK by proinflammatory cytokines in murine embryo fibroblasts. SAPK/JNK activation in response to UV and anisomycin was almost completely lost in sek1−/−mkk7−/− murine embryo fibroblasts, but approximately half stimulation of SAPK/JNK was retained in sek1−/−or mkk7−/−murine embryo fibroblasts. In contrast, SAPK/JNK activation in response to TNFα and IL-1α was almost completely lost inmkk7−/− cells, but 507 stimulation was observed in sek1−/− cells. Thus, their results are somewhat different from ours observed in the single mutant ofsek1−/−or mkk7−/− ES cells, where SAPK/JNK activation by various stimuli was greatly reduced. These differences may be caused by the specificity of cell types used. ES cells were derived directly from preimplantation embryos and maintained in vitro under undifferentiated conditions. Thus, the molecular mechanism of SAPK/JNK activation observable in ES cells may be considered a prototype in mammalian cells. In more differentiated cells, other cellular proteins, such as the JIP group of scaffold proteins, may regulate the protein interaction among SEK1, MKK7, and SAPK/JNK to alter the properties of the MAPKKs, resulting in the gain of dual-specificity kinase activity (Fig. 8B). However, overexpression of JIP1, -2, or -3 by cDNA transfection did not support this possibility (data not shown). Therefore, it will be critical to investigate the two phosphorylated states of the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in endogenous SAPK/JNK and associated proteins to understand the molecular mechanism of synergistic activation of the MAPK in each type of cells. Besides SAPK/JNK, other members of MAPK family, ERK and p38, have also two MAPKKs. ERK is activated by MKK1 and MKK2, and p38 is stimulated by MKK3 and MKK6 (15Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of two MAPKKs is a common feature of mammalian MAPK-signaling pathways. Fleming et al.have reported that MKK3 and MKK6 have a strong preference for the phosphorylation of Tyr residue within the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif of p38 MAPK (9Fleming Y. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N. Paterson A. Goedert M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other MAPKKs have also unique biochemical properties. Therefore, ERK and p38 may be regulated cooperatively by two MAPKKs, as has been observed in SAPK/JNK. Studies in other MAPKK-deficient cells would be required for the elucidation of the functional significances of two activators in ERK and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways. Recently, Ferrell et al. have proposed the interesting concept that SAPK/JNK cascade could, in principle, function as a sensitivity amplifier, which converts graded inputs into more switch-like outputs, allowing the cascade to filter out noise and yet still respond decisively to supra-threshold stimuli (16Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 17Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1997; 22: 288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They have shown in Xenopus oocytes that SAPK/JNK responds to physiological and pathological stimuli, such as progesterone and sorbitol, in an all-or-none manner (20Bagowski C.P. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1176-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The activation of SAPK/JNK by the stimuli was graded at the level of a population of oocytes; however, at the level of an individual oocyte, the stimulatory response seemed to be switch-like. In the present study, we have also observed a very steep concentration-dependent response in the activation of SAPK/JNK by hyperosmolar stress (i.e.sorbitol) in murine ES cells (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, as described in the Introduction, our recent work showed that both SEK1 and MKK7 are required for full SAPK/JNK activation and hepatoblast proliferation in developing mice (6Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Ohata S. Kitagawa D. Nishitai G. Seo J. Tanemura S. Shimizu N. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Aoki J. Arai H. Iwatsubo T. Mochita M. Watanabe T. Satake M. Ito Y. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 332-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the all-or-none type MAPK activation also occurs in mammalian cells at an individual cell level only when the two MAPKKs are simultaneously activated. Therefore, this MAPK signaling should strictly proceed without errors, essentially through the two separated signals, one of which activates SEK1 and the other activates MKK7. Although the molecular mechanism whereby the two MAPKKs are simultaneously stimulated by various stress signals remains to be resolved, it is tempting to speculate that the existence of the two separated pathways leading to SAPK/JNK activation may physiologically function as a fail-safe mechanism as proposed previously (10Wada T.

Proteolytic analyses showed that the maturation of prostreptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B zymogen (pro-SPE B) involves eight intermediates with a combination ofcis- and trans-processing. Based on the sequences of these intermediates, the substrate specificity of streptopain favors a hydrophobic residue at the P2 site.

Interestingly, the N356D mutant containing protease activity could not be converted into the 28-kDa form by autoprocessing. This observation suggested that Asn356 might involve the cis-processing of the propeptide. In addition, the maturation rates of pro-SPE B with trypsin and plasmin were 10- and 60-fold slower than that with active mature streptopain.

Zymogen activation produces a prompt and irreversible response to a physiological stimulus, and it is capable of initiating new physiological functions.

Similar autoactivation processes have been found in other families of cysteine proteases; specifically, the maturation mechanism of propapain has been fully characterized (17Doran J.D. Nomizu M.

Thecis-processing of propapain is characterized by a zero-order reaction, where the rate of propapain processing is independent of the propapain concentration. In contrast, the trans-processing of propapain is characterized by a higher order reaction, where the rate of propapain processing is dependent on the concentration of propapain (20Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one recent study, investigators used multiple approaches to demonstrate that the maturation of pro-SPE B involves both cis- and trans-processing (17Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Menard R. Griffith D. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pro-SPE B immobilized on a Sepharose resin is capable of liberating the 28-kDa form of streptopain from the column, indicating that the maturation of pro-SPE B involves cis-processing (17Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Menard R. Griffith D. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although streptopain (C10) belongs to one of the cysteine protease families and undergoes similar maturation processing, it contains a prodomain different from that of other cysteine protease families (20Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Groves M.R. Coulombe R. Jenkins J. Cygler M. Proteins. 1998; 32: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The maturation of pro-SPE B to the 28-kDa active form of streptopain can also be mediated by exogenous proteases such trypsin and subtilisin and by the active form of streptopain (14Liu T.-Y. Elliott S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1138-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Streptopain is an extracellular plasmin-binding protein for nephritogenic streptococci (22Poon-King R. Bannan J. Viteri A. Cu G. Zabriskie J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ability of streptopain to bind human plasminogen and plasmin may be important because these interactions may provide a means for GAS invasion. However, the maturation of pro-SPE B by exogenous proteases has never been fully addressed. To date, >60 families of proteases containing a cysteine residue at the active site have been found (21Groves M.R. Coulombe R. Jenkins J. Cygler M. Proteins. 1998; 32: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to the MEROPS Protease Database, 2Available at merops.sanger.ac.uk/. streptopain and papain belong to the C10 and C1 families of papain-like clan CA, respectively. Although there is only 207 identity and 437 similarity between the sequences of streptopain and papain, the catalytic residues of streptopain (Cys192, His340, and Asn356) occur in the same order as those in papain (Cys25, His159, and Asn175), with some identical nearby residues (5Tai J.Y. Kortt A.A. Liu T.Y. Elliott S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the residues involved in the maturation processing of streptopain. For purposes of comparison with previous mutagenesis studies, in this study, we numbered the first methionine of the signal peptide of streptopain as position 1 (23Gubba S. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3716-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Matsuka Y.V. Pillai S. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Olmsted S.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4326-4333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the kinetic and biochemical effects of mutation on the maturation processing of pro-SPE B, in this study, we expressed the wild-type protein and mutants Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A inEscherichia coli: Gln186 is the residue outside the substrate-binding pocket and contacts with the loop containing Cys192; Cys192 and His340 are the catalytic residues; and Asn356 and Trp357 are the residues near the active site of streptopain. Studies of the chemical modifications of cysteine, histidine, and tryptophan also indicate that these residues are essential for the protease activity of streptopain (5Tai J.Y. Kortt A.A. Liu T.Y. Elliott S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structure of the streptopain C192S mutant (Fig. 1) (27Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar), the catalytic site of streptopain has a catalytic Cys-His dyad, which differs from most other cysteine proteases containing a Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad. Previous studies have shown that a mutation at Cys192 or His340 of streptopain leads to a complete loss of protease activity (4Gubba S. Low D.E. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 765-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gubba S. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3716-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Asn175 of papain is not essential for its protease activity, and it may play a role in orientating the catalytic residues. In streptopain, the carbonyl group of Trp357 may replace the function of Asn175 in papain (26Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also demonstrates that Phe342, Trp357, and Phe367 form a hydrophobic pocket that fits a hydrophobic residue at the P2 site of the substrate (26Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the role of Asn356 in streptopain is not clear, it is near the active-site region of streptopain. To compare the maturation of pro-SPE B and propapain, we applied the same approach used in propapain to study pro-SPE B (20Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also investigated the processing of limited proteolysis of pro-SPE B by trypsin and plasmin and characterized the intermediates of pro-SPE B during its course of maturation. Our goal was to provide an additional basis for exploring the differences between autoproteolytic and proteolytic processing. We found that the maturation processing of pro-SPE B involves both cis- and trans-processing in a consecutive cascade with eight identifiable intermediates and that the 28-kDa active form of streptopain is the most effective protease for converting pro-SPE B into a mature protease throughtrans-processing. This study serves as the basis for gaining insight into streptococcal infections by exploring the maturation processing and characterization of streptopain. The genomic DNA of GAS was extracted from strain A20. The structural gene of pro-SPE B was amplified by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GGATCCGGATCCCATCATCATCATCATCATGATCAAAACTTTGCTCGTAACGAA-3′ with a His6 tag and BamHI recognition and by the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCGGATCCCTAAGGTTTGATGCCTACAACAG-3′ with BamHI recognition. The PCR product was purified and then cloned into the BamHI site of the pET-21a vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys strain, and the system was under the control of a strong T7 promoter. The wild-type construct was used to produce Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A mutations using overlap extension PCR (27Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C for 6–8 h in LB medium (1 liter of 10 g of Bacto-Tryptone, 5 g of Bacto-yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl) that was adjusted to pH 7.2 with 3n NaOH. The cells were cultured toA600 = 0.5–1.0. To the culture was added isopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and the culture was further incubated at 15–37 °C for 2–24 h to induce protein production. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by liquid shear with a French press to obtain the extract. To obtain soluble proteins, the conditions of protein expression were optimized by lowering the temperature and by varying induction periods. Under varying induction conditions, 10 ml of cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 8.0). Each lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The proteins in the supernatant (soluble) were collected, and the proteins in the pellet (insoluble) were dissolved in 1 ml of sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed to analyze the relative proportions of overexpressed proteins in the soluble and insoluble fractions. Recombinant wild-type streptopain was converted into a 28-kDa active enzyme during the course of purification. To prevent the conversion, mercuric chloride was added to the wild-type extract to a final concentration of 1 mm and was kept present throughout the purification. In addition, most of the expressed W357A mutant was present as an insoluble inclusion body, and a standard procedure using a denaturing condition was performed to refold the protein (41QIAGEN Inc. QIAGEN Manual. 2nd Ed. QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA1992Google Scholar). The inclusion body of the W357A mutant was solubilized in denaturing solution (4.5 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and the solution was diluted toA280 < 0.1. The protein was renatured by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl and 200 mmNaCl, pH 8.0. The recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+ chelating chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient of 20–200 mm imidazole. The proteins were concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa cutoff membrane and then exchanged with PBS. The final solutions were stored at −20 °C. Native streptopain was purified from strain A20 as previously described (8Kuo C.-F. Wu J.-J. Lin K.Y. Tsai P.J. Lee S.C. Jin Y.T. Lei H.Y. Lin Y.-S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One volume of 1 ml of bacterial culture was first grown overnight at 35 °C in 20 ml of TSBY medium (37 tryptic soy broth and 0.57 yeast extract). The culture was then added to 100 ml of TSBY medium. Streptopain was produced by growing cells at 37 °C for 22–24 h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.45-ॖm membrane filter. The filtrate was diluted with 400 ml of cold distilled water, and the pH was adjusted with 1n NaOH to 8.0. Then, 25 g of pre-equilibrated DEAE-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, were added to the filtrate. The solution was left for 30 min with occasional mixing, and the unbound protein was collected by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated to 100 ml by Amicon ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa cutoff membrane. The buffer was exchanged by ultrafiltration with 1 liter of 207 ethanol and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0. The final solution was loaded onto a Red A column (Dymatrex gel, Millipore Corp.). Streptopain was eluted using a linear gradient of 400 ml of 0–2 m NaCl with a flow rate of 20 ml/h, and 5-ml fractions were collected. SDS-PAGE showed that streptopain with a molecular mass of 28 kDa was homogeneous. The azocasein assay was used to test for proteolytic activity of streptopain and mutant proteins. The assay was modified as previously described (28Stockbauer K.E. Magoun L. Liu M. Burns Jr., E.H. Gubba S. Renish S. Pan X. Bodary S.C. Baker E. Coburn J. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activity was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of azocasein based on the absorbance increase at 366 nm against time as described below. The reaction was initiated by addition of 20 ॖl of streptopain or mutant protein to 160 ॖl of reaction mixture containing 2.7 mg/ml azocasein, 5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 5 mm EDTA (Sigma) in PBS. After incubating the solution at 37 °C for the designated time intervals ranging from 0 to 24 h, the reaction was stopped by addition of 40 ॖl of 157 ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Absorbance was measured using a Beckman Model DU640 spectrophotometer. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of protease required to release 1 ॖg of soluble azopeptide/min. The specific absorption coefficient (A366117 = 40) of the azocasein solution was calculated by measuring its absorption after total digestion (28Stockbauer K.E. Magoun L. Liu M. Burns Jr., E.H. Gubba S. Renish S. Pan X. Bodary S.C. Baker E. Coburn J. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the pro-SPE B C192S mutant does not exhibit any enzyme activity and exists as a 42-kDa zymogen, it can be used as the substrate for the 28-kDa active form of streptopain (17Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Menard R. Griffith D. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a total of 20 ॖl of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. Purified or recombinant streptopain protein at a final concentration of 1.2 ॖmwas incubated with the 42-kDa C192S mutant (24 ॖm) at 37 °C for the designated time intervals ranging from 0 to 14 h. The reactions were quenched by addition of 5 ॖl of 50 ॖm E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The solution was then heated at 100 °C for 10 min and analyzed by 127 SDS-PAGE. Gels were scanned using a Vilber Lourmat Model CN-TFX imaging system, and the intensities of the bands were integrated with BIO-1D Version 5.07 software. Proteolytic activity was measured as the disappearance of pro-SPE B, and relative reaction rates were obtained from the intensity change of the 42-kDa pro-SPE B C192S band against time. Plasmin and trypsin were obtained from Sigma. The reaction was carried out in a total of 20 ॖl of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. Plasmin or trypsin at a final concentration of 1.2 ॖm was incubated with the 42-kDa pro-SPE B C192S mutant (24 ॖm) at 37 °C for the designated time intervals ranging from 0 to 72 h. The reactions were quenched by addition of 5 ॖl of 5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The solution was then heated at 100 °C for 10 min and analyzed by 127 SDS-PAGE. The relative rates of processing were measured from the intensity change of the 42-kDa pro-SPE B C192S band against time. The reaction was carried out in PBS with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. A total of 13.5 ॖg of pro-SPE B were incubated in volumes of 20, 35, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, and 400 ॖl at 37 °C for the designated time intervals from 0 to 14 h. The final concentrations were 0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, and 4 ॖm, respectively. The reaction was quenched by adding 5 ॖl of 50 ॖm E-64 and heating the solution at 100 °C for 10 min, and the solution was then lyophilized for gel analysis. Relative reaction rates were obtained from the intensity change of pro-SPE B against time. The molecular masses of the proteins were examined by mass spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Model API365). Proteins were dissolved in 0.17 formic acid and 1007 methanol as the matrix. Streptopain, mutant proteins, and the cleavage products of wild-type and mutant proteins of pro-SPE B were analyzed by 127 SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.27 Amido Black. The bands were excised and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems Model 477A Sequencer. CD spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structures of wild-type and mutant proteins of pro-SPE B. CD spectra were measured at 27 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter that had been calibrated with camphosulfonic acid. Spectra were recorded under nitrogen between 185 and 260 nm and with a 1.0-nm spectral step size, a 1.0-nm bandwidth, and a 10 or 12 nm/min scan rate. The secondary structures of streptopain and its mutants were estimated using the convex constraint algorithm together with a least-square fitting program (LINCOMB) as described by Perczel et al. (29Perczel A. Hollosi M. Tusnady G. Fasman G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Wild-type pro-SPE B and mutants Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A without their signal peptides were expressed in an E. coli pET-21a expression system. All recombinant proteins contained 11 extra vector residues (ASMTGGQQMGS) and 6 histidine residues to simplify the purification procedures. All recombinant proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity in a single step by Ni2+ chelating chromatography. Recombinant wild-type streptopain was expressed as 42-kDa pro-SPE B and converted into a 28-kDa active enzyme during the course of purification. To prepare 42-kDa pro-SPE B, 1 mm HgCl2 was added as an inhibitor to prevent the conversion. In contrast, all mutant proteins were purified as 42-kDa zymogens without adding HgCl2 as an inhibitor. However, they formed inclusion bodies when the cells were induced at 37 °C. To obtain soluble protein and to maximize the yield, the cells were grown at different temperatures and induction periods. We determined the relative proportions of overexpressed proteins in the soluble and insoluble fractions that were obtained by varying the induction conditions. We found that 100, 68, 42, and 57 of the C192S mutant protein were soluble when the C192S mutant cells were induced at 28, 30, 32, and 37 °C, respectively. Similar approaches were used to obtain 1007 soluble proteins for other mutants. The optimal induction temperatures for the cells of H340R, N356D, and W357A mutants were 28, 25, and 17 °C, respectively. The final yields of the purified wild-type and Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A mutant proteins were ∼45, 40, 380, 210, 15, and 8 mg/liter, respectively (Table I). Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, the wild-type and mutant proteins were homogeneous (Fig. 2). Wild-type streptopain was freshly prepared to prevent autodegradation. The mutant proteins remained stable as 42-kDa zymogens at −20 °C for >2 years. The experimental molecular mass of the C192S mutant was determined to 42,334 Da with a deviation of <0.5 compared with the calculated value.Table IExpression and purification of wild-type streptopain and its Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A mutantsClonesProtein expression conditionsYield1-aYield indicates total soluble protein after purification by Ni2+ chelating chromatography.Specific activity1-bOne enzyme unit is defined as the amount of soluble protease required to release 1 ॖg of soluble azopeptides/min.

Open table in a new tab To examine the structural differences between native and recombinant streptopain while excluding mutation effects due to conformational changes, we performed CD analyses to determine the secondary structures of wild-type and mutant streptopain. The CD spectra were fit with a root mean square deviation of 2–57 using the convex constraint algorithm together with the least-square fitting program (LINCOMB) of Perczel et al. (29Perczel A. Hollosi M. Tusnady G. Fasman G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Although a slight difference at ∼210 nm was observed, CD analysis showed that recombinant and native 28-kDa streptopain had 18.8 and 20.27 α-helix, 55.5 and 52.57 औ-structure, and 25.7 and 27.37 coil, respectively (Fig. 3A). These values are consistent with the reported x-ray structure of the pro-SPE B C192S mutant, which can be calculated by ignoring the propeptide region (26Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the CD spectra of the 42-kDa zymogen forms of Q186N, C192S, H340R, N356D, and W357A were similar (Fig.3B). CD analysis showed that they contained 19.1–23.57 α-helix, 51.5–54.27 औ-structure, and 22.2–25.27 coil, respectively. Their secondary structures obtained from CD spectra were similar to the reported three-dimensional structure of the pro-SPE B C192S mutant, which contains 23.67 α-helix, 52.57 औ-structure, and 23.97 coil (26Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We used azocasein as the substrate to examine the proteolytic activities of the wild-type and mutant proteins of streptopain. As shown in Table I, mutants C192S a"
https://openalex.org/W2108311888,"The K650E substitution in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and is associated to the lethal skeletal disorder, thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII). The underlying mechanisms of how the activated FGFR3 causes TDII remains to be elucidated. FGFR3 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is synthesized through three isoforms, with various degrees of N-glycosylation. We have studied whether immature FGFR3 isoforms mediate the abnormal signaling in TDII. We show that synthesis of TDII-FGFR3 presents two phosphorylated forms: the immature non-glycosylated 98-kDa peptides and the intermediate 120-kDa glycomers. The mature, fully glycosylated 130-kDa forms, detected in wild type FGFR3, are not present in TDII. Endoglycosidase H cleaves the sugars on TDII intermediates thus indicating their intracellular localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, TDII-FGFR3-GFP co-localizes with calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, following TDII transfection, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is phosphorylated in the absence of FGFR3 ligand and brefeldin A does not inhibit its activation. On the contrary, the cell membrane-anchored FRS2α protein is not activated in TDII cells. The opposite situation is observed in stable TDII cell clones where, despite the presence of phosphorylated mature receptor, STAT1 is not activated whereas FRS2α is phosphorylated. We speculate that the selection process favors cells defective in STAT1 activation through the 120-kDa TDII-FGFR3, thus allowing growth of the TDII cell clones. Accordingly, apoptosis is observed following TDII-FGFR3 transfection. These observations highlight the importance of the immature TDII-FGFR3 proteins as mediators of an abnormal signaling in TDII. The K650E substitution in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and is associated to the lethal skeletal disorder, thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII). The underlying mechanisms of how the activated FGFR3 causes TDII remains to be elucidated. FGFR3 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is synthesized through three isoforms, with various degrees of N-glycosylation. We have studied whether immature FGFR3 isoforms mediate the abnormal signaling in TDII. We show that synthesis of TDII-FGFR3 presents two phosphorylated forms: the immature non-glycosylated 98-kDa peptides and the intermediate 120-kDa glycomers. The mature, fully glycosylated 130-kDa forms, detected in wild type FGFR3, are not present in TDII. Endoglycosidase H cleaves the sugars on TDII intermediates thus indicating their intracellular localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, TDII-FGFR3-GFP co-localizes with calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, following TDII transfection, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is phosphorylated in the absence of FGFR3 ligand and brefeldin A does not inhibit its activation. On the contrary, the cell membrane-anchored FRS2α protein is not activated in TDII cells. The opposite situation is observed in stable TDII cell clones where, despite the presence of phosphorylated mature receptor, STAT1 is not activated whereas FRS2α is phosphorylated. We speculate that the selection process favors cells defective in STAT1 activation through the 120-kDa TDII-FGFR3, thus allowing growth of the TDII cell clones. Accordingly, apoptosis is observed following TDII-FGFR3 transfection.

Bio Essays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In particular, the membrane-linked docking proteins FRS2α and FRS2औ function as major mediators of signaling by FGF (8Wong A. Lamothe B. Li A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that several human congenital skeletal disorders result from point mutations in the FGFR3. Indeed, mutations in different domains of FGFR3 are implicated in several clinically related forms of short-stature with graded severity including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and the neonatal lethal syndrome thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) (9Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). TDII is one form of neonatal lethal dwarfism and results from a lysine (K) to glutamate (E) substitution at position 650 (644 in mouse) of FGFR3 (10Tavormina P.L. Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.

The K650E mutation is located in the activation loop of the kinase domain and is associated to strong, ligand-independent constitutive receptor autophosphorylation (11Webster M.K. D'Avis P.Y. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4081-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In in vitro studies and in mice carrying the TDII mutation it was shown that the signal transduction and activator of transcription STAT1 is activated and translocated into the nucleus (12Iwata T.

This, together with activation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21waf1 was proposed as the molecular mechanism responsible for the TDII pathology (13Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C-X. Horton W.A. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligand-independent activation of the STAT signaling pathway was demonstrated in cultured TD cells and confirmed by immunodetection of activated STAT1 associated to apoptosis of chondrocytes in TD fetus (14Li C.

However, the underlying mechanism of how the activated TDII-FGFR3 causes disrupted proliferation and organization of the cartilaginous growth plate of long bones in the TDII remains unclear. In this study we have investigated whether additional means by TDII mutation in FGFR3 could affect receptor signaling. Biosynthesis of FGFR3 is characterized by three isoforms with various degrees ofN-glycosylation: a 98-kDa unglycosylated native protein, a 120-kDa intermediate membrane-associated glycoprotein, and a 130-kDa mature glycoprotein (16Keegan K. Meyer S. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2229-2236PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, we have questioned whether TDII-FGFR3 intermediates played a role in the signal transduction. We show herein that the K644E mutation causes the immature phosphorylated TDII-FGFR3 intermediate glycomers to activate STAT1 from the ER. As far as we know, this is the first report of a tyrosine kinase receptor that signals from within the cell in its immature form. We discuss that a novel intracellular signal transduction pathway may be relevant in the pathogenesis of FGFR3-mediated TDII. Murine FGFR3 cDNA (17Ornitz D.M. Leder P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by C. Basilico. The cDNA was subcloned into pBSKII (Stratagene) and the K644E (TDII) mutation was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5′-GAGGAACAGCTCACCTGCA-3′ (mFR3F1), 5′-CATTTGTGGTCTCCTTGTAGTA-3′ (mFR3644R), 5′- TACTACAAGGAGACCACAAATG-3′ (mFR3644F), and 5′-CAGGAACAGCTCACCTGCA-3′ (mFR3R1). The 5′-half of the wild type mFR3 was amplified with primers mFR3F1 and mFR3644R, whereas the 3′-half of the same cDNA was amplified with primers mFR3644F and mFR3R1. 5′ and 3′ PCR products were then mixed and amplified again with primers mFR3F1 and mFR3R1. After cleavage with BstEII andBglII enzymes the secondary PCR product was cloned into pBSKIImFR3 that had been cleaved with the same two enzymes. The structure of the DNA construct was confirmed by sequencing, and both the wild type and the K644E mFGFR3 cDNAs were then subcloned into the expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen). A double HA sequence was introduced in frame at the 3′ end of both the wt and the TDII mutant mFR3 cDNAs as now described. A first PCR product was obtained by combining 5′-GAGGAACAGCTCACCTGCA-3′ (mFR3F1) and 5′-GGGAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACGTCCGAGGTCCCCCGTT-3′ (mFR3HaR, containing the first HA sequence and the half-site of a SmaI restriction enzyme sequence), and the obtained amplified DNA was digested with BstEII. The second HA sequence was obtained by excising it from the yeast vector pYX (R&D System) usingSmaI and NheI. Both inserts were purified and ligated to the pRcCMVmFR3 digested with BstEII andXbaI. Positive clones were verified by sequencing analysis. Finally, mFGFR3-GFP were obtained by subcloning the cDNAs into the vector pEGFPN1 (Clontech). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Euroclone), 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection of HEK293, NIH3T3 and Cos7 cells was performed with FuGENE (Roche) according to manufacturer's protocols. RCS cells were transfected with calcium-phosphate technique. KMS11 cells (kindly provided by A. Neri) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum. For stimulation with FGF9 (R&D), cells were serum-deprived for 12 h, and then FGF9 was added for 10 min at 100 ng/ml in the presence of Heparin (Sigma). Transfected cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS) in the presence of a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to specific immunoprecipitation using the following antibodies: anti-HA (Roche), anti-FGFR3 C-15, anti-STAT1 E-23, and anti-FRS2α H-91 (Santa Cruz). Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, once with Tris-buffered saline buffer and resuspended in 2× gel loading buffer. STAT1 and FRS2α proteins were separated by 7.57 SDS-PAGE, whereas FGFR3 proteins were resolved by 77 Tricine gels (18Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonP, Millipore), blocked with 57 milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and incubated with desired antibodies. Phosphorylated STAT1 proteins were detected by specific anti-phospho-STAT1 antibodies (Cell Signaling), whereas phosphorylated FGFR3 proteins were revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine PY99 (Santa Cruz). Phosphorylated FRS2α proteins were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine-RC20:HRPO antibodies (Transduction Lab). Where indicated, immunoprecomplexes were resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 17 SDS and 17 औ-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min. Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) was added directly to the recovered samples. Concerning the PNGase F (New England Biolabs) reactions, samples were diluted 1:1 with 50 mm sodium citrate, and 17 of Nonidet P-40 was added prior to adding the enzyme. Both enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. Confluent cultures of HEK293 cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium (ICN) for one hour prior to labeling with 200 ॖCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-mix,Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, cells were labeled in the presence of 5 ॖg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) or 5 ॖg/ml tunicamycin. Cells were grown on glass coverslips surfaced with 10 ॖg/ml of polylisine and transfected with wt and TDII GFP-conjugated constructs for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 47 paraformaldeide, permeabilized with 0.47 of Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-calreticulin antibodies diluted 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. The specific labeling was revealed by using secondary rhodamine-conjugated antibodies (Alexa 594, Molecular Probes). Cell membranes where visualized with fluorescent conjugates cholera toxin B subunit from Molecular Probes. To detect apoptosis, we used antibodies directed to the cleaved p85-poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) (19O'Brien M.A. Moravec R.A. Riss T.L. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Promega) at 1:100 dilution. Analyses were performed with confocal microscopy (Zeiss). To study the biosynthesis of the FGFR3, a double HA epitope-sequence was inserted at the 3′ end of murine wt-FGFR3 cDNA. HEK293 cells were transfected with wt-FGFR3 and several G418-resistant cell clones were isolated. The FGFR3 biosynthetic pattern was studied upon immunoprecipitation and Western blot with anti-HA antibodies. Two specific bands of ∼120 (II) and 130 (III) kDa, were observed in the wt-FGFR3 (Fig. 1, lane 4) as detected by anti- HA antibodies and according to what was previously described (16Keegan K. Meyer S. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2229-2236PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion with PNGase F caused the disappearance of both 120 and 130 kDa species that were reduced to an intense 98-kDa band, thus showing that the higher molecular mass species are N-linked glycosylated isoforms (Fig. 1,lane 6). Differently, Endo-H treatment resulted in the disappearance only of the intermediate 120 kDa species, therefore indicating their presence as high-mannose glycomers still residing into the ER/cis-Golgi compartments (Fig. 1, lane 5). An identical protein profile was detected for the endogenous FGFR3 in the multiple myeloma KMS11 human cells that present the G373C FGFR3 mutant (20Ronchetti D. Greco A. Compasso S. Colombo G. Dell'Era P. Otsuki T. Lombardi L. Neri A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3553-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). Endogenous wt-FGFR3 from RCS chondrocytic cells presented the same pattern (not shown). The identity of the FGFR3 protein profiles ruled out any interference by the HA epitope on the normal processing of the FGFR3-HA protein. A comparative analysis between wt and mutated TDII-FGFR3 biosynthesis was performed by transient transfection of the FGFR3 HA-tagged molecules into HEK293 cells followed by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine. wt-FGFR3 exhibited the three isoforms described above (Fig.2A, lane 2). Surprisingly, only the 98-kDa and a predominant 120-kDa bands (I and II) were detected in TDII (Fig.2B, lane 2). To determine whether the different pattern between wt and TDII receptors was ascribed to an anomalous glycosylation or to uncompleted maturation of the TDII receptor, analysis with specific enzymes and drugs were performed. Because sugar composition of glycoprotein reflects their location in the secretory pathway (21Tarentino A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Endo-H was considered as diagnostic for the position of the band II intermediates. As already mentioned for wt-FGFR3, also the 120-kDa TDII proteins were Endo-H-sensitive, thus confirming their nature as immature intermediates located within the ER/cis-Golgi compartments (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3). We further confirmed the location of the 120-kDa TDII-FGFR3 by performing experiments with the fungal drug BFA, which enhances retrograde traffic from Golgi to ER (22Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). BFA inhibits the formation of the mature form (III) of wt-FGFR3 (Fig. 2A,lanes 4 and 5). In TDII, BFA does not affect the protein profile thus confirming that the 120-kDa species reside in the ER (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin blocks wt and TDII biosynthesis at the immature unglycosylated band I (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 6). We further investigated the possibility that the predominance of the band II in TDII was due to a peculiarity of the HEK293 cells. For this purpose, transfection experiments were performed in NIH3T3 as well in Cos7 cells. In both cell types, TDII-FGFR3 biosynthetic pattern was characterized by the absence of the mature form and by Endo-H-sensitive intermediate glycomers (not shown). In addition, considering that chondrocytes are the cells mostly affected by FGFR3 mutation in the growth plate, we tested whether TDII-FGFR3 showed the same biosynthetic pattern in the RCS cells. As expected, only the 120-kDa form was observed in RCS cells transfected with TDII-FGFR3 molecules (not shown). A kinetic of [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporation was performed to test whether TDII-FGFR3 required a longer time to be processed into the mature form. After 5 h of labeling, the mature 130-kDa forms in TDII were still undetected, whereas the wt mature forms were clearly detected after 90 min of labeling (Fig. 2C). In addition, after 15 min of labeling, we consistently observed a comparable 1:1 ratio between the 98 and the 120-kDa species in TDII (Fig. 2C). This suggests a possible delay in the processing of the native isoforms into the following maturation step, whereas, in the wt-FGFR3, the native forms were rapidly glycosylated (Fig. 2C). To visualize the localization of the TDII intermediates within the cell, the GFP protein was fused at the C terminus of wt and TDII receptors. 48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were fixed and stained with antibodies that recognize calreticulin, which is the major calcium-binding protein found in the ER (23Krause K-H. Michalak M. Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Merging analysis by confocal microscopy showed that TDII-GFP co-localize with calreticulin in the ER (Fig. 3). The same result was obtained when cells were analyzed at 72 h post transfection (not shown). Furthermore, by staining the cells with rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin peptides, which specifically recognize membrane lipid raft, we were able to confirm the absence of TDII-FGFR3 from the cell surface (Fig. 4). On the contrary, the wt-FGFR3-GFP was clearly exposed on the cell surface (Fig. 4).Figure 4FGFR3 with the TDII mutation is not processed on the cell membrane. Confocal microscopy analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with wtFGFR3-GFP or TDIIFGFR3-GFP molecules (green). At 48 h following transfection, cells were fixed and incubated with fluorescent-conjugated cholera toxin B peptides (red). Merge analysis showed the presence of the wt-FGFR3 on the cell surface. On the contrary, the TDIIFGFR3-GFP molecules where not present on the cell surface as indicated by arrows. Bar magnification is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As previously reported (13Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C-X. Horton W.A. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), the human K650E mutation strongly activates FGFR3, which, in turn, activates STAT1. We have investigated whether the intracellular intermediate TDII receptor was phosphorylated and, most importantly, whether STAT1 was activated in cells transiently transfected with TDII-FGFR3. For this purpose, cell lysates from HEK293 transfected with the wt- or TDII-FGFR3 were first immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and subsequently with anti-STAT1 antibodies. The collected immunocomplexes were then analyzed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phospho-STAT1 antibodies. Interestingly, the immature 120-kDa TDII-FGFR3 glycomers were phosphorylated (Fig.5A). Accordingly, STAT1 was phosphorylated in TDII but not in wt-FGFR3 cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, when TDII cells were treated with BFA for 5 h, STAT1 was still detected in its phosphorylated form, thus confirming that such an activation occurred even if the traffic out the ER was inhibited (not shown). Furthermore, we have investigated whether the docking protein FRS2α, which is anchored on the cell membrane, could be activated by TDII intermediates. We did not detect phosphorylated FRS2α in the TDII cells (not shown). We obtained stable TDII-FGFR3 cell clones, although the number of the positive TDII colonies was ∼507 less compared with the number of wt-FGFR3 selected cell clones. Analysis of FGFR3 showed that the 120-kDa intermediate glycomers were highly represented in all TDII cell clones although, to a lesser extent, the mature 130-kDa form was also present (Fig.6A). Of note, in independent clones showing different levels of FGFR3 expression, the intermediate 120-kDa forms were always favored. Both forms of the receptor were constitutively phosphorylated. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of 120 and 130 kDa bands were comparable in intensity, suggesting a higher degree of phosphorylation of the mature forms versusthe intermediates (Fig. 6A). Alternatively, the phosphorylated 130-kDa mature proteins include endogenous co-immunoprecipitated FGFR3. Remarkably, in all the cell clones analyzed, we were unable to detect phosphorylated STAT1 protein (Fig.6B). To determine whether failure in STAT1 activation was due to a cellular defect in the activation of the STAT1 pathway, cells were stimulated with γ interferon. STAT1 was phosphorylated in wt and TDII clones as well as in the parental cells treated with γ interferon (Fig. 6C). We deduced that only the cells that had lost the ability to activate STAT1 through the TDII mutant would be favorably selected to become permissive for the TDII-FGFR3. This indicates that the selection process favored cells defective of a specific factor(s) linked to TDII-FGFR3 and playing a major role in mediating STAT1 activation. The situation was different for FRS2α docking protein. Indeed, FRS2α was present as a constitutively phosphorylated protein only in the TDII cell clones (Fig.6D). Finally, wt and TDII cell clones were treated with FGF9, a specific ligand for FGFR3. This stimulation resulted in the phosphorylation of FRS2α in the wt clones, whereas in TDII the FRS2α remained unchanged in its constitutively phosphorylated form. Differently, FGF9 did not induce STAT1 phosphorylation in both wt and TDII cell clones (not shown). To determine whether TDII-FGFR3 triggered apoptosis, cells were transfected with the wt or the TDII-GFP receptor constructs. At 72 h cells were fixed, incubated with antibodies that recognize only the cleaved p85-PARP, followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig.7, apoptosis was observed in ∼407 of TDII cells as measured by the number of cells showing double fluorescence. TDII mutation in FGFR3 strongly activates receptor signaling, as measured by tyrosine kinase activity and induction of cell proliferation in several cell lines (e.g. BaF3, NIH3T3) (24Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nature Genetic. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, the TDII disease is characterized by disrupted proliferation of chondrocytes in the growth plate, and ultimately the clinical severity parallels the profound kinase activation of the receptor (25Sillence D.O. Horton W.A. Rimoin D.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1979; 96: 813-859PubMed Google Scholar). This paradox was reconciled by demonstrating that FGFR3 signaling can operate along two different pathways. One, the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, leads to cell proliferation (26Chesi M. Brents L.A. Ely S.A. Bais C. Robbiani D.F. Mesri E.A. Kuehl W.M. Bersagel P. Blood. 2001; 97: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas the other pathway, operating through STAT1, induces cell cycle inhibition (27Malika S. Ambrosetti D-C. Mansukhani A. Gertner R. Levy D. Basilico C. Genes ' Development. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have reasoned that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the TDII receptor, per se, was not sufficient to justify the devastating effects observed in TDII. Our first approach in this study was to determine whether biosynthesis of the TDII-FGFR3 presented anomalies. For this purpose we have generated FGFR3 (mutant and wt) tagged with the HA epitope. This allowed us to follow the biosynthesis of the receptor upon transfection in HEK293 cells. At first we ruled out any interference by HA in relation to both synthesis and activation of the FGFR3 by comparing the biosynthetic pattern of wt-FGFR3-HA with endogenous FGFR3 from different cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that the K644E substitution hampers the intermediate glycosylated 120 kDa forms to exit the ER. This is based on the following observations: first, the mature 130-kDa form was not detected; second, the TDII 120-kDa intermediates were sensitive to Endo-H, which is specific for high-mannose sugars on glycoproteins resident in the ER/cis-Golgi compartments. Indeed, Endo-H is considered as diagnostic for the position of a glycoprotein in the secretory pathway. The same results were obtained when TDII-FGFR3 was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 or chondrocytic RCS cells, thus confirming that accumulation of the immature TDII form was due to a property of the mutated protein rather than to a defect of HEK293 cell surveillance on protein synthesis. Furthermore, the results indicate that the switch from a basic 644 lysine to the negatively charged glutamic acid, rather than the tissue specificity, plays a pivotal role in the retention of TDII receptor within the ER. In addition, the molecular weight of the protein species and the profiles obtained with specific enzymes do not indicate a defect in the glycosylation of TDII-FGFR3. Most importantly, we show that the immature 120-kDa forms of TDII receptor were phosphorylated. Furthermore, STAT1 was activated upon TDII transfection, and this coincided with a certain level of apoptosis, in line with a previous report (15Legeai-Mallet L. Benoist-Lasselin C. Delezoide A. Munnich A. Bonaventure J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13007-13014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An important, yet unanswered, question is whether TDII-FGFR3 is retained in the ER in a monomeric or dimeric form. Nonetheless, no traces of the endogenous mature 130-kDa FGFR3 were observed after five hours of metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. We can not exclude, however, the possibility that the endogenous 120-kDa immature FGFR3 forms dimerize with TDII and therefore are retained in the ER. However, it has been previously shown (28Neilson K.M. Freisel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25049-25057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) thatXenopus FGFR2 with the corresponding K652E mutation does not require dimerization for signaling. Further evidence that confirms the signaling by TDII-FGFR3 from the ER was obtained with BFA. Indeed, by blocking the traffic out of the ER, STAT1 was still activated upon transfection. A different situation was recorded in the stable TDII-FGFR3 cell clones in which both 120 and 130 kDa receptor forms were present in their phosphorylated state. At present, we cannot yet explain why the p130 form is present in stable TDII cell clones, however, we can speculate on two possibilities. The first one is that the defect in p130 processing may be bypassed, and over time some mature forms accumulate in stable transfectants. The second hypothesis, which is under study, is that a factor, missing in the stable TDII clones, interacts with the 120-kDa receptor forms in the ER, thus inhibiting, somehow, the regular TDII-FGFR3 processing. It remains to be determined whether STAT1 plays a direct role in such a mechanism. Indeed, surprisingly, it was not detected in its active configuration in stable TDII cells. The fact that STAT1 is activated only by the immature TDII-FGFR3 but not upon stimulation of stable clones with FGF9 supports the hypothesis that STAT1 plays a critical role in the TD (13Su W-C.S.

In line with the above observations are the data obtained with human KMS11 and OPM-2 myeloma cells in which with a strong auto-phosphorylation of FGFR3, carrying the G373C and K650E mutations, respectively, there is not correspondent STAT1 activation (29). Treatment of stable TDII cell lines with the γ interferon showed activation of STAT1, thus indicating that this activation cascade was not affected and that STAT1 itself has not lost the ability to be phosphorylated. We hypothesize that the selection process favored cells in which some critical protein(s) involved in the FGFR3 signaling was missing, thus leaning toward an oncogenic potential. To verify if a switch in the signaling occurred in TDII clones, phosphorylation of FRS2α protein was studied. Interestingly, we have not found phosphorylated FRS2α upon transfection of the TDII molecules. On the contrary, we detected phosphorylation of FRS2α in all the stable TDII cell clones analyzed. Considering that FRS2α is a myristylated protein, which is anchored on the cytoplasmic membrane, the failure in its activation represents further evidence that TDII-FGFR3 signals from the ER. Moreover, the fact that FRS2α fails to be activated upon TDII transfection indicates that the TDII receptor does not phosphorylate the endogenous FGFR3. In conclusion, we show that phosphorylation per se may not be sufficient to explain the severity of the disease. Indeed, we suggest that critical roles are played by phosphorylated immature receptor glycomers that can activate specific substrate(s) from within the cell. We thank Drs. C. Basilico, H.

Although we have previously proven that the PI3K/Akt pathway can suppress androgen receptor (AR) transactivation, the potential linkage from APPL to the AR remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that APPL could suppress AR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. This suppressive effect could be blocked by either dominant-negative Akt or dominant-negative PI3K or LY294002, suggesting that the APPL-mediated suppression of AR transactivation is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. We also observed that APPL could further enhance the Akt-mediated suppression of AR transactivation and AR target gene using the reporter gene and Northern blot assay. APPL was able to enhance insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)-mediated Akt activation. The abrogation of IGF-1-mediated Akt activation by the dominant-negative PI3K or LY294002 or antisense APPL suggests that APPL may function as an important adapter protein in controlling the IGF-1 → Akt signal pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays suggest that APPL, Akt, and AR may exist in a complex and Akt may serve as an important bridge factor for the association of APPL with AR. Together, our data indicate that APPL may suppress AR transactivation via potentiating Akt activity.

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States (7Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). Androgen ablation is the mainstream of therapy for progressive prostate cancer; however, most of prostate cancer patients eventually fail with androgen ablation therapy and die of recurrent androgen-independent prostate cancer (8Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). The failure of androgen ablation therapy may be due to an alteration of the normal androgen axis through mutation of AR, an alteration in the expression of AR coregulators, or a dysregulation of AR activity through signal transduction cascades. A substantial body of literature suggests that the AR can be regulated directly or indirectly by growth factor signal transduction pathways, which may contribute to the development and progression of prostate cancer (8Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) consists of regulatory (p85) and catalytic (p110) subunits that participate in multiple cellular processes, including cell survival, growth, transformation, and differentiation (9Carpenter C.L.

Akt, a serine/threonine kinase can prevent cell apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead transcription factors (10Brunet A.

The binding of PI3K-generated phospholipids to Akt results in the translocation of Akt from the cytoplasm to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where Akt is phosphorylated by the upstream kinases phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-1, PDK-2, and integrin-linked kinase (14Andjelkovic M.

Tissue distribution studies suggest that these Akt homologs are expressed ubiquitously in human tissue and may share similar mechanisms in exerting their biological functions (19Bellacosa A.

APPL (adapter protein containing PH domain,PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif) was identified as an Akt-interacting protein (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and detected in many human tissues including the prostate. The ability of APPL to interact with Akt1 and P110α, the catalytic domain of PI3K, suggests that APPL may function as an adapter to tether Akt and PI3K (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of how APPL influences the P13K/Akt signal pathway, however, remains unclear. Our early reports show that Akt can suppress AR transactivation (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that various AR functions can be suppressed by a new signal pathway of APPL → Akt → AR, which may influence AR-mediated prostate cancer growth. pCDNA3-cAkt (a constitutively active Akt with a deletion at amino acids 4–129 replaced with a consensus myristoylation domain) and pCDNA3-dAkt (a kinase-deficient mutant, K179A) were obtained from Dr. Robert Freeman (22Crowder R.J.

The plasmids pCMV-AR, pSG5-AR, mouse mammary tumor virus promoter-luciferase (MMTV-luc), prostate-specific antigen promoter-luciferase (PSA-luc), promoter-luciferase reporters containing four copies of androgen responsible elements ((ARE)4-luc), pRL-SV40, and pRL-TK have been previously described (2Yeh S.

Hsiao P. Wang C. Su C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The anti-AR monoclonal antibody (G122–77) was purchased from Pharmingen. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma, and the AP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Santa Cruz. APPL cDNA was PCR-amplified from the human testis Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) using primers APPL-5′ (5′ CTT CTC GAG ATG CCG GGG ATC GAC AAG 3′) and APPL-3′ (5′-CGC GGG CCC TTA TGC TTC TGA TTC TCT-3′). The underlined nucleotides represent BamHI in APPL-5′ and ApaI in APPL-3′. The PCR products were cut as a BamHI to ApaI fragment and inserted between the BamHI and ApaI sites in pCDNA3-FLAG and in-frame to the down-stream of the FLAG tag. APPL N- and C-terminal DNA fragments (1–1284 and 1329–2130 bp, respectively) were produced by PCR from pCDNA3-FLAG-APPL and inserted between the BamHI and XbaI sites in pCDNA3-FLAG. The APPL N-terminal DNA fragment was inversely inserted into pFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma) with XbaI andBamHI sites as antisense APPL. Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 50 min in a total volume of 20 ॖl of first-strand buffer (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 ॖg of oligo(dT)12–18 primers (Invitrogen), 0.5 mmeach dNTP (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and 1 ॖg of total RNA. The absence of contaminating DNA from each RNA sample was checked by omitting the reverse transcriptase from the RT reaction (RT control). When the reaction was complete, 2 ॖl of the cDNA solutions were amplified in a final volume of 50 ॖl of PCR buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2) containing 0.2 ॖm each primer, 0.2 mm each dNTP (Invitrogen), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used were: PTB-N 5′, 5′-CGC GGA TCC CAG TTA TTT ATT GTC CGA-3′, and PTB-N 3′, 5′-GCT CTA GAT TAT GGA AAC GTG AGC CTT GT-3′ (250-bp product). The human prostate cancer PC-3 and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 ॖg/ml), and 107 fetal calf serum. The androgen-dependent human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were purchased from ATCC, and the passages numbering between 22 and 30 were used in these studies and maintained in ATCC-recommended RPMI 1640 with 107 fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using SuperFectTM (Qiagen). In brief, cells were plated in 107 charcoal-dextran-treated FBS (CD-FBS)-containing medium in 24-well plates at 8 × 104 cells/well. One day after plating, the cells were transfected according to standard procedures. The cells were transfected with plasmids in the 107 CD-FBS media for 16 h and then treated with ethanol or 10 nm DHT for 24 h. After the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested, cell lysates were prepared and used for luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and are presented as the mean ± S.D. APPL was subcloned into pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were generated from BL21 (DE3) strain and purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The purified GST proteins were resuspended with 100 ॖl of interaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl/pH 8.0, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 87 glycerol, 0.057 (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitors) and incubated with 800 ॖg of LNCaP cell lysates or35S-labeled TNT-expressed AR in the presence or absence of 10 nm ligands on a rotating disk at 4 °C for 2 h. Translation reactions were performed in the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) system according to the manufacturer's instructions. After extensive washes with NENT (20 mm Tris; pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 87 glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) buffer, the bound proteins were separated on an 87 SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot with anti-AR NH27 antibody. A standard protocol was performed for immunoprecipitation. For the immunoprecipitation of APPL and AR, COS-1 cells (at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were maintained in 107 CD-FBS medium and transfected with APPL, AR, Akt, or combinations of these genes. After 16 h, cells were treated with or without DHT for 24 h. For the immunoprecipitation of APPL and PI3K, COS-1 cells (at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were maintained in 107 FBS medium and transfected with APPL and wild-type p85, a regulatory subunit. After 24 h, cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 17 IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, and 0.17 SDS and supplemented with 10 ॖl/ml protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 800 ॖg supernatants were incubated with 1 ॖg of individual antibodies and 30 ॖl of packed protein A/G PLUS-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitated immunocomplexes were solubilized in 60 ॖl of protein sample buffer, resolved by 87 SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The protein complex was detected by Western blot analysis and developed by the AP conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). LNCaP cells were cultured following the methods previously described (28Kang H.Y. Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and treated with or without DHT for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from each plate using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and 25 ॖg of each RNA was loaded onto denaturing agarose gels. The RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane using a vacuum blotter. PSA cDNA was used as the hybridization probe, and औ-actin RNA was used as a control for equivalent RNA loading. We first applied RT-PCR analysis to test the expression of endogenous APPL mRNA in COS-1 and prostate cancer lines, which will be used in the current studies. As shown in Fig. 1, the amplified APPL transcript of 250 bp was detected in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, androgen-independent PC-3 cells, and the COS-1 cells. APPL has been identified as an Akt-interacting protein that contains phosphotyrosine binding, pleckstrin homology (PH), and leucine zipper domains (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our earlier study showed that Akt could suppress AR transactivation in prostate cancer cells (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential influence of APPL on the AR transactivation, we first co-transfected APPL with AR in the presence of 10 nm DHT to see if APPL could influence the activity of the luciferase reporter linked to three different promoters containing AREs, MMTV 5′ promoter, PSA 5′ promoter, and four copies of a synthetic ARE ((ARE)4) in PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, 10 nm DHT induces AR transactivation up to 25-fold, and the addition of APPL can then repress AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner in all three different ARE promoters in PC-3 cells. To reduce the potential artificial effect of exogenous overexpression of AR, we replaced PC-3 cells with LNCaP cells that express endogenous, mutated but functional AR. As shown in Fig.2B, the addition of APPL also represses endogenous AR-induced (ARE)4-luc activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, APPL showed only marginal effects on the estrogen receptor (ER) α-mediated transactivation, even with high concentrations of APPL in PC-3 cells (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that the APPL effect on AR transactivation is selective and may not be due to general transcriptional squenching. To further prove the APPL repression effect on AR transactivation, we tested antisense APPL effect on AR activity in LNCaP cells with natural promoter PSA-luc. As shown in Fig. 2D, APPL also suppressed endogenous AR-induced PSA-luc activity in a dose-dependent manner, and antisense APPL enhanced AR activity and could reverse the inhibitory effect of transfected APPL. Overall, the results from Fig. 2suggest that APPL can repress AR transactivation in prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Because we previously showed that Akt could repress AR transactivation (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we were interested in seeing if APPL, an Akt-interacting protein, had any influence on the Akt-repressed AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.3A, in PC-3 cells cAkt can repress AR transactivation in all reporters with three different AREs, and the addition of APPL can then further suppress AR transactivation. In contrast, the addition of cAkt enhances the ERα-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with a recent publication (29Campbell R.A. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Patel N.M. Constantinidou D. Ali S. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9817-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Together, results from Fig. 3 clearly indicate that both APPL and Akt can repress AR transactivation and that APPL can further enhance the Akt effect on AR transactivation. An earlier report suggested that APPL could interact with Akt and PI3K and might function as an adapter affecting the PI3K/Akt pathway (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We were interested in seeing if APPL-mediated suppression of AR transactivation relied on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Three components, Δp85 (a dominant negative form of PI3K), LY294002 (a selective PI3K inhibitor), and dAkt (a dominant negative form of Akt), were applied to examine potential effects on APPL-mediated AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.4, in PC-3 cells the addition of APPL (lane 3) or cAkt (lane 4) alone suppresses AR transactivation (lane 2). Simultaneous addition of APPL and cAkt further suppresses AR transactivation (lane 5). As expected, the addition of dAkt (lane 6), LY294002 (lane 8), and Δp85 (lane 10) alone enhance AR transactivation, which is consistent with a previous report (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the suppression effect of APPL on AR transactivation can be reversed after adding either dAkt (lanes 3 versus 7), LY294002 (lanes 3 versus 9), or Δp85 (lanes 3 versus 11). These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major role in the APPL-mediated inhibition of AR transactivation. Taken together, the results from Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that the suppression of AR transactivation by APPL is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. APPL was first identified as an Akt interaction protein (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the potential physiological roles of APPL as well as how APPL influences Akt function remain largely unknown. As our data show, because APPL can enhance the Akt-mediated suppression of AR transactivation and the suppression of AR transactivation by APPL is dependent on PI3K/Akt pathway, we would like to see if it is possible that APPL may also be able to influence PI3K/Akt activity. Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that APPL could interact with p85, a subunit of PI3K (Fig.5A). Because the PI3K/Akt pathway can down-regulate the gene expression of p27Kip1(30Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), we used p27Kip1 as a surrogate gene to monitor the Akt activity in the presence and absence of APPL. As shown in Fig.5B, p27Kip1 promoter activity (lane 1) was suppressed by both APPL (lane 2) and cAkt (lane 3). The simultaneous addition of cAkt and APPL (lane 4) could further suppress p27Kip1 promoter activity (lane 4). In contrast, the addition of dAkt (lane 5), LY240092 (lane 6), or Δp85 (lane 7) could reverse the APPL-repressed p27Kip1 promoter activity, implying that APPL may influence p27Kip1 promoter activity via activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. To further confirm this notion, we directly assayed the Akt activity by monitoring the Akt phosphorylation status in the presence and absence of APPL. As shown in Fig. 5C, IGF-1 can activate the Akt activity (lane 2), and this effect can be blocked by Δp85 (lane 8) or LY294002 (lane 12), suggesting that PI3K serves as an upstream activator for IGF-1 mediated Akt activation. As expected, APPL significantly enhanced the IGF-1 mediated Akt activation (lane 4). The enhancement effect of APPL on Akt activation was abrogated by Δp85 (lane 6) or LY294002 (lane 10), indicating that APPL may affect Akt activation by modulation of PI3K activity or PI3K upstream activators. Furthermore, we used the antisense APPL construct to block endogenous APPL expression to see if APPL was required for the mitogenic signal activating Akt. As shown in Fig. 5D, overexpression of APPL significantly enhanced Akt activity (lane 3), but the phosphorylated Akt became undetectable after co-transfection with antisense APPL, even under the treatment of IGF-1 (lane 6 versus lane 2). These findings suggest that APPL is an important adapter protein that may be necessary for Akt activation upon mitogenic stimulation. Data from Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 suggest that APPL may suppress AR transactivation via interaction with PI3K to mediate the growth factor signal for the activation of Akt. To avoid potential artificial effects from the reporter gene assay on the results in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, we replaced PC-3 cells with LNCaP cells and tested the influence of Akt and APPL on the mRNA expression of PSA, an androgen-induced target gene that has been used as a marker to monitor the progress of prostate cancer (31Mulders T.M. Bruning P.F. Bonfrer J.M. Eur. J. Surg. Oncol. 1990; 16: 37-41PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6A, androgen-induced PSA mRNA expression (middle panel, lane 2) can be repressed by the addition of cAkt or APPL (middle panel,lanes 3 and 5, respectively). As expected, the simultaneous addition of cAkt and APPL can further suppress the PSA mRNA expression (middle panel, lane 4). Quantification of the Northern blot in Fig. 6A is presented (upper panel). To further prove the PI3K/Akt signaling repression on AR transactivation, we treated LNCaP cells with LY294002 to determine the effect of the PI3K/Akt pathway on PSA mRNA and protein expression. As shown in Fig. 6B, 4 h of treatment of 20 ॖm LY294002 decreased the PSA mRNA level (middle panel, lane 4 versus lane 2) but increased PSA mRNA expression at 24 h (middle panel, lane 8 versus lane 6). Quantification of the PSA mRNA expression level in Fig. 6B is shown in the upper panel. Western blot results indicated that blockade of PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 (24 h) causes a significant increase of protein expression level of PSA (Fig. 6C, lane 3 versus lane 2), but 4 h of treatment of LY294002 only marginally influenced PSA protein level (data not shown). We also tested the effect of androgen ablation on Akt activity by growing LNCaP cells under serum-starvation conditions for 4 days in the presence and absence of DHT. Removal of androgens resulted in increased levels of active phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 6D, lane 2 versus lane 1), but no changes were observed in Akt protein levels. These data indicate that acute androgen deprivation of LNCaP cells triggered an increase in PI3K and Akt activity. The APPL C terminus is responsible for binding to Akt (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that the APPL C terminus itself may play a role on the repression of AR transactivation. Thus, we dissected the full-length APPL into the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–428 containing the leucine zipper and PH domain) and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 443–710 containing the phosphotyrosine binding domain) (Fig.7A). As shown in Fig.7B, the APPL C terminus suppresses AR transactivation similar to the full-length APPL. In contrast, the APPL N terminus shows little suppression on AR transactivation. The inability of the APPL N terminus to inhibit AR transactivation was not due to lower levels of protein expression, since the expression levels of the full-length APPL, APPL N terminus, and APPL C terminus were comparable (Fig.7C). Because we demonstrated that APPL repression of AR transactivation is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway by inducing Akt activity, it may also be possible that the APPL C terminus is sufficient to enhance Akt activity. Full-length APPL and APPL N and APPL C termini were transfected into COS-1 cells under serum-starvation conditions for 24 h, and then cells were treated with IGF-1 for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 7D, full-length APPL and APPL C terminus both increased the phosphorylated Akt level. The expression of full-length APPL and APPL N and APPL C termini was confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). Hence, the results from Fig. 7 demonstrate that the C-terminal region of APPL may be responsible for APPL suppression of AR transactivation. We used the GST pull-down assay and Western blot analysis to test whether APPL can associate with AR. APPL fused with GST was used as bait to incubate with LNCaP cell lysates, which contain endogenous AR and Akt. Fig.8A indicates AR could be detected through GST-APPL but not GST alone. DHT addition did not significantly enhance the APPL·AR complex formation. We then used in vitro translated 35S-labeled AR to replace LNCaP cell extracts to see if AR can interact with APPL directly. As shown in Fig. 8B, GST-APPL did not pull-down AR in the presence or absence of DHT. However, GST-ARA70 was able to interact with AR under the same conditions. These results suggest that APPL may not directly interact with AR and may require a bridge factor that exists in the LNCaP cell extract to form an APPL·AR complex. Because Akt has been proven to be the interacting protein for both AR (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and APPL (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), it is likely that Akt may serve as a bridge factor to bring the APPL and AR together. If Akt is one of the important bridge factors for the promotion of APPL·AR complex formation, ectopic expression of Akt should enhance this complex formation. To test this hypothesis, COS-1 cells co-transfected with AR, FLAG-APPL, and hemagglutinin (HA)-Akt were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and analyzed by Western blot. The membranes were then probed individually with the antibodies of anti-AR (G122–77), anti-APPL (FLAG M2), and anti-Akt (HA). As shown in Fig. 8C, the APPL·AR complex was not clearly seen (lane 6), and the addition of Akt markedly enhanced APPL·AR complex formation (lane 7). These results support the assumption that Akt may be an important bridge factor for the promotion of APPL·AR complex formation. APPL contains multiple important regulatory motifs, including a PH domain, a phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a leucine zippered coiled-coil domain. The PH domain exists in diverse signaling molecules and permits anchorage of proteins to the cell membrane via phospholipid interactions (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The leucine zippered coiled-coil domain is found in many transcription factors and has been proposed to play a role in the dimerization/polymerization of proteins (32Bresnick E.H. Felsenfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21110-21116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine binding domain was originally identified from mammalian signaling proteins such as Shc and has been shown to mediate protein-protein as well as protein-phospholipid interactions (33Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Although APPL is identified as an Akt-associated protein from the yeast two-hybrid screening using Akt2 as bait (20Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism of how APPL may affect the Akt-signaling pathway and its biological function remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that APPL suppresses the AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner in the androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and that this suppressive effect is largely dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. We also observed that APPL could further enhance the Akt-mediated suppression of AR transactivation. Furthermore, we also found that APPL can interact with PI3K and Akt (Fig. 5A and data not shown). These data suggest that APPL may regulate PI3K/Akt activity by controlling AR transactivation. In support of this notion, we found that APPL suppresses the reporter gene expression of p27Kip1, an Akt down-stream target, and that this effect is blocked by LY294002, Δp85, or dAkt. Thus, APPL may affect the activity of PI3K or the PI3K upstream activator to control p27Kip1 expression. In addition, APPL markedly enhances the IGF-1-mediated Akt activation. This effect is abrogated by LY294002, Δp85, and antisense APPL. These data indicate that APPL modulates the Akt activity via a PI3K-dependent manner. Several lines of evidence suggest that APPL regulates the AR transactivation via the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. First, suppression of AR transactivation by APPL is blocked by LY294002, Δp85, or dAkt. Second, APPL down-regulates gene expression of p27Kip1, which is blocked by LY294002, Δp85, or dAkt. Finally, APPL markedly enhances the IGF-1-mediated Akt activation and the destruction of endogenous APPL by antisense APPL, leading to the blockade of Akt activation upon mitogenic stimulation. How APPL affects the Akt phosphorylation is currently unclear. The fact that the enhancement of Akt activation by APPL is blocked by LY294002, Δp85, or antisense APPL suggests that APPL may affect PI3K. Because APPL contains the PH domain and interacts with PI3K (Fig. 5A), it is likely that APPL serves as an adapter protein that recruits the PI3K to the cell membrane, where it can be activated by growth factor receptors like the IGF-1 receptor, followed by subsequent Akt activation. AR is a well known critical proliferation factor in prostate cancer. The study on the role of PI3K/Akt in the progression of prostate cancer suggests that PI3K/Akt may function as a dominant growth factor-activated cell survival pathway in LNCaP cells (34Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PI3K/Akt and AR may cooperate with each other to promote the prostate cancer cell survival and growth. Based on our data and other reports, PI3K/Akt and AR may also negatively regulate each other to maintain homeostasis of prostate cancer cells. Supporting this hypothesis, Lin et al. (34Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar) find that in LNCaP cells inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway will induce apoptosis, but DHT pretreatment can prevent this apoptosis. Our data further indicate that inhibition of PI3K/Akt strongly induces AR functioning, suggesting that LNCaP cells are able to enhance AR activity to rescue themselves from apoptosis caused by the blockade of PI3K/Akt. Thompsonet al. (35Thompson J. Koskinen P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. The Endocrine Society 84th Annual Meeting, San Francisco, CA, June 19–22, 2002. The Endocrine Society, 2002Google Scholar) demonstrate that Akt can suppress AR transactivation in PC-3 cells, which is also consistent with our previous report (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), In addition, Murillo et al. (36Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) show that androgen ablation can increase PI3K-Akt activity, as our data suggest (Fig. 6D), implying that enhanced Akt activity may rescue LNCaP cells from impairment of androgen withdrawal. Taken together, these findings suggest that the survival factor Akt and the proliferation factor AR may mutually influence prostate cancer cell survival and growth in a balanced way. Interestingly, using reporter gene assays, Thompson et al.(35Thompson J. Koskinen P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. The Endocrine Society 84th Annual Meeting, San Francisco, CA, June 19–22, 2002. The Endocrine Society, 2002Google Scholar) and Lin et al. (21Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) indicate that Akt can suppress AR transactivation in PC-3 cells, whereas Wen et al. (37Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar) find that Her2/Neu was able to go through Akt to enhance PSA promoter activity in LNCaP cells in the absence of androgen. Manin et al. (38Manin M. Baron S. Goossens K. Beaudoin C. Jean C. Veyssiere G. Verhoeven G. Morel L. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 729-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that LY294002 treatment could decrease AR protein and PSA mRNA levels but was unable to influence AR mRNA expression in LNCaP cells, whereas Sharma et al. (39Sharma M. Chuang W.W. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30935-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) find that LY294002 treatment did not suppress the AR protein level in LNCaP cells, but 4 h of LY294002 treatment decreased the PSA mRNA level, which is consistent with our report (Fig. 6B). The detailed mechanisms for these discrepancies remain unclear. This may be due to the use of different reagents and different cell lines with various passage numbers. Furthermore, different experimental conditions, such as varied concentrations and treatment times of LY294002, applied by individual investigators, may also influence the results. We used parental LNCaP cells with passage numbers 23–30 under the ATCC-medium culture condition in our studies. According to our data and the results from a recent report which show that LNCaP cells with androgen withdrawal treatment show increased Akt activity sustained throughout the progression process (36Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) combined with the evidence that PI3K/Akt is the dominant factor for the LNCaP cells survival (34Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that AR activity can be induced by LY294002 to play a dominant proliferation role to compensate for the loss of PI3K/Akt signaling. Overall, AR and PI3K/Akt signaling both appear to be important proliferation and survival factors in prostate cancer cells and also seem to antagonize each other to maintain cell homeostasis. In conclusion, our finding that APPL may suppress AR function via the PI3K-Akt pathway may represent a unique pathway that further expands the importance of the PI3K-Akt-AR pathway in prostate cancer. Further development of blockers to interrupt this pathway may help us to battle the prostate cancer. We are grateful to Drs. R. Freeman and T. Sakai for reagents.

https://openalex.org/W2011118302,"We report here the NMR structure and backbone dynamics of an exchangeable apolipoprotein, apoLp-III, from the insect Locusta migratoria. The NMR structure adopts an up-and-down elongated five-helix bundle, which is similar to the x-ray crystal structure of this protein. A short helix, helix 4′, is observed that is perpendicular to the bundle and fully solvent-exposed. NMR experimental parameters confirm the existence of this short helix, which is proposed to serve as a recognition helix for apoLp-III binding to lipoprotein surfaces. The L. migratoria apoLp-III helix bundle displays several characteristic structural features that regulate the reversible lipoprotein binding activity of apoLp-III. The buried hydrophilic residues and exposed hydrophobic residues readily adjust the marginal stability of apoLp-III, facilitating the helix bundle opening. Specifically, upon lipoprotein binding the locations and orientations of the buried hydrophilic residues modulate the apoLp-III helix bundle to adopt a possible opening at the hinge that is opposite the recognition short helix, helix 4′. The backbone dynamics provide additional support to the recognition role of helix 4′ and this preferred conformational adaptation of apoLp-III upon lipid binding. In this case, the lipid-bound open conformation contains two lobes linked by hinge loops. One lobe contains helices 2 and 3, and the other lobe contains helices 1, 4, and 5. This preferred bundle opening is different from the original proposal on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of this protein (Breiter, D. R., Kanost, M. R., Benning, M. M., Wesenberg, G., Law, J. H., Wells, M. A., Rayment, I., and Holden, H. M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 603–608), but it efficiently uses helix 4′ as the recognition short helix. The buried interhelical H-bonds are found to be mainly located between the two lobes, potentially providing a specific driving force for the helix bundle recovery of apoLp-III from the lipid-bound open conformation. Finally, we compare the NMR structures of Manduca sexta apoLp-III and L. migratoria apoLp-III and present a united scheme for the structural basis of the reversible lipoprotein binding activity of apoLp-III.

Exchangeable apolipoproteins regulate the metabolism of lipids and plasma lipoproteins by their reversible lipoprotein binding activity (1Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is commonly believed that lipoprotein association induces a large conformational change in apolipoproteins (2Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the lipid-free state, apolipoproteins adopt an up-and-down helix bundle topology (3Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On lipid binding, however, the apolipoprotein helix bundle is believed to open at putative hinge loops that connect helices, adopting an extended α-helical conformation that contains large flat hydrophobic surfaces for lipid binding (4Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Weisgraber K.H. Adv.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in a lipid mimetic environment support this open conformation model, important questions are raised as to what triggers the lipid binding process and what structural features in the helix bundle regulate the bundle opening/recovery. ApoLp-III is an exchangeable apolipoprotein found in the hemolymph of many insect species. It serves as a good model for structure-function studies of human exchangeable apolipoproteins (2Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III provided the first high resolution structure of an exchangeable apolipoprotein and offered the possibility of correlating the structural knowledge of an apolipoprotein to its reversible lipid binding activity (4Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have reported an NMR structure of M. sexta apoLp-III (5Wang J. Gagne S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Wang J. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both apoLp-IIIs adopt a similar up-and-down elongated five-helix bundle topology. We further described several important structural features that modulate the helix bundle opening/recovery of M. sexta apoLp-III on association/dissociation with the lipoprotein surface (9Wang J. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, a short helix was found between helices 3 and 4 in M. sexta apoLp-III (helix 3′), but was not reported in the original paper on the x-ray crystal structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III (4Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This short helix, located at one end of the bundle, adopts an orientation that is nearly perpendicular to the long axis of the bundle and is fully exposed to the solvent. We hypothesized that this short helix played a critical role in initiating the lipid binding process of apoLp-III (5Wang J. Gagne S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our experimental evidence using site-directed mutagenesis supported this concept (10Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Schieve D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4366-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fact that both apoLp-IIIs share a similar helix bundle topology and an identical reversible lipoprotein binding activity leads us to speculate that L. migratoria apoLp-III may have a similar short helix that is responsible for lipid surface recognition. To test this hypothesis, we carefully studied the x-ray crystal structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III (Protein Data Bank code 1AEP) and found a similar short helix that is located at the opposite end of the helix bundle from that of helix 3′ in M. sexta apoLp-III. This short helix, helix 4′, is located between helices 4 and 5 (Ala129–Pro132). Despite a different location from helix 3′ in M. sexta apoLp-III, helix 4′ in L. migratoria apoLp-III is also perpendicular to the long axis of the helix bundle and is fully solvent-exposed. This raises the question of whether the helix bundle of L. migratoria apoLp-III may open in a different manner if helix 4′ serves as the recognition short helix. To confirm this short helix in solution, we carried out a NMR structural determination of L. migratoria apoLp-III. On the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III, it was proposed that upon lipid binding the bundle opens in such a way that the helices spread on the lipid surface. Helices 1, 2, and 5 form a lobe, and helices 3 and 4 form the other lobe (4Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The two lobes are linked by the putative hinge loops in which one loop contains helix 4′. This hypothesis is based on an assumption that several conserved leucine residues located in the putative hinges serve as the recognition sites of apoLp-III for the lipoprotein surface. One recent report seems to support this hypothesis (11Weers P.M. Narayanaswami V. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An alternative model for the apoLp-III helix bundle opening is that it opens at hinges located at the opposite end to helix 4′, containing helices 1, 4, and 5 in one lobe and helices 2 and 3 in the other lobe. The helix bundle topology indeed allows for this alternative bundle opening. More importantly, this alternative model permits helix 4′ to serve as a recognition helix, similar to the role that helix 3′ plays in M. sexta apoLp-III. The apparent difference between these two models is that the helix bundle opens at a different end of the bundle. An NMR solution structure and dynamics may provide critical information to identify the most likely conformation adaptation of L. migratoria apoLp-III on lipid binding. Expression, Purification, and Isotope Labeling of L. migratoria apoLp-III—An efficient expression system of L. migratoria apoLp-III has been developed (12Weers P.M. Wang J. Van der Horst D.J.

Briefly, saturated 2× YT overnight was diluted (1:100, v/v) in M9 minimal medium containing 0.1% 15NH4Cl and/or 0.2% d-13C6-glucose (Isotec, Miamisburg, OH) and incubated at 37 °C. The protein production was induced at an A600 = 0.9–1.0, using 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was then kept shaking at 28 °C overnight. The expression was stopped and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. After being concentrated to 50 ml, the supernatant was dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h and lyophilized. The protein was then dissolved in deionized water and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography on a preparative Zorbax C8 reversed phase column. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the relative isotope enrichment was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The final yield for 15N-labeled protein was 100–120 mg and for 13C/15N-labeled protein was 80–100 mg/liter. The purity of the protein was >99%, and the isotope enrichment was >95%. NMR Sample Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR sample was prepared at 1 mm in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) with 0.05% NaN3, 0.03 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate and 5% D2O. The proton chemical shift was referenced using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0.0 ppm. All NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance z-axis gradient probe. The following NMR experiments were collected for NMR assignment and structure calculations: two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-13C HSQC and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, 13C-edited NOESY, 15N-edited TOCSY, HNHA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NNH, HCCH-TOCSY, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO. NMR data processing was achieved using nmrPipe and nmrDraw software (13Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11562) Google Scholar), and the spectral assignment was achieved using PIPP (14Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). NMR Spectral Assignment and Structure Calculation—Three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, 15N-edited TOCSY, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NNH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO were used for the backbone atom assignment. Three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, 15N-edited TOCSY, and HCCH-TOCSY were used for the side chain assignment. The chemical shift assignment has been deposited in the BioMagResBank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under BMRB number 4814 (15Fan D. Reese L. Ren X. Weers P.M.M. Ryan R.O. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The 3JHN-HA coupling constants and ϕ torsion angles were obtained using HNHA spectra. The TALOS program was used to obtain the backbone dihedral angles (Φ and Ψ) on the basis of chemical shift information (16Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). NOE distance restraints were generated using 15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Structure calculations were performed on the basis of 2750 non-hydrogen bond NOE restraints and 271 dihedral angle restraints (Φ and Ψ) with a simulated annealing protocol (17Nigles M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 129-136Google Scholar) using the X-PLOR program (18Brunger A.T. X-PLOR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The NOE-derived distance restraints were classified into four groups with the upper boundaries of 2.7, 3.5, 5.0, and 6.0 Å on the basis of NOE intensity measurements. Structure calculations were carried out semiautomatically using a computer program to resolve ambiguous NOEs (19McInnes C Wang J. O'Conner McCourt M. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27357-27363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in an iterative manner. Each iteration generated 50 NMR structures, which were analyzed for identification of distance restraint violations of >0.3 Å. NOEs were checked for ambiguity, followed by generation of a new distance restraint set for the next calculation. Thirteen iterations were carried out, and the final iteration generated 50 structures with no NOE violations of >0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations of >2.0°. The 20 lowest energy NMR structures within the final 50 structures were used for the structural statistics calculation. Structural Analysis—The NMR and x-ray crystal structures of L. migratoria apoLp-III were analyzed using PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Google Scholar) and VADAR (21Wishart D.S. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. VADAR. Edmonton, Alberta, Canada1994Google Scholar) programs. Both programs analyze the coordinates of proteins and give secondary structure locations. The VADAR program also provides the fractional solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of the side chain of each residue as well as H-bonding information. From the fractional ASA of each side chain, we identified buried hydrophilic residues and exposed hydrophobic residues. The thresholds used were a side chain fractional ASA of <0.30 for the buried hydrophilic residues and a side chain fractional ASA of >0.30 for the exposed hydrophobic residues. 15N Relaxation Measurements—The 15N relaxation times T1 and T1 and 1H-15N NOEs were measured using inversely detected two-dimensional NMR methods (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar, 23Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 911-912Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Relaxation times T1 were determined by collecting seven points with delays of 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 700 ms using a recycle delay of 1 s and 8 scans. Relaxation times T1 were measured by collecting seven points with delays of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 ms using a spin-lock power of 1.6 kHz, a 2.5-s recycle delay, and eight scans. To measure the heteronuclear NOEs, two spectra were acquired with and without proton saturation using 24 scans. Saturation was achieved by using a train of 120° 1H pulses applied for 4 s after a 4-s recycle delay. All the data were recorded by using 256 and 512 complex points in t1 and t2 dimensions, respectively, and with spectral widths of 1316 Hz (15N) and 8000 Hz (1H). Relaxation times were fitted as single exponential decays to peak height data. Spin-spin relaxation time T2 was calculated from T1ρ and T1 according to Equation 1, 1/T1ρ=1/T1sin2θ+1/T2cos2θ(Eq. 1) where τ = atan(Δω/ω1) and Δω and ω1 are the resonance offset and spin-lock field strength, respectively. Quality of the NMR Structure—Fig. 1 shows an ensemble of 20 NMR structures and a ribbon representation of the energy-minimized average structure of lipid-free L. migratoria apoLp-III. The coordinates of these 20 NMR structures and an energy-minimized average structure have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (code 1LS4). Table I lists the structural statistics for the 20 deposited NMR structures and the energy-minimized average structure. The root mean square deviation of the well defined secondary structure regions of the 20 NMR structures to the energy-minimized average structure is 0.62 ± 0.07 Å for the backbone and 1.05 ± 0.08 Å for the heavy atoms. A PROCHECK analysis of the energy-minimized average NMR structure indicated that 83% of the residues lie in the most favored region, 14.6% of the residues lie in additionally allowed regions, and 2.4% of the residues lie in generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. There are no residues located in the disallowed regions.Table IStructural statistics for the 20 NMR structures of L. migratoria apoLp-IIIStructural statistics<SA><SA>a<SA> is the energy-minimized average structure of 20 NMR structuresr.m.s.d.br.m.s.d., root mean square deviation from distance restraints <Å>cNOE force constant = 50 kcal/mole Å-2All (2750)0.016 ± 0.0010.015Intraresidue (540)0.007 ± 0.0020.005Sequential (772)0.013 ± 0.0020.012Medium range (1203)0.012 ± 0.0010.009Long range (235)0.010 ± 0.0010.010r.m.s.d. from torsion angle restraints<°>dTorsion angle force constant = 200 kcal/mole Å-2Φ angles (133)0.42 ± 0.100.43Ψ Angles (138)eThe Ψ torsion angle restraints are generated using TALOS calculation based on chemical shift information0.50 ± 0.080.49X-PLOR potential energies (kcal mol-1)E (total)180.4 ± 8.7178E (bond)6.9 ± 0.57E (ang)144.4 ± 4.6142E (imp)14.2 ± 0.715E (vdw)8.2 ± 2.06E (NOE)2.5 ± 1.22E (dih)4.1 ± 0.96r.m.s.d. from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.00 ± 0.000.00Angle (°)0.46 ± 0.010.40Improper (°)0.27 ± 0.010.30Structural r.m.s.d. for secondary structure regions (Å)BackboneHeavy<SA>versus<SA>fAtoms of well defined secondary structure regions: residues 11-34, 41-65, 71-88, 100-124, and 136-1600.62 ± 0.071.05 ± 0.08a <SA> is the energy-minimized average structure of 20 NMR structuresb r.m.s.d., root mean square deviationc NOE force constant = 50 kcal/mole Å-2d Torsion angle force constant = 200 kcal/mole Å-2e The Ψ torsion angle restraints are generated using TALOS calculation based on chemical shift informationf Atoms of well defined secondary structure regions: residues 11-34, 41-65, 71-88, 100-124, and 136-160 Open table in a new tab Description of ApoLp-III Structure—The NMR structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III consists of five long amphipathic α-helices that form an up-and-down antiparallel elongated helix bundle with short loops of 3–9 residues connecting the helices. A short helix, helix 4′ is observed between helices 4 and 5. The location of each helix is: helix 1, residues 10–35; helix 2, residues 40–66; helix 3, residues 70–89; helix 4, residues 99–125; short helix 4′, residues 128–132; and helix 5, residues 134–161. Such a helix location is nearly identical to that of the x-ray crystal structure (helix 1, residues 10–32; helix 2, residues 37–68; helix 3, residues 72–87; helix 4, residues 96–125; short helix 4′, residues 129–132; and helix 5, residues 134–156), except for helix 5. Although helix 5 in the x-ray crystal structure is located between residues 134 and 156, helix 5 in the NMR structure extends to residue 161. The helix bundle topology of the NMR structure is also nearly identical to the x-ray crystal structure with a root mean square deviation (backbone superposition) of 2.06 Å between the two structures. A careful comparison between the NMR and the x-ray crystal structures indicates that the five helix segments are superimposed very well with a smaller root mean square deviation, whereas the loops and two terminals are superimposed less well. This is especially true in the loop between helices 2 and 3, and the loop between helices 3 and 4. Interestingly, the short helix, helix 4′, and the loop residues before and after this short helix are better superimposed between the two structures as compared with the other loops. The fact that helix 4′ (highlighted in red in Fig. 1) is better superimposed indicates that this short helix is conserved in both structures, suggesting a potentially important role in the function of apoLp-III. Existence of Helix 4′—To confirm the existence of helix 4′,we carefully examined the NMR parameters, such as NOEs, coupling constants, amide exchange rates, and chemical shift index, of the corresponding region, Gln127-Glu128-Ala129-Trp130-Ala131-Pro132. Fig. 2 shows these NMR parameters, providing strong NMR evidence that the helix 4′ exists in the region of residues 128–132. Structure calculation generated the 20 lowest energy structures that all contained this short helix between residues 128 and 132. VADAR calculation of the energy-minimized averaged structure indicates that whereas Gln-127 and Glu-128 are nearly completely exposed (Gln-127, fractional ASA of 0.77; Glu-128, fractional ASA of 0.65), Ala-129 is completely buried (ASA, 0.06), and Trp-130, Ala-131, and Pro-132 are partially buried (Trp-130, fractional ASA of 0.47; Ala-131, fractional ASA of 0.42; and Pro-132, fractional ASA of 0.37). This is different from the x-ray crystal structure in which Trp-130 is completely buried (Gln-127, fractional ASA of 0.84; Glu-128, fractional ASA of 0.79; Ala-129, fractional ASA of 0.39; Trp-130, fractional ASA of 0.04; Ala-131, fractional ASA of 0.56; Pro-132, fractional ASA of 0.53), but consistent with the recent results by Weers et al. (24Weers P.M. Prenner E J. Kay C. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6874-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We suggest that this difference is mainly because helix 4′ starts at residue Glu-128 in solution but at residue Ala-129 in the x-ray structure. Buried Hydrophilic Residues, Exposed Hydrophobic Residues, and Buried H-bonds—VADAR calculation indicated several hydrophilic residues that are buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein and several exposed hydrophobic residues that are located on the bundle surfaces. A total of 22 buried/partially buried hydrophilic residues and a total of 14 exposed/partially exposed hydrophobic residues were observed. Table II indicates that both buried/partially buried hydrophilic residues and exposed/partially exposed hydrophobic residues are evenly distributed in each helix of L. migratoria apoLp-III. Fig. 3 shows a helix wheel diagram of L. migratoria apoLp-III on the basis of its NMR structure, providing both the location and orientation of each residue. Strikingly, Fig. 3 demonstrates that buried/partially buried hydrophilic residues are not evenly located/oriented between helix-helix interfaces. Although only a few buried/partially buried hydrophilic residues are located in the interfaces between helices 1 and 4 (Asn-18), between helices 1 and 5 (Thr-20, Glu-27, Thr-31, and Thr-144), and between helices 2 and 3 (Lys-52, Thr-59, Asn-78), most buried/partially buried hydrophilic residues are located in the interfaces between helices 2 and 5 (Gln-47, Glu-65, Ser-61, Lys-68, Glu-139, and Ser-154) and between helices 3 and 4 (Ser-87, Gln-100, Ser-103, Asn-110, Gln-114, and Lys-121). A similar observation has also been obtained for the exposed/partially exposed hydrophobic residues. VADAR calculation further indicates that several buried hydrophilic residues form either buried intrahelical H-bonds or buried interhelical H-bonds. Table III lists 11 interhelical hydrogen bonds that are either completely buried or partially buried. The fractional ASA data listed in Table III provide quantitative data on the extent of burial of the buried H-bonds. For example, the H-bond between Thr-59 and Ala-81 is completely buried with the fractional ASA of both residues less than 0.06, whereas the rest are partially buried, with the ASA values of either one residue between 0.03 and 0.30 or both residues between 0.10 and 0.30. Fig. 4 demonstrates that buried H-bonds are mostly located in the interfaces between helices 2 and 5 (5 interhelical H-bonds) and between helices 3 and 4 (4 interhelical H-bonds). One buried interhelical H-bond was found between helices 2 and 4, and another one between helices 2 and 3. No buried H-bond was observed either between helices 1 and 4 or between helices 1 and 5.Table IIBuried/partially buried hydrophilic residues and exposed/partially exposed hydrophobic residues in L. migratoria apoLp-III NMR structureSecondary structureBuried/partially buried hydrophilic residuesExposed/partially exposed hydrophobic residuesHelix 1 (10-35)aThe number represents the residue number of the helixAsn-18 (0.29), Thr-20 (0.16)Ala-13 (0.65),bThe number represents the fractional solvent-accessible surface area Val-22 (0.53)Glu-27 (0.16), Thr-31 (0.00)Leu-34 (0.31), Pro-35 (0.32)Helix 2 (40-66)Gln-47 (0.19), Lys-52 (0.30)Ala-50 (0.52)Thr-59 (0.05), Ser-61 (0.17)Ala-56 (0.31)Glu-65 (0.13)Helix 3 (70-89)Gln-70 (0.28), Asn-78 (0.30)Val-73 (0.64), Ala-79 (0.58)Ser-87 (0.29)Phe-80 (0.38)Helix 4 (99-125)Gln-100 (0.00), Ser-103 (0.20)Ala-124 (0.84)Asn-110 (0.26), Gln-114 (0.16)Lys-121 (0.30), Thr-122 (0.02)Helix 4′ (128-132)Trp-130 (0.44), Ala-131 (0.43)Pro-132 (0.30)Helix 5 (133-161)Glu-139 (0.29), Thr-144 (0.06)Ala-149 (0.53)Gln-152 (0.18), Ser-154 (0.29)a The number represents the residue number of the helixb The number represents the fractional solvent-accessible surface area Open table in a new tab Table IIIBuried/partially buried H-bonds in L. migratoria apoLp-III NMR structureHelix 1Helix 2Helix 3Helix 4Helix 5Helix 1Helix 2Thr-59s-Ala-81ba“s” s"
https://openalex.org/W2056245360,"We present here the 2.3-Å crystal structure of the Escherichia coli YdiB protein, an orthologue of shikimate 5-dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate as part of the shikimate pathway, which is absent in mammals but required for the de novo synthesis of aromatic amino acids, quinones, and folate in many other organisms. In this context, the shikimate pathway has been promoted as a target for the development of antimicrobial agents. The crystal structure of YdiB shows that the protomer contains two α/β domains connected by two α-helices, with the N-terminal domain being novel and the C-terminal domain being a Rossmann fold. The NAD+ cofactor, which co-purified with the enzyme, is bound to the Rossmann domain in an elongated fashion with the nicotinamide ring in the pro-R conformation. Its binding site contains several unusual features, including a cysteine residue in close apposition to the nicotinamide ring and a clamp over the ribose of the adenosine moiety formed by phenylalanine and lysine residues. The structure explains the specificity for NAD versus NADP in different members of the shikimate dehydrogenase family on the basis of variations in the amino acid identity of several other residues in the vicinity of this ribose group. A cavity lined by residues that are 100% conserved among all shikimate dehydrogenases is found between the two domains of YdiB, in close proximity to the hydride acceptor site on the nicotinamide ring. Shikimate was modeled into this site in a geometry such that all of its heteroatoms form high quality hydrogen bonds with these invariant residues. Their strong conservation in all orthologues supports the possibility of developing broad spectrum inhibitors of this enzyme. The nature and disposition of the active site residues suggest a novel reaction mechanism in which an aspartate acts as the general acid/base catalyst during the hydride transfer reaction.

The shikimate pathway in bacteria has also been considered as a route to industrial production of hydroaromatic compounds for use in chemical syntheses (9Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. Biochem.

For instance, the genome of Bacillus subtilis (13Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A.

In contrast, this pattern is reversed in the genome of Escherichia coli K12 (14Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K.

The ydiB gene in E. coli K12 is cocistronic with the aroD gene, i.e. the only orthologue of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase found in this organism. The YdiB protein is 28% identical and 50% similar to the AroE protein (12Anton I.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem.

Although the redundancy of these enzymes in many pathogenic organisms suggests that their function is important under physiological conditions, it also raises questions as to the feasibility of using shikimate pathway inhibitors as antibiotics. However, the results reported in this article show very tight conservation of the substrate binding site in all orthologues of shikimate 5-dehydrogenase, suggesting that the design of broad spectrum antibiotics directed against this enzyme is possible (16Magalhaes M.L.

Shikimate 5-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.25) functions to catalyze the reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate using the cofactor NADH (12Anton I.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem.

This enzyme belongs to the superfamily of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases, which function in anabolic and catabolic enzyme pathways as well as in xenobiotic detoxification. This superfamily is usually subdivided into several families, including short chain dehydrogenases (22Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3115-3122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism used by these enzymes involves the catalysis of hydride transfer from the NAD(P)H cofactor on the basis of stabilization of the negative charge accumulation in the hydride-accepting substrate by either an amino acid side chain acting as a general base proton donor or a prosthetic cation in the active site. The crystal structure of the YdiB shikimate dehydrogenase orthologue from E. coli that is reported in this article shows variations in the identity and spatial distribution of the active site residues compared with any other known oxidoreductase structure, suggesting that the details of its catalytic reaction mechanism are likely to be different from the other enzymes in the NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily. Protein Expression and Purification—The full-length ydiB gene from E. coli was cloned into a pET21d (Novagen) derivative. The gene was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (containing the rare tRNA expression plasmid pMGK), yielding a protein containing the entire native sequence plus an eight-residue affinity tag at its C terminus (LEHHHHHH). Protein was produced in MJ9 minimal medium (28Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) supplemented for selenomethionine labeling (29Doublie S. Kapp U. Aberg A. Brown K. Strub K. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 17 °C after growth to mid-log phase at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, the clarified extract was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic column (Qiagen) and eluted in the same buffer plus 250 mm imidazole. After purification on a Superdex 75-gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization. Enzyme Assays—Activity was monitored on the basis of the increase of A340 nm on the reduction of NAD+ (assuming an extinction coefficient of 6230 cm-1m-1 for NADH) in the buffer used previously for AroE (30Chaudhuri S. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (100 mm Na2CO3 and 2 mm NAD+, pH 10.6, at 25 °C). The enzyme was used at 320 nm and shikimate or quinate (Sigma) at 4 mm. One unit is defined as a rate of 1 μmol/min. Crystallization—Crystals were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 21 °C over a reservoir containing 25% PEG 6000, 200 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate, pH 5.2. Each drop contained 2 μl of protein, 1.6 μl of reservoir solution, and 0.4 μlof3 m non-detergent sulfobetaine 195. Hexagonal rods grew to ∼50 × 50 × 400 μm overnight and were frozen in liquid propane using paratone-N as a cryoprotectant. Quinate was added to the protein solution at a 1 mm concentration before setting up the drop that produced the crystal that was solved and refined. However, this ligand was not required for crystal growth, and no evidence of it was observed in the electron density maps. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on beamline X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Table I). Multiwavelength selenium anomalous diffraction data sets were collected on the Brandeis B4 detector in consecutive 370° sweeps at 0.9790 (peak), 0.9787 (edge), and 0.9200 Å (remote) using 1° oscillations and 5–10 s exposures. The data were processed and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) (Table I). The Laue symmetry of the diffraction pattern and systematic extinctions were consistent with the hexagonal space groups P62 or P64, indicating a 56% solvent content assuming a dimer of YdiB in the asymmetric unit. SOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Eventually, all of the residues in the protomer were included in the model except for the C-terminal affinity tag (and one adjacent residue from the native protein in one of the two subunits). An Rfree set containing 5% of the reflections was selected at random. Strong non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (250 kcal/Å2 and σB = 1.5) were maintained throughout the model at all stages of refinement, which consisted of iterations of overall anisotropic B-factor refinement, bulk-solvent correction, rigid-body refinement, positional minimization, individual isotropic B-factor refinement, torsional angle dynamics using slow cooling annealing, and automatic water addition. The final model is described in Table I. Enzymatic Activity—YdiB catalyzed the NAD+-dependent reduction of both shikimate (right to left in Fig. 1) and quinate under established conditions (30Chaudhuri S. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Vmax of 150–180 units/mg (data not shown) corresponds to a turnover rate of 80–90 s-1, which is ∼15% of AroE. Structure of the YdiB Protomer—The YdiB protomer is composed of two α/β domains plus a pair of C-terminal α-helices that bridge these two domains (Fig. 2). A deep cavity is found at the interface between these domains. This cavity is likely to form the active site of the enzyme on the basis of the fact that it is contiguous with the hydride acceptor site on the NAD+ cofactor, which was found bound to the C-terminal domain in the structure. The apparently flat geometry of the nicotinamide ring suggests that the cofactor is bound in the oxidized NAD+ state (36Karle I.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1961; 14: 497-502Crossref Google Scholar), although this conclusion is tentative given the resolution of our crystal structure. The cofactor was not added to the crystallization reaction, indicating that it co-purified with the enzyme through two columns and must therefore dissociate very slowly in the absence of substrate. The N-terminal α/β domain of YdiB comprises residues 1–105. The mostly parallel six-stranded β-sheet at the core of this domain is flanked on each side by two α-helices, one of them coming from the extreme C terminus of the polypeptide (Fig. 2A). The central β-sheet in this domain has its strands in the order of 2-1-3-5-6-4, with only strand 5 antiparallel to the others (Fig. 2B). A systematic analysis using the DALI program identifies a number of protein domains with significant structural similarity, the closest of which is the N-terminal domain of E. coli IIB cellobiose-specific phosphotransferase (Protein Data Bank number 1iib) (37van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Thunnissen M.M. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which gives a Z-score of 5.6 for alignment of 72 residues with a root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å. However, neither this domain nor any of the other structural homologues has the same topology as the N-terminal domain in YdiB, suggesting that it is unique among proteins of known structure. The C-terminal α/β domain of YdiB comprises residues 106–254, which form a characteristic dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold (38Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). The entirely parallel six-stranded β-sheet at the core of this domain is flanked by three α-helices on one side and two on the other (Fig. 2B). The central β-sheet in this domain has its strands in the order of 6-5-4-1-2-3 and only deviates from the canonical Rossmann fold by having one of its flanking α-helices replaced by a long well ordered loop that contains a small 310-helix (between strands β10 and β11 in Fig. 2B). The NAD+ cofactor binds to this domain with its nicotinamide ring in the pro-R conformation (Fig. 2A), indicating that this enzyme is a class A NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase like the well studied malate, lactate, and alcohol dehydrogenases. Structure of the YdiB Dimer—Gel filtration and static lightscattering data indicate that YdiB forms a homodimer in solution (not shown), likely corresponding to the dimer found in the asymmetric unit in the crystal structure. This species buries 2718 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area in its interface, which is mediated primarily by residues in strand β1 and helices α1 and α2 in the N-terminal α/β domain. Superimposition of the individual domains in the two independent protomers yields root mean square deviations of 0.8 Å for the N-terminal α/β domain, 0.2 Å for the C-terminal α/β domain (i.e. the Rossmann fold), and 0.4 Å for the C-terminal α-helices. Superimposition of just the Rossmann folds (Fig. 3A) shows that a rigid body rotation occurs between the α/β domains when the two protomers in the asymmetric unit are compared. Residue Gly-104 near the C terminus of the N-terminal α/β domain appears to act as a hinge for this rotation, which modulates the width of the active site cavity (Fig. 3A). Structural Similarity to the Methylene Tetrahydromethanopterin Dehydrogenase, MtdA—Among proteins of known structure, the MtdA from Methylobacterium extorquens (39Ermler U. Hagemeier C.H. Roth A. Demmer U. Grabarse W. Warkentin E. Vorholt J.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 1127-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) shows the highest sequence homology and structural similarity to the C-terminal Rossmann domain in YdiB (Z-score of 13.7 for alignment of 135/148 residues with a root mean square deviation of 3.0 Å and 27% sequence identity). The structure similarity between the YdiB and MtdA structures extends beyond the boundary of this domain (Fig. 3B). In both enzymes, the active site is at the interface of the two α/β domains found in the protomer. Moreover, there is significant structural homology (40Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar) in the N-terminal α/β domains (Z-score of 5.2 for alignment of 71/106 residues with a root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å and 7% sequence identity), despite the failure of iterative position-specific iterated basic alignment search tool analysis (41Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar) to find sequence homology in this region. Although these domains share common topology in their three N-terminal β-strands, their overall topology is different (Figs. 2C and 3B), as observed with the other structural homologues of this domain of YdiB. Furthermore, the putative active site residues differ in MtdA and YdiB (Fig. 2C), indicating likely divergence in enzymatic mechanism. Although the structurally conserved N-terminal region of the N-terminal α/β domain mediates formation of the oligomer interface in both YdiB and MtdA, the structural interactions at the interfaces are very different. Its position has migrated in MtdA relative to YdiB to enable the subunit-subunit interface in this trimeric enzyme to provide an extended recognition site for the much larger substrate that it oxidizes (39Ermler U. Hagemeier C.H. Roth A. Demmer U. Grabarse W. Warkentin E. Vorholt J.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 1127-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). These proteins therefore demonstrate an interesting paradigm whereby structural evolution of an oligomeric interface is used to modify substrate specificity in the NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily. Binding Environment of the NAD+Cofactor—The average B-factor of the bound NAD+ molecule is 35.6 Å2 compared with 34.4 Å2 for the overall polypeptide chain. This result suggests that there is full occupancy of the active site by the co-purified NAD+ and reinforces the conclusion that it is bound to the enzyme very tightly. The extended NAD+ molecule makes multiple interactions with the protein (Fig. 4, A and B). The side chain of invariant residue Arg-156 interacts with the adenine, whereas Asn-155 and Asp-158 hydrogen bond (H-bond) to the hydroxyl groups of the adjacent adenosyl ribose. Residues Asp-158 and Glu-159 in the vicinity of the O2′ hydroxyl of this ribose explain the specificity of YdiB for binding NAD(H) over NADP(H) on the basis of their ability to mediate electrostatic repulsion of the extra phosphate bound to the adenosyl ribose in NADP(H). Significant heterogeneity is observed in the identity of these residues in other shikimate 5-dehydrogenase orthologues (Fig. 2C), explaining their variable preferences for NAD(H) versus NADP(H). For example, the NADP(H)-dependent shikimate dehydrogenase AroE (12Anton I.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has valine and serine at positions 158–159 and arginine at position 160 instead of the phenylalanine at this position in YdiB. Positively charged residues near this region of the cofactor are strongly correlated with specificity for NADP(H) over NAD(H) on the basis of the ability to form an ionic interaction with the extra phosphate group on the adenosyl ribose (42Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The glycine-rich loop, which anchors the pyrophosphate of the NAD(H) in the active site, has a variant sequence of GXGG in YdiB (Fig. 4, A and B), compared with the GXGXXG “finger-print” motif found in most NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases (43Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The backbone of this segment forms an N-terminal helix-capping structure in YdiB, which shares a conserved conformation with the canonical motif found in the other superfamily members. As in many of these enzymes (44Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), the direct H-bonds between the amides of the glycines in the motif and the phosphate oxygens are supplemented by an indirect H-bond via a strongly ordered (B-factor 26 Å2) buried water molecule located in the center of the helix-capping structure. However, YdiB shows an unusual “clamp” over the pyrophosphate and adenosyl ribose formed by residues Lys-205 and Phe-160, respectively, which buries the NAD+ more than in other superfamily members. This clamp may contribute to the very slow release rate of the cofactor from YdiB. The amide group of the nicotinamide makes extensive contacts with the N-terminal helix-capping motif on α9, including an H-bond to the carbonyl of Gly-255, that hold the ring in the pro-R conformation (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the six atoms of the nicotinamide ring make a total of only three or four van der Waals contacts with the protein. One of these is between the hydride-transferring atom C4N and the carboxylate group of the invariant residue Asp-107. Interestingly, the ring is positioned directly over two side chains containing sulfur atoms, Cys-232 and Met-258. The low pKa of the cysteine residue raises the possibility that it could be deprotonated under some circumstances in the presence of NAD+ to make an ionic interaction with the bound cofactor. Shikimate Binding Site and Hypothesized Catalytic Mechanism—Analyses of the active site of YdiB combined with manual docking exercises suggest that the binding site for the shikimate substrate is located in the cleft between the two α/β domains close to the solvent-exposed Re side of the nicotinamide ring (Figs. 3B and 4C). This cavity is lined by a set of phylogenetically conserved residues (e.g. Lys-71, Asn-92, Thr-106, and Asp-107) with chemical characteristics similar to those that mediate the binding of shikimate derivatives in several other enzymes (i.e. 2,3-dehydroquinic acid to type II dehydroquinase (45Roszak A.W. Robinson D.A. Krell T Hunter I.S. Fredrickson M. Abell C. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and shikimate-3-phosphate to 5-enolpyru-vylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (46Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Shikimate could be modeled into this site with minimal ambiguity on the basis of the previously established stereochemistry of ternary complexes in other NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases (47Ramaswamy S. Eklund H. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5230-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Specifically, the carbon containing the hydride donor and the two flanking carbons on shikimate were aligned with the equivalent atoms in the substrate in a crystallographically observed complex, with the ring oriented so that the reactive hydride points toward the C4N acceptor on the nicotinamide ring. This exercise yields a model for the ternary complex (Fig. 4C) in which all but one of the oxygen atoms on the shikimate interact with side chain heteroatoms that are invariant in all shikimate dehydrogenase orthologues (Fig. 2C). Specifically, the C1 carboxylate accepts a bifurcated H-bond from Ser-67, the C4 hydroxyl donates an H-bond to Gln-262, and the C5 hydroxyl donates a bifurcated H-bond to Asp-107. The remaining oxygen atom on shikimate (the C3 hydroxyl) H-bonds with Tyr-234, which is conserved in AroE and 90% of the orthologous sequences (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, invariant residue Lys-71 is close to the carboxylates of both the shikimate and Asp-107. Although these groups are not within H-bonding distance when shikimate is modeled into our crystal structure of the binary complex, a rotamer change and/or the demonstrated rotational flexibility of the N-terminal α/β domain (Fig. 3A) could allow closer interactions to occur in the activated ternary complex. This model for the ternary complex with shikimate suggests a hypothesis for the catalytic reaction mechanism of YdiB. The presence of an H-bond between Asp-107 and the C5 hydroxyl of the shikimate suggests that the carboxylate side chain will act as the acceptor for the proton from this hydroxyl when the C5 hydride is transferred to NAD+ (right to left in Fig. 1). This mechanism is highly attractive, because the pKa of the aspartate makes it an excellent proton acceptor. When the reaction is run in reverse (left to right in Fig. 1), the principle of microscopic reversibility would then require the aspartate to be protonated before binding 3-dehydroshikimate, which could be promoted by the negative charge on the adjacent NADH. Comparison with all known three-dimensional structures using DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar) and motif searches using SPASM (48Madsen D. Kleywegt G.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 137-139Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) shows that the side chain disposition in the active site YdiB is unique, suggesting that it uses a novel catalytic reaction mechanism relative to other enzymes in the NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily. Moreover, the key residues in YdiB that interact with the substrate and cofactor are exceedingly well conserved in all shikimate 5-dehydrogenase orthologues (12Anton I.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem.

During apoptosis induced by some stimuli, specific PITSLRE isoforms are cleaved by caspase to produce a protein that contains the C-terminal kinase domain of the PITSLRE proteins (p110C). The p110C induces apoptosis when it is ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In our study, similar induction of this p110C was observed during anoikis in NIH3T3 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis mediated by p110C, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human fetal liver cDNA library and identified p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as an interacting partner of p110C. The association of p110C with PAK1 was further confirmed by in vitro binding assay, in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, and confocal microscope analysis. The interaction of p110C with PAK1 occurred within the residues 210–332 of PAK1. Neither association between p58PITSLRE or p110PITSLRE and PAK1 nor association between p110C and PAK2 or PAK3 was observed. Anoikis was increased and PAK1 activity was inhibited when NIH3T3 cells were transfected with p110C. Furthermore, the binding of p110C with PAK1 and inhibition of PAK1 activity were also observed during anoikis.

During apoptosis induced by Fas or tumor necrosis factor, the action of p110C, a novel processed PITSLRE isoform resulting from the proteolysis of specific larger PITSLTR isoforms, significantly increased (15Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 238: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that apoptosis was increased when p110C was ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells or SMMC 7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. These data suggested that p110C might play an important role in mediating apoptosis. In this study, we also detected the expression of p110C in NIH3T3 cells during anoikis, which is a form of apoptosis induced by the disruption of cell-matrix interaction. In agreement with the previous studies, a similar induction of p110C was observed during anoikis in NIH3T3 cells. It seems that p110C could participate in apoptosis induced by different factors. However, little is known about the mechanism of p110C-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. Previous studies of the p58PITSLRE or p110PITSLRE isoforms showed that they could interact with different proteins and mediate different cellular functions. For example, p110PITSLRE isoform interacted with the RNA-binding protein RNPS1, RNA polymerase II, and multiple transcriptional elongation factors, regulating some aspects of RNA splicing or transcription in proliferating cells (21Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1505-1506Crossref Google Scholar, 22Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the p58PITSLRE isoform interacted with cyclin D3 in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, regulating G2/M phase cell cycle progression (24Zhang S.W. Xu S.L. Cai M.M. Yan J. Zhu X.Y. Hu Y. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Zhang S.W. Cai M.M. Zhang S. Xu S.L. Chen S. Chen X.N. Chen C.

Thus, the identification of cellular proteins that do interact with p110C, physically and/or functionally, should be a useful approach for defining the cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms of p110C in apoptotic signaling pathways. To investigate this issue, the yeast two-hybrid system with p110C as bait was used to screen a human fetal liver cDNA library. As a result, PAK1 1The abbreviations used are: PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; HA, influenza hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody epitope; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein; aa, amino acid(s); PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidylserine; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; poly-HEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). (p21-activated kinase 1) was identified as a p110C-associated protein via the domain (aa 210–332). This association of p110C with PAK1 was specific, as verified by the inability of PAK2 or PAK3 to associate with p110C and the inability of PAK1 to associate with p58PITSLRE or p110PITSLRE. Anoikis was increased and PAK1 activity was inhibited when NIH3T3 cells were transfected with p110C. Furthermore, the association of p110C, with PAK1 and inhibition of PAK1 activity, was also observed when anoikis was induced in NIH3T3 cells. Taken together, the data suggested that PAK1 might play a role in the regulation of p110C-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. Cell Lines and Reagents—The NIH3T3 cells and SMMC 7721 cells were obtained from the Institute of Cell Biology, Academic Sinica. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system and human fetal liver MATCHMAKER LexA cDNA library were products of Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody and the goat polyclonal anti-γ-PAK antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PAK1 and the anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PAK3 antibody was from Calbiochem. Protein G-agarose, glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Leupeptin, aprotinin, PMSF, poly-HEMA, and MBP were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. [γ-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mm), [35S]methionine, Hybond PVDF membrane, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Annexin V-FITC recombinant protein was purchased from Bender MedSystems. Other reagents were commercially available in China. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Induction of Anoikis— NIH3T3 cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SMMC 7721 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. They were maintained in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. For transient transfection assays, the cells (5 × 105) were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes. The following day, the cells were transfected with relevant plasmids. The transfection was performed with LipofectAMINETM according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for further analysis. For induction of anoikis (27Ibuki Y. Goto R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 3 × 106 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. After culturing for 6 h, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM. Following a further culturing for 18 h, the cells were trypsinized and plated in cell suspension dishes previously coated with 10 mg/ml poly-HEMA. After indicated time, the cells were collected for further investigation. Apoptosis was evaluated by staining with propidium iodide (PI) to detect subdiploid DNA content and by using annexin V to detect cell surface phosphatidylserine (PS). For PI staining, the cells (106) were washed twice, collected, and then fixed with 70% ethanol at –20 °C overnight. After staining with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, the cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The percentage of apoptosis was quantitated from sub-G1 events. To use annexin V to detect cell surface PS, the cells were washed twice in PBS and then resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 195 μl of cell suspension containing 105 cells was taken, and 5 μl of annexin V-FITC was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min in the dark. After that, the cells were wash twice in PBS and resuspended in 190 μl of binding buffer. 10 μl of 20 μg/ml PI was added and then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Apoptotic cells could be stained with annexin V but not PI. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot experiments were used to measure certain proteins. Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (120 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF). A total of 50 μg of protein from each sample was electrophoresed by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times, each for 5 min, the membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for another 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system. Yeast Two-hybrid cDNA Library Screening and Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system was used to perform yeast two-hybrid screening according to the manufacturer's instruction. The p110C was used as bait to screen by the reporter genes LEU2 and lacZ. The transformed yeast was grown on plates lacking both histidine to select the bait plasmid and tryptophan to select the prey plasmid, respectively. The individual cDNA of interest was purified from the positive clones and re-transformed into yeast to confirm its specific interaction with p110C. 14 clones could activate both the LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes only when they contain pLexA-p110C. All of these clones were revealed to encode the fragment of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) by sequence analysis. The quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed to detect the protein-protein interaction on at least three independent colonies from the same clone, using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Murine p53 fused with LexA as a bait and SV40 large T-antigen fused as a prey were used as a positive control. Construction of the p110C and the Mutants of PAK1—pLexA-p110C containing the C-terminal PITSLRE p110 coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number U04824, nucleotides 1357–2451) was constructed. The p110C was generated by PCR using p110PITSLRE cDNA (a gift from Dr. Sigrid Cornelis) as template and using primer 1 (5′-GATGAATTCATGTGCCGGAGCGTCGAGGAG-3′, EcoRI site underlined), primer 2 (5′-GATGTCGACTTAGAACTTGAGGCTGAA-3′, SalI site underlined). pcDNA3-HA-p110C and pcNDA3-GST-p110C with a GST fusion at the N-terminal were constructed by inserting the same PCR product of p110C in-frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA vector or pcDNA3-GST vector. The full-length of p110 was cut from pSV-sport-p110PITSLRE by EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3-HA vector. The full-length cDNA and mutants of PAK1 were designated as FL (aa 1–545), N (aa 1–270), C (aa 271–545), F1 (aa 1–456), F2 (aa 1–394), F3 (aa 1–332), F4 (aa 150–332), F5 (aa 210–332), F6 (aa 240–332), and F7 (aa 210–300) and performed by PCR using pcMV6-myc-PAK1 (wt) (a gift from Dr. Gary Bokoh) as template. FL was generated from primer 3 (5′-GATGAATTCATGTCAAATAACGGCCTAGAC-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTAGTGATTGTTCTTTGT-3′), N from primers 3 and 5 (5′-GATGTCGACTTATTTCTTCTTAGGATCGCC-3′), C from primer 6 (5′-GATGAATTCATGTATACACGGTTTGAGAAG-3′) and primer 4, F1 from primer 3 and primer 7 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTATTCGATGGCCATGATGCC-3′), F2 from primer 3 and primer 8 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTAATTGTCACTCTTGATGTC-3′), F3 from primer 3 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTAGTCCAAGTAATTCACAAT) and primer 9, F4 from primer 10 (5′-GATGAATTCATGGCTGAGGATTACAATTCT-3′) and primer 9, F5 from primer 11 (5′-GATGAATTCATGCCTGTCACTCCAACTCGG-3′) and primer 9, F6 from primer 12 (5′-GATGAATTCATGGAGAAGCAGAAGAAG-3′) and primer 9, and F7 from primer 11 and primer 13 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTACTGCTTAATGGCCTC-3′) by PCR separately. The EcoRI site underlined in the forward primer and the XhoI site underlined in the reverse primer were used to clone these fragments into pB42AD plasmid or pcDNA3 vector. The PAK2 was cloned into pB42AD plasmid or pcDNA3 vector by PCR using PAK2 cDNA (a gift from Dr. Gray Bokoch) as template, and using primer 14 (5′-GATGAATTCATGTCTGATAACGGAGAACTG-3′, EcoRI site underlined) and primer 15 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTAACGGTTACTCTTCATTGC-3′, XhoI site underlined). The PAK3 was cloned into pB42AD plasmid or pcDNA3 vector by PCR using mPAK3 cDNA (a gift from Dr. Richard A. Cerione) as template and using primer 16 (5′-GATGAATTCATGTCTGACAGCTTGGATAAC-3′, EcoRI site underlined) and primer 17 (5′-GATCTCGAGCTAACGGCTACTGTTCTTAAT-3′, XhoI site underlined). In Vitro Binding Analysis—p110C was cloned into pcDNA3-GST vector. PAK1 and its mutants, PAK2, and PAK3 were cloned into pcDNA3 individually. Their transcripts were produced by using an in vitro transcription kit (Promega). Rabbit reticulocyte lysates from Promega were used to generate [35S]Met-labeled proteins, which were used immediately for binding studies. The binding reactions were performed in protein binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) at 4 °C for 2 h with constant mixing (28Bagheri-Yarmand R.

The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. In Vivo Interaction Assay—48 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates were incubated with mouse normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or relevant antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were then added and collected by centrifugation after 2 h of incubation and then gently washed three times with the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane and analyzed using Western blots. Fluorescence Imaging of Living Cells—The enhanced GFP segment (Clontech) was attached to the C terminus of human p110C by standard recombinant techniques. Briefly, the DNA fragments of p110C was generated by PCR (primer 18: 5′-GATGAATTCATGTGCCGGAGCGTCGAGGAG-3′, EcoRI site underlined; primer 19: 5′-GATGTCGACGAACTTGAGGCTGAAGCC-3′, SalI site underlined), digested with EcoRI and SalI, and then cloned into pEGFPN3 (Clontech) to create pEG-FPN3-p110C. Full-length PAK1 was cloned into the pDsRed1-C1 vector (Clontech) so as to be expressed as a fusion with a red fluorescent protein (DsRed). The fragment of PAK1 was prepared by PCR (primer 20: 5′-GATGTCGACATGTCAAATAACGGCCTAGAC-3′, SalI site underlined; primer 21: 5′-GATGGATCCTTAGTGATTGTTCTTTGT-3′, BamHI site underlined), digested with SalI and BamHI, and then ligated into the pDsRed1-C1 vector to create pDsRed1-C1-PAK1. SMMC 7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transiently co-transfected with pDsRed1-C1-PAK1 and pEGFPN3-p110C. After 48 h, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope and digitally photographed. PAK1 Kinase Assay—As described by Chant et al. (29Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). Equal total protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-PAK1 (1:50) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were covered by adding protein G beads and then centrifuged. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2). Kinase assays were performed in 50-μl reactions with 50 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 5 μg of MBP. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 6× sample buffer, boiled, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using autoradiography. Quantitation of MBP phosphorylation by PAK1 was determined by phosphorimaging. Induction of p110C Protein during Anoikis in NIH3T3 Cells—Previous studies indicated that transfection of p110C in Chinese hamster ovary cells did not influence mitosis and cell growth but could induce apoptosis (15Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When the apoptosis of cells was induced by treating with Fas antibody or tumor necrosis factor, p110C protein was induced, which was not due to new protein synthesis but processing of some PITSLRE isoforms (15Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28505-28513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These suggested that p110C might have an important role in apoptotic signaling pathway. To test whether the induction of p110C isoform was in general in response to different apoptotic inducers, NIH3T3 cell apoptosis was induced by detachment from the cell matrix (also known as anoikis), and then the expression of the PITSLRE protein isoforms was detected. Cells undergoing apoptosis could be recognized by flow cytometry by detecting a sub-G1 peak using PI staining and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane using an annexin V label. About 26% of the NIH3T3 cells cultured in a poly-HEMA-coated dish (detached from the extracellular matrix) under serum-free condition for 10 h underwent apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using anti-PITSLRE antibody showed that p110C was markedly induced when the cells were induced during anoikis. This result was consistent with the previous studies (15Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28505-28513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that the induction of p110C did not result from the processing of p110 PITSLRE isoform but largely results from cleavage of the p58PITSLRE isoform when anoikis was induced in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, our study also showed the similar induction of p110C during anoikis in NIH3T3 cells. Identification of PAK1 as p110C-associated Protein—To identify proteins that interact with p110C, the yeast two-hybrid system was used with p110C as bait, and a human fetal liver cDNA library was screened. We plated a pool of cells that contained 5 × 107 primary library transformants at a multiplicity of 10 onto selection induction medium. Approximately 40 clones were obtained whose LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes were activated. Among them 14 clones could activate both the LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes only when they contained pLexA-p110C. The DNA of interest was isolated and sequenced. Sequence homology search identified the encoded proteins. All of these peptides were positioned in-frame to the p21-activated kinase (PAK1) and contained a partly N-terminal deletion portion of PAK1. PAK1 was first identified as a Rac-interacting protein (30Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). There are at least six known PAK isoforms (PAK1–6) that are differentially expressed in mammalian tissues (31Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem.

Based on their conserved structure, PAK1–3 are classed together as the Group I PAKs (34Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends.

To investigate if PAK1 was the unique one in the Group I PAKs that could interact with p110C, a direct two-hybrid assay was performed. The other two Group I PAKs, PAK2 and PAK3, were co-transformed, respectively, with p110C into EGY48 (p8op-lacZ). Subsequent transformation results showed that neither of them permitted activation of the reporter genes, whereas PAK1, in the presence of p110C, did activate the two report genes. It suggested th"

However, on establishing the whole-cell recording configuration in photoreceptors of the supposedly null allele, norpAP24, we detected a small (∼15 pA) inward current that represented spontaneous light channel activity. The current decayed during ∼20 min, after which tiny residual responses (<2 pA) were elicited by intense flashes. Both spontaneous currents and light responses appeared to be mediated by residual PLC activity, because they were enhanced by impairing diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase function by mutation (rdgA) or by restricting ATP but were reduced or abolished by a mutation of the PLC-specific Gq α subunit. It was reported recently that metabolic inhibition activated the light-sensitive transient receptor potential and transient receptor potential-like channels, even in norpAP24, leading to the conclusion that this action was independent of PLC (Agam, K., von Campenhausen, M., Levy, S., Ben-Ami, H. C., Cook, B., Kirschfeld, K., and Minke, B. (2000) J. Neurosci. 20, 5748–5755). However, we found that channel activation by metabolic inhibitors in norpAP24 was strictly dependent on the residual PLC activity underlying the spontaneous current, because the inhibitors failed to activate any channels after the spontaneous current had decayed. By contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids invariably activated the channels independently of PLC. The results strongly support the obligatory requirement for PLC and DAG in Drosophila phototransduction, suggest that activation by metabolic inhibition is primarily because of the failure of diacylglycerol kinase, and are consistent with the proposal that polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are potential DAG metabolites, act directly on the channels.

Phototransduction in the microvillar photoreceptors of invertebrates is mediated by the inositol lipid or phosphoinositide signaling cascade. Largely because of its molecular genetic potential, Drosophila has become an important model system not only for phototransduction but for inositol lipid signaling in general (1Montell C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 231-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 3Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The generally accepted mechanism of excitation conforms to the canonical phosphoinositide cascade (see Fig. 8). After photoisomerization in the microvillar membrane, rhodopsin activates a Gq protein which, in turn, binds to and activates phospholipase C (PLCβ4 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; PUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; WT, wild type; LNA, linolenic acid; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; QE, quantum efficiency; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPL, TRP-like; PI, phosphatidylinositol. isoform), resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG. By a still unknown mechanism, this process activates at least two classes of light-sensitive channels in the microvilli, encoded by the transient receptor potential (trp) and trp-like (trpl) genes, which are the prototypical members of the large TRP ion channel superfamily (4Clapham D.E.

Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtans:2001/RE1)PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that lipid products of PIP2 hydrolysis are the messengers of excitation (6Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C.

The key argument for the conclusion that phototransduction in Drosophila is an obligatory PLC-signaling cascade is the finding that the norpA (no receptor potential A) gene encoded an eye-enriched PLCβ and that severe mutations in norpA abolished the response to light (11Pak W.L. Ostroy S.E. Deland M.C. Wu C.-F. Science. 1976; 194: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Pedrew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G.

Martin F. Cochrane G.W. Juusola M. Georgiev P. Raghu P. Neuron. 2002; 36: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that sensitivity in norpA hypomorphs could be greatly facilitated by mutations in the retinal degeneration A (rdgA) gene and also by depletion of cytosolic ATP (17Hardie R.C. Martin F. Cochrane G.W. Juusola M. Georgiev P. Raghu P. Neuron. 2002; 36: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that DAG or its metabolites are excitatory messengers, because the rdgA gene encodes diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) (18Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is the major enzyme controlling DAG in most cells (19Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that even the supposedly null mutant norpAP24 has a residual sensitivity to light, which can be massively enhanced by either ATP depletion or the rdgA mutation but still appears to be mediated by PLC. In light of these findings we repeated some key experiments, which assumed that norpAP24 was functionally null. In particular we found that contrary to a recent report (8Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of the light-sensitive channels by metabolic inhibitors is strictly dependent on PLC activity, and we present evidence here that this represents the failure of DGK. By contrast, excitation of the channels by PUFAs (6Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), suggested previously to be caused indirectly by metabolic inhibition (8Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the activation of endogenous PLC (20Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), appeared to be independent of PLC activity and seems likely to represent a direct effect on the channels or their lipid environment. Flies—Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised on standard medium in the dark at 25 °C. The wild type (WT) strain was white-eyed Oregon R. Mutant alleles included: Gαq1, a severe hypomorphic mutation (approximately 1% protein) of the eye-enriched Gq protein α subunit (21Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C.

Whole-cell Recordings—Dissociated photoreceptor clusters (ommatidia) were prepared as described previously (23Hardie R.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

The bath solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 TES, 4 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 25 proline, and 5 alanine. Unless otherwise stated, intracellular solution was (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 TES, 4 MgATP, 2 MgCl2, 1 NAD, and 0.4 NaGTP. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.15. To determine current-voltage relationships (Fig. 7), potassium gluconate was replaced with 125 mm cesium gluconate and 15 mm tetraethylammonium chloride to block K+ channels. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and linolenic acid (LNA) were obtained from Sigma and were applied from a puffer pipette (tip diameter, 2–4 μm) positioned ∼10 μm from the recorded cell. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made at a holding potential of -70 mV unless otherwise stated, using electrodes of approximately 10–15 megaohms resistance. Series resistance values were generally below 30 megaohms and were compensated to approximately 80% when recording macroscopic responses but not for collecting bumps. Data were sampled at 0.5–1 kHz and filtered at 100 Hz using Axopatch 1-D or 200B amplifiers and pCLAMP 6 or 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Cells were stimulated via a green light-emitting diode. All intensities are expressed with respect to effectively absorbed photons in WT flies, which were estimated by counting quantum bumps at the lowest intensities and then calibrating relative intensities by using a linear photodiode. Quantum bumps were detected and analyzed using Mini-analysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). The quantum efficiency (QE) (equal to the percentage of absorbed photons eliciting a quantum bump) was estimated relative to WT by counting the number of quantum bumps in response to calibrated flashes (25Henderson S.R. Reuss H. Hardie R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 179-194Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or when they could not always be clearly separated, by integrating the current under the entire response and dividing by the average bump integral current recorded in the same cell. Amplitudes of the spontaneous currents were measured with respect to the final level reached after complete decay of the current to a quiet base line. The data are presented here as mean ± S.D. Spontaneous Currents and Light Responses in norpAP24—It is well known that light responses in severe norpA hypomorphs have extremely slow kinetics, with responses to brief flashes continuing for several minutes (14Pearn M.T. Randall L.L. Shortridge R.D. Burg M.G. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) because of the generation of quantum bumps with exceptionally long latencies (15Scott K. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Cook B. BarYaacov M. BenAmi H.C. Goldstein R.E. Paroush Z. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This behavior is believed to reflect a general principle of G-protein-coupled signaling, namely that the effector enzyme (in this case PLC) also functions as an obligatory GTPase-activating protein required for inactivation of the activated GTP-bound Gq α subunit. In WT flies the density of G-protein and PLC (approximately 100 copies/microvillus) is such that diffusional encounters of G-proteins with PLC occur within milliseconds, resulting in rapid activation of PLC swiftly followed by GTPase activity and inactivation. However, when PLC levels are very low (≪1 copy/microvillus in severe norpA hypomorphs), activated G-protein α subunits can remain in the active GTP-bound form and diffuse for many seconds or even minutes before finally encountering a PLC molecule, resulting in a greatly delayed cycle of activation and inactivation (15Scott K. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Cook B. BarYaacov M. BenAmi H.C. Goldstein R.E. Paroush Z. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consequently, on establishment of the whole-cell recording configuration there is an ongoing barrage of noisy inward current because of the summation of bumps with extremely long latencies generated by previous illumination. Depending on the severity of the allele, this activity decays in the dark during several seconds or minutes after which responses can be elicited from a quiet base line (15Scott K. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Cook B. BarYaacov M. BenAmi H.C. Goldstein R.E. Paroush Z. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nat.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although it is considered as a null mutation, we wondered whether a similar behavior might also be observed in norpAP24. Indeed, in almost all whole-cell recordings from dissociated norpAP24 photoreceptors we detected a small ∼15-pA noisy inward current on establishment of the whole-cell configuration. This current appeared to be mediated by the light-sensitive channels, because it was blocked by La3+ (Fig. 1), which is known to specifically block TRP channels in these cells (26Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 27Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As in other norpA hypomorphs, the noisy current gradually subsided and in favorable recordings eventually revealed isolated ∼1–2-pA events (1.4 ± 0.1 pA, n = 5 cells; mean ± S.D.) and finally, after ∼20 min, a quiet base line. At this point bright flashes delivered to the cells induced tiny (<2 pA) light responses consisting of little more than a train of miniature “quantum bumps,” again ∼1–2 pA in amplitude and lasting for several minutes (Figs. 1 and 5). Because they would be buried in the noise, such responses could be detected only after the complete decay of the spontaneous current and even then only in recordings with excellent signal-noise ratios. Under standard recording conditions, we never detected any response to even saturating flashes (corresponding to >106 rhodopsin photoisomerizations) in norpAP24 when they were delivered before the decay of the initial spontaneous activity.Fig. 5Quantum bumps.A, averaged quantum bump waveforms obtained by aligning between 25 and 85 bumps with their rising phases from representative cells in WT, norpAP24 with (left) and without (-ATP) nucleotide additives in the electrode and norpAP24,rdgA1 norpAP24;Gαq1 and norpAP24,rdgA1;Gαq1 photoreceptors.

This facilitation was effectively mimicked by the rdgA mutation encoding DAG kinase, suggesting that DGK normally suppresses bump amplitudes in norpA by metabolizing DAG (17Hardie R.C. Martin F.

We performed similar experiments to see whether ATP depletion could also enhance sensitivity in norpAP24. In recordings made with no ATP in the electrode, the spontaneous activity seen on establishment of the whole-cell configuration in norpAP24 photoreceptors initially increased in magnitude during a period of several minutes, consistent with an increase in the amplitude of the underlying events (quantum bumps). However, the current again eventually decayed during 15–20 min, revealing single quantum bump-like events with amplitudes that were now restored to near WT levels (∼7 pA) but terminated more slowly (Figs. 2 and 5). Once a quiet base line had been reached, it was maintained indefinitely in the dark (>30′) with no sign of spontaneous activation of the light-sensitive channels as happens in WT flies recorded without nucleotide additives (8Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hardie R.C. Minke B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 389-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Strikingly, sensitivity to light was greatly enhanced with maximum responses up to ∼75 pA, and large quantum bumps, similar to the spontaneously occurring bumps during the latter stages of the decay, could be elicited by dimmer flashes (Fig. 2). Facilitation in norpA,rdgA Double Mutants—To test whether the rescue of light responses in norpAP24 by ATP depletion could be explained by the failure of DGK as reported in other norpA hypomorphs (17Hardie R.C. Martin F. Cochrane G.W. Juusola M. Georgiev P. Raghu P. Neuron. 2002; 36: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we generated a norpAP24,rdgA double mutant using the most severe allele, rdgA1 (18Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As will be described in detail elsewhere, 2R. C. Hardie and P. Raghu, unpublished data. retinal degeneration was effectively rescued in such double mutants. In norpAP24,rdgA1, even with standard electrode solution containing nucleotide additives, the constitutive inward currents recorded immediately on establishing the whole-cell configuration were greatly enhanced (mean 145 ± 31 pA; n = 19) compared with norpAP24. Once again, however, the spontaneous currents slowly decayed, reaching a quiet base line after ∼20 min. Toward the end of this decay, large (∼8 pA) slowly terminating quantum bumps could be resolved, very similar in both amplitude and kinetics to those seen in recordings from norpAP24 without ATP (Figs. 3 and 5). Sensitivity to light was also massively enhanced on the rdgA background, and even before the decay of the spontaneous current, bright flashes elicited responses up to ∼200 pA in amplitude superimposed on the constitutive current. After decay to base line, large bumps could be elicited by dimmer flashes, whereas bright flashes elicited responses of up to ∼400 pA that decayed with the slow kinetics that are characteristic of norpAP24 (Fig. 3). Overall, the rdgA mutation therefore closely mimics the effect of depletion of ATP, and we conclude that impairment of DGK function is sufficient to account for the effect of ATP depletion in enhancing the spontaneous currents, increasing bump amplitude, and rescuing the macroscopic response to light in norpAP24. In fact, the overall rescue of sensitivity was even more pronounced in norpAP24,rdgA1, probably indicating that residual endogenous ATP can support limited DGK function in recordings made without ATP. Compared with recordings from norpAP24 made with ATP, the overall facilitation in norpAP24,rdgA1 (estimated by comparing the integrals of light-induced currents) was in excess of 2000-fold (2215 ± 884-fold, n = 3). An ∼50-fold increase can be attributed to the increase in the size of the bump integral current (Fig. 5), the rest presumably represents an increase in QE. In fact QE in norpAP24,rdgA1 was now estimated to be reduced only ∼30-fold with respect to that seen in WT flies. This comparison highlights both the critical role of DGK, presumably in regulating the supply of DAG required for excitation, and also the considerable potential sensitivity to light in the supposedly null PLC mutant norpAP24. Light Responses in norpAP24 Are because of Residual PLC Activity—The spontaneous currents and light responses revealed in norpAP24 could represent residual PLC activity or could be evidence of an alternate phototransduction pathway. To test whether the residual responses in norpAP24 and norpAP24,rdgA1 were mediated by the same PLC-specific Gq protein, we generated norpAp24;Gαq1 double mutants and norpAP24,rdgA1;Gαq1 triple mutants using the severe hypomorphic allele Gαq1 in which levels of the G-protein α subunit are reduced to ∼1% of WT levels (21Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The spontaneous currents in these double and triple mutants were completely abolished, indicating that they were strictly dependent on activation of Gq. Responses to light in norpAP24;Gαq1 were also greatly reduced compared with norpAP24 controls, with at most a few sporadic 1–2-pA bumps to saturating illumination (Fig. 4) and in 5 of 11 cells no detectable response at all. In norpAP24,rdgA1;Gαq1, however, the rdgA background again resulted in a massive enhancement of bump amplitude and QE and large slowly terminating quantum bumps very similar to those seen in norpAP24,rdgA1 could be elicited by bright flashes from the start of the recording in all cells (Figs. 4 and 5, n = 20). Nevertheless, compared with norpAP24,rdgA1, sensitivity in norpAP24,rdgA1;Gαq1 was reduced ∼100-fold. These findings show that both the spontaneous current and the light-induced current in norpAP24 and norpAP24,rdgA1 are dependent on Gq and hence likely to be mediated by its only known target in the photoreceptors, namely PLC. Although in principle one cannot exclude the possibility that Gq might have alternative targets, the striking rescue of the light response in norpAP24,rdgA1 and norpAP24,rdgA1;Gαq1 (compared with norpAP24 and norpAP24; Gαq1, respectively) provides strong independent evidence that the residual responses in norpAP24 and norpAP24;Gαq1 are mediated by PLC, because the rdgA mutation is expected to result in a greater net production of one of the two products of PLC activity, namely DAG. The question remains whether the PLC responsible for the spontaneous currents and responses in norpAP24 represents residual norpAP24 protein or an alternative PLC isoform. The Drosophila genome contains only two further identifiable PLC sequences: a PLCγ encoded by the sl (small wing) gene (22Thackeray J.R. Gaines P.C. Ebert P. Carlson J.R. Development. 1998; 125: 5033-5042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PLC-21C, which is a second PLCβ isoform (29Shortridge R.D. Yoon J. Lending C.R. Bloomquist B.T. Perdew M.H. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12474-12480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLCγ can be excluded, because spontaneous currents and residual light responses similar to those in norpAP24 could still be recorded in norpAP24,sl double mutants (data not shown). Because there are no mutants of PLC-21C, we attempted to test whether the residual norpAP24 protein might be responsible by generating flies with only one copy of norpAP24 by crossing norpAP24 to a lethal deficiency strain, Df(1)HC244, in which the entire norpA gene and the surrounding genomic region were deleted. The results, however, were inconclusive; the constitutive currents and quantum bump amplitudes in photoreceptors from norpAP24/Df(1)HC244 (n = 11) were not significantly different from homozygous norpAP24 controls, but QE did in fact appear to be reduced ∼2-fold. Although the latter suggests that residual mutant norpAP24 protein is responsible, because the responses were minimal and near the limit of detectability, we treat this result with caution. Activation of TRP Channels by Metabolic Inhibitors Is PLC-dependent—Because any residual light sensitivity in norpAP24 still appears to be mediated by PLC, our findings only serve to strengthen the conclusion that Drosophila phototransduction is an obligatory PLC-based pathway. Nevertheless, numerous studies have assumed that norpAP24 is a null mutant, and we wondered whether the finding of significant PLC activity in norpAP24 had any implications for the conclusions of such studies. For example, we recently demonstrated that PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and LNA could activate the light-sensitive channels. Because LNA was still effective in norpAP24, we concluded that activation was downstream of PLC and therefore likely to reflect a direct effect on the channels (6Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Minke and colleagues (8Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the light-sensitive channels could be activated by mitochondrial inhibitors; since they too found these agents to be effective in norpAP24, they also concluded that the agents acted downstream of PLC and that metabolic inhibition might affect the channels directly. These authors also noted that PUFAs can act as mitochondrial uncouplers and proposed that this was responsible for their ability to activate the light-sensitive channels. In view of the importance of these arguments for the mechanism of excitation and because of the significant PLC activity remaining in norpAP24, we repeated and extended these experiments. We first confirmed that mitochondrial inhibitors could activate light-sensitive channels as reported previously (8Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, large currents were reversibly induced within only seconds of application of either 10 μm CCCP or 0.1 mm DNP in WT and norpAP24 in recordings made soon after establishing the whole-cell configuration (Fig. 6A). Note that both CCCP and"

They catalyze ATP synthesis/hydrolysis coupled to transmembrane proton transport. All ATP-synthases consist of two parts, a membrane-embedded F0 part and a membrane extrinsic F1 part, which are connected by a thinner connecting region. In the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts, the F1 part is composed of five different subunits with the stoichiometry (αβ)3γδε. The α and β subunits surround the central γ subunit, which, together with the ε subunit, forms the central stalk. The F0 part is involved in proton translocation and consists of four different subunits I, II, III, and IV. Subunit III is the major component, 14 copies of the subunit III form a ring (1Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A segment of this ring, together with subunit IV, forms the proton channel (2Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunits I and II have an amphiphilic character, with a single transmembrane helix serving as a membrane anchor. The homologous b subunits in Escherichia coli form a dimer with inner-dimer contacts in the transmembrane N-terminal region (3Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the subunit III-ring in the membrane and the γ and ε subunit in the stalk region form a rotor, which rotates during proton translocation. This rotation induces conformational changes in the catalytic nucleotide binding sites during ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. A second static connection (stator) formed by subunits I and II, prevents co-rotation of the (αβ)3 core complex. The orientation of the rotor determines the occupancy of the three catalytic nucleotide binding sites. There are three equivalent orientations of the central rotor relative to the individual catalytic binding sites as shown by micro videograms (8Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Because rotational catalysis requires functional equivalence of the catalytic binding sites, all three conformations should occur with the same probability. In the ATP-synthases from chloroplasts, this type of rotational multisite catalysis requires activation of the enzyme by a transmembrane potential difference of protons, Δμ̃H+ (9Junge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Up to now it is not understood if the inactivate chloroplast ATP-synthase also adopts each of the three conformations with the same probability or takes up a unique resting conformation. Although various high resolution structures of sub-complexes from different F-type ATPases are known (for example, bovine MF1(αβ)3γδε (11Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); chloroplast CF1(αβ)3γ (12Groth G. Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); E. coli EF1(αβ)3γ (13Hausrath A.C. Grüber G. Matthews B.W. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar)), none of these sub-complexes include homologues of the smaller subunits that form the stator in the chloroplast ATP-synthase. Because the small static subunits are missing, which are asymmetrically attached to the (αβ)3 core, the individual nucleotide binding sites are only defined in respect to the rotor and not in respect to the stator, which is insufficient to distinguish between the three possible conformations. Information on this issue can be obtained by electron microscopy and image reconstruction of a complete ATP-synthase. Up to now, projection maps of the ATP-synthase from mitochondria (15Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), chloroplasts (16Böttcher B. Schwarz L. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and E. coli (17Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which show rotor and stator in the connecting region, have been obtained. However, two-dimensional projection maps alone, without prior knowledge of the three-dimensional shape, are inadequate to discern between different conformational states and projections of the same object in different directions. Such a discrimination can only be done, if the three-dimensional volumes are also known. Nevertheless, three-dimensional maps at 30- to 35-Å resolution, of the negatively stained E. coli (18Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and chloroplast enzymes (19Mellwig C. Böttcher B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), show the stator either weakly or not at all. Therefore, three-dimensional maps are still insufficient to decide whether or not the complex adopts different conformations. Here we present a three-dimensional map of the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts embedded in vitrified buffer, in which the stator and rotor are clearly visible and only a single conformation, as expected for a unique resting position, is observed. The ATP-synthase was purified according to a previous study (19Mellwig C. Böttcher B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which yields a complex where the regulatory disulfide bond of the γ-subunit is oxidized. The buffer was changed by passage through a Sephadex G-50 spin-column equilibrated in 0.1 mm dodecyl maltoside, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2. Grids coated with a perforated carbon film were glow-discharged and used within 30 min. After adding 2 mmAMP-PNP,1 2 μl of the sample was applied to the pretreated grid. The grid was mounted in a modified controlled environment freezing apparatus (20Bellare J.R. Davis H.T. Scriven L.E. Talmon Y. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1988; 10: 87-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). After blotting for 15 s with filter paper (Whatman No. 1), the samples were plunged into liquid ethane. The vitrified samples were transferred with a Gatan 626 cryo-holder into a Philips CM-200-FEG electron microscope. The microscope was operated under low dose conditions at 200 kV accelerating voltage. Micrographs were taken on Kodak SO-163 film, at a nominal magnification of ×50,000 with an underfocus of 3–5.1 μm. The micrographs were developed for 10 min in full-strength Kodak d-19 developer at room temperature. For image processing, suitable micrographs were scanned with a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a pixel size of 14 μm corresponding to 2.8 Å at specimen level. The particle images were selected interactively and were boxed off from the micrographs using the MRC image processing programs (21Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Further image processing was carried out using the IMAGIC-5 software package (22Van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Domgall I. Venzke D. Lüttge U. Ratajczak R. Böttcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13115-13121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. The phases of the particle images were corrected for the contrast transfer function. The particle images were band-pass filtered, including information between 1/16 and 1/110 Å−1. The band-pass filtering and the contrast transfer function of the microscope lead to an underestimation of the low resolution amplitudes, causing dark fringes and an overestimation of holes in the complex. To minimize this effect in the final three-dimensional map, the low resolution amplitudes of the raw three-dimensional map (Araw) were scaled relative to the amplitudes of a binarized three-dimensional map (Abin), in which gray values inside the particles were set to 1 and outside to 0. The threshold for binarizing was chosen so that the total number of voxels set to 1 accounted for the expected molecular mass of the ATP-synthase surrounded by the detergent micelle (∼750 kDa). Raw map and binarized map were Fourier-transformed. For each band of spatial frequencies (R1 ≤ R ≤R2) the ratio of the average amplitudes A was calculated,ratio(band)=∑R=R1R2Araw(R)∑R=R1R2Abin(R)Equation 1 The ratio varied at low spatial frequencies R and reached constant values for a small band of frequencies at aboutRR = 1/45 Å−1. At frequencies below this band, the ratio was used as a scaling factor and at frequencies above this band the constant ratio in the band was used for scaling of the amplitudes Araw in the raw map as follows. For band < RR,Afinal(R)=Araw(R)×ratio(band)Equation 2 and for band ≥ RR,Afinal(R)=Araw(R)×ratio(RR)Equation 3 The scaled three-dimensional Fourier transform was transformed to real space to give the final three-dimensional map (Fig. 5), which showed the same gross features as the raw map but smaller holes and reduced dark fringes, which facilitated fitting of the high resolution structures. In this approach, the absolute threshold for binarization was not too critical, however, the absolute size and shape of the binarized reference map were crucial. Therefore, scaling the electron microscopic reconstructions with atomic models of smaller sub-complexes, or models lacking the detergent micelle, yields poorer results than using the binarized reconstruction for scaling (data not shown). To demonstrate the effect of the scaling approach, a model experiment was performed: from the yeast F1c10 sub-complex (Protein Data Bank 1QO1 (14Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar)) a density map at 20-Å resolution was calculated (Fig. 1A). This map was convoluted with the contrast transfer function as calculated for a defocus of 3000 nm using a Philips CM-200-FEG operating at 200 kV. The resulting map showed dark fringes and holes at places where holes were not observed in the original map. After correcting phases for the contrast transfer function, the holes were observed at the correct positions (Fig.1C). However, they were darker and larger than in the original data. In addition, dark fringes surrounded the particle. Only little improvement was observed, when various reconstructions were calculated using different defocus values and had phases corrected for the contrast transfer functions were combined (Fig. 1D). We assume, that the dark fringes and holes are predominantly effects of uncorrected amplitudes at low spatial frequencies. In the “true” reconstruction, we do not expect any negative values (dark fringes and dark holes). This situation was approximated by a binarized map (Fig. 1E), the threshold of which was chosen so the total number of voxels set to 1 accounted for the expected molecular mass. The binarized map gave an estimate for the average amplitudes of the low spatial frequencies of a reconstruction without dark fringes. The map was used for scaling the amplitudes of the low spatial frequencies of the combined reconstruction (Fig. 1C) as described above. Indeed, scaling reduced the dark fringes and decreased the size of the holes (Fig.1F). Although the scaled map (Fig. 1F) was still not identical to the starting map (Fig.1A), it was more similar in its overall appearance than the map (Fig. 1D), where only phases were corrected for the contrast transfer function. To estimate the resolution of the three-dimensional map, two independent maps of half of the class averages were calculated, and their Fourier shell correlation was determined. The atomic models were fitted manually to the three-dimensional map using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). For the difference map, the fitted atomic models were filtered to the resolution of the three-dimensional reconstruction. After binarizing both maps with a threshold value of 0.3, a difference volume was calculated. Fig.2 shows a typical micrograph of the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts embedded in a thin layer of vitrified buffer. The protein formed a uniform monodisperse particle distribution. For image processing about 10,000 particle images were selected from 150 micrographs. The particle images were aligned, classified according to their similarity, and averaged. The class averages (Fig. 3A) showed projections of particles with a larger and a smaller domain, which were linked by one or two connectors. The larger domain corresponded to the F1 part and the smaller domain to the F0 part, shielded by the detergent micelle.Figure 3A, class-averages; B, surface representations of the three-dimensional map; and C, calculated projections of the three-dimensional map in the same directions as determined for the class averages in A. Views are rotated along the long axis of the complex in steps of ∼60°. In the surface representation individual elements possibly corresponding to the α subunits are labeled 1, 3, and5 and elements corresponding to the β subunits are marked2, 4, and 6. The scale barcorresponds to 100 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The class averages were combined into a three-dimensional map by exact filtered back-projection reconstruction (25Harauz G. Van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). All class averages could be matched by projections of the three-dimensional map (Fig. 3C). The Euler angles of the class averages covered most of the asymmetric unit (Fig.4), leaving only small areas unaccounted for. To estimate the overall resolution, we calculated the Fourier shell correlation between two maps, each representing half of the data. The correlation dropped to 0.5 at (1/21) Å−1 and cut the three-times noise correlation curve at (1/18) Å−1, indicating an overall resolution of about 20 Å. In our three-dimensional map the F1 part was formed by six elongated elements arranged roughly hexagonally around a central rod (see map in Fig.5B, labeled 1–6). These elements could also be recognized in the surface representations (Fig. 3B) and most likely correspond to the α and β subunits. To decide which of the elements were α and which were β subunits, we compared this region of the map to the atomic structures of different F1 sub-complexes (PS3-(αβ)3 (26Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.

Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar)). Although these sub-complexes had different nucleotide occupancies and varied significantly in the region nearest to the connecting region, the α subunits always extended further from the center than the β subunits. We observed a similar pattern in our map (Fig. 5B,2), where the elements 1, 3, and5 extended further from the center than 2,4, and 6. For this reason, we conclude that the α subunits form elements 1, 3, and 5and that the β subunits are represented by elements 2,4, and 6. The αβ-dimers in our map were not related by strict 3-fold symmetry. Therefore, we fitted the asymmetric (αβ)3 sub-complex of the mitochondrial F1(PDB 1E79 (11Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)), rather than the structure of the symmetric (αβ)3 sub-complex of the F1, from chloroplasts (PDB 1FX0 (12Groth G. Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)), into our three-dimensional map (Fig.6). The match between the mitochondrial F1 sub-complex and our map was best when the β subunit with the empty nucleotide binding site was superimposed to the elongated element 6 in our map. We propose that the rod in the center of the six elongated elements (Fig. 5A,elements 6 and 7, and 5B,element 2) correspond to the two long helices of the γ subunit in the atomic structure of the mitochondrial F1part. Fitting the α and β subunits and the two long helices of the γ subunit to the map, as described above, accounted for most of the observed density in the F1 part. In the F1 part only a peanut-shaped density at the top and an elongated density, running parallel to the α subunit corresponding to element 1, was unaccounted. The peanut-shaped feature at the top of F1part consisted of two domains (Fig. 5B, 1). One of the domains was located in the center of a crown-like region at the top of the α and β subunits, formed by the β-barrels, as seen in the x-ray structure (PDB 1E79 (11Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)). The other domain created a bridge to the α subunit in element 1. We assume that most of the peanut-shaped feature was occupied by subunit δ, because its central domain coincided with the area that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of subunit δ in E. coli (6Wilkens S. Zhou J. Nakayama R. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consequently, in our three-dimensional map the N-terminal domain of subunit δ must occupy the remaining peripheral domain into which the structure of the N-terminal domain of E. coli δ subunit (28Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) fitted nicely (Fig. 6). The F1 and F0part were joined by two connecting elements, a thin peripheral connector and one that was larger, and more centrally localized. The latter was formed by subunits γ and ε. In the past, two different conformations have been observed for the central connection. One was derived from crystals of a γ′ε sub-complex of the E. coli enzyme (29Rodgers A.J. Wilce M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the other from a mitochondrial F1(11Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and it has been argued that both conformations occur during catalysis (13Hausrath A.C. Grüber G. Matthews B.W. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13697-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The conformations vary in the orientation of the ε subunit (or related δ subunit in mitochondria F1) relative to the γ subunit with the ε subunit rotating 81° and undergoing a net translation of 23 Å. We fitted both types of central connections into our map (not shown) and found the conformation observed in the mitochondrial F1 was the best match (Fig.6). In contrast to an earlier reconstruction of the negatively stained ATP-synthase from E. coli, where two peripheral connectors have been identified (18Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), only one peripheral connection was observed. Whether or not the two connections observed in the ATP-synthase ofE. coli are a specialty of the bacterial enzyme or some artifact probably caused by the staining procedure remains open. In the chloroplast ATP-synthase the thinner, peripheral connection was attached at the periphery of the α subunit of the F1 part (Fig. 3B, element 1). The connection was wider at the sites of interaction with the F0 and F1part and thinner between these points. It remains uncertain if this slimming is a genuine feature of the connection or only appears in our model due to increased flexibility in this area. Whichever the case, we think that this peripheral link is the stator, formed by subunits I and II, in the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts. For the related b-subunits of E. coli, secondary structure determination indicates a helix content of 80% (30Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that the observed stator might contain only a little more than two extended helices, which is also supported by x-ray analysis (31Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the F1 part, the stator does not account for an individual feature and is presumably tightly attached to the α subunit (element 1), pointing toward the β subunit (element 6). To follow the path of the stator through the F1 structure, we calculated the difference between the volume occupied by the manually fitted x-ray structures and the volume occupied by our three-dimensional map (Fig.7A). In the F1part and in the connecting region, the fitted x-ray structures did not account for subunits I and II, the C-terminal domain of the δ subunit, and the disordered N-terminal residues of the α and β subunits. According to the difference, the stator contacted the α subunit (Fig. 5B, element 1), involved in forming the tight catalytic nucleotide binding site in the center, at the “bottom.” Then the stator lined the side of the α subunit, which faced the β subunit that forms part of the empty catalytic nucleotide binding site (Fig. 5B, element 6). At the top of the F1 part, the stator ended with a contact to the δ subunit at the uppermost part of the N-terminal domain. The observed position of the stator is in agreement with earlier cross-linking data for the stator-forming b and α subunits inE. coli (32McLachlin D.T. Coveny A.M. Clark S.M. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17571-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Rodgers A.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The F0 part had an elliptical cross-section in the plane of the membrane (Fig.5B, 4). An outer oval belt, probably formed by detergent, surrounded an inner circular ring of similar diameter, as the subunit III complex observed by atomic force microscopy (1Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the subunit III complex forms the inner ring. To get some impression of its space requirements in the context of our map, we generated a ring of 14 copies of the related E. coli c-subunit. There are two structures available from NMR measurements that vary in the deprotonation of Asp-61, which inE. coli has a pKa value of 7.1 (34Assadi-Porter F.M. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16186-16193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we generated a ring of the protonated (35Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the deprotonated (36Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) conformation of the related c-subunit (36Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) using MolMol (37Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and placed both in the observed density. The manual placement was guided by the hole in the center of the F0part in our map, which we superimposed on the central channel of the modeled ring. A belt of unaccounted density surrounded both modeled rings. This belt was smaller due to the modeled ring of the deprotonated conformation. However, at the level of observed detail, both fits were somewhat arbitrary. In Fig. 6 the modeled ring of the deprotonated form is shown, because at pH 7.2 this conformation should be adopted by the majority subunits. The ring was sealed from one side by the central stalk and from the other side by a plug. The nature of the plug was unclear, but it was probably formed by either detergent or by tightly bound lipids. The latter was observed in two-dimensional crystals of the related c complex of I. tartaricus(38Meier T. Matthey U. Henzen F. Dimroth P. Müller D.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When the volume occupied by the modeled ring was subtracted from the observed density, a belt with a bulge was left at the side where the stator emerged. We conclude that the membrane domains of subunits I, II, and IV formed this bulge. ATP-synthases work with a rotational mechanism, which requires the catalytic nucleotide binding sites to be functionally equivalent. Accordingly, there should be three equivalent conformations in which the catalytic nucleotide binding sites have the same overall occupancy, but vary in the occupancy of the individual binding sites as depicted in Fig. 8. In all three conformations, the core of (αβ)3γε III14 should have the same structural organization. Only the presence of the small peripheral subunits (I, II, IV, and δ) provides the means to distinguish between the three conformations. In the three conformations, the small peripheral subunits also have to adapt to spatially different environments, because the invariable core does not have a strict 3-fold symmetry. In our samples, we have the small static subunits present, and therefore, we are in principle, able to discern between the three conformations. Nevertheless, at the given resolution, our data does not show any indication of the presence of multiple conformational states. All observed projections can be matched by projections calculated from the same three-dimensional map, which is one indication that a conformationally homogeneous particle population was explored (19Mellwig C. Böttcher B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We can also exclude the possibility that particle images representing different conformations were accidentally combined in the three-dimensional map for the following reason: if particles with the described variation in conformations would have been averaged in our three-dimensional map, we would either expect the occurrence of three weak peripheral connectors or of a central connector with a 3-fold symmetry-axis approximately parallel to the long molecule axis and/or with a fuzzy outline. However, we observe only a single peripheral connector and a central stalk with a well-defined asymmetric shape. This stalk accommodates the atomic model of the mitochondrial central stalk in only one orientation. The two alternative orientations of the central stalk, which could be expected for the other two equivalent conformations (Fig. 8), do not match the observed density (not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the majority of the isolated, inactive ATP-synthases adopts a single unique resting position (equivalent to the one depicted in the center of Fig. 8). At present we do not know if this is a specialty of the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts, which requires activation by Δμ̃H+for rotational multisite catalysis, or whether it is a genuine feature for all ATP-synthases. A prerequisite for a unique resting position would be functional none-equivalent catalytic nucleotide binding sites. Somehow, the ATP-synthase must “know” in which position to stop when catalysis halts, due to inactivation by an insufficient Δμ̃H+. This could be achieved by a change of the binding constants for nucleotides in one of the three catalytic nucleotide binding sites. We think that in the ATP-synthase from chloroplasts, the change in binding constants might be realized by the stator, which is anchored in the membrane on one hand, where it could sense changes in the Δμ̃H+, and on the other hand is also tightly attached to one of the α subunits where it could influence the properties of the adjacent nucleotide binding sites. Therefore, the stator could “communicate” changes in Δμ̃H+ to the binding sites by dislocating the α subunit slightly and thus changing the binding constant of the adjacent nucleotide binding sites. According to our fit, in the resting position, the stator is attached to the tight catalytic nucleotide binding site (Fig. 8,center), which carries an ADP in the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inhibited mitochondrial F1 sub-complex (11Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). An ADP on a tight catalytic nucleotide binding site, which cannot be removed, is also found in the purified ATP-synthase from chloroplasts (39Possmayer F.E. Hartog A.F. Berden J.A. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 202-217Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that this peculiar property of one of the binding sites is caused by the stator, which in the resting position could force the adjacent site in a closed conformation and thus trapping the bound ADP. Because rotational catalysis requires functional equivalence of the catalytic nucleotide binding sites, we speculate that activation by Δμ̃H+, shifts the stator, which in turn relocates the attached α subunit rendering the binding sites functionally equivalent and thus enabling multisite catalysis again. We thank David Venzke for excellent technical assistance, Remco Sprangers for help with MolMol, and Peter Gräber and Susanne Fischer for valuable discussions."

Using in vitro transcription systems with ribosomal RNA P1 promoters, we have analyzed which step of the initiation cycle is inhibited by the effector ppGpp. We show that formation of the ternary transcription initiation complex consisting of RNA polymerase holoenzyme, the promoter DNA, and the first initiating nucleotide triphosphate is the major step at which ppGpp exerts its regulation. Neither primary binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter nor isomerization to the open binary complexes or the subsequent promoter clearance steps contributes notably to the observed inhibition. The effect of ppGpp-dependent inhibition in the formation of the ternary transcription initiation complex could be mimicked by nucleotide derivatives known to bind to the RNA polymerase active center. Using these model compounds, almost identical inhibition characteristics were observed as seen with ppGpp. The results support the previously published model, which suggests that ppGpp-dependent inhibition is based on competition between the inhibitor molecules and NTP substrates for access to the active center of RNA polymerase.

The cellular growth is generally determined by the capacity for protein synthesis, which itself is tightly linked to the number of ribosomes. During amino acid deprivation bacterial cells react, among other metabolic adaptations, by an immediate transcriptional shut-down of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs),1 the key molecules for the constitution of the protein synthesis apparatus. This global regulation is triggered by the rapid accumulation of the effector molecule guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and termed the stringent response (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J.

Although gradual progress in understanding this remarkable network has been made in recent years, the molecular details of the regulatory mechanism(s) are still obscure (2Barker M.M. Gaal T.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The observations that some promoters (e.g. amino acid biosynthesis operons) are activated during the stringent response and that in vivo and in vitro studies have often yielded contradictory results have further aggravated our understanding of the mechanism of ppGpp-dependent regulation (11Wagner R. Transcription Regulation in Prokaryotes. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). Moreover, ppGpp-dependent regulation is not restricted to the steps of transcription initiation but has also been shown to act during elongation where the pausing properties of transcribing RNA polymerase are specifically changed (6Krohn M. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23884-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).There is consensus today that RNA polymerase is the obvious target for the effector molecule ppGpp (7Toulokhonov I.I. Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Reddy P.S. Raghavan A. Chatterji D. Mol.

Binding has been shown to occur close to the active center formed modularly by both the औ and औ′ subunits. The presence of ppGpp renders the activity of the enzyme in such a way that transcription from stringent promoters (e.g.rRNA and tRNA promoters) is strongly repressed. However, mutations in the RNA polymerase sigma subunits have also been reported which apparently obstruct ς70-core polymerase interaction and thereby cause altered initiation properties of RNA polymerase at elevated ppGpp concentrations (14Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been observed for other sigma factors like ς32, ς38, and ς54 as well (9Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M.D. Sze C.C. Skärfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nyström T. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1494-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Whether a gene is stringently regulated or not is clearly encoded by its promoter structure. It is known for some time that promoters under negative stringent regulation share a common GC-rich sequence element downstream of the −10 promoter recognition element (16Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is termed the discriminator, and it has been shown to be a necessary, although not sufficient, structural element for stringent regulation. It is also clear, however, that other properties of a promoter, in addition to the discriminator sequence, are involved in defining whether a transcription unit is under stringent control or not (5Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies in the past have revealed that promoters under negative ppGpp-dependent control are characterized by a striking instability of their binary open complexes. For instance, the stringently regulated rRNA promoters will only form stable open complexes in presence of their corresponding starting nucleotides (3Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar,4Heinemann M. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Gourse R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9789-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough C. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the absence of starting nucleotides, the lifetime of open binary complexes is very short and such complexes have a high tendency to dissociate. Hence, at low NTP concentrations, formation of the ternary complexes will be the critical, rate-limiting step for productive transcription initiation. How, and at which step of the initiation pathway, can ppGpp affect transcription from such promoters? To answer this question we have systematically analyzed the effect of ppGpp on the individual steps leading to productive transcription initiation at several rRNA P1 promoters. Studies were performedin vitro, and the unregulated PtacI promoter served as a control. We show here that ppGpp affects the negatively regulated rRNA promoters at the transition from the binary open complexes to the ternary initiation complexes. The concentration of the starting substrate NTPs play a crucial role in this inhibition, suggesting that competition between the substrate NTPs and ppGpp for the catalytic site is involved. This conclusion is supported by almost identical inhibition characteristics when ppGpp is replaced by NTP substrate analogues known to bind to the active site of RNA polymerase.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have attempted to solve some of the questions that are still pending with respect to the mechanism of the stringent control. This type of regulation is mediated by the small effector molecule ppGpp, which affects transcription of many genes, in particular stable RNA genes. The concentration of this global regulator changes rapidly in response to a variety of environmental signals, for which amino acid starvation is the most notable example. Despite numerous attempts to understand the mechanism of this fundamental regulatory process of bacterial physiology, we still lack important details. Many conclusions from former studies are controversial, although some findings are consistent and in general agreement. There is consent, for instance, that RNA polymerase is the target for ppGpp (7Toulokhonov I.I. Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Reddy P.S. Raghavan A. Chatterji D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and, although not all the criteria are completely understood, it is known that the respective promoter structures determine whether a gene is under stringent control or not (5Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Travers A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2605-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Mizushima-Sugano J. Kaziro Y. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6271-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, both activation and repression of transcription are mediated by ppGpp, yet activation may not be a direct effect of the regulator. For instance, ribosomal RNA promoters represent the most outstanding examples for negative stringent control, whereas for example the universal stress protein UspA or amino acid biosynthesis proteins are known to be induced at elevated ppGpp concentrations. Much of the recent data suggest that the latter group of genes is probably regulated by passive mechanisms (2Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although direct effects have also been reported (36Choy H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6783-6789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Riggs D.L. Müller R.D. Kwan H.-S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 737-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To explain the mechanism of the stringent control, various steps of the transcription cycle have been proposed to be crucial for negative regulation. For instance, formation of the open promoter complex has been suggested as the relevant kinetic step for the negative control ofrrn promoters (39Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19813-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Raghavan A. Kameshwari D.B. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 75: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A different conclusion, namely trapping in the non-productive closed complex followed by efficient inhibition at promoter clearance, was reached by a kinetic analysis of stringently and non-stringently controlled rrnB P2 promoter variants (4Heinemann M. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The model is consistent with the partition model, proposed earlier, which suggests that RNA polymerase can exist in two interconvertible forms with different properties. Interconversion of the enzyme is triggered by bound ppGpp. RNA polymerase without ppGpp preferentially transcribes stable RNA promoters, whereas the enzyme with bound ppGpp prefers mRNA promoters (41Baracchini E. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2597-2602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the observation that stable RNA promoters form intrinsically unstable open complexes, models for both positive and negative stringent control have been proposed recently (3Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 42Barker M.M. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6315-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). According to those models ppGpp has a direct effect only on promoters under negative stringent control (e.g. stable RNA promoters), whereas positive stringent regulation is explained as passive effect of increasing RNA polymerase concentration, which results from transcriptional shut-down of the stable RNA genes. Recent studies describe clear evidence in vivo and in vitro for transcriptional inhibition by ppGpp at the lambda PR promoter (29Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PR promoter forms rather stable open complexes indicating that ppGpp-dependent regulation is apparently not restricted to promoters with short-lived open complexes. Moreover, based on earlier studies, several passive models for stringent control have been proposed previously (44Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Beck C. Ingraham J. Maaloe O. Neuhard J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 78: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The many different models, and the fact that none by itself can explain all the existing data, may reflect that there is probably not one single mechanism for the stringent control. This view is further strengthened by the finding that ppGpp is able to affect steps during transcription initiation but also during elongation (6Krohn M. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23884-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 46Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we have performed experiments in vitro, designed to define which step(s) of the initiation pathway are primarily affected by ppGpp and to explore the molecular mechanism by which ppGpp exerts it regulatory function. We selected the ribosomal RNA P1 promoters from the rrnB and rrnD operons, which differ in their starting nucleotide (ATP for rrnB and GTP for rrnD), bearing in mind the NTP-sensing model, which proposes that the starting NTP concentrations in the cell determines the sensitivity of stringent regulated promoters (18Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough C. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For comparison we employed the synthetic PtacI promoter, which does not contain a stringent discriminator sequence and which is known not to be affected by ppGpp. Consistent with the expectation, we found only a very small inhibition in multiple-round transcription experiments. In contrast, the two stable RNA promoters were strongly inhibited under the same conditions. At the same ppGpp concentration, inhibition of the two rrn promoters was not identical, however, and therrnB P1 promoter exhibited a stronger inhibition (927 compared with 827 for rrnD). Whether this slight difference is caused by the minor structural deviations of the core promoter sequences (rrnB P1 deviates in only one, and rrnDP1 in three positions from the ideal consensus sequence; see Fig.1A) or whether the difference reflects the alternative starting nucleotides (ATP versus GTP) remains unclear.Our study clearly demonstrates that the major effect of ppGpp is exerted before or during the formation of the ternary transcription initiation complexes. This can be concluded from the following findings. 1) Strong inhibition is only observed when ppGpp is added before or at the formation of the ternary complex (see Fig. 3). 2) Effects later during the initiation cycle (promoter clearance, abortive initiation or pausing) do not contribute significantly to overall inhibition (see Fig. 5). In addition we can show that the concentration of initiating nucleotides is crucial for the extent of inhibition. High starting NTP concentrations abrogate ppGpp-dependent inhibition (see Fig. 4). We could further demonstrate that the DNA structure within the open complex is very likely not altered in presence of ppGpp. We take this as indication that the conformation of ternary transcription complexes are not changed dramatically by ppGpp (see Fig. 6A). Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Ref. 3Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we obtained evidence that the difference in stability of the ternary complexes in presence or absence of ppGpp is insufficient to explain the degree of inhibition (see Fig.6B). Most interestingly, we find that the rate of ternary complex formation is reduced in presence of ppGpp. This effect can be compensated by an increase in the concentration of the initiating NTPs (see Fig. 7).Together these results are consistent with a previously published model, suggesting that ppGpp competes with the initiating NTP substrates (25Wagner R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). The model makes the assumption that the obligatory path for substrate NTPs to enter RNA polymerase active center is the secondary channel, a structure formed by elements of the औ′ domains F and G (32Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The diameter of this nucleotide entry channel is broad enough to allow passage of only one NTP at a time but also to accommodate ppGpp. It is feasible, therefore, that at high ppGpp concentrations free movement of substrate NTPs to the active site is restricted. This does not matter much if the Kmvalues for substrate binding are low and the respective complexes are stable. If, however, the requirements for substrate NTPs are high (high apparent Km values), as is the case for initiation complexes at stable RNA promoters, then the competition situation will take effect. Stringent sensitivity can thus be explained by the promoter structure, which through its conformation and specific interaction with RNA polymerase, determines the stability of the initiating complex and the apparent Km for the first substrate NTP. The effector molecule ppGpp, which accumulates to millimolar concentrations during the stringent control, may cause a competition situation. According to the simplest explanation, ppGpp effectively competes with the substrate NTPs for access to the active center of RNA polymerase. As a consequence less or no productive initiation complexes are formed.Our conclusions are in an apparent contrast to a previously published study (51Kingston R.E. Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that ppGpp lowers the overall elongation rate of RNA polymerase by enhanced pausing of the transcription elongation complex. The authors, by performing classical kinetic analyses, concluded that ppGpp-dependent inhibition did not appear to be competitive with the ribonucleoside triphosphate substrates. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the mechanism of ppGpp-dependent inhibition on elongation may be substantially different from that on ternary initiation complex formation where the promoter structure is certainly involved. The latter studies, however, were performed at elongation with transcription complexes initiated at the non-stringently controlled T7 A1 promoter. Moreover, because overall elongation rates and not individual pauses were studied, it is not completely clear whether the kinetic formalism correctly applies to the rather complex situation with individual pauses dependent on a sequence-specific context. The observed overall inhibition may be the result of more than one inhibition mechanism, and competitive inhibition my be masked under such a complex situation.Whether substrate competition is actually involved in the mechanism of ppGpp-dependent inhibition was further investigated by substituting the effector molecule ppGpp with nucleotide analogues. We selected dinucleotides (ApA, ApU, and CpC) that are known to be accepted as primers and thus are able to enter the active center of RNA polymerase. As can be seen in Figs. 8 and 9, these competitor substances not only inhibited transcription of the stable RNA promoters but showed almost the same characteristics of inhibition and were effective at the same concentration range as ppGpp. Moreover, in all cases the PtacI promoter was not inhibited. As shown for ppGpp, the dinucleotide competitors acted exclusively before or at the step leading to formation of the ternary initiation complex. Moreover, they exhibited the same dependence on the concentration of the starting NTPs as observed with the regulator ppGpp; finally, they reduced the rate at which the ternary complexes are formed. We believe that all these observations are certainly not an accidental coincidence. Therefore, we take these findings as a strong indication that substrate competition plays a major role in the mechanism of ppGpp-mediated stringent control.Of course there is also the possibility that dinucleotide substrates might mimic other mechanisms of ppGpp-dependent inhibition. For instance, such substrates might directly interact with a putative ppGpp binding site and invoke allosteric effects in much the same way as might be the case for ppGpp. In a recent in vitrotranscription initiation analysis employing the dinucleotide ApU at the lambda PR promoter, it was shown that ppGpp-mediated inhibition was abrogated (29Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As the simplest interpretation of this finding, the authors concluded that ppGpp inhibits formation of the first phosphodiester bond and this step is by-passed by the dinucleotide. It was thus concluded that the effect of ppGpp is less drastic in the presence of the dinucleotide ApU. The alternative explanation as outlined above might, however, also apply to this observation. To further test the model and to explore the exact type of inhibition or competition, more experiments with competitor analogues are under way.There is independent evidence for the regulation of NTP access to the active site of RNA polymerase, and blocking the secondary channel for free passage of NTP substrates has been proposed recently in quite a different context. For the structure that is central for the secondary channel, different conformations have been described. Within the RNA polymerase, the bridging helix formed by औ′ domains F and G (alternatively bent or straight) are believed to provide a mechanism for RNA polymerase translocation. The bent औ′ subunit F bridge involves a clash competing with the incoming nucleotides at the active site of RNA polymerase. The alternating movement pushes template bases from the i+1 site (translocation) and concomitantly blocks the entry for nucleotides into the active site. This switch mechanism, termed “swing-gate” by the authors, explains translocation of the transcript and simultaneously regulates the entry of substrate nucleotides (47Ephstein V. Mustaev A. Markovstov V. Bereshchenko O. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The proposed mechanism of competition outlined above does not rest on a static RNA polymerase structure. To the contrary, more complex scenarios can be envisaged involving dynamic changes of the transcription complex. Many observations are in favor of the view that RNA polymerase activity can be regulated by allosteric mechanisms, as in the case of the swing-gate mechanism, where the conformation of the F helix is modulated by factors acting elsewhere in the molecule binding to stringent promoters or the interaction with an effector molecule like ppGpp might change the architecture of distant domains within the multi-subunit enzyme. Allosteric mechanisms could principally explain a different phenomenon of the stringent control, which appears to be independent from substrate competition. For instance, several reports have provided evidence that ppGpp affects the relative competitiveness of sigma factor interaction with core RNA polymerase (9Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M.D. Sze C.C. Skärfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nyström T. Shingler V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14795-14798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this case ppGpp could be an allosteric effector that interacts at some site within the secondary channel (or elsewhere) and triggers a conformational change, which alters the complex interacting surface of the औ/औ′ subunits that is known to make contacts with the alternative sigma factors (49Colland F. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Kolb A. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 50Lacour S. Kolb A. Boris Z. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells adapt their growth very efficiently in response to changes in the environmental conditions. The cellular growth is generally determined by the capacity for protein synthesis, which itself is tightly linked to the number of ribosomes. During amino acid deprivation bacterial cells react, among other metabolic adaptations, by an immediate transcriptional shut-down of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs),1 the key molecules for the constitution of the protein synthesis apparatus. This global regulation is triggered by the rapid accumulation of the effector molecule guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and termed the stringent response (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J.

Although gradual progress in understanding this remarkable network has been made in recent years, the molecular details of the regulatory mechanism(s) are still obscure (2Barker M.M. Gaal T.

The structure shows lovastatin bound in the active site and its interactions with residues critically involved in catalysis and substrate binding. Binding of lovastatin also displaces the flap domain of the enzyme, which contains the catalytic residue His-381. Comparison with the structures of statins bound to the human enzyme revealed a similar mode of binding but marked differences in specific interactions that account for the observed differences in affinity.

Isoprenoids are branched-chain lipids formed by polymerization of the five-carbon monomer isopentenyl diphosphate. Present in all known organisms, isoprenoids function in processes as diverse as maintenance of membrane structure, cell wall and glycoprotein synthesis, defense mechanisms, and modification of proteins and tRNAs. Formation of isopentenyl diphosphate can occur by either of two pathways: the mevalonate pathway (1Rodwell V.W. Beach M.J. Bischoff K.M. Bochar D.A. Darnay B.G. Friesen J.A. Gill J.F. Hedl M. Jordan-Starck T. Kennelly P.J. Kim D-Y. Wang Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 259-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-pyruvate (GAP-pyruvate) pathway (2Rohmer M. Cane D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 2. Pergamon Press, Tarrytown, NY1999: 45-67Google Scholar). Animals and Archaea use only the mevalonate pathway, and plants utilize both pathways (2Rohmer M. Cane D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 2.

Kuzuyama T. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many true bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, employ the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-pyruvate pathway. Gram-positive cocci and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi possess only genes that encode the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway (5Wilding E.I. Brown J.R. Bryant A.P. Chalker A.F. Holmes D.J. Ingraham K.A. Iordanescu S. So C.Y. Rosenberg M. Gwynn M.N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting reaction of the mevalonate pathway is catalyzed by HMG-CoA 1The abbreviation used is: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. reductase, which converts (S)-HMG-CoA to (R)-mevalonate (Fig. 1). The reaction proceeds in three stages, the first and third of which are reductive. In humans, the mevalonate pathway is responsible for the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol. For this reason, HMG-CoA reductase is the target of the statin drugs that severely attenuate cholesterol synthesis and lower blood cholesterol levels in human subjects (6Corsini A. Maggi F.M. Catapano A.L. Pharmacol. Res. 1995; 31: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) by competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate, HMG-CoA. There are two distinct classes of HMG-CoA reductase, which appear to have arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (7Bochar D.A. Stauffacher C.V. Rodwell V.W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 66: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The class I HMG-CoA reductases are present in eukaryotes and several Archaea. Characterized class II HMG-CoA reductases include those from Pseudomonas mevalonii (8Jordan-Starck T.C. Rodwell V.W. J. Biol.

Palnitkar M. Buchanan S.K. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the class II HMG-CoA reductase of P. mevalonii (14Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W.

The class II enzymes are considerably less sensitive to inhibition by statin drugs, with Ki values in the millimolar range, in contrast to the nanomolar values for the class I enzymes (9Kim D-Y.

Apart from multiple genes for acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, which also functions in fatty acid catabolism, the enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci possess only single copies of the genes encoding the subsequent five enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway is essential for the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Strains carrying double allelic replacements of the genes encoding HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase are auxotrophic for mevalonate, and the virulence of an HMG-CoA synthase mutant of a pathogenic strain of S. pneumoniae is severely attenuated in a mouse model (5Wilding E.I. Brown J.R. Bryant A.P. Chalker A.F. Holmes D.J. Ingraham K.A. Iordanescu S. So C.Y. Rosenberg M. Gwynn M.N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Significantly, the low (20–80 nm) concentration of mevalonate in human plasma (19Popjak G. Boehm G. Parker T.S. Edmond J. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 716-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cannot support growth of the HMG-CoA synthase-null mutant. Because the mevalonate pathway is essential for the survival of Gram-positive cocci, the class II HMG-CoA reductases, and possibly other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, represent attractive potential targets for the development of active site-directed inhibitors for use as antibiotics against multiple drug-resistant strains of the enterococci and streptococci that constitute a major cause of nosocomial infections. We have shown in previous crystallographic work (14Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A.

Three distinct subsites that bind cofactors and substrates can be described. One site, formed by the large domain of one monomer, binds the CoA portion of HMG-CoA. The small domain of the second monomer forms the NAD(H) binding site. A deep pocket at the dimer interface forms the binding site for mevalonate and the HMG portion of HMG-CoA. The crystal structures of the ternary complexes (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) revealed that binding of the substrates and cofactors induces folding of the last 50 residues at the C-terminal region of the monomer to form a three-helix flap domain. This region is disordered in the original structure of the apoenzyme (14Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The flap domain closes over the active site and positions the catalytic histidine, His-381, proximal to the thioester of HMG-CoA, in an orientation consistent with its proposed role in protonating the leaving CoAS— anion (15Tabernero L.

The structures also presented evidence that a new residue, Lys-267, is critically involved in catalysis as confirmed by mutagenesis and chemical modification of Lys-267 (21Bochar D.A. Tabernero L. Stauffacher C.V. Rodwell V.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The determination by Istvan and Deisenhofer (22Istvan E.S. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2001; 292: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar) of multiple crystal structures of statins complexed to the human class I HMG-CoA reductase has revealed their molecular interactions. The low sequence homology between class I and class II HMG-CoA reductases, significant differences in their three-dimensional structures, and wide differences in their statin sensitivity suggested that there might be differences in the way they bind statins. We therefore have determined the crystal structure of a class II HMG-CoA reductase complexed with the statin lovastatin. This reveals the specific interactions of the statin in the active site and explains the molecular basis for the wide differences in statin sensitivity of the two classes of HMG-CoA reductase. More importantly, this structure provides new insights for the ultimate development of “class II statins,” compounds selectively directed against HMG-CoA reductase of pathogenic microorganisms. Protein Expression and Purification—Following expression in E. coli of the mvaA gene that encodes P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity as described previously (1Rodwell V.W.

Crystals were soaked overnight and then mounted in capillaries for data collection. Data Collection—X-ray data were collected at room temperature using an R-axis II (MSC) with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source. A full data set was collected from a single crystal of the HMG-CoA reductase·lovastatin complex. X-ray data were indexed and integrated with DENZO and scaled using Scalepack (24Otwinowski, Z. (1993) Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar). The scaled data set has 23,498 unique reflections with an Rsym = 7.8% and is 87% complete (25–2.6 Å). The crystal lattice for the complex is isomorphous with the native crystals and belongs to the cubic space group I4132 with a = 228.5 Å. Crystallographic Refinement—Crystallographic refinement was performed using the coordinates of the P. mevalonii enzyme from the mevalonate·NADH ternary complex structure (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with X-PLOR version 3.1 (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and the Engh and Huber parameters (26Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Initial rigid body refinement for data in the 15–3.5-Å resolution range led to a final Rfactor of 23.8%. The initial 2(Fo — Fc) difference maps at 2.6 Å showed a nicely shaped density in the active site that permitted modeling of the lovastatin molecule without any ambiguity. These initial maps also showed two peaks of density corresponding to water molecules bound to two residues in the active site that mediate interactions with the statin. Successive cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing were combined to complete the refinement of the structure. Water molecules were modeled using the 2(Fo — Fc) maps contoured at the 3.5σ level. Temperature factors were refined according to the restrained individual isotropic B-factor refinement protocol in X-PLOR using data from 6 to 2.6 Å with a resulting Rwork = 19.6% (Rfree = 25.1%). The last refined model contained protein residues 4–375 (first monomer) and 504–877 (second monomer) plus 1 lovastatin and 43 water molecules. The geometrical parameter analysis gave a root mean square deviation for bond distances of 0.016 Å and for bond angles of 1.85°. Lovastatin Contacts Four Different Regions of the Active Site—Four distinct subsites or pockets of the active site of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase accommodate specific functional groups on lovastatin (Fig. 2). The LOV-1 site accommodates the C5-OH group, the LOV-2 site the C3-OH group. The LOV-3 site, at the top of the active site, accommodates the carboxylic group, and the hydrophobic LOV-4 site accommodates the decalin ring. The β-hydroxy-δ-acid moiety of lovastatin sits in the central pocket of the active site in the same position as the HMG moiety of HMG-CoA in the structure of the ternary complex (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The decalin ring and the α-methylbutyrate ester moiety twist inward and face the side wall of the pocket formed by the hydrophobic side of the α-helix that contains Ala-368 to Leu-372 (Fig. 3B). In addition to occupying the HMG/mevalonate site, lovastatin partially occupies the position of the coenzyme A moiety in the HMG-CoA site.Fig. 3Lovastatin interactions mimic substrate binding.A, ball and stick partial representation of the HMG-CoA·NAD+ complex (in magenta) (15Tabernero L.

Relevant residues from both complexes are superimposed. Lovastatin is colored orange, HMG-CoA light blue, and NAD+green. The hydroxy acid moiety of lovastatin overlays the HMG moiety of HMG-CoA, and both form similar hydrogen bond interactions with the same active site residues. Water molecules involved in hydrogen bond interactions in the lovastatin complex are labeled W1 and W2. The catalytic His-381 is shown in its position near the thioester in HMG-CoA, as expected from the proposed role of this residue in protonating the leaving CoAS— anion. In the lovastatin complex, His-381 is displaced by the binding of the statin to the active site. B, ribbon representation of the lovastatin complex with P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase.

The two water molecules that mediate interactions of lovastatin with active site residues are labeled W1001 and W1002. Hydrogen bond interactions with the enzyme are represented by blue dotted lines. Residues involved in hydrophobic interactions with lovastatin (Ala-368 (A368), Leu-372 (L372) and Ser-85 (S85), Ile-86 (I86), Ala-89 (A89)) are situated along the hydrophobic faces of two α-helices that surround the decalin ring.

As for the C5 oxygen of HMG-CoA (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the C5-OH of lovastatin hydrogen bonds to catalytic residues Lys-267 and Glu-83 in the LOV-1 pocket. The carboxylate group of lovastatin hydrogen bonds to Arg-261 in the LOV-3 site, an interaction that mimics that of the carboxylate groups of HMG-CoA and mevalonate in the ternary complexes. This type of interaction, which is common in other dehydrogenases, is considered critical in compensating the negative charge of the carboxylate group (27Sudi J. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Additional Hydrogen Bonds Are Formed through Water Molecules—An additional hydrogen bond is formed to Asn-365 in the LOV-2 site through one of the water molecules identified in the initial map. This previously unobserved interaction has no parallel in the ternary complexes with substrates. A second water molecule mediates a hydrogen bond between Asn-216 in the B subunit and the C3-OH group of lovastatin. This contact was unexpected because Asn-216 formed two hydrogen bonds to the NAD(H) carboxyamide group in the structures of the ternary complexes, which facilitate binding of the nicotinamide ring (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the lovastatin complex, the water molecule overlaps exactly the position of the oxygen from the carboxyamide of NAD(H) and establishes an indirect interaction between the statin and Asn-216. Lovastatin thus appears to make all possible direct interactions with catalytically important residues present in the HMG/mevalonate pocket. Additional water-mediated interactions suggest potential sites of modification of the inhibitor to further enhance its binding affinity. Table I summarizes each of the above interactions.Table IInteractions of statins with the class I and class II HMG-CoA reductasesSubsiteP. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductaseHuman HMG-CoA reductaseLovastatin atomProtein residueDistanceCompactin atomProtein residueDistanceSimvastin atomProtein residueDistanceÅÅÅLOV-1O5Lys-2672.8O5Lys-6912.7O5Lys-6912.8LOV-1O5Asn-2713.1O5Asn-7552.8O5Asn-7552.9LOV-1O5Glu-833.3O5Glu-5592.7O5Glu-5592.7LOV-2O3Water2.5O3Arg-5903.1O3Arg-5903.1LOV-3O1BArg-2612.7O1BLys-7352.8O1ALys-7352.8LOV-3O1AWater2.5O1ALys-6923.1O1BLys-6923.2LOV-3O1ASer-6842.6O1BSer-6842.7LOV-3O1AWater2.6O1BWater2.9 Open table in a new tab Hydrophobic Contacts Also Contribute to Lovastatin Binding—Five residues in the LOV-4 site are involved in close hydrophobic contacts with the decalin ring. These are Ala-368 and Leu-372 (3.4–4.0 Å), on the hydrophobic face of an α-helix of the large domain responsible for HMG-CoA binding, and Ser-85, Ile-86, and Ala-89 (3.8–3.9 Å) located in an α-helix downstream from the catalytic Glu-83 on the other side of the pocket (Fig. 3B). Binding of Lovastatin Prevents Closure of the Flap Domain— Lovastatin bound in the central or HMG/mevalonate pocket blocks access of the substrate HMG-CoA. In addition, the bulky decalin ring protrudes from the pocket and interferes directly with closure of the flap domain seen in the ternary complexes of HMG-CoA reductase (15Tabernero L. Bochar D.A. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, the flap domain appears disordered in the electron density map, similar to the structure of the apoenzyme (14Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Superposition of the lovastatin complex onto the HMG-CoA·NAD+ complex shows that the decalin ring of the inhibitor overlaps the position of the catalytic histidine, His-381, in the closed flap structure (Fig. 3A). Binding of the statin thus impedes closure of the flap domain, blocks formation of the active site, and prevents correct alignment of functionalities essential for catalysis. Comparison of the Statin Complexes of Class I and Class II HMG-CoA Reductases—Complexes of simvastatin and compactin with the catalytic domain of human HMG-CoA reductase have been reported and show the drugs bound in the substrate-binding site (22Istvan E.S. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2001; 292: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). All three statins have similar structures. In compactin there is a hydrogen rather than a CH3 on C6′ of the hexahydronaphthalene ring, and simvastatin has an additional methyl group on C2″ of the α-methylbutyrate ester moiety (Figs. 2 and 4). Major features in the mode of binding of the statins are common to both class I and class II HMG-CoA reductases because they mimic the natural substrate binding and position. Inspection of the specific interactions and arrangement of the active site residues reveals differences, which are discussed below in more detail. For the class II P. mevalonii enzyme, all residues that have direct interactions with lovastatin belong to the same subunit of this dimeric enzyme. Four direct hydrogen bonds mediate interactions with the HMG-like moiety of lovastatin, and two structural water molecules mediate additional interactions (Fig. 4A). Lovastatin binds in the hydrophobic pocket close to non-polar side chains with its decalin ring partially exposed to solvent. Interactions of compactin (Fig. 4B) and simvastatin (Fig. 4C) with the class I human enzyme involve interactions with residues of two subunits of the tetrameric enzyme. In both cases, four regions or pockets can be distinguished in the active site of the enzyme, similar to the lovastatin complex presented here. In the complexes of compactin and simvastatin with the human enzyme there are seven direct hydrogen bond interactions with residues in the active site and one additional interaction mediated by a water molecule (Table I). Hydrophobic interactions occur with Leu-853h 2The subscripts p and h on numbered residues refer to P. mevalonii or human HMG-CoA reductase, respectively. of the hydrophobic side of helix Lα10, which occupies a position analogous to the long helix at the HMG-CoA binding site of the P. mevalonii enzyme. Two additional hydrophobic residues are in close proximity to the decalin ring, Leu-562h and Val-683h. From this analysis it is clear that a higher number of hydrogen bond interactions is involved in the binding of the statins to the active site of the class I human enzyme, consistent with the wide differences in the inhibition constants when compared with the P. mevalonii and other class II HMG-CoA reductases. Sequence Conservation and Divergence at the Inhibitor Pocket Sites—The hydrophobic regions of both classes of the enzyme contain residues that are semiconserved across classes but which occupy comparable positions in the three-dimensional structure of the α-helices in the large domain (HMG-CoA binding domain). Ile-86p is either Val or Leu in class II HMG-CoA reductases and is Leu in the class I enzymes. By contrast, Ala-89p is conserved in class II but is a serine in the class I enzymes. Ala-368p, Leu-372p, and their analogous residues Leu-853h and Leu-857h are conserved within classes. The apolar character and the relative position of all these residues are retained in both classes of the enzyme. This suggests that overall the hydrophobic contacts of the inhibitors with the enzyme do not represent a distinctive feature of a particular class of HMG-CoA reductase. The LOV-1 Pocket—Asn-271p/Asn-755h and Glu-83p/Glu-559h of the LOV-1 pocket are conserved across classes, and Lys-267p/Lys-691h, although not conserved across classes, fulfill an analogous function in catalysis. Up to three hydrogen bond interactions are present in this pocket when analyzing the complexes of statins with both classes of the enzyme (Fig. 4). The LOV-2 Pocket—This pocket exhibits the greatest differences between the class I and class II enzymes. In the class I enzyme, the pocket is formed by the insertion named the “cis-loop,” which also forms the LOV-3 pocket (16Istvan E.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the class II enzymes, the pocket is formed by an α-helix containing the conserved “THNK” motif. No direct interactions between lovastatin and the P. mevalonii enzyme occur in this pocket, although there is a water-mediated interaction with Asn-365p. By contrast, compactin and simvastatin form a hydrogen bond with Arg-590h in the human enzyme (Fig. 4, B and C). The LOV-2 pocket thus provides interactions strictly conserved in class I, but which lack apparent analogues in class II enzymes. Furthermore, the LOV-2 pocket of the class II enzymes has a more hydrophobic character. The LOV-3 Pocket—Positively charged residues present in the LOV-3 pocket interact with the carboxylate of statins. Arg-261p and a water molecule form two hydrogen bonds in the class II complex, an interaction common in dehydrogenases, which neutralizes the negative charge of the carboxylate group of the substrate (27Sudi J. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the class I complex Lys-735h and Lys-692h arise from different subunits, occupy a position equivalent to that of the arginine of the class II enzyme, and form two hydrogen bonds with the statins. Ser-684h and a water molecule provide two additional hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group (Fig. 4). Similar to the LOV-2 pocket, residues in the LOV-3 pocket are conserved within each class of enzyme but have no apparent analogues across classes. Interestingly, these conserved residues occupy similar positions in the three-dimensional structure. This suggests a conserved mode of binding for the substrate, and hence for statins, critical for both types of enzyme. Additional Differences—Ser-85p near the catalytic Glu-83p and Gln-364p in the coenzyme A-binding site all are close to the decalin ring and could act as potential hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups. Ser-85p and Gln-364p are conserved in the class II enzymes but lack apparent homologues in class I enzymes. In the three-dimensional structure of the human enzyme Cys-351h and His-752h occupy these positions and do not interact with the statins. These differences therefore offer potential for the design of inhibitors specific for class II HMG-CoA reductases. Lovastatin binds to the active site of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase mimicking the binding of the substrate HMG-CoA. Specific interactions of lovastatin with residues important in catalysis further confirm the proposed catalytic mechanism for this enzyme and provide an explanation at the molecular level for why inhibition of lovastatin is competitive with respect to HMG-CoA. Interactions of lovastatin at the active site occur in four different subsites or pockets. Present in each pocket are residues conserved among the class II enzymes but which lack apparent homologues in the class I HMG-CoA reductases. However, residues with analogous functional groups occupy similar positions in the three-dimensional structure and establish similar interactions with the statins. Binding of lovastatin in the active site displaces both the flap domain (class II enzyme) and the C-terminal helix Lα11 (class I enzyme) that contains the catalytic histidine. This results in a conformational disorder that prevents the visualization of this region in the electron density maps of the structures of the complexes. Comparison of the structures of lovastatin bound to Pseudomonas HMG reductase and those of compactin and simvastatin bound to the human enzyme revealed an overall similar mode of binding for the statins but significant differences in the specific interactions. For the human enzyme complexes, extensive hydrogen bond interactions involve residues in the LOV-1, LOV-2, and LOV-3 pockets. Most of the residues involved in specific interactions are conserved in the class I enzyme but with no apparent homology to the class II enzyme. There are two exceptions, the catalytic glutamate and asparagine in the LOV-1 pocket, which are conserved throughout both classes of the enzyme. The hydrophobic region around the decalin ring of lovastatin also appears to be highly conserved and to retain the non-polar character across both classes of enzyme. This suggests that the hydrophobic interactions in that region are less specific for each class of enzyme, and they would probably not provide significant discrimination for the development of class II specific inhibitors. In contrast, regions such as the LOV-2 pocket, which exhibit marked differences in amino acid composition between both types of enzyme, are potential “hot spots” for further investigation and drug development. Water-mediated interactions, for example, could accommodate extra functional groups positioned in the statin molecule to maximize interactions. Interactions of statins with the functional groups of residues such as Ser-85p and Gln-364p might be also exploited to provide alternative binding capabilities and enhance the design of selective inhibitors for the class II forms of HMG-CoA reductases of important human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1992575609,"Stat5 is activated by a broad spectrum of cytokines, as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src. In this study, the DNA binding properties of the two closely related Stat5 proteins, Stat5a and Stat5b, induced either by prolactin (Prl) or by Src were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using several different Stat5 binding sites. Src-induced Stat5b-DNA binding complexes consistently displayed a slightly faster mobility than those induced by Prl, as well as differences in their ability to be supershifted by anti-Stat5 antibodies. IP-Westerns performed using specific antibodies directed at the N and C termini of Stat5b suggested that depending on the activating stimulus, Stat5b exhibited different conformations, which influenced antibody accessibility at its C terminus. These conformational differences may in part be due to differential effects of Prl and Src on Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation, since Src induced several additional sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b at residues other than Tyr-699, including Tyr-724 and Tyr-679. The latter Tyr-679 is conserved in all mammalian Stat5bs, but is not present in Stat5a. A Stat 5bY679F mutant induced by Src kinase exhibited an altered pattern of nuclear localization as compared with wild-type Stat5b. Furthermore, this mutation inhibited v-Src-induced cyclin D1-luciferase reporter activity in transient transfection assays performed in Stat5a/b-deficient MEFs, suggesting that Tyr-679 phosphorylation may play a role in v-Src induced proliferation. Thus, depending on the signal transduction pathway responsible for activation, different conformations of activated Stat5 may result in selective biological responses."

The regulation of exocytosis is vital for a number of processes, for example, cell polarity, embryogenesis, and neuronal growth formation. Regulation of the exocyst complex in mammals was recently shown to be dependent upon binding of the small G protein, Ral, to Sec5, a central component of the exocyst. This interaction is thought to be necessary for anchoring the exocyst to secretory vesicles. We have determined the structure of the Ral-binding domain of Sec5 and shown that it adopts a fold that has not been observed in a G protein effector before.

The exocyst complex is involved in the final stage of exocytosis, when post-Golgi vesicles are targeted and dock to the plasma membrane. The exocyst consists of an assembly of eight proteins: Sec3, -5, -6, -8, -10, and 15, and Exo70 and -84, which form a complex localized to sites of vesicle docking to the plasma membrane during exocytosis.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the exocyst directs vectorial targeting of secretory vesicles to sites of membrane expansion, such as bud sites. It appears that Sec3p, which is always localized to the plasma membrane, forms a targeting patch and is the spatial landmark for polarized exocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A subcomplex of Sec15p and Sec10p is localized to secretory vesicles (2Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and a network of protein-protein interactions among the exocyst components bridges Sec15p-Sec10p to the targeting patch made by Sec3p (3Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In mammals the exocyst is involved in the targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelia. The regulation of the exocyst seems to be somewhat different in higher eukaryotes, because Sec3 does not have the same role. Rather, in polarized epithelial cells, Exo70 is localized to the plasma membrane (4Matern H.T. Yeaman C. Nelson W.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas the other components of the exocyst remain cytosolic, implying that exocyst assembly at the membrane is dependent upon Exo70, rather than Sec3 as in yeast.Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, actin cytoskeleton, nuclear transport, and vesicle transport. Because many of these processes involve exocytosis, it was likely that small GTPases could play a role in exocyst regulation (5Novick P. Guo W. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 247-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In yeast, Sec4p, a homologue of Rab3A GTPase, anchors Sec15p to secretory vesicles (2Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The exocyst is anchored to the plasma membrane via the interaction of Sec3p with another GTPase, Rho1p (6Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Sec3p has also been shown to bind to Cdc42, another member of the Rho family (7Zhang X.Y. Bi E.F. Novick P. Du L.L.

Finally, it was shown that Exo70p interacts with Rho3p at the plasma membrane (8Robinson N.C.G. Guo L. Imai J. Toh-E A. Matsui Y. Tamanoi F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the Rho family GTPases, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton, in exocyst regulation implies a coordination of cytoskeletal changes with exocytosis.In mammalian cells, the exocyst components do not seem to interact with Rab3A or Rho family members. Rather, it was recently shown that the exocyst is regulated by yet another GTPase, RalA (9Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat.

Both activated Ral and Ral inhibition disrupt polarized exocytosis in epithelial cells, suggesting it is necessary for the GTPase to cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms to direct vesicle movement. Ral, like Rab3A, is localized to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane, but the exocyst component responsible for interacting with RalA was found to be Sec5. In yeast, Sec5p is at the center of the exocyst complex, linking the Sec10p-Sec15p subcomplex to the rest of the exocyst via its interactions with Exo70p, Sec3p, and Sec6p (3Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, Sec5 may have a different role in the mammalian exocyst.Ral small GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins implicated in oncogenesis, endocytosis, actin dynamics, and membrane trafficking.

The discovery that Ral is involved in regulation of exocytosis provides a link between secretory and cytoskeletal pathways.The exocyst was found to bind specifically to GTP-bound RalA (11Brymora A.

One region of small G proteins that is sensitive to the state of the bound nucleotide is the effector loop, which interacts with downstream effectors. The effector loop mutant D49E does not bind to Sec5 and has been shown to disrupt transport of proteins to the basolateral surface in polarized epithelial cells (9Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).The region of Sec5 responsible for Ral binding was identified and comprises the first 80 amino acids (10Sugihara K. Asano S. Tanaka K. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Ohta Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The first 95 residues of Sec5 contain a putative domain, the IPT (17Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which is found in some cell-surface receptors such as Met and Ron and in intracellular transcription factors, e.g. NF-κB, where it is responsible for DNA binding. A domain of this type has not been found in a G protein effector so far, and it is not possible to predict how it will interact with Ral. In contrast, the topology of the Ras-binding domain of the Ras effectors is structurally conserved and forms a ubiquitin-like fold (18Nassar M. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 48Vetter I.R. Linnemann T. Wohlgemuth S. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. FEBS.

It is thus of great interest to study how the Ral GTPases (the closest homologues of Ras) interact with their own effectors. There is some precedent for Ig domain-G protein interactions. A guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Rho family proteins contains an Ig domain, whose structure in complex with Cdc42 and Rac has been solved (19Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).We have solved the structure of the Ral-binding domain of Sec5 using solution NMR techniques and find that it forms an IPT fold. We have mapped the binding of Ral·GMPPNP to this domain and found that the surface of Sec5 that interacts with Ral is similar to that used in other IPT domains for protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, this surface is different from that used in the Rho GDI Ig domain for contacting the Rho family proteins and their geranyl-geranyl moiety. How Ral may bind to the IPT domain of Sec5 will be discussed and compared with other G protein-effector interactions.DISCUSSIONThe structural and sequence alignments reveal that, although the overall folds are similar, the Sec5 domain is more similar to the bacterial α-amylases than to NF-κB (Figs. 3 and 4). One of the major differences between these domains is the region between strands c and e. In NF-κB there is a loop containing a single turn of a 310 helix, then the c′ strand, then another turn of 310 helix and strand d, which is only 2 residues; in Sec5 and α-amylase the loop between c and c′ is much shorter and does not contain any helix and strand d is longer (Fig. 4). The other main difference between Sec5/α-amylase and the transcription factors is that there is a 6-residue insertion in the e–f loop in the DNA-binding proteins. This insertion is visible in the structures, because the loop protrudes from the surface in NF-κB (Fig. 3).The residues involved in dimerization in the transcription factors map to one surface of the domain, comprising residues from औ-strands a, b, d, and e (Figs. 4 and 5B, shown in red). This is in contrast to Ig-Ig interactions, such as the Cd2-Cd58 complex, where the interaction surface is on the opposite surface of the औ-sandwich and is composed of residues in strands g, f, c, and c′ (33Wang J. Smolyar A. Tan K.M. Liu J. Kim M.Y. Sun Z.J. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 791-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The residues involved in dimerization are generally hydrophobic, although some salt bridges are also found in the dimer interfaces. These hydrophobic residues are not conserved in Sec5 except where they are involved in packing (e.g. Ile-13). There is one notable exception, Val-61 in Sec5, which is not conserved in α-amylase and is equivalent to Val-313 in NF-κB. This side chain is exposed on the surface of the Sec5 even though it is hydrophobic. Despite this, it is not likely that Sec5 dimerizes via the IPT domain in a manner similar to the transcription factors; the correlation time of this domain, determined from the T1/T2 ratios of residues in secondary structure, is 5.9 ns (data not shown), which is consistent with a monomeric protein of this size.The Ral binding surface on the Sec5 IPT domain can be compared with the regions of the IPT domains involved in interactions with other molecules (Figs. 4 and 5B, shown in green). The α-amylase IPT domain uses the same face to contact other domains within the same protein (30Dauter Z. Dauter M. Brzozowski A.M. Christensen S. Borchert T.V. Beier L. Wilson K.S. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8385-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NF-κB and the other DNA-binding proteins use the same face both for contacting other IPT domains and for contacting other domains within the same protein (28Ghosh G. Vanduyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7078-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-binding residues in these IPT domains are close to the protein-protein interaction surface but only partially overlap. Interestingly, the other Ig-like domain that has been found to contact G proteins, that from Rho GDI, uses the opposite face to contact the Rho family proteins (Fig. 5B) (19Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is perhaps not surprising that this divergence in binding interfaces exists between the GDI and Sec5, because the GDI domain is quite different; it has several extra औ-strands, one of which is involved in G protein binding (Figs. 3 and 5B). In addition, the GDI domain, although it interacts with the G protein, makes the majority of its contacts with the geranyl-geranyl moiety that is covalently attached to the C terminus of the Rho family proteins.A number of G protein-effector complex structures have been solved and have shown that the way that proteins can contact G proteins varies significantly. In most G protein-effector complexes, the effector contacts switch I (the effector loop). The Sec5 domain also makes contacts with the effector loop, because mutation of Asp-49 of Ral abrogates its interaction with Sec5 (9Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In other G protein-effector complexes, the structural motifs that interact with the effector loop vary widely, so it is not possible to predict which region of Sec5 may be contacting this region of Ral.In several complexes, for example the Ras-effector complexes (18Nassar M. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 48Vetter I.R. Linnemann T. Wohlgemuth S. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R.

Biol. 1997; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the Cdc42-CRIB effector complexes (41Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E. Lim L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 50Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K.

Biol. 2000; 7: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), an intermolecular औ-sheet is observed, formed by an interaction between the औ2-strand of the G protein and a strand from the effector. In the case of Sec5, it is tempting to speculate that a similar intermolecular औ-sheet will be formed in this effector complex, because many of the residues implicated in binding to the Ral are within strands a, b, e, and g. If an intermolecular औ-sheet is formed in this complex, it must involve a औ-strand of the Sec5 IPT that is available to make hydrogen bonds. The औ-strand that fulfils this criterion and experiences chemical shift changes on Ral binding is strand d. If, however, this were involved in an intermolecular औ-sheet interaction, there would have to be some structural rearrangement of the Sec5 because there is not enough space between strand d and the single turn of helix in the b-c loop to insert part of the G protein there.The other Ral effector that has been studied in some detail is Ral BP1 or RLIP. The Ral-binding domain of this protein has been delineated and comprises residues 403–499 (15Jullienflores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although there is no structure available for this protein, secondary structure predictions show that RLIP is predominantly α-helix and that the Ral-binding domain partially overlaps a potential coiled-coil region. Thus, the interaction between Ral and RLIP is likely to be significantly different from that between Ral and Sec5. There are other G protein-effector complexes where the effector domain is predominantly α-helix, e.g. Rho-PKN (42Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Rac-Arfaptin (43Tarricone C. Xiao B. Justin N. Walker P.A. Rittinger K. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and Rab-Rabphilin (44Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), but the structures and interactions are highly variable.Although the IPT fold exists in most phyla, the IPT domain of Sec5 seems to appear with Ral in evolution. In S. cerevisiae andArabidopsis thaliana, where Ral does not exist, Sec5 lacks the IPT. In S. cerevisiae the exocyst components that bind to G proteins do not contain any regions with homology to the IPT domains, so it is possible that Ral is the only small GTPase controlling the exocyst that binds an IPT. The other Ral effector proteins, Ral BP1, filamin, and phospholipase D, do not contain an IPT domain. It remains to be seen whether other Ral effectors are isolated that use an IPT to mediate their interaction with Ral.Directed exocytosis is crucial to the regulation of several cellular processes. Central to the understanding of regulation of exocytosis is the role of small G proteins in recruitment of the components of the exocyst complex. We have solved the structure of the Ral-binding domain of the mammalian exocyst protein, Sec5. This is the first structure of a Ral effector domain and the first G protein effector that utilizes an IPT fold to contact the GTPase. We have shown that the Sec5 Ral-binding domain forms an IPT domain that is topologically closer to α-amylase than to the transcription factors such as NF-κB. Mapping of the Ral binding site in the Sec5 domain reveals that, within the family of IPT domains, a similar region is used for protein-protein interactions and that this region is not the same as that used for interacting with DNA. Comparison of the Ral-binding surface of Sec5 with the region of GDI that interacts with Rho family G proteins shows that the contacts between Sec5-Ral and GDI-Cdc42 are significantly different. A detailed analysis of the contacts that Sec5 makes with Ral awaits determination of the three-dimensional structure of the complex. The information presented here can be used to help design mutants that disrupt Ral-Sec5 interactions. Such mutants could be used to elucidate the role of the Sec5-Ral interaction in exocyst assembly at the plasma membrane. Spatial regulation of exocytosis is crucial for a variety of cellular processes, including embryogenesis, establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and neuronal growth cone formation (reviewed in Ref. 1Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The exocyst complex is involved in the final stage of exocytosis, when post-Golgi vesicles are targeted and dock to the plasma membrane. The exocyst consists of an assembly of eight proteins: Sec3, -5, -6, -8, -10, and 15, and Exo70 and -84, which form a complex localized to sites of vesicle docking to the plasma membrane during exocytosis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the exocyst directs vectorial targeting of secretory vesicles to sites of membrane expansion, such as bud sites. It appears that Sec3p, which is always localized to the plasma membrane, forms a targeting patch and is the spatial landmark for polarized exocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A subcomplex of Sec15p and Sec10p is localized to secretory vesicles (2Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and a network of protein-protein interactions among the exocyst components bridges Sec15p-Sec10p to the targeting patch made by Sec3p (3Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In mammals the exocyst is involved in the targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelia. The regulation of the exocyst seems to be somewhat different in higher eukaryotes, because Sec3 does not have the same role. Rather, in polarized epithelial cells, Exo70 is localized to the plasma membrane (4Matern H.T. Yeaman C. Nelson W.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas the other components of the exocyst remain cytosolic, implying that exocyst assembly at the membrane is dependent upon Exo70, rather than Sec3 as in yeast. Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, actin cytoskeleton, nuclear transport, and vesicle transport. Because many of these processes involve exocytosis, it was likely that small GTPases could play a role in exocyst regulation (5Novick P. Guo W. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 247-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In yeast, Sec4p, a homologue of Rab3A GTPase, anchors Sec15p to secretory vesicles (2Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The exocyst is anchored to the plasma membrane via the interaction of Sec3p with another GTPase, Rho1p (6Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Sec3p has also been shown to bind to Cdc42, another member of the Rho family (7Zhang X.Y. Bi E.F. Novick P. Du L.L. Kozminski K.G. Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46745-46750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, it was shown that Exo70p interacts with Rho3p at the plasma membrane (8Robinson N.C.G. Guo L. Imai J. Toh-E A. Matsui Y. Tamanoi F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the Rho family GTPases, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton, in exocyst regulation implies a coordination of cytoskeletal changes with exocytosis. In mammalian cells, the exocyst components do not seem to interact with Rab3A or Rho family members. Rather, it was recently shown that the exocyst is regulated by yet another GTPase, RalA (9Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Sugihara K. Asano S. Tanaka K. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Ohta Y. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ral is a Ras family small G protein that is not present in S. cerevisiae. Both activated Ral and Ral inhibition disrupt polarized exocytosis in epithelial cells, suggesting it is necessary for the GTPase to cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms to direct vesicle movement. Ral, like Rab3A, is localized to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane, but the exocyst component responsible for interacting with RalA was found to be Sec5. In yeast, Sec5p is at the center of the exocyst complex, linking the Sec10p-Sec15p subcomplex to the rest of the exocyst via its interactions with Exo70p, Sec3p, and Sec6p (3Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, Sec5 may have a different role in the mammalian exocyst. Ral small GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins implicated in oncogenesis, endocytosis, actin dynamics, and membrane trafficking. Downstream effector proteins identified for Ral include Ral BP11 (or RLIP-76), which mediates the effects of Ral on endocytosis (13Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B.

https://openalex.org/W2169165493,"CD229 (Ly9) is a cell surface receptor selectively expressed on T and B lymphocytes, and it belongs to the CD150 receptor family. Like other receptors of this family, CD229 interacts with SAP/SH2D1a protein, mutation of which is responsible for the fatal X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. Receptors of the CD150 family function as costimulatory molecules, regulating cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Thus, their signaling and regulation in lymphocytes may be critical to an understanding of the pathogenesis of the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. Here we show that CD229 interacts with the 2 chain of the AP-2 adaptor complex that links transmembrane proteins to clathrin-coated pits. CD229 was the only member of the CD150 family associated with AP-2. We also show that the 2 chain interacts with the Y470EKL motif of CD229. The integrity of this site was necessary for CD229 internalization, but it was not involved in SAP recruitment. Moreover, CD229 binds to the AP-2 complex in T and B cell lines, and it is internalized rapidly from the cell surface on T cells after antibody ligation. In contrast, cross-linking of CD229 receptors with intact antibody inhibited CD229 internalization on B cells. However, when F(ab′)2antibodies were used, CD229 internalization was similar on T and B cells, suggesting that Fcγ receptors control CD229 cell surface expression. Furthermore, CD229 was regulated by T cell receptor and B cell receptor signaling because coligation with antibodies against anti-CD3 and anti-IgM increased the rate of CD229 endocytosis. These data suggest that CD229 cell surface expression on lymphocytes surface is strongly and differentially regulated within the CD150 family members."

More than 100 different pathogenic mutations have so far been reported, 587 of which reside in tRNA genes (1Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg.

Functional analysis of mt tRNAs with such mutations will thus be necessary to clarify the molecular pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases. If a mutation does not affect replication of mtDNA or transcription of the corresponding mt tRNA, its deleterious effect in the mt tRNA gene can be assigned to the post-transcriptional level, including maturation, modification, folding, stability, aminoacylation, association with translation factors, and/or various functions on the ribosome.

Suzuki T. Ishii N. Ohta S. Watanabe K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4794-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), strongly implicating deficient decoding arising from the modification defect as one of the main causes of the mitochondrial dysfunction, and representing the first known case of a human disease apparently resulting from the loss of a post-transcriptional modification. CCA-addition at the 3′ terminus of tRNA is one of the essential steps for tRNA maturation in mitochondria. In human mitochondrial DNA, the CCA sequence of tRNAs is not encoded in the tRNA genes but is post-transcriptionally synthesized by ATP (CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme). We recently cloned and characterized the human mt CCA-adding enzyme, and we showed that it efficiently recognizes mt tRNAs with unusual structures (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Bacterial and yeast CCA-adding enzymes have been shown to recognize the elbow region of tRNA formed by D- and T-loop interaction (9Spacciapoli P. Doviken L. Mulero J.J. Thurlow D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spacciapoli P. Thurlow D.L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11Li Z. Gillis K.A. Hegg L.A. Zhang J. Thurlow D.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, human mt tRNAs have no consensus sequence in either the D- or T-loop. Although the tRNA recognition mechanism of the human mt CCA-adding enzyme is now under investigation, the T-arm has been found to be important for efficient CCA-addition (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We report here in vitro evidence that two pathogenic mitochondrial point mutations significantly inhibit CCA-addition to the corresponding tRNAs. The first mutation, A4317G in the mt tRNAIle gene, was described to be associated with severe cardiomyopathy in a 1-year-old infant who died from cardiac failure (12Tanaka M. Ino H. Ohno K. Hattori K. Sato W. Ozawa T. Tanaka T. Itoyama S. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1452Abstract PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The other, A10044G in the mt tRNAGly gene, was reported in several siblings of one family and appeared to be associated with sudden unexpected death (13Santorelli F.M. Schlessel J.S. Slonim A.E. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Neurol. 1996; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although little is known of the molecular pathogenesis of these two point mutations, because they occur at similar positions in the respective T-loops of mt tRNAIle and tRNAGly, we speculated that they could modulate CCA-adding activity during the tRNA maturation. A kinetic analysis of CCA-addition and a structural investigation of the mutant tRNAs indicated the involvement of these pathogenic point mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases. [α-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and [5′-32P]pCp (111 TBq/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nuclease S1 and T4 RNA ligase were purchased from Takara Bio Inc., RNase V1 was from Ambion Inc., and RNase U2 was from Sigma. Template plasmids for in vitro transcription of human mt tRNAs for Ile and Gly were constructed with synthetic DNAs. DNA fragments containing the class III promoter of T7 RNA polymerase directly connected upstream of human mt tRNAIle or mt tRNAGly gene were synthesized by Klenow enzyme using two overlapping primers. The A1-U72 base pair of both tRNAs was replaced with G1-C72 to promote the efficiency of transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The following DNA primers were used: mtIle1, AAAAGGGGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATATGTCTGATAAAAGAGTTACTTTGATAGA; mtIle2, AAAAGGGGAAGCTTTGGAAATAAGGGGGTTTAAGCTCCTATATTTACTCTATCAAAGTAACTCTTT; mtGly1, AAAAGGGGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGCTCTTTTAGTATAAATAGTACGTTAACTTCCAA; mtGly2, AAAAGGGGAAGCTTTGCTCTTTTTTGAATGTTGTCAAAACTAGTTAATTGGAAGTTAACGGTACTA. The synthetic DNA fragments were cloned into theEcoRI/HindIII sites of pUC18 and sequenced. The DNA fragments were amplified from the cloned plasmid to be used as templates for T7 transcription by PCR with the following primer sets: GGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACATAGGAAAT (T7-Ile) and TGGAAATAAGGGGGTTTAAGC for the wild type tRNAIle-D; T7-Ile and GTGGAAATAAGGGGGTTTAAGC for the wild type tRNAIle-DC; T7-Ile and GGTGGAAATAAGGGGGTTTAAGC for the wild type tRNAIle-DCC; T7-Ile and TGGAAATAAGGGGGCTTAAGC for the A4317G tRNAIle-D; T7-Ile and GTGGAAATAAGGGGGCTTAAGC for the A4317G tRNAIle-DC; T7-Ile and GGTGGAAATAAGGGGGCTTAAGC for the A4317G tRNAIle-DCC; GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGC (T7-Gly) and TGCTCTTTTTTGAATGTTGTCAAAA for the wild type tRNAGly-D; T7-Gly and GTGCTCTTTTTTGAATGTTGTCAAAA for the wild type tRNAGly-DC; T7-Gly and GGTGCTCTTTTTTGAATGTTGTCAAAA for the wild type tRNAGly-DCC; T7-Gly and TGCTCTTTTTTGAACGTTGTCAAAAACTAGT for the A10044G tRNAGly-D; T7-Gly and GTGCTCTTTTTTGAACGTTGTCAAAAACTAGT for the A10044G tRNAGly-DC; T7-Gly and GGTGCTCTTTTTTGAACGTTGTCAAAAACTAGT for the A10044G tRNAGly-DCC. In vitrorun-off transcription was performed according to the literature (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). All transcripts obtained were purified by denaturing 127 polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Human mt CCA-adding enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out as described previously (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 10-ॖl reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CTP, and/or ATP, 0.033 ॖm [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP, 1 ॖm substrate tRNA, and 10 ng of purified recombinant CCA-adding enzyme. Reaction products were resolved by denaturing 107 PAGE, and the radioactivity of the labeled bands was measured using an image analyzer (BAS-5000; Fuji Photo Film). The 10-ॖl reaction mixtures for C-addition or A-addition contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 ng of CCA-adding enzyme, 0.5 mm CTP or ATP, 0.033 ॖm [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP, and 1–12 ॖm tRNA-DC or tRNA-DCC. After incubation for 5 min while the nucleotide incorporation rate was constant, reactions were stopped by adding 8 murea. Mixtures were loaded onto denaturing 107 PAGE, and the gel was exposed to an imaging plate along with the standard dilution series of [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP electrophoresed on another gel. The amount of nucleotide incorporated was calculated by comparing the radioactivities of labeled tRNA with those of nucleotide standards. The initial velocities of nucleotide incorporation were then utilized in Lineweaver-Burk plots to determine the kinetic parameters. The tRNAs were labeled at the 3′ terminus with [5′-32P]pCp by T4 RNA ligase and then purified by denaturing PAGE. Limited digestion under denaturing condition by alkaline, RNase T1, and RNase U2 was performed according to the method of Donis-Keller (15Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) to verify the sequence of tRNAs. Limited digestion under non-denaturing condition by nucleases S1, V1, and U2 was carried out at 25 °C for 5 min in 50 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, and 100A260 units/ml of a yeast tRNA mixture. For the digestion with nuclease S1, 1 mm ZnSO4 was added. The enzyme concentrations were 0.04, 0.2, and 0.4 units/ॖl nuclease S1; 4 × 10−3, 8 × 10−3, and 1.6 × 10−2 units/ॖl RNase V1; and 8 × 10−4, 4 × 10−3, and 8 × 10−3 units/ॖl RNase U2. Reactions were stopped by adding 8 m urea and quenching in liquid nitrogen. Mixtures were then loaded onto 50-cm-long denaturing 157 polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 107 glycerol. The gels were exposed to an imaging plate and analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer (FLA3000; Fuji Photo Film). Short RNA fragments containing the T-arm region of the wild type and A4317G tRNAIle were transcribed in vitro (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) using the following DNA fragments as templates, and were purified with super-denaturing PAGE (157 polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, 307 formamide, 1× TBE). The fragments used are as follows: wild type, TAGAAATAAGGGGGTTTAAGCTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGAATAATACGACTCACTATAGG; A4317G, TAGAAATAAGGGGGCTTAAGCTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGAATAATACGACTCACTATAGG. The RNA fragments were then electrophoresed under a super-denaturing condition (157 polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, 307 formamide, 1× TBE) after denaturation in a super-denaturing buffer (507 formamide, 1× TBE) at 65 °C for 15 min, the regular denaturing condition (157 polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, 1× TBE) after being mixed with a denaturing buffer (7 m urea, 1× TBE), and a non-denaturing condition (157 polyacrylamide, 1× TBE) without denaturation. Melting profiles were measured by a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer using 0.1 or 0.2A260 units of RNA samples in 400 ॖl of a buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 mm NaCl as described previously (16Yasukawa T. Hino N. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Ohta S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found previously (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that the human mt CCA-adding enzyme requires the T-arm region of mt tRNAs for efficient CCA-addition, prompting us to hypothesize that some mitochondrial diseases associated with pathogenic point mutations in tRNA genes may result from an absence or an inefficiency of CCA-addition to mt tRNA during maturation. Because two pathogenic point mutations, A4317G and A10044G, were found at similar positions in the respective T-loop of mt tRNAIle and mt tRNAGly, we focused our attention on evaluating these mutations (Fig.1). To examine the effects of the mutations, we prepared wild type and mutant tRNAs without the 3′-terminal CCA sequence (tRNA-D) by in vitro transcription, and we evaluated their capability of incorporating CCA catalyzed by the recombinant human mt CCA-adding enzyme (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2a, in vitro-transcribed wild type mt tRNAs for Ile and Gly were repaired by the human mt CCA-adding enzyme as efficiently as canonical yeast tRNAPhe. In contrast, both mutants exhibited significantly lower levels of CCA incorporation, with remarkable reduction in the case of the A4317G mt tRNAIle mutation (Fig.2a). Because the CCA-adding reaction consists of C-addition and A-addition, we prepared wild type and mutant tRNAs without the 3′-terminal CA sequence (tRNA-DC) and 3′-terminal A (tRNA-DCC), and we investigated the efficiency of C-addition to tRNA-DC and A-addition to tRNA-DCC. Both C- and A-addition to mutant tRNAs were reduced (Fig.2b), not as remarkably as the entire CCA-addition (Fig.2a), suggesting that the reduced reaction at each step of C- and A-addition results accumulatively in significant decrease of whole CCA-addition (Fig. 2a). The kinetic parameters of C-addition to tRNAs-DC and A-addition to tRNAs-DCC for wild type and mutant tRNAs were determined as shown in Table I. The kcatvalues for both mutant tRNAs were severely reduced, whereasKm values were slightly affected in either C- or A-adding step. This observation suggests that these two mutations inhibit both C- and A-adding steps by mainly hindering the catalytic process without affecting the substrate recognition.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant tRNAs for C-addition and A-additiontRNAIleSubstrateKmkcatkcat(relative)ॖms−1tRNA-DC + CTP* Wild type6.271.19100 A4317G6.170.36330.5tRNA-DCC + ATP* Wild type14.30.403100 A4317G8.730.07318.1tRNAGlySubstrateKmkcatkcat(relative)ॖms−1tRNA-DC + CTP* Wild type14.71.54100 A10044G9.960.45129.3tRNA-DCC + ATP* Wild type8.910.112100 A10044G9.620.04035.7 Open table in a new tab Suspecting that the reduction in thekcat value might arise from structural alterations caused by the pathogenic point mutation, we carried out nuclease probing by using double-stranded specific RNase V1 and single-stranded specific cleavages by nuclease S1 and RNase U2, and we compared the cleavage profiles with those of the wild type. The nuclease cleavage pattern in Fig.3a indicates that although the A4317G mutant appears to retain the global secondary structure of the wild type mt tRNAIle, some significant differences are evident in the T-arm region. C54 and C62 of the A4317G mutant became sensitive to double-stranded specific RNase V1 on the 5′ side, whereas the 5′ side of A49 exhibited high resistibility to this nuclease (Fig.3b). This finding suggests structural rearrangement of the T-arm region caused by the A4317G mutation, as was predicted by Tanakaet al. (12Tanaka M. Ino H. Ohno K. Hattori K. Sato W. Ozawa T. Tanaka T. Itoyama S. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1452Abstract PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) when they first reported the mutation. They proposed the T-stem “slippage” model as shown in theinset of Fig. 3b, in which the T-arm has a stem of 6 bp with two A-C mismatches and a 4-base loop. The RNase V1 cleavages at C54 and C62 in mutant tRNA are likely to result from two Watson-Crick base pairs, G53-C60 and C54-G59. An absence of cleavage at A49 can be explained by the A49-C64 mismatch. In addition, the 5′ side of U56 of the mutant was less sensitive to RNase V1 cleavage than that of the wild type. Because the base pairs between T-loop and D-loop are known to accommodate cleavage sites for RNase V1 (17Lockard R.E. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5125-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), tertiary interaction between the T- and D-loops involving U56 is assumed to be impaired by the structural rearrangement. The structural rearrangement by the A4317G mutation is supported by the abnormal migration of RNA fragments containing the T-arm region on the alkaline ladder (Fig. 3a). The 3′ part of the RNA fragment cleaved at the 3′ side of A49 of the mutant tRNA migrates faster than the corresponding fragment of the wild type, whereas normal migration of a one-nucleotide-short RNA fragment (cleaved at the 3′ side of G50) is observed. This extraordinary mobility of the RNA fragment of the mutant tRNA, despite the electrophoresis of the denaturing gel at 55 °C, suggests the formation of aberrantly stable secondary structure in the T-arm region caused by the A4317G mutation. Similar faster migration is observed in the cases of RNA fragments corresponding to positions 45–48, indicating that the stable secondary structure of the T-arm region is retained in the whole tRNA molecule with the A4317G mutation. To characterize the structural rearrangement resulting from the A4317G mutation, the 3′ parts of RNA fragments from G50 to A73 with or without the mutation were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (Fig.4a). Fig. 4b shows that the RNA fragment with the A4317G mutation migrated faster than the wild type in gels under the non-denaturing or regular denaturing condition (as in Fig. 3a), whereas no discernible difference in the mobility was observed in the super-denaturing gel (see “Materials and Methods” for details of each condition). Faster migration in the gel is indicative of a stable, compact structure of the RNA fragment with the A4317G mutation. The melting profiles of the wild type and mutant fragments are plotted in Fig. 5a. Only the mutant fragment exhibits an evident melting curve with higherTm values, verifying its stable secondary structure. This also explains the fact that the Tm value of mt tRNAIle with the A4317G mutation (59 °C) was higher than that of the wild type mt tRNAIle (57.5 °C) (Fig.5b). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the strong inhibition of CCA-addition to the mt tRNAIle A4317G mutant is caused by the structural rearrangement of the T-arm region induced by the mutation. Considering that position 10044 in the secondary structure of mt tRNAGly is identical to that of 4317 in mt tRNAIle (Fig. 1b), the tertiary structure of the mt tRNAGly A10044G mutant was also evaluated by nuclease probing (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, strong cleavages were observed at both the 5′ and 3′ sides of A55/A56 in the T-loop of the mutant tRNA by nuclease S1 and RNase U2, respectively. In addition, residues in the D-loop show slightly higher sensitivity to nuclease S1, with decreased accessibility at the 5′ side of U20/A21 by RNase V1. These results suggest that tertiary interaction between the T- and D-loops is weakened by the A10044G mutation, whereas the global secondary structure is conserved. In the initial step of mammalian mitochondrial tRNA maturation process, the 5′ end leader and 3′ end trailer are removed by RNase P and 3′-tRNase, respectively, followed by the addition of 3′ CCA terminus by the CCA-adding enzyme (18Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisa E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12885-12891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Reichert A.S. Morl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is possible to consider that some pathogenic mutations may have deleterious effect on the tRNA maturation step. Here we have shown that both the A4317G and A10044G mutations in mt tRNAs significantly inhibit the CCA-addition by the human mt CCA-adding enzyme. Both C- and A-addition were inhibited by these mutations, not as remarkably as the entire CCA-addition, suggesting that the reduced reaction at two C-adding steps and one A-adding step results accumulatively in significant decrease of whole CCA-addition. The CCA sequence of mt tRNAs is not encoded in the tRNA genes but is post-transcriptionally synthesized by mt CCA-adding enzyme. Immature tRNAs without complete CCA sequence cannot be aminoacylated nor protected by elongation factors, resulting in their instability in mitochondria. Thus, the significant decrease of entire CCA-addition by A4317G and A10044G mutations (Fig. 2a) might be a direct cause for mitochondrial dysfunction. The A4317G mutation in mt tRNAIle induced a structural rearrangement of the T-arm region, whereas the A10044G mutation in mt tRNAGly weakened the T-loop/D-loop interaction. It has been considered that the CCA-adding enzyme recognizes the elbow region of tRNA formed by the D- and T-loops (9Spacciapoli P. Doviken L. Mulero J.J. Thurlow D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spacciapoli P. Thurlow D.L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Hegg L.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and we showed previously (8Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that the mt CCA-adding enzyme has a lower substrate specificity than the E. coli enzyme, presumably to enable it to recognize mt tRNAs with unusual structures. Our finding that both the A4317G and A10044G mutations in human mt tRNAs had a small effect on the Km values for C- and A-addition indicates that these mutations do not inhibit recognition of the tRNA elbow region by the mt CCA-adding enzyme. Thus, the decreases observed in thekcat values might result from an inappropriate positioning of the tRNA substrate in the enzyme during the catalytic process. The sequences of the T- and D-loops are highly conserved in cytoplasmic tRNAs, but mammalian mt tRNAs have unusual structures without consensus sequences in either of the loops (22Helm M. Brule H. Friede D. Giege R. Putz D. Florentz C. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Hence, it is difficult to predict the conformational influence of a single mutation in mt tRNAs because of their abnormality. When Tanaka et al. (12Tanaka M. Ino H. Ohno K. Hattori K. Sato W. Ozawa T. Tanaka T. Itoyama S. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1452Abstract PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) first reported the A4317G mutation in mt tRNAIle, they deduced that it would cause structural rearrangement of the T-arm region (Fig. 3b). Our findings based on nuclease probing and RNA fragment analysis have clearly demonstrated their proposed structural rearrangement. We previously analyzed another pathogenic point mutation (A4269G in mt tRNAIle associated with fatal cardiomyopathy) and found that this mutation destabilizes the whole tRNA structure with a lower Tm, which explains the rapid decay of the A4269G mutant tRNA observed in cybrid cells (16Yasukawa T. Hino N. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Ohta S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the A4317G mutation stabilizes tRNA by forming an aberrantly stable secondary structure in the T-arm region, thereby increasing itsTm value. It is plausible that this structural rearrangement affects various steps in the tRNA maturation process, including CCA-addition. In the case of the A10044G mutation in mt tRNAGly, such structural rearrangement was not observed, but instead a weakened interaction between the T- and D-loops was suggested. In mitochondria, high sensitivity to nucleases in either the T- or D-loop can lead to instability of the tRNA. The A4317G mutation was reported to decrease significantly isoleucylation (23Kelley S.O. Steinberg S.V. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10607-10611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Degoul F. Brule H. Cepanec C. Helm M. Marsac C. Leroux J. Giege R. Florentz C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be assumed that the pathogenic A4317G mutation at least causes defects in both CCA-addition and the following aminoacylation. In addition, because certain mutations in the T-loop were demonstrated to decrease the tRNA processing activity of Drosophila RNase P and 3′-tRNase (25Levinger L. Bourne R. Kolla S. Cylin E. Russell K. Wang X. Mohan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that both the A4317G and A10044G mutations also affect the 5′- and 3′-processing of tRNA. We cannot define which step in tRNA maturation process is the most damaged in vivo, because neither of the cell lines carrying these mutations is available at the present time. 2M. Tanaka, personal communication. Even if the 5′- and 3′-processing proceeds inefficiently by these mutations, the following CCA-addition and aminoacylation are still considered to be crucial steps for tRNA function. Our findings presented here indicate the probability that the CCA-addition disorder of the pathogenic A4317G and A10044G mutants is involved in mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, they suggest an approach to understanding the mechanism of tRNA recognition by the mt CCA-adding enzyme, which is currently under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2025501596,"We have previously demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) induces eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) activation in neuronal cells through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathway as well as by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathway (Quevedo, C., Alcázar, A., and Salinas, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 19192–19197). This paper addresses the mechanism involved in IGF1-induced eIF2B activation via the MEK/MAPK cascade in cultured neurons treated with IGF1 and demonstrates that extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and -2) immunoprecipitates of IGF1-treated neuronal cells promote this activation. This effect did not directly result from eIF2B phosphorylation by ERK immunoprecipitates. In addition, recombinant ERK1 and -2 neither activate eIF2B nor phosphorylate it. Endogenous protein phosphatase 1 and 2A catalytic subunits (PP1C and PP2AC, respectively) were co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1 and -2, and the association of ERK with PP1C was stimulated by IGF1 treatment, resulting in increased PP1 activity. ERK immunoprecipitates incubated with PP1 inhibitors did not activate eIF2B, indicating that PP1C activates eIF2B. In vitro experiments with phosphorylated eIF2B showed that recombinant PP1C (α isoform) dephosphorylates and activates eIF2B. Paralleling eIF2B activation, IGF1 treatment induced PP1 activation in a MEK/MAPK-dependent fashion. Moreover, the treatment of neurons with the PP1 inhibitor tautomycin inhibited PP1 activation and prevented IGF1-induced eIF2B activation. These findings strongly suggest that IGF1-induced eIF2B activation in neurons is effected by PP1, the activation of which is mediated by the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway. We have previously demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) induces eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) activation in neuronal cells through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathway as well as by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling pathway (Quevedo, C., Alcázar, A., and Salinas, M.

Endogenous protein phosphatase 1 and 2A catalytic subunits (PP1C and PP2AC, respectively) were co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1 and -2, and the association of ERK with PP1C was stimulated by IGF1 treatment, resulting in increased PP1 activity. ERK immunoprecipitates incubated with PP1 inhibitors did not activate eIF2B, indicating that PP1C activates eIF2B. In vitro experiments with phosphorylated eIF2B showed that recombinant PP1C (α isoform) dephosphorylates and activates eIF2B. Paralleling eIF2B activation, IGF1 treatment induced PP1 activation in a MEK/MAPK-dependent fashion. Moreover, the treatment of neurons with the PP1 inhibitor tautomycin inhibited PP1 activation and prevented IGF1-induced eIF2B activation. These findings strongly suggest that IGF1-induced eIF2B activation in neurons is effected by PP1, the activation of which is mediated by the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway. eukaryotic initiation factor 2 casein kinase 1 and 2 α subunit of eIF2 eukaryotic initiation factor 2B ε subunit of eIF2B extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor 2 insulin-like growth factor 1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase MAPK/ERK-activating kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein phosphatase 1 PP1 catalytic subunit PP1C α isoform PP1C γ isoform protein phosphatase 2A PP2A catalytic subunit radioimmune precipitation assay buffer The pathway through which growth factors promote their effects in protein synthesis is not fully understood at least in neurons of the central nervous system. Protein synthesis is activated in different cell types by a variety of growth factors essential to cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Translational control starts at the level of initiation (1Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational control.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and depends on eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).1This binds to GTP and interacts with the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) to form the ternary complex eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi. In this way, eIF2 factor recruits Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. This together with other initiation factors binds to mRNA, leading to the recognition of the AUG start codon (3Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 5Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Upon formation of the 80 S initiation complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and eIF2 is released from the ribosome as a functionally inactive binary complex (eIF2·GDP). Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a heteropentameric protein that catalyzes the exchange of bound GDP from eIF2·GDP for GTP (4Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 6Manchester K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7Williams D.D.

The eIF2·GTP form is then available to undergo further interaction with Met-tRNAi, leading to a new round of initiation. eIF2B activity therefore plays a key role in regulating translation initiation. elF2B factor can be mainly regulated by two mechanisms. First, elF2 phosphorylation of the α subunit (eIF2α) inhibits eIF2B because phosphorylated eIF2α is a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B (8Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, eIF2B activity can be regulated by phosphorylation of its ε subunit. Four kinases have been described to phosphorylate the ε subunit of eIF2B (eIF2Bε); they are casein kinase (CK) 1 and 2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase (10Dholakia J.N.

The phosphorylation by GSK3 requires previous elF2Bε phosphorylation, which is catalyzed in vitro by dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase (13Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goedert M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The translational inhibition caused by eIF2B inhibition through eIF2α phosphorylation is a well known cellular mechanism that triggers in response to different stress situations (18Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Traslational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 19Paschen W. Doutheil J. J. Cereb.

However, in growth factor-treated cells and in response to other different treatments, changes in eIF2B activity independent of eIF2α phosphorylation have been described in vivo (21Welsh G.I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19192-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IGF1 exerts its action by activating multiple signal transduction pathways, notably the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activating kinase (MEK)/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathways (28Cross D.A.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9847-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, we previously showed that elF2B activation by IGF1 depends on both GSK3 inactivation, via a mechanism mediated by PI3K, and MAPK activation (32Welsh G.I. Stokes C.M. Wang X. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The link between IGF1-induced GSK3 inactivation and PI3K activity is provided by protein kinase B, which is located downstream of PI3K and phosphorylates GSK3 at a conserved serine inhibitory site (33Van Weeren P.C. De Bruyn K.M.T. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Van Lint J. Burgering B.M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 34Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the signaling pathway or the mechanism through which IGF1-induced MAPK activation leads to eIF2B activation remains unknown. The phosphorylation status of proteins depends on the relative activities of both kinases and phosphatases. However, the possible role of protein phosphatases in eIF2B regulation has not been established. Protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) are two major and structurally related families of serine/threonine phosphatases that regulate a large number of cellular processes, including neuronal signaling (35Price N.E. Mumby M.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The regulation of PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits by extracellular signals seems to be mediated mainly by association with non-catalytic regulatory subunits which inhibit, modulate, or target catalytic subunits to various subcellular structures and substrates (36Cohen P.T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to investigate the mechanism of eIF2B regulation by IGF1-induced MAPK activation in cultured neurons. By studying extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, MAP kinases, and PP1, a novel transduction pathway leading to eIF2B activation in neurons was discovered. Evidence is provided that IGF1-induced eIF2B activation, promoted via MAPK signaling, is exerted by PP1 activation. IGF1, inhibitor 2 (I2), tautomycin, purified recombinant PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) α isoform (PP1Cα), anti-ERK1 and -2 polyclonal antibody, and anti-diphospho-ERK1 and -2 (Thr183 and Tyr185 in ERK2) (the active forms of the kinases) monoclonal antibodies were provided by Sigma. Purified recombinant PP1Cγ, 4E-BP1, and fostriecin were from Calbiochem, purified recombinant ERK1 and GSK3औ and anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and purified recombinant ERK2 and anti-phospho-GSK3α/औ(Ser21/Ser9) (the inactive form of the kinases) polyclonal antibodies were provided by New England Biolabs. PD98059 was obtained from Biomol, LY294002 was from Alexis, anti-ERK2 and anti-eIF2α polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-PP1C and anti-GSK3औ monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Leibovitz L-15, Ham's F-12 and high glucose Dulbecco's media were purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]GDP and [γ-32P]ATP were supplied byAmersham Biosciences, and synthetic peptides were supplied by Mimotopes. eIF2 and eIF2B were purified from calf brain (38Alcázar A. Martı́n M.E. Soria E. Rodrı́guez S., L.- Fando J. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of cells from cerebral cortex were prepared from 16 day-old fetuses removed from timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. The fetuses were placed in Leibovitz L-15 medium for brain dissection. The cerebral cortex was separated from the rest of the brain using iridectomy scissors, and the meningeal membranes were carefully removed. The resulting pieces were then dissociated using a Pasteur pipette and 20–21-gauge needles to make a homogeneous cell suspension. Trypan blue exclusion was used to count the living cells. Neurons were seeded on plastic multidishes precoated with 0.05 mg/ml poly-d-lysine at a density of 2–2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultured at 37 °C with 7.57 CO2 in air in high glucose Dulbecco's medium with 157 fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cultures were placed and maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v, D:F medium) supplemented with 1.8 mg/ml glucose, 100 ॖg/ml transferrin, 100 ॖm putrescine, 20 nmprogesterone, and 30 nm sodium selenite. Six- to 7-day-old cultured neurons were used in all experiments. The neuronal content, as determined by immunocytochemistry with antibodies to neuron-specific protein औ-tubulin isotype III, was found to be more than 907. Cells were maintained in D:F medium without supplements for 16 h before treatments and then placed in the same medium in the absence or presence of additives. When inhibitors were used, cells were treated with them for 1 h (or 2 h in the case of tautomycin) before and during IGF1 treatment. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before harvesting. Both untreated and treated cells cultured on 35-mm multidishes were lysed for 10 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin and antipain, 2 mmऔ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium molybdate, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysate was made up to 4 mm magnesium acetate and 140 mm potassium acetate, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and saved as cell extract. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. A binary complex, eIF2·[3H]GDP, was formed as described (17Quevedo C. Alcázar A. Salinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19192-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The eIF2B activity of purified eIF2B (0.1–0.35 ॖg) and of cell extracts (40 ॖg of protein) were measured by the capacity to exchange eIF2-bound [3H]GDP for free GDP during 3- or 5-min incubations, respectively (17Quevedo C. Alcázar A. Salinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19192-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The substrate used was 1 pmol of eIF2·[3H]GDP. eIF2B activity was expressed as a percentage of pmol of [3H]GDP released from the binary complex with respect to controls. Cell extracts (500 or 75 ॖg) from both untreated and IGF1-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with either 5 ॖl of anti-ERK2 antibody or 3 ॖl of anti-diphospho-ERK1 and -2 antibody, respectively, and with 25 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose, respectively (Amersham Biosciences) following previously described procedures (39Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the eIF2Bε phosphorylation assay, ERK immunoprecipitates obtained with the two different antibodies were washed and centrifuged for 5 min at 2300 ×g 3 times in buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated in 40 ॖl of buffer A with purified eIF2B (3 ॖg), 30 ॖm ATP, and 7 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C, a 25-ॖl aliquot was taken, and the reaction was stopped with 12.5 ॖl of SDS sample buffer. It was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was stained and exposed to film, and the 32P was incorporated into the eIF2Bε protein quantified using an image analyzer (DiversityOne, Bio-Rad). To measure eIF2B activity, ERK immunoprecipitates were incubated with eIF2B (0.5–1 ॖg) as described above for the phosphorylation assay but in the absence of radioactive ATP. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and an aliquot of the supernatant (corresponding to 0.1–0.35 ॖg of eIF2B) was taken for eIF2B activity analysis. In some cases, the immunoprecipitates were preincubated with 200 nm I2 or 20 nm tautomycin for 12 min before incubation with eIF2B. In other experiments purified recombinant ERK1 and ERK2 (3 and 10 units, respectively) instead of ERK immunoprecipitates from cell extracts were used to phosphorylate eIF2Bε, and eIF2B activity was assayed following the same protocol as above. As a positive control of ERK activity, ERK immunoprecipitates as well as purified ERK1 and -2 were incubated with 4E-BP1 (3 ॖg), a known substrate for these MAPKs in vitro, under the same conditions described for eIF2B phosphorylation. 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was quantified using the image analyzer as for the assessment of ERK activity. To detect the presence of protein phosphatases that co-immunoprecipitate with ERK1 and -2, both ERK2 and diphospho-ERK1 and -2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The membranes were developed with antibodies against diphosphorylated ERK1 and -2, ERK1 and -2, PP1C, and PP2AC proteins. In other experiments, diphospho-ERK1 and -2 immunoprecipitates (from 75 ॖg cell extracts) were washed either with 0.4 m potassium acetate in buffer A, 17 (v/v) Triton X-100 in buffer A, or RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm KCl, 17 Triton X-100, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, and 0.17 SDS). After centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed again three times with buffer A, incubated with purified eIF2B, and eIF2B activity was assessed as described above. PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity was determined according to the method of Cohenet al. (40Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y.L. Method Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) using purified 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as the substrate. 32P-Labeled phosphorylase a was prepared by incubating phosphorylaseb (10 mg/ml) with phosphorylase kinase (0.2 mg/ml) as previously described (41Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts (0.5 ॖg) prepared as described for eIF2B activity assessment in hypotonic buffer but in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors were preincubated for 12 min at 30 °C without and with I2 or fostriecin in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA in a volume of 30 ॖl. The phosphatase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ॖl of 32P-labeled phosphorylasea (60,000 cpm). After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 180 ॖl of 207 (wt/v) trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were left on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (180 ॖl) of the clear supernatant were counted to determine the phosphatase activity as the amount of 32P released. Phosphorylase a is a substrate for both PP1 and PP2A. Therefore, to differentiate between these two protein phosphatases, assays were performed in the presence of either I2 or fostriecin, specific inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A, respectively. The doses of PP1 and PP2 inhibitors used were predetermined by a set of dose-response experiments in which the effect of each inhibitor was independently measured. The PP1 activity inhibited by I2 (100–500 nm) was comparable with the activity remaining in the presence of the PP2A inhibitor fostriecin (400–1000 nm). Thus, the sum of the PP1 and PP2A activities represents the total phosphorylase aphosphatase activity of the cell extracts. Accordingly, a concentration of 200 nm I2 was chosen to assess phosphatase activity in further experiments. PP1 activity was defined as the phosphorylasea phosphatase activity inhibited by I2. PP2A activity was defined as the remaining activity. PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activities were also assayed in ERK immunoprecipitates from 35 ॖg of cell extracts. PP1Cα and PP1Cγ phosphatase activities were assayed using the peptide RRAAEELDSRAGS(P)PQL based on eIF2Bε531–542 rat sequence (42Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) phosphorylated by GSK3औ. Purified GSK3औ (100 milliunits) was immunoprecipitated with 2 ॖl of anti-GSK3औ and 25 ॖl of protein G-Sepharose as described elsewhere (39Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GSK3औ immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 15 ॖg of eIF2Bε peptide in 55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.5 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a volume of 25 ॖl. The radioactivity incorporated into the peptide was determined by liquid scintillation.32P-Labeled peptide (12,000 cpm) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with PP1Cα (1.16 units/ॖg) or PP1Cγ (2.0 units/ॖg) in 25 ॖl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 ॖmMnCl2 (only for the PP1Cα assay). After incubation, samples were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and rinsed three times with 37 (v/v) phosphoric acid, and phosphatase activity was counted. In other experiments purified eIF2B factor (3 ॖg) was phosphorylated with GSK3औ immunoprecipitates using 30 ॖm ATP and 4.5 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. An aliquot of32P-labeled eIF2B (1.35 ॖg) was then used instead of the peptide in the PP1Cα activity assay. The reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 ॖl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To study the effect of recombinant PP1C on eIF2B activity, purified eIF2B factor (0.5–1 ॖg) was incubated with PP1Cα or PP1Cγ under the same conditions as described for the peptide. After incubation, an aliquot containing about 0.1–0.35 ॖg of eIF2B was used for assessing eIF2B activity. Cell extracts, prepared in the same way as for the eIF2B assay, were analyzed using horizontal isoelectric focusing slab gels to detect eIF2α phosphorylation and SDS-PAGE to detect GSK3 and ERK phosphorylation. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were visualized by specific anti-eIF2α, anti-phospho-GSK3α/औ, and anti-diphospho-ERK1 and -2 antibodies. The bands corresponding to eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α proteins were quantified as described above. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test for paired and unpaired dataversus control values or analysis of variance and Dunnett's post-test for comparisons between treated groups. Recently we reported that IGF1 induces MAPK activation, mainly of ERK2, and that this signaling pathway is involved in eIF2B activation in neuronal cultures (17Quevedo C. Alcázar A. Salinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19192-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). eIF2Bε contains Pro-Leu-Thr-Pro and Ser-Pro consensus sequences for recognition by ERK1 and -2 MAP kinases. To determine whether eIF2Bε was a substrate for ERK2 kinase in vitro, we incubated eIF2B with ERK2 immunoprecipitates from untreated controls and IGF1-treated cells in an eIF2B phosphorylation assay. The results showed that ERK2 immunoprecipitates from IGF1-treated cells did not increase eIF2Bε phosphorylation and even slightly decreased eIF2Bε phosphorylation (68.6 ± 6.57 versus 1007 of control cells; Fig. 1A, top panel). To test whether MAP kinases were active in the immunoprecipitates, parallel experiments were performed with the known substrate 4E-BP1. As shown, the observed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation with ERK2 immunoprecipitates from IGF1-treated cells (15.5 ± 0.53 in arbitrary units) was greater than that seen with immunoprecipitates from untreated control cells (6.0 ± 2.1 in arbitrary units,p < 0.05; Fig. 1A, bottom panel). This finding confirms the previously reported MAPK activation induced by IGF1 (17Quevedo C. Alcázar A. Salinas M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, and supporting the results obtained with the immunoprecipitates, eIF2B was not phosphorylated by either recombinant ERK1 or ERK2 in vitro(data not shown). To study the participation of MAP kinase in IGF1-induced eIF2B activation, we tested the effect of ERK2 immunoprecipitates from IGF1-treated and untreated neurons on purified eIF2B activity. Interestingly, eIF2B activity was significantly increased after incubation with immunoprecipitates from IGF1-treated cells (168 ± 207; Fig.1B). A similar result was found when diphospho-ERK1 and -2 immunoprecipitates, obtained with an antibody against diphospho-ERK1 and -2 (active form of the kinases), were incubated with eIF2B factor (150 ± 137; Fig. 1B). eIF2B activation induced by ERK immunoprecipitates in IGF1-induced neurons was inhibited by cell treatment with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, whereas the treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect (Fig.1B). Besides, incubation of purified eIF2B with purified recombinant ERK1 or -2 did not change eIF2B activity (not shown). All these findings demonstrate that ERK1 or -2 MAP kinases does not directly modify eIF2B phosphorylation status or activity. Conversely, the above findings suggest that an unknown factor that co-immunoprecipitates with activated ERK1 and -2 may be responsible for eIF2B activation in IGF1-stimulated neurons. Furthermore, when ATP was omitted in incubations with immunoprecipitates, eIF2B activation occurred (not shown), indicating that this effect might not be mediated by kinase activity. To further investigate the nature of the unknown factor that activates eIF2B, we studied the potential involvement of PP1 and PP2A, the two main protein phosphatases involved in cell growth and signaling in eukaryotic cells (36Cohen P.T.W.

Accordingly, we searched for PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits in ERK1 and -2 immunoprecipitates effected with four different antibodies: anti-ERK1 and -2 diphosphorylated, anti-ERK1 and -2, anti-PP1C, and anti-PP2AC. As shown in Fig. 2A, both PP1C and PP2AC proteins were detected. Interestingly, PP1C levels found in ERK2 immunoprecipitates from IGF1-treated neurons were higher than those from untreated cells, whereas PP2AC levels showed no difference (Fig. 2A). Increased PP1C levels were also detected in diphospho-ERK1 and -2 of IGF1-treated cells, whereas PP2AC was"

Here the crystal structure of a ternary complex of LVR with NADH and its inhibitor 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol has been determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.6-A resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 0.199. The overall structure is similar to those of other short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes. The positions of NADH and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol indicate the binding site of the substrate and identify residues that are likely to be important in the catalytic reaction. Modeling of the substrate binding in the active site suggests that the specificity of LVR is determined by electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged surface of Glu-103 of LVR and the positively charged surface on the re side of levodione. Mutant LVR enzymes in which Glu-103 is substituted with alanine (E103A), glutamine (E103Q), asparagines (E103N), or aspartic acid (E103D) show a 2-6-fold increase in Km values as compared with wild-type LVR and a much lower enantiomeric excess of the reaction products (60%) than the wild-type enzyme (95%). Together, these data indicate that Glu-103 has an important role in determining the stereospecificity of LVR."

The action of agrin is critically dependent on an eight-amino acid insert (z8 insert) in the third of three consecutive laminin-like globular (G3) domains near the C terminus of neural agrin.

Direct binding of calcium to AgG3z8 was demonstrated by trypsin digestion and thermal denaturation experiments. Moreover, calcium induced a significant change in the conformation of AgG3z8, and the effect was correlated with an enhanced binding affinity of the protein to muscle receptor. Mutation of calcium-binding residues in the G3 domain diminished the conformational change of neural agrin, reduced its binding affinity to muscle membrane, and inhibited AChR-clustering activity. Conversely, the G3 domain of muscle agrin (AgG3z0) displayed little structural change in the presence of calcium, bound poorly to muscle surface, and was inactive in AChR-clustering assays.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2959-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agrin acts on muscle cell surface and is responsible for the induction of several major aspects of postsynaptic specialization at the developing neuromuscular junction. The most studied action of agrin is the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR)1 on the postsynaptic muscle cell membrane (7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev.

In addition, agrin is also required for the organization of other synaptic proteins, recruitment of cytoskeletal components, and the formation of junctional folds at the neuromuscular synapse (11Campanelli J.T.

The action of neural agrin is mediated by a high affinity agrin receptor on muscle cell membrane. The identity of the receptor remains unknown, but MuSK, amuscle-specific receptor tyrosinekinase, is believed to be an important component of the receptor complex (15Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D.

Agrin induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK in cultured myotubes. The downstream signaling cascade that leads to AChR clustering is poorly understood. It involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the औ-subunit of AChR and the recruitment of rapsyn, a 43-kDa protein, to the postsynaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junction (7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 8Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In mammals, a single agrin gene with three alternative splicing sites (x, y, and z sites) encodes multiple isoforms of agrin in a variety of tissues (18Gesemann M. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19O'Toole J.J. Deyst K.A. Bowe M.A. Nastuk M.A. McKechnie B.A. Fallon J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7369-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The AChR-clustering activity of agrin protein is critically influenced by amino acid sequences contained within the z site. This site is located in the third of three consecutive laminin-like globular (G3) domains near the C-terminal end of agrin. An exon, which encodes a short insert of eight amino acid residues (ELTNEIP; z8), is found only in neural agrin and is required for the AChR-clustering activity (see Fig. 1A) (20Tsen G. Napier A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15934-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Splicing variants of agrin expressed by non-neural tissues including muscle all lack the z8 insert. They displayed little biological activity in AChR-clustering assays in vitro (22Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Stone D.M.

Brain Res. 1998; 110: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). How alternative splicing at the z site results in a striking difference in the functional activity of agrin isoforms is unclear. Although agrin is a large (>200 kDa) protein with multiple domains, the AChR-clustering activity resides entirely in the C-terminal portion of the protein (∼75 kDa) (22Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Cornish T. Chi J. Johnson S. Lu Y. Campanelli J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region contains four copies of epidermal growth factor-like repeats and three copies of globular domains (G1, G2, and G3) initially described in the C terminus of laminin α2 chains (see Fig. 1A). Deletion analysis has revealed that the C-terminal 21-kDa fragment of agrin, which consists of only the G3 domain and z8 insert (AgG3z8), is necessary and sufficient for binding to agrin receptor on muscle cells and for inducing AChR clustering (22Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The other laminin-like domains (G1 and G2), as well as the epidermal growth factor-like repeats, are involved in agrin binding to α-dystroglycan and heparin (18Gesemann M. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). They are completely dispensable without significantly altering the receptor-clustering activity of neural agrin (27Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An important factor that influences the biological activity of neural agrin is calcium. Several studies have shown that calcium concentration is critical for the induction of AChR clustering by motoneuron and agrin in cultured myotubes and for the maintenance of cluster stability (28Bloch R.J. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2670-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Borges L.S. Lee Y. Ferns M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 50: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Removal of extracellular calcium completely blocked agrin-induced activation of MuSK. Clamping of intracellular calcium with BAPTA had little effect on MuSK activation but inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of AChR औ-subunit (30Borges L.S. Lee Y. Ferns M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 50: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Megeath L.J. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 672-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings provide circumstantial evidence that extracellular calcium may promote agrin binding to the membrane receptor, whereas intracellular calcium appears to regulate the downstream signaling events subsequent to the formation of agrin-receptor complex. Nonetheless, the mechanism and precise site of action by calcium remain unknown. The G3 domain sequence of agrin is homologous to the globular domain of α2 laminin (see Fig. 1B). Crystallographic studies reveal that this domain of laminin binds calcium through the side chains of two aspartic acids and two main chain carbonyls (32Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because the aspartates are conserved in agrin G3 domain, and the z8 insert provides two additional negatively charged residues (Glu), it has been speculated that calcium might bind neural agrin, which contains the z8 sequence (32Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The present study has been undertaken to address the following: 1) whether calcium directly binds to the G3 domain of agrin, 2) whether the z8 insert affects the protein interaction with calcium, and 3) whether the interaction plays a role in regulating the AChR-clustering activity of alternatively spliced isoforms of agrin protein. We report that the G3 domain of rat neural agrin (AgG3z8) expressed inPichia pastoris promoted AChR clustering on the surface of C2C12 myotubes in a calcium-dependent manner. Direct binding of calcium to AgG3z8 was demonstrated by trypsin digestion and thermal denaturation experiments. Calcium induced a significant change in the conformation of AgG3z8, and the effect was correlated with an enhanced binding affinity of the protein to muscle receptor. Mutation of the calcium-binding site in G3 domain diminished the conformational change of neural agrin, reduced its binding affinity to muscle membrane, and inhibited AChR-clustering activity. Conversely, the G3 domain of muscle agrin (AgG3z0) displayed little structural change in the presence of calcium, bound poorly to muscle surface, and was inactive in AChR-clustering assays. We conclude that calcium specifically alters the conformation of G3 domain of neural agrin. The distinct effects of calcium on agrins with or without the z8 sequence determine the biological activities of alternatively spliced isoforms of the protein. cDNA clones encoding the C-terminal portion of the rat neural (CAg4,8) and muscle agrin (CAg0,0) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Ferns (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The yeast expression vector pPICZαA and the KM71 mutS strain of P. pastoriswere purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction and modification enzymes for DNA cloning were purchased from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Invitrogen. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity resin was the product of Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA). Rhodamine-α-BuTx was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 125I-Na was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture media and supplements were the products of Invitrogen. General chemicals including protein sequencing grade trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) were purchased from Sigma. Sequences encoding the G3 domain of neural (amino acids 1756–1948) or muscle agrin (amino acids 1756–1940) were each amplified by PCR using CAg4,8 or CAg0,0 as the template (see Fig. 1). The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR are 5′-AGG AAT TCC CAG TGG GGG ACC TAG AAA CAC TG-3′ and 5′-CCC TCT AGA TTA GTG GTG ATG ATG ATG GTG GGG AGT GGG GCA GGG TCT-3′, respectively. The PCR products were double-digested withEcoRI and XbaI and ligated into identically digested pPICZαA. Ligation mixtures were used to transform electrocompetent Top 10 cells. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from colonies grown on low salt LB plates with Zeocin (25 ॖg/ml). Mutation of the putative calcium-binding residue (Asp1820) to alanine was carried out using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers by following the QuikChangeTM PCR mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were verified by restriction digestion and dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing (kit from Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The pPICZαA-AgG3z8 or -AgG3z0 construct was linearized by PmeI digestion and transformed into P. pastoris KM71 strain by electroporation. Positive yeast clones were selected on YPD plates with Zeocin (0.1 mg/ml). A single colony was used to inoculate a 50-ml overnight culture in buffered glycerol complex medium (17 yeast extract, 27 peptone, 3.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 17 glycerol). The initial culture was then expanded to 1 liter in buffered methanol complex medium (BMMY; 17 yeast extract, 27 peptone, 3.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.4 mg/liter biotin). Methanol was added daily to the BMMY medium at a final concentration of 0.757 to induce and maintain protein expression. On the fourth day of induction, the culture supernatant was collected, and proteins were salted out in 707 ammonium sulfate by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were dissolved in 40 ml binding buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA column, washed consecutively with 40 ml of binding buffer and 40 ml of washing buffer (250 mm NaCl, 25 mmimidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and finally eluted in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 mm imidazole. After the imidazole was removed by dialysis against two liters of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the eluent was concentrated by gentle dehydration using Aquacide II (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The agrin protein was then further purified using the Rotofor isoelectric focusing system (Bio-Rad). The recovered fractions were passed through a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column to remove the ampholytes (Amersham Biosciences). The structural models were built by using the homology modeling function of Swiss-PdbViewer V3.7 b2 (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of αL2LG5 (Protein Data Bank code 1DYKA) was selected as the template, and the sequence alignment of AgG3 and αL2LG5 was adjusted according to their secondary structures (32Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The modeling request was submitted to Swiss-Model server, and the modeling results were presented by PdbViewer. C2C12 myoblast cultures were maintained in the growth medium (DMEM containing 207 fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.57 chick embryo extract (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin). Fusion was induced by switching myoblasts at ∼707 confluence to the fusion medium (DMEM containing 57 horse serum, 2 mm glutamine). AChR clusters were induced by adding AgG3 proteins to fully differentiated myotube cultures. 5 h later, the cells were fixed in 27 paraformaldehyde (5 min), stained with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and viewed under a ×400 lens of an Olympus IX-70 fluorescent microscope. The results were photographed with a SPOT-2e camera, and the degree of AChR clustering was analyzed with NIH ImageJ software. To remove extracellular calcium, we replaced the standard DMEM media that contains ∼2 mm calcium with DMEM that lacked both calcium and magnesium. To increase extracellular calcium, we added to the standard DMEM an additional 3, 8, and 98 mmCaCl2, giving a final concentration of 5, 10, and 100 mm, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra were collected at 25 °C on an Aviv 202 spectrometer. Protein was diluted in either 6 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl to ∼0.2 mg/ml to reduce low UV absorbance in wavelength scanning experiments or in 1× Tris-buffered saline for titration and temperature denaturation experiments. At least six scans per sample were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 280 to 195 nm with 1-s integration time. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Mean residue ellipticity values were calculated based on the known protein sequences. The spectra were analyzed by the CDSSTR program using an IBasis 4 reference set (35Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal.

The results presented in this study were averaged values from four separate experiments. Calcium titration curves of 0 to 100 mm CaCl2with 5 mm concentration steps were measured at wavelength 215 nm with 2 min of equilibration time and 1 min of average time. Thermal denaturation curves were also measured at 215 nm, with a 1 °C temperature step, a 0.2-min equilibration time, and a 1-s averaging time. AgG3z8 or AgG3z0 protein was first dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline with either 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA. Trypsin digestion was carried out at enzyme/substrate ratios (w/w ratio) of 1:100, 1:50, 1:25, and 1:12.5 for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by boiling the proteins in SDS sample buffer for 10 min, and the digestion pattern was analyzed on a 157 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant agrins were iodinated using the chloramin T method described by Hunter and Greenwood (38Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The labeling was carried out by adding 1 mCi of125I-Na (Amersham Biosciences) to 0.5 mg of protein in potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction was started with 20 ॖl of a chloramin T solution (2 mg/ml). After 45 s, 20 ॖl of 2 mg/ml Na2S2O5 was added to terminate the labeling reaction. Free 125I was separated from labeled proteins by gel filtration on Sepharose-G25 columns. Approximately 857 of the proteins were recovered after gel filtration. The biological activity of neural agrin was retained after iodination as assayed by their ability to induce AChR clustering in cultured C2C12 myotubes. Iodinated agrin proteins were added at indicated concentrations to cultured myotubes on six-well plates in the fusion medium. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, cells were rinsed four times with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and lysed with 0.2m NaOH. Bound radioactivity was counted using a γ-counter. Using truncated fragments of agrin expressed by mammalian cell lines, several previous studies have shown that the C-terminal 21-kDa sequence of agrin, which contains only the G3 domain with the z8 insert, is the minimal domain sufficient for inducing AChR clustering in cultured myotubes (22Hoch W.

To obtain protein materials sufficient for structural and functional analysis, we expressed the G3 domains of neural (AgG3z8) and muscle agrin (AgG3z0), respectively, in P. pastoris (Fig.1). PCR-amplified rat cDNA encoding these domains were subcloned into the yeast expression vector, pPICZαA. The signal sequence from yeast α-mating factor and a hexahistidine tag were added in-frame to the 5′ and 3′ ends of agrin cDNA, respectively. AgG3z8 and AgG3z0 were each secreted as a soluble protein into the culture medium (>30 mg/liter). They were purified to >957 by using the Ni-NTA column chromatography. On a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the proteins migrated as a single band of 26 and 24 kDa, respectively (Fig.2A). The sizes were not changed upon digestion with endoglycosidase H or PNGase F (in 107 SDS at 95 °C for 2 h), suggesting they were not modified by N-linked glycosylation (data not shown). Preparative isoelectric focusing electrophoresis on the Rotofor apparatus separated the samples into 20 fractions, pH 3–10. Both proteins were concentrated in fraction 9 and 10, pH 6.0–6.5 (see Fig. 2,B and C), in agreement with a calculated pI of 6.31 for AgG3z0 and 6.04 for AgG3z8. The yield after the purification was ∼20 mg/liter culture for each of the proteins. The following two experiments were carried out to determine whether the yeast-expressed agrin G3 domains were properly folded. First, we measured their spectrum with a CD spectrophotometer. The composition of protein secondary structures was calculated using the CDSSTR program (35Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The spectra of neural and muscle agrins were slightly different, but both had deep minima at 215 nm (Fig. 2C). AgG3z8 had 307 औ-sheet, 257 औ-turn, and 27 α-helix. These values are consistent with a model predicted based on the crystal structure of the homologous domain of α2 laminin (see Fig.1B and Fig. 3). Similarly, AgG3z0 had a structural composition of 277 औ-sheet and 267 औ-turn with no α-helix. The results of CD studies thus suggest that the recombinant G3 domains of neural and muscle agrins both assumed a folded conformation rich in औ-structures. Next, we assessed the function of the protein domains using an AChR-clustering assay with C2C12 myotubes grown in standard culture medium. In the absence of agrin, staining of myotubes with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin revealed few, if any, spontaneous receptor clusters on the cell surface. Treating the cells for 3 h with AgG3z8 at concentration as low as 0.01 ॖg/ml (∼0.4 nm) induced the formation of numerous AChR clusters. The number of clusters approached maximal when 1 ॖg/ml (∼100 nm) AgG3z8 was added to the culture (Fig.4). The efficacy of yeast AgG3z8 protein was thus comparable with that of a chick agrin G3 fragment expressed in COS and HeLa cells (EC50 ∼13 nm) (40Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 41Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, muscle agrin (AgG3z0) at similar concentrations failed to induce AChR cluster formation. Only when the myotubes were treated with extremely high concentrations (>50 ॖg/ml, ∼2 ॖm) of AgG3z0, a few receptor aggregates became visible (data not shown). Thus, the G3 domain of neural agrin expressed in Pichiaacted potently to induce AChR aggregation, whereas the muscle isoform displayed little, if any, biological activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that calcium enhances the binding of G1 and G2 domains of agrin to α-dystroglycan and heparin on muscle membrane. The role of these interactions has not been defined, but they appear to be not required for agrin-induced AChR clustering (42Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 43Bowen D.C. Gordon H. Hall Z.W. J.

To determine whether calcium influences the function of agrin G3 domain, we added 10 nm AgG3z8 to cultured myotubes grown in medium with or without calcium. Staining with rhodamine-conjugated α-BuTx revealed that few AChR clusters were present on the surface of myotubes in a calcium-free medium (see Fig.5A and Fig. 4B). In contrast, AgG3z8 induced the formation of numerous receptor clusters on the plasma membrane of myotubes cultured in standard DMEM (∼2 mm calcium). The number of clusters increased when extracellular calcium was raised to 5 mm. The response to agrin approached maximal at ∼10 mm calcium, and it was saturated at 100 mm calcium (Fig. 5B). In separate experiments, myotubes treated in the same manner were labeled with 125I-α-BuTx instead of rhodamine-α-BuTx. The result showed that the total number of surface AChRs was not significantly different among cells incubated with or without calcium (data not shown). We thus exclude that the increased AChR clustering was a result of enhanced transcription of AChR subunit genes by calcium. The requirement for calcium in agrin-induced synaptic specialization may reflect calcium-dependent binding of agrin to its receptor or to some other calcium-dependent signaling processes inside the muscle cells. By taking the advantage that the G3 domain binds specifically to muscle agrin receptor but not to α-dystroglycan and heparin, we carried out radioligand binding assay using iodinated G3 proteins (125I-AgG3) in cultured C2C12 myotubes. In the absence of extracellular calcium,125I-AgG3z8 bound poorly to muscle cell surface (KD ∼375 nm). In standard DMEM medium (∼2 mm calcium), however, the binding affinity of agrin was increased by nearly two orders of magnitude (KD∼9.3 nm). At higher calcium concentrations (5 and 100 mm), a further but less dramatic increase in AgG3z8 binding was detected (see Fig. 5C and TableI). In c"

In T cells from Mf2−/− mice, reduced levels of RIα translates functionally into ∼2-fold less sensitivity to cAMP-mediated inhibition of proliferation triggered through the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. In Jurkat T cells, FOXD2 overexpression increased the endogenous levels of RIα through induction of the RIα1b promoter. FOXD2 overexpression also increased the sensitivity of the promoter to cAMP.

Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). PKA type I is recruited to the TCR-CD3 complex following T cell activation (2Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and elicits an inhibitory pathway in lipid rafts that negatively modulates signaling through the TCR. This pathway involves activation of C-terminal Src kinase by PKA type I. Active C-terminal Src kinase subsequently inhibits Lck by phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine 505 (3Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Taskén K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This inhibitory mechanism determines the threshold of T cell activation with implications in several disease conditions. In human immunodeficiency virus infection, high levels of cAMP and thereby hyperactivation of PKA type I leads to T cell hyporesponsiveness and T cell anergy (4Aandahl E.M. Aukrust P. Skålhegg B.S.

Muller F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1178-1185PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, a deficiency in PKA type I regulatory subunit expression and PKA type I activity has been reported in the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (6Laxminarayana D. Khan I.U. Mishra N. Olorenshaw I. Taskén K. Kammer G.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5639-5648PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is activated by the intracellular second messenger cAMP, leading to dissociation of two active catalytic (C) subunits from a regulatory dimer (R2) (reviewed in Ref. 7Taskén K. Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K.A. Solberg R. Knutsen H.K. Levy F.O. Sandberg M. Ørstavik S. Larsen T. Johansen A.K. Vang T. Schrader H.P. Reinton N.T. Torgersen K.M. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 191-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R subunit isoforms (RIα, RIऔ, RIIα, and RIIऔ) can combine with the catalytic subunit to form either PKA type I (RIα2C2/RIऔ2C2) or PKA type II (RIIα2C2/RIIऔ2C2) holoenzymes that have different affinities for cAMP and thus activate at low or high local concentrations of cAMP in the cell (Kact of 50–100 nmversus 200–400 nm, respectively) (8Øgreid D. Ekanger R. Suva R.H. Miller J.P. Døskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PKA types I and II are also targeted differently in the cell through binding to A kinase-anchoring proteins (reviewed in Ref. 9Herberg F.W. Maleszka A. Eide T. Vossebein L. Taskén K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When RI subunits are up-regulated, cAMP sensitivity of PKA increases and thereby lowers the threshold for activation of cAMP-mediated downstream effects (10Dostmann W.R. Taylor S.S. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10484-10491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 757 of PKA in T cells is of type I, and RIα is the dominating R isoform. A complex set of mechanisms appears to regulate expression of the RIα subunit of PKA. First, several promoters differentially regulate the expression of alternatively spliced RIα mRNAs. Second, these mRNAs contain different 5′-untranslated regions encoded by the first exons that may exhibit different translation efficiency. Five RIα splice variants have been cloned (RIα1a–e), two of which are ubiquitously expressed (RIα1a and RIα1b) (11Barradeau S. Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Weiss M.C. Faust D.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Torjesen P.A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K.

Dev. 2001; 59: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, RIα protein levels are regulated by mechanisms such as rapid degradation of excess protein not associated with catalytic subunit, resulting in a regulatory:catalytic ratio of ∼1:1 (14Orellana S.A. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3048-3053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RIα expression is regulated by cAMP in many cell types, and regulation at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level has been reported (12Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V.

Having discovered the presence of FOXD2 in T cells, we wanted to examine whether FOXD2 functions as an inducer of RIα expression in T cells by a similar mechanism as reported in adipocytes and testicular cells. Here, we report the finding that T cells from FOXD2−/− mice have reduced levels of RIα1b mRNA and RIα protein and a decreased sensitivity to cAMP-mediated inhibition of immune function. Furthermore, FOXD2 regulates the RIα1b promoter and works together with both cAMP and PKB to induce the RIα1b promoter and elevate endogenous levels of RIα protein. In conclusion, our data indicate that FOXD2 is important for expression of RIα mRNA and RIα protein in T lymphocytes in vivo and thereby tunes the sensitivity to cAMP and sets the threshold for cAMP-mediated immunomodulation. Complementary DNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using a commercial kit (Invitrogen, ThermoScriptTM RT-PCR System, catalog number 11146-024). Total cellular RNA (5 ॖg of Jurkat, T cell, B cell, or monocyte total RNA) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C using both oligo(dT)20 and random hexamer primers. Subsequently, the cDNA was subjected to 45 PCR amplification cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 99 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 1 min, and 70 °C for 2 min) and a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification products were separated on a 17 agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The human FOXD2 sense 5′-GGA GAA CAG GCA AAC TCG GAG CAG T-3′ and antisense 5′-CGA GTG ATC ACC AGG AGC GAA CTT G-3′ primers amplified a 197-bp fragment of the FOXD2 cDNA. Sequence-specific PCR primers were designed for औ-actin (forward primer, 5′-AGG CAC CAG GGC GTG AT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCG TCC CAG TTG GTG ACG AT-3′; GenBankTM accession number NM_001101) using the Primer Express software version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantification of mRNA was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, 100 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). SyBr Green assays were performed using 2× SyBr Green Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 300 nm sense and antisense primers and water made up to 25 ॖl. The specificity of the SyBr Green assays was assessed by melting point analysis and gel electrophoresis. All of the samples were analyzed in triplicate. Total RNA from homogenized mouse spleens was extracted by the guanidium isothiocyanate/CsCl method as previously described (23Øyen O. Frøysa A. Sandberg M. Eskild W. Joseph D. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 37: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis was performed using 20 ॖg of total RNA. The RNA was denatured in 507 (v/v) formamide and 67 (v/v) formaldehyde, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.57 (w/v) agarose gel containing 6.77 formaldehyde, and blotted on to a nylon membrane. Complementary DNA probes for mouse RIα 1b 5′-untranslated region (11Barradeau S. Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Weiss M.C. Faust D.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and human RIα cDNA were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed with 507 formamide at 42 °C, and the filters were washed four times in a solution containing 0.1–0.5× SSC (300 mmNaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.17 SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. The filters were subjected to electronic autoradiography in a Packard Instant Imager औ-scintillation counter. Jurkat cells and C57/BL6 mouse spleen lymphocytes (splenocytes) were collected by centrifugation (10 min, 600 × g), washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 500 ॖl of a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm CHAPS (Sigma) and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mix (1 tablet/10 ml; Roche Applied Science). Cell suspensions were sonicated three times (Heat Systems Ultrasonics) and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −70 °C until analysis. The protein samples were diluted in SDS sample buffer and denaturated for 5 min at 100 °C before loading onto a one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4.07 stacking gel, 107 separating gel). 20 ॖg of total protein were loaded in each lane, subjected to electrophoresis, and subsequently transferred onto polyvinyldifluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.057 Tween 20, and 57 milk and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human or rat RIα and RIIα (1:250) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against catalytic subunit (1:250) (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.057 Tween 20. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by Supersignal (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and subjected to autoradiography. The films were scanned, and the densities of bands were quantified using the Scion Image package (downloaded from www.scioncorp.com). Spleens from adult C57/BL6 FOXD2−/− (24Kume T. Deng K. Hogan B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or wt mice were extracted and converted into single-cell suspensions by squeezing through a cell strainer in serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 17 non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Erythrocytes were depleted in a buffer containing 10 mmKHO3, 155 mm NH4Cl, and 8.9 ॖm EDTA. Spleen lymphocytes (2.5 × 106/ml) suspended in the medium defined above supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum were seeded into anti-mouse CD3 T cell activation plates (Becton Dickinson) in a total volume of 100 ॖl and placed in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 48 h. After 48 h of culturing, the cells were pulsed with 5 ॖCi of [3H]thymidine, and 4 h later cultures were harvested onto filter plates and subsequently analyzed by औ-scintillation counting. When used, cAMP agonist (8-CPT-cAMP; 0–100 ॖm; BioLog, Life Science, Bremen, Germany) was added prior to incubation. Deletion constructs from the RIα promoter regions RIα1a+1b (−882 to +77), RIα1a (−882 to −310), and RIα1b (−406 to +77) were inserted into the pCAT basic reporter vector (12Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Torjesen P.A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The numbers are relative to the downstream transcription start of promoter 1b. The expression vector for FOXD2 was constructed by insertion of the coding region into pCB6+, and the FOXD1 coding region was inserted in pEVRFO. Expression vectors for wt or mutant PKBα/Akt1 isoforms were created in pCMV6 fused to a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag (25Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). All of the expression vectors contained CMV promoters. The internal luciferase control vector was pGL3 control (Promega). Jurkat TAg cells (a human leukemic T cell line stably transfected with SV40 large T antigen) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing streptomycin (100 g/liter), and penicillin (70 mg/liter) supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For transfections, 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected with a total of 20 ॖg of DNA (2.5 ॖg of CAT reporter plasmid, 2 ॖg of internal luciferase control vector, 7.5 ॖg of expression vector(s) for FOX and/or PKB, and the respective empty vectors to a total of 20 ॖg) by electroporation (250 V/cm, 950 microfarads) in cuvettes with a 0.4-cm electrode gap. The cells were then expanded in 20 ml of complete medium in 75-cm2 culture flasks and incubated for 20 h. For stimulation, the cAMP agonist 8-CPT-cAMP was added to a final concentration of 100 ॖmafter 20 h, and the cells were cultured for another 10 h. The Jurkat cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 30 h after transfection. CAT activities were measured using an organic phase extraction method (26Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.P. Guerin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and normalized for expression from the Luciferase-encoding vector pGL3 Control (Promega). The luciferase activities were measured using a luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and a Wallac 1251 luminometer (Amersham Biosciences, Helsinki, Finland). The presence of FOXD2 in leukocytes was initially seen in a tissue blot screen (not shown), and we went on to map the expression in leukocyte subsets (B and T cells and monocytes) purified from human peripheral blood. Fig.1 shows that FOXD2 is expressed in T cells and monocytes but not detected in B cells as assessed by RT-PCR. To examine whether FOXD2 regulates RIα expression in T cells by a similar mechanism as FOXC2 in adipocytes (22Cederberg A. Grønning L.M. Ahren B. Taskén K. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and FOXD1 in testicular Sertoli cells (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22902-22908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we first examined spleens from homozygous (−/−) and heterozygous (+/−) FOXD2 null mutant mice compared with wt (+/+) for levels of expression of total RIα mRNA (Fig. 2A) and levels of the RIα1b mRNA with the 1b leader exon originating from the RIα1b promoter (Fig. 2B). We found that levels of both total RIα mRNA and of the 1b splice variant were reduced by 40–507 in the FOXD2-deficient mice relative to wt, whereas RIα1a mRNA was not detected (not shown). Western blotting showed that RIα protein levels were decreased by 357 in FOXD2−/− compared with wt spleens, whereas RIIα levels were increased moderately (Fig.2C). These observations indicate that FOXD2 regulates RIα mRNA and protein levels in T lymphocytes in vivo. To explore the impact of FOXD2 regulation of RIα on cAMP-mediated inhibition of T lymphocyte function in vivo, FOXD2−/− and wt spleen lymphocytes were activated by anti-CD3 and subjected to lymphocyte proliferation assays in the absence and presence of 8-CPT-cAMP at increasing concentrations (0–100 ॖm). The data from proliferation assays showed that spleen lymphocytes deficient in FOXD2 were less sensitive to cAMP than wt spleen lymphocytes as illustrated by the right-shifted inhibitioncurve in Fig. 3A. When examining four null mutant and three wt mice it was evident that T cells from all the mutant mice were less sensitive to inhibition of T cell function by cAMP than wt littermates as illustrated by the increase in IC50 values for cAMP inhibition of T cell proliferation in the FOXD2−/− mice (Fig. 3B). We next transfected Jurkat T cells with pCAT reporter constructs containing either the RIα1a, the RIα1b, or the total RIα1a+1b promoter region (Fig.4A) together with expression construct for FOXD2 or the related factor FOXD1 (Fig. 4B). Reporter activity directed by constructs containing the RIα1a+1b and RIα1b promoter, but not the construct containing the upstream RIα1a promoter alone, was induced 2–4-fold by both FOXD2 and FOXD1. A construct containing the RIα1a promoter with the addition of 1.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequences showed no further effect on reporter expression or induction by FOXD2 (not shown). However, elements immediately upstream of RIα exon 1a appeared to induce basal activity of the RIα1b promoter. Elevating the amounts of FOXD2 expression vector up to 12-fold relative to the RIα1b reporter construct demonstrated that maximal induction of the RIα1b promoter by FOXD2 was at least 5.8-fold (Fig. 4C). However, we observed no more than 2-fold induction by introducing the corresponding amount of FOXD1 expression vector, indicating that FOXD1 and FOXD2 share the same function but display different efficacy in Jurkat cells. We next explored whether expression of FOXD2 affected the responsiveness of the RIα1b promoter to cAMP and transfected the RIα1b reporter vector together with the expression vector for FOXD2 or the corresponding empty vector (Fig. 4D). The cells were treated with 100 ॖm 8-CPT-cAMP for 10 h or left untreated, which produced a 2-fold induction of the RIα1b promoter in the presence of endogenously expressed FOXD2, but this induction was increased to 5-fold in cells overexpressing FOXD2, suggesting that FOXD2 partly mediates the effect of cAMP in activating the RIα1b promoter. Similar results were obtained using the RIα1a+1b construct as a reporter, whereas the RIα1a reporter was not affected (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of PKBα on the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX) is well documented. Furthermore, we have recently reported that PKBα enhances the effect of a FOXD family member, FOXD1, on the RIα1b promoter in testicular Sertoli cells but not in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22902-22908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKBα is involved in FOXD-mediated activation of RIα1b in T cells, we transfected Jurkat T cells with 2.5 ॖg of pCAT reporter constructs containing the RIα1a+1b, 1a, or 1b promoters together with expression vector for FOXD2 and/or PKBα (Fig.5A). Although FOXD2 overexpression did not induce the RIα1b promoter more than 1.4-fold in these experiments, we found that the combination of FOXD2 and PKBα induced the RIα1b promoter 10-fold, whereas PKBα alone induced expression from the RIα1b promoter 5-fold, indicating that PKBα may influence RIα expression through endogenous FOXD2 or by alternative mechanisms in these cells. When FOXD1 and PKBα were co-transfected in Jurkat cells, a 6.3-fold induction of the RIα1b promoter was observed (Fig. 5B). To assess the importance of the localization of PKBα for induction of RIα expression, we examined the effect of a myristylated PKBα mutant compared with a wt kinase (Fig.5C). Myristylated PKB is reported to be constitutively membrane-bound and constitutively active (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J.

A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We observed that membrane-restricted PKBα alone had a modest inductive effect on the basal expression from the RIα1b promoter and produced a 3.8-fold induction in FOXD2-expressing cells, indicating that the activating mechanism of PKB is enhanced by detachment of PKB from the membrane. Expressed as a control, the kinase-dead PKB mutant had no effect on the RIα1b promoter. We next examined the effects of FOXD2 and/or PKBα on endogenous RIα protein levels at 16 and 24 h post-transfection by immunoblotting (Fig. 5D). We observed that FOXD2 up-regulated RIα protein levels up to 2-fold, whereas the combined expression of FOXD2 and PKBα elevated RIα-levels 2.7-fold. We have previously shown that the forkhead transcription factor FOXC2 induces RIα expression in adipocytes (22Cederberg A. Grønning L.M. Ahren B. Taskén K. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and that FOXD1 share the same function in testicular Sertoli cells (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22902-22908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We report here the finding of FOXD2 mRNA expression in leukocytes and the regulation of RIα expression by FOXD2 in T cells. Spleen lymphocytes from FOXD2 null mutant mice had reduced levels of RIα mRNA and protein, whereas expression of both FOXD2 and FOXD1 induced the RIα1b promoter as well as RIα protein in a Jurkat cell line. Furthermore, in the FOXD2-deficient mice, anti-CD3 activated spleen lymphocytes were less sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by cAMP than cells from wt mice as indicated by a right-shifted inhibition curve and elevated IC50 values. The observation that sensitivity to cAMP is reduced in FOXD2−/− may be due to the facts that (i) the levels of RIα are reduced and PKAIα (RIα2C2) has a 3–4-fold higher affinity and lower Kact for cAMP than the PKAIIα (RIIα2C2) enzyme also present in T cells and (ii) PKAIα is the PKA isoform specifically recruited to the TCR complex (2Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In support of this, we observed an up-regulation of RIα promoter activity and RIα protein in FOXD2-overexpressing cells. The RIα1b promoter was induced 2–3-fold by cAMP in Jurkat T cells and about 5-fold in normal T cells (not shown). We also show here that overexpression of FOXD2 markedly increases the sensitivity of the RIα1b promoter to cAMP in Jurkat cells, which may also involve endogenous FOXD2. A similar connection between FOXD1 and cAMP-mediated regulation of the RIα1b promoter has been reported in Sertoli cells (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22902-22908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have previously also reported that translation of the RIα1b mRNA may be stimulated by cAMP in testicular Sertoli cells depending on specific sequences in the RIα1b 5′-untranslated region (15Dahle M.K. Knutsen H.K. Taskén K.A. Pilz R. Taskén K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5920-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our findings showed that both cAMP and PKBα activate the RIα1b promoter to a similar extent in the presence of FOXD2 in Jurkat T cells. However, in our assays the effects of PKBα and cAMP did not appear to be additive (not shown). A possible explanation for this may be that FOXD2 is a cross-road for PKA/PKBα cross-talk or that a mechanism of cAMP-mediated activation of PKBα is involved. Cyclic AMP has been demonstrated to stimulate PKB activity independently of PKA (27Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 28Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-independent activation of PKB by PKA has also been reported (29Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Notably, Jurkat cells lack PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog detected at chromosome 10) and have a disturbed phosphoinositide signaling (30Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). The inductive effect of PKBα on FOXD2 in T cells and on FOXD1 in Sertoli cells is in contrast to the inhibitory effects reported on a different family of forkheads, the FOXO family. PKB/Akt is a key player in transduction of anti-apoptotic and proliferative signals in T cells, and overexpression of active PKBα/Akt1 promotes T cell survival (31Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PKB is activated following proliferative signals through the interleukin-2 receptor and the T cell receptor complex in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent fashion (31Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 32Reif K. Burgering B.M. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14426-14433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN (30Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). PKB has the ability to antagonize apoptotic signals by inhibiting the function of winged helix transcription factors of the FOXO family members (AFX, FKHR, and FKHR-L1) via a direct phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (reviewed in Ref. 20Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FOXD2 and FOXD1 share little sequence similarity with FOXO proteins in regions outside the DNA-binding region, and we did not find consensus PKB phosphorylation sites. However, the possibility exists that FOXD2 competes for DNA-binding sites with FOXO proteins and that nuclear exclusion of the FOXO family members by PKB takes part in the synergistic effect of PKB and FOXD2. Based on the above, it is possible that PKB, in addition to its strong role in T cell activation, in parallel participates in activating immunomodulatory effects via the PKA pathway. In testicular Sertoli cells, we observed that ectopically expressed FOXD2 did not regulate the RIα1b promoter regardless of the presence of PKBα (not shown), whereas FOXD1 and PKBα induced RIα1b 15-fold in these cells (21Dahle M.K. Grønning L.M. Cederberg A. Blomhoff H.K. Miura N. Enerbäck S. Taskén K.A. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22902-22908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 3M. K. Dahle, L. M. Grønning, and K. Taskén, unpublished data. This led us to believe that additional cell-specific factors are essential for the different effects of the two FOXD proteins. In conclusion, our data indicate that FOXD2 is a physiological regulator of RIα levels in T lymphocytes in vivo by inducing the RIα1b promoter, working with PKB to further induce PKA RIα expression. Through this mechanism FOXD2 may regulate PKA RIα levels that regulate sensitivity to cAMP and set the threshold for negative modulation of T cell activation (Fig.6). We thank Dr. Tsutomu Kume and Dr. Brigid L. M. Hogan for supplying the FOXD2−/− mice, Dr. Naheed N. Ahmed for providing the PKBα expression vectors, and Dr. Mary Weiss for furnishing the mouse RIα1b sequence for design of an RIα1b-specific mouse cDNA probe. We greatly appreciate the technical assistance of Gladys Josefsen and Guri Opsahl."
https://openalex.org/W2006465680,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family comprises several proteins with similar structures including the LDL receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER2). The human brain expresses two major splice variants of apoER2 mRNA, one of which includes an additional exon that encodes 59 residues in the cytoplasmic domain. This exon is absent from the LDL receptor and contains three proline-rich (PXXP) motifs that may allow apoER2 to function as a signal transducer. To investigate the role of this insert, we took advantage of the well characterized low density lipoprotein receptor pathway. Chimeras comprising the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of the LDL receptor fused to the cytoplasmic domain of apoER2 lacking the PXXP-containing residues are able to mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis of LDL as effectively as cells expressing the LDL receptor but not if the PXXP insert is present in the protein. Although expressed on the cell surface, the PXXP-containing chimeric receptor is excluded from clathrin vesicles as judged by its failure to co-localize with adaptor protein-2 possibly due to interaction with intracellular adaptors or scaffolding proteins. Chimeras with the transmembrane domain of apoER2, predicted to be longer than that of the LDL receptor by several residues, fail to mediate endocytosis of LDL or to co-localize with adaptor protein-2 regardless of the presence or absence of the PXXP insert. Thus features of apoER2 that distinguish it as a signaling receptor, rather than as an endocytosis receptor like the LDL receptor, reside in or near the transmembrane domain and in the proline-rich motifs."
