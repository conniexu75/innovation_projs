Meanwhile, science education at the K-12 level is undergoing significant changes as a result of the emphasis on scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. This framework of ""three-dimensional learning"" is based on the literature about how people learn science and how we can help students put their knowledge to use. Recently, similar changes are underway in higher education by incorporating three-dimensional learning into college science courses. As these transformations move forward, it will become important to assess three-dimensional learning both to align assessments with the learning environment, and to assess the extent of the transformations. In this paper we introduce the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which is designed to characterize and support the development of assessment tasks in biology, chemistry, and physics that align with transformation efforts. We describe the development process used by our interdisciplinary team, discuss the validity and reliability of the protocol, and provide evidence that the protocol can distinguish between assessments that have the potential to elicit evidence of three-dimensional learning and those that do not."

Some impacts of climate change, such as high temperatures in urban environments, have not yet been addressed through adaptation strategies, which are based on poorly supported data. These impacts remain outside the scope of urban planning. New spatially explicit approaches that identify highly vulnerable urban areas and include specific adaptation requirements are needed in current urban planning practices to cope with heat hazards. In this paper, a heat vulnerability index is proposed for Santiago, Chile. The index was created using a GIS-based spatial information system and was constructed from spatially explicit indexes for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity levels derived from remote sensing data and socio-economic information assessed via principal component analysis (PCA). The objective of this study is to determine the levels of heat vulnerability at local scales by providing insights into these indexes at the intra city scale. The results reveal a spatial pattern of heat vulnerability with strong variations among individual spatial indexes. While exposure and adaptive capacities depict a clear spatial pattern, sensitivity follows a complex spatial distribution. These conditions change when examining PCA results, showing that sensitivity is more robust than exposure and adaptive capacity. These indexes can be used both for urban planning purposes and for proposing specific policies and measures that can help minimize heat hazards in highly dynamic urban areas. The proposed methodology can be applied to other Latin American cities to support policy making."

Villages within districts and their households were selected randomly according to market accessibility, with a mother selected from each household. Information on on-farm diversity was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Market diversity was obtained through a 7-day food frequency questionnaire that elicited if foods were purchased. Dietary diversity was derived from a quantitative 24-hour food recall. A system of three simultaneous equations via a Generalized Methods of Moments was estimated to address potential endogeneity between dietary diversity and on-farm diversity and market diversity.Results show rich on-farm diversity with more than 65 different edible plant species grown or collected by households. More than 70% of foods consumed by mothers were purchased in 55 market places. More than 50% of mothers met minimum dietary diversity with at least 5 food groups consumed. Diagnostic tests indicated the existence of endogeneity. Econometric results showed that on-farm and market diversities were positively associated with mothers' dietary diversity (p < 0.05) once market opportunities, seasonality and other socioeconomic factors were controlled for.Results provide evidence of a positive relationship between on-farm diversity and dietary diversity among participant mothers. They demonstrate the important contribution of market diversity to their dietary diversity. Links among these three facets of diversity suggest that production for self-consumption and food purchases complement rather than replace each other in their contribution to dietary diversity and thus dietary quality."
https://openalex.org/W2518634742,"Bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) pumps four proton equivalents per catalytic cycle through the H-pathway, a proton-conducting pathway, which includes a hydrogen bond network and a water channel operating in tandem. Protons are transferred by H3O+ through the water channel from the N-side into the hydrogen bond network, where they are pumped to the P-side by electrostatic repulsion between protons and net positive charges created at heme a as a result of electron donation to O2 bound to heme a3. To block backward proton movement, the water channel remains closed after O2 binding until the sequential four-proton pumping process is complete. Thus, the hydrogen bond network must collect four proton equivalents before O2 binding. However, a region with the capacity to accept four proton equivalents was not discernable in the x-ray structures of the hydrogen bond network. The present x-ray structures of oxidized/reduced bovine CcO are improved from 1.8/1.9 to 1.5/1.6 A resolution, increasing the structural information by 1.7/1.6 times and revealing that a large water cluster, which includes a Mg2+ ion, is linked to the H-pathway. The cluster contains enough proton acceptor groups to retain four proton equivalents. The redox-coupled x-ray structural changes in Glu198, which bridges the Mg2+ and CuA (the initial electron acceptor from cytochrome c) sites, suggest that the CuA-Glu198-Mg2+ system drives redox-coupled transfer of protons pooled in the water cluster to the H-pathway. Thus, these x-ray structures indicate that the Mg2+-containing water cluster is the crucial structural element providing the effective proton pumping in bovine CcO."
https://openalex.org/W2514375142,"Until today, anti-microbial drugs have been the therapy of choice to combat bacterial diseases. Resistance against antibiotics is of growing concern in man and animals. Stress, caused by demanding environmental conditions, can reduce immune protection in the host, influencing the onset and outcome of infectious diseases. Therefore psychoneuro-immunological intervention may prove to be a successful approach to diminish the impact of diseases and antibiotics use. This study was designed to investigate the effect of social and environmental enrichment on the impact of disease, referred to as “disease susceptibility”, in pigs using a co-infection model of PRRSV and A. pleuropneumoniae. Twenty-eight pigs were raised in four pens under barren conditions and twenty-eight other pigs were raised in four pens under enriched conditions. In the enriched pens a combination of established social and environmental enrichment factors were introduced. Two pens of the barren (BH) and two pens of the enriched housed (EH) pigs were infected with PRRSV followed by A. pleuropneumoniae, the other two pens in each housing treatment served as control groups. We tested if differences in disease susceptibility in terms of pathological and clinical outcome were related to the different housing regimes and if this was reflected in differences in behavioural and immunological states of the animals. Enriched housed pigs showed a faster clearance of viral PRRSV RNA in blood serum (p = 0.014) and histologically 2.8 fold less interstitial pneumonia signs in the lungs (p = 0.014). More barren housed than enriched housed pigs developed lesions in the lungs (OR = 19.2, p = 0.048) and the lesions in the barren housed pigs showed a higher total pathologic tissue damage score (p<0.001) than those in enriched housed pigs. EH pigs showed less stress-related behaviour and differed immunologically and clinically from BH pigs. We conclude that enriched housing management reduces disease susceptibility to co-infection of PRRSV and A. pleuropneumoniae in pigs. Enrichment positively influences behavioural state, immunological response and clinical outcome in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2515281308,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are highly malignant cancers characterized by extensive invasion into surrounding tissues, metastasis to distant organs, and a limited response to therapy. A main feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas is desmoplasia, which leads to extensive deposition of collagen I. We have demonstrated that collagen I can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells. A hallmark of EMT is an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal cadherin N-cadherin. Previously we showed up-regulation of N-cadherin promotes tumor cell invasion and that collagen I-induced EMT is mediated by two collagen receptors, α2β1-integrin and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). DDR1 is a receptor-tyrosine kinase widely expressed during embryonic development and in many adult tissues and is also highly expressed in many different cancers. In the signaling pathway initiated by collagen, we have shown proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is downstream of DDR1. In this study we found isoform b of DDR1 is responsible for collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin and tyrosine 513 of DDR1b is necessary. Knocking down Shc1, which binds to tyrosine 513 of DDR1b via its PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain, eliminates the up-regulation of N-cadherin. The signaling does not require a functional SH2 domain or the tyrosine residues commonly phosphorylated in Shc1 but is mediated by the interaction between a short segment of the central domain of Shc1 and the proline-rich region of Pyk2. Taken together, these data illustrate DDR1b, but not DDR1a, mediates collagen I-induced N-cadherin up-regulation, and Shc1 is involved in this process by coupling to both DDR1 and Pyk2.

Pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States with a 5-year survival rate of ∼6% (American Cancer Society, 2014). This unfortunate outcome is mainly due to the aggressive behavior of this cancer and the lack of symptoms early in the disease. One of the major features of pancreatic cancer is that during the early stages an extensive stromal reaction occurs called desmoplasia. A dense stroma forms, which consists of myofibroblasts (pancreatic stellate cells), abundant extracellular matrix, and different types of inflammatory cells including macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells (1.Ryan D.P. Hong T.S. Bardeesy N. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 2140-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 2.Feig C. Gopinathan A. Neesse A. Chan D.S. Cook N. Tuveson D.A. The pancreas cancer microenvironment.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 4266-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix components include collagens, fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, and proteoglycans, whereas the major part is type I collagen (3.Whatcott C.J. Posner R.G. Von Hoff D.D. Han H.

The atypical stroma plays many roles in pancreatic cancer. It changes the normal architecture of pancreatic tissue and induces an abnormal configuration of blood and lymphatic vessels resulting in a hypovascular and hypoxic microenvironment. It also presents a barrier to drug delivery and promotes tumor immunologic tolerance (2.Feig C. Gopinathan A. Neesse A. Chan D.S. Cook N. Tuveson D.A. The pancreas cancer microenvironment.Clin.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). EMT is a biologic process that enables polarized epithelial cells to attain a mesenchymal cell phenotype, thus enhancing migratory capacity and invasiveness, so cells can migrate away from the original epithelial layer (6.Yilmaz M. Christofori G. EMT, the cytoskeleton, and cancer cell invasion.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2009; 28: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). EMT plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis in many solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (7.Nakajima S. Doi R. Toyoda E. Tsuji S. Wada M. Koizumi M. Tulachan S.S. Ito D. Kami K. Mori T. Kawaguchi Y. Fujimoto K. Hosotani R. Imamura M. N-cadherin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic carcinoma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). During EMT, a process called cadherin switching often happens (8.Wheelock M.J. Shintani Y. Maeda M. Fukumoto Y. Johnson K.R. Cadherin switching.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 9.Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Cadherin switching: essential for behavioral but not morphological changes during an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most normal epithelial tissues in which cells are polarized express the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin, whereas mesenchymal cells, which are more motile and less polarized, typically express N-cadherin (10.Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Cadherins as modulators of cellular phenotype.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). However, some cancer cells derived from epithelial tissues inappropriately express N-cadherin and lose E-cadherin function. Our laboratory has shown that N-cadherin expression by tumor cells promotes cell invasion and metastasis regardless of their E-cadherin expression (11.Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. N-cadherin promotes motility in human breast cancer cells regardless of their E-cadherin expression.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We found in pancreatic cancer cells, collagen I can mediate up-regulation of N-cadherin and a cell scattering morphological change through cooperative signals from α2β1-integrin and DDR1, thus promoting metastasis (5.Shintani Y. Fukumoto Y. Chaika N. Svoboda R. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Collagen I-mediated up-regulation of N-cadherin requires cooperative signals from integrins and discoidin domain receptor 1.J.

DDR1 is type I transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) activated by collagen, and it has a structure similar to many members of the RTK family (13.Vogel W. Discoidin domain receptors: structural relations and functional implications.FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, it is unique among RTKs because it is activated by binding to collagen through the N-terminal discoidin domain and by the unusually slow kinetics of activation (14.Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. The discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by collagen.Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The discoidin domain is followed by an extracellular (JM) membrane region, then a single transmembrane (TM) domain and a large cytosolic JM domain. A catalytic kinase domain follows the cytosolic JM domain and, at the very end, a short C-terminal tail. Transcripts from the DDR1 gene are reported to be alternatively spliced to generate five DDR1 protein isoforms (a–e). The isoforms termed DDR1a and DDR1b are the most widely distributed, whereas the others are much less common, and in addition isoforms d and e are predicted to lack kinase activity (15.Valiathan R.R. Marco M. Leitinger B. Kleer C.G. Fridman R. Discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinases: new players in cancer progression.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2012; 31: 295-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). DDR1a lacks a 37-residue segment present in the cytosolic juxtamembrane region of DDR1b. DDR1b thus contains two tyrosines (Tyr-513 and Tyr-520) missing in DDR1a. After phosphorylation, these tyrosines are reported to bind proteins such as Src homology and collagen homology 1 (Shc1) and c-src tyrosine kinase (Csk), respectively (14.Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. The discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by collagen.Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 16.Yang G. Li Q.

The current study was designed to identify the early steps in the signaling pathway that are initiated downstream of DDR1 when pancreatic cancer cells are exposed to collagen. Our experiments identified which isoform of DDR1 is responsible for collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin and also identified the proteins that interact with DDR1 to initiate the signaling pathway and the regions of the proteins necessary for signaling. We examined the expression of DDR1 and N-cadherin in tissues from human pancreatic cancer patients, comparing cancerous with uninvolved tissues (Fig. 1). The immunohistochemistry showed that both DDR1 and N-cadherin are up-regulated in primary pancreatic cancer tissues as well as in liver metastases. Moreover, we performed correlation analysis in both primary and metastatic sites and found that expression levels of DDR1 and N-cadherin in the cancerous tissues are highly correlated (Fig. 1c). We have shown that collagen I can activate DDR1 and induce the up-regulation of N-cadherin (5.Shintani Y. Fukumoto Y. Chaika N. Svoboda R. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Collagen I-mediated up-regulation of N-cadherin requires cooperative signals from integrins and discoidin domain receptor 1.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As noted above, DDR1a and DDR1b are the two major isoforms of DDR1. We first determined which isoforms are expressed in several pancreatic cancer cell lines by performing RT-PCR with primers flanking the alternatively spliced exon to semiquantitatively measure the mRNA levels of DDR1a and DDR1b. We found that both DDR1a and DDR1b are expressed in BxPC-3, T3M-4, and L3.6pl cells, and the expression levels of transcripts encoding DDR1a and DDR1b are similar (Fig. 2a). We then set out to test if both of them could mediate collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin. We used L3.6pl cells to dissect the details of the DDR1 signaling pathway because we found the response of these cells to collagen is primarily mediated by DDR1 arm of the pathway. We stably knocked down DDR1 in L3.6pl cells with a lentiviral shRNA targeting the 3′-UTR. DDR1 knockdown cells as well as control cells were plated on collagen I-coated dishes (Fig. 2b). We found that after DDR1 knockdown, collagen I failed to induce N-cadherin up-regulation when compared with the control. We then introduced either DDR1a-mEGFP or DDR1b-mEGFP in the DDR1 knockdown cell lines (Fig. 2b). We found that up-regulation of N-cadherin in response to collagen I was fully rescued in cells expressing DDR1b but not in cells expressing DDR1a. Protein kinases such as DDR1a and DDR1b have residues termed gatekeepers that limit access to the ATP-binding pocket (18.Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase.Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In DDR1a and DDR1b, the gatekeeper residues are Thr-664 and Thr-701, respectively. When the gatekeeper residues are mutated to Ala or Gly, the mutant kinases have larger ATP binding pockets than wild-type DDR1. As a result, the mutant enzymes ought to be more sensitive to protein kinase inhibitors such as 1NM-PP1 (19.Shokat K. Velleca M. Novel chemical genetic approaches to the discovery of signal transduction inhibitors.Drug Discov. Today. 2002; 7: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This approach allows the use of inhibitors such as 1NM-PP1 to mimic the effects of a specific DDR1 inhibitor. We mutated the gatekeeper residues in DDR1a and DDR1b to either Gly or Ala and expressed the mutants fused to monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) in PSN1 cells, a human pancreatic cancer cell line lacking endogenous DDR1 (Fig. 3a). The mutants with Gly in the gatekeeper position were no longer active (results not shown), whereas those with Ala in the gatekeeper position were activated by collagen. The collagen I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1a-mEGFP (T664A) and DDR1b-mEGFP (T701A) was inhibited by 1NM-PP1. Importantly, the collagen-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type DDR1a and DDR1b was not affected by the drug (Fig. 3a). We then performed a Boyden chamber assay with Matrigel-coated filters to test the effects of DDR1 with gatekeeper mutation on invasion of L3.6pl cells with endogenous DDR1 knocked down. We found DDR1b, but not DDR1a promoted cell invasion, and this invasion was inhibited by 1NM-PP1 (Fig. 3b). We plated the L3.6pl cells expressing the gatekeeper mutants on collagen I and found that in the presence of 1NM-PP1 DDR1b-mEGFP (T701A) failed to rescue the up-regulation of N-cadherin (Fig. 3d). The data show the kinase activity of DDR1b, but not DDR1a, is necessary to mediate collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin and to increase cell invasiveness. Recently, specific inhibitors of DDR1 have been developed (20.Li Y. Lu X. Ren X. Ding K. Small molecule discoidin domain receptor kinase inhibitors and potential medical applications.J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58: 3287-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Kim H.G. Tan L. Weisberg E.L. Liu F. Canning P. Choi H.G. Ezell S.A. Wu H. Zhao Z. Wang J. Mandinova A. Griffin J.D.

The specific inhibitor 7rh (22.Gao M. Duan L. Luo J. Zhang L. Lu X. Zhang Y. Zhang Z. Tu Z. Xu Y. Ren X. Ding K. Discovery and optimization of 3-(2-(pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethynyl)benzamides as novel selective and orally bioavailable discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 3281-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) inhibited collagen I-dependent up-regulation of N-cadherin (Fig. 3f), consistent with the results we obtained with 1NM-PP1 and the gatekeeper mutant form of DDR1b (Fig. 3d). As mentioned above, in pancreatic cancer cell lines we have shown collagen can signal through both integrins and DDR1 (5.Shintani Y. Fukumoto Y. Chaika N. Svoboda R. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Collagen I-mediated up-regulation of N-cadherin requires cooperative signals from integrins and discoidin domain receptor 1.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). L3.6pl cells respond to collagen almost exclusively through the DDR1 arm of this signaling pathway, whereas the inhibition seen with 7rh in T3M-4 was partial, presumably due to signaling through integrins (Fig. 3f). As we discussed earlier, due to alternative splicing, DDR1b has an extra 37-residue segment in the cytosolic juxtamembrane region, which includes two tyrosines (Tyr-513 and Tyr-520) that are lacking in DDR1a. Because DDR1 is a tyrosine kinase, we focused on these tyrosines and constructed the DDR1b-mEGFP Y513F, Y520F, and Y513F/Y520F (YFYF) mutants. The mutants as well as wild-type DDR1b-mEGFP were expressed in L3.6pl cells with endogenous DDR1 knocked down (Fig. 4a). We found that up-regulation of N-cadherin was fully restored only when Tyr-513 was intact. Previously we showed that activation of JNK1 is necessary for collagen I-dependent up-regulation of N-cadherin (5.Shintani Y. Fukumoto Y. Chaika N. Svoboda R. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Collagen I-mediated up-regulation of N-cadherin requires cooperative signals from integrins and discoidin domain receptor 1.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK1 is indicated by the phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 (23.Fleming Y. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N. Paterson A. Goedert M. Cohen P. Synergistic activation of stress-activated protein kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK1/JNK) isoforms by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and MKK7.Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In knockdown cells, we found JNK1 was activated in response to collagen I when the knockdown cells expressed DDR1b-mEGFP but not when they expressed DDR1b-mEGFP Y513F (Fig. 4c). This shows that Tyr-513 of DDR1b is critical for collagen I-induced signaling to JNK1 and the resulting up-regulation of N-cadherin. Because Tyr-513 is responsible for the collagen-I activated signaling pathway, we sought to determine which protein interacts with this residue to mediate the downstream signaling. Tyr-513 of human DDR1 is in the sequence NPAY. Many vertebrate species including Xenopus and Zebrafish have the sequence NPAY embedded in homologous sequences that are encoded by orthologous exons (not shown). Shc1 is a prototypical signaling adaptor with three isoforms, p66, p52, and p46, named according to relative molecular weight (24.Wills M.K. Jones N. Teaching an old dogma new tricks: twenty years of Shc adaptor signalling.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All three isoforms of Shc1 have a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which can bind to phosphotyrosine, as well as an N-terminal PTB domain, which also binds phosphotyrosine residues including phospho-Tyr-513 of DDR1b (14.Vogel W.

The two domains are connected by a central collagen homology 1 (CH1) region containing consensus tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated and serve as recognition motifs for other signaling effectors (24.Wills M.K. Jones N. Teaching an old dogma new tricks: twenty years of Shc adaptor signalling.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The three isoforms share the same PTB-CH1-SH2 region and are only different at their N termini (see Fig. 6a). p46Shc1 and p52Shc1 are generated from the same transcripts due to translation initiation at different start codons, whereas p66Shc1 is encoded by transcripts initiated from a different promoter (26.Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

To determine if Shc1 interacts with DDR1b in pancreatic cancer cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. Only DDR1b-mEGFP was co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to Shc1, and the interaction was collagen-dependent. Mutating Tyr-513 largely prevented the co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5a). This suggested there was a direct collagen-dependent interaction between Tyr-513 of DDR1b and Shc1. To determine if Shc1 was involved in the collagen I-induced signaling pathway leading to the up-regulation of N-cadherin, we knocked down Shc1 in L3.6pl cells with four different lentiviral shRNAs targeting the 3′-UTR, which is common to all the transcripts (Fig. 5b). We found that up-regulation of N-cadherin in response to collagen I was eliminated by knocking down Shc1 (Fig. 5c). We introduced p46Shc1, p52Shc1, or p66Shc1 into Shc1 knockdown cells and found that all three isoforms could rescue the up-regulation of N-cadherin induced by collagen I (Fig. 5e). Point mutations have been identified that inactivate the PTB and SH2 domains of Shc1 (24.Wills M.K. Jones N. Teaching an old dogma new tricks: twenty years of Shc adaptor signalling.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using the amino acid numbers from mouse p52Shc1 (NP_035498.2), R175Q inactivates the PTB domain, and R397K inactivates the SH2 domain (27.Northey J.J. Dong Z. Ngan E. Kaplan A. Hardy W.R. Pawson T.

We reintroduced 3× FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutated mouse p52Shc1 (R175Q, R397K, Y313F (mutant 1F), Y239F/Y240F (mutant 2F), Y239F/Y240F/Y313F (mutant 3F)) into L3.6pl cells with endogenous Shc1 knocked down and found that only the PTB domain of Shc1 is necessary for collagen I-dependent up-regulation of N-cadherin. Neither inactivation of the SH2 domain nor mutation of the tyrosine residues prevented up-regulation of N-cadherin (Fig. 6b). Because Tyr-513 is within the Shc1 PTB domain consensus binding motif LLSNPAY (29.Smith M.J. Hardy W.R. Murphy J.M. Jones N. Pawson T.

In the collagen I-induced up-regulation of N-cadherin signaling pathway, we have shown that Pyk2 is downstream of DDR1 (5.Shintani Y. Fukumoto Y. Chaika N. Svoboda R. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R.

Using endogenous proteins in L3.6pl cells, we observed collagen I-dependent association between DDR1 and Pyk2 (Fig. 7a, lanes 1 and 8).

The DDR1 knockdown cells were then stably infected with viruses encoding various DDR1 constructs (lanes 3–7 and 10–14). Cells were cultured on uncoated (w/o col I) or collagen-coated plates (col I) for 18 h. DDR1 was immunoprecipitated (IP), and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with antibodies to Pyk2 or DDR1.

https://openalex.org/W2517070929,"Evaluating the impact of a scholarly article is of great significance and has attracted great attentions. Although citation-based evaluation approaches have been widely used, these approaches face limitations e.g. in identifying anomalous citations patterns. This negligence would inevitably cause unfairness and inaccuracy to the article impact evaluation. In this study, in order to discover the anomalous citations and ensure the fairness and accuracy of research outcome evaluation, we investigate the citation relationships between articles using the following factors: collaboration times, the time span of collaboration, citing times and the time span of citing to weaken the relationship of Conflict of Interest (COI) in the citation network. Meanwhile, we study a special kind of COI, namely suspected COI relationship. Based on the COI relationship, we further bring forward the COIRank algorithm, an innovative scheme for accurately assessing the impact of an article. Our method distinguishes the citation strength, and utilizes PageRank and HITS algorithms to rank scholarly articles comprehensively. The experiments are conducted on the American Physical Society (APS) dataset. We find that about 80.88% articles contain contributed citations by co-authors in 26,366 articles and 75.55% articles among these articles are cited by the authors belonging to the same affiliation, indicating COI and suspected COI should not be ignored for evaluating impact of scientific papers objectively. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate COIRank algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-art solutions. The validity of our approach is verified by using the probability of Recommendation Intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2507826087,"Tropical forest conversion to pasture, which drives greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, remains a pressing socio-ecological challenge. This problem has spurred increased interest in the potential of small-scale agroforestry systems to couple sustainable agriculture with biodiversity conservation, particularly in rapidly developing areas of the tropics. In addition to providing natural resources (i.e. food, medicine, lumber), agroforestry systems have the potential to maintain higher levels of biodiversity and greater biomass than lower diversity crop or pasture systems. Greater plant diversity may also enhance soil quality, further supporting agricultural productivity in nutrient-limited tropical systems. Yet, the nature of these relationships remains equivocal. To better understand how different land use strategies impact ecosystem services, we characterized the relationships between plant diversity (including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity), and soil quality within pasture, agroforests, and secondary forests, three common land use types maintained by small-scale farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Nicaragua. The area is undergoing accelerated globalization following the 2007 completion of the region's first major road; a change which is expected to increase forest conversion for agriculture. However, farmer agrobiodiversity maintenance in the Basin was previously found to be positively correlated with affiliation to local agricultural NGOs through the maintenance of agroforestry systems, despite these farmers residing in the communities closest to the new road, highlighting the potential for maintaining diverse agroforestry agricultural strategies despite heightened globalization pressures. We found that agroforestry sites tended to have higher surface soil %C, %N, and pH relative to neighboring to secondary forest, while maintaining comparable plant diversity. In contrast, pasture reduced species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity. No significant relationships were found between plant diversity and the soil properties assessed; however higher species richness and phylodiversity was positively correlated with natural resource diversity. These finding suggest that small, diversified agroforestry systems may be a viable strategy for promoting both social and ecological functions in eastern Nicaragua and other rapidly developing areas of the tropics."

During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the interaction between liver resident macrophages and hepatocytes is a key component in liver innate immunity. In this study, we explored the role of exosomes in the delivery of innate anti-HCV factors to hepatocytes from macrophages. We showed that supernatant from TLR3-activated macrophage cultures could efficiently inhibit HCV replication in Huh7 cells. This macrophage-mediated anti-HCV activity was through exosomes because inhibiting exosomes could abrogate the action of macrophages. Further analyses demonstrated that TLR3-activated macrophages release exosomes that contain anti-HCV micro RNA (miRNA)-29 family members. Inhibiting miRNA29 could restore HCV replication. These findings suggest a novel antiviral mechanism in liver innate immunity against HCV infection and provide insights to support further studies on developing exosome-based delivery systemfor disease treatment.—Zhou, Y., Wang, X., Sun, L., Zhou, L., Ma, T.-C., Song, L.,Wu, J.-G., Li, J.-L., Ho, W.-Z.

Consistent with this asymptomatic clinical presentation, genital C. trachomatis infection of women generates robust TH2 immunity. As an animal model that modeled this response would be invaluable for delineating bacterial pathogenesis and human host defenses, herein we explored if pathogen-specific TH2 immunity is similarly elicited by intravaginal (ivag) infection of mice with oculogenital C. trachomatis serovars. Analogous to clinical infection, ascension of primary C. trachomatis infection into the mouse upper genital tract produced no obvious tissue damage. Clearance of ivag challenge infection was mediated by interferon (IFN)-γ-producing CD4+ T cells, while IFN-γ signaling blockade concomitant with a single ivag challenge promoted tissue damage by enhancing Chlamydia-specific TH17 immunity. Likewise, IFN-γ and IL-17 signaling blockade or CD4+ T cell depletion eliminated the genital pathology produced in untreated controls by multiple ivag challenge infections. Conversely, we were unable to detect formation of pathogen-specific TH2 immunity in C. trachomatis-infected mice. Together, our work revealed C. trachomatis infection of mice generates TH1 and TH17 immune responses that promote pathogen clearance and immunopathological tissue damage. Absence of Chlamydia-specific TH2 immunity in these mice newly highlights the need to identify experimental models of C. trachomatis genital infection that more closely recapitulate the human host response."
https://openalex.org/W2516472963,"The poor health status of the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, compared to its Eastern counterpart, Apis cerana, is remarkable. This has been attributed to lower pathogen prevalence in A. cerana colonies and to their ability to survive infestations with the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. These properties have been linked to an enhanced removal of dead or unhealthy immature bees by adult workers in this species. Although such hygienic behavior is known to contribute to honey bee colony health, comparative data of A. mellifera and A. cerana in performing this task are scarce. Here, we compare for the first time the removal of freeze-killed brood in one population of each species and over two seasons in China. Our results show that A. cerana was significantly faster than A. mellifera at both opening cell caps and removing freeze-killed brood. The fast detection and removal of diseased brood is likely to limit the proliferation of pathogenic agents. Given our results can be generalized to the species level, a rapid hygienic response could contribute to the better health of A. cerana. Promoting the fast detection and removal of worker brood through adapted breeding programs could further improve the social immunity of A. mellifera colonies and contribute to a better health status of the Western honey bee worldwide."

The mechanistic basis of NusG dependence of the Rho function is not known. Here, we describe Rho* mutants I168V, R221C/A, and P235H that do not require NusG for their termination function. These Rho* mutants have acquired new properties, which otherwise would have been imparted by NusG. A detailed analyses revealed that they have more stable interactions at the secondary RNA binding sites of Rho, which reduced the lag in initiating its ATPase as well as the translocase activities. These more stable interactions arose from the significant spatial re-orientations of the P, Q, and R structural loops of the Rho central channel. We propose that NusG imparts similar conformational changes in the central channel of Rho, yielding faster isomerization of the open to the closed hexameric states of the latter during its RNA-loading step. This acceleration stabilizes the Rho-RNA interactions at many terminators having suboptimal rut sites, thus making Rho-NusG interactions so essential in vivo Finally, identification of the NusG binding sites on the Rho hexamer led us to conclude that the former exerts its effect allosterically."
https://openalex.org/W2516202125,"Objectives With the present study we wanted to explore the impact of treatment with a tumor necrosis factor-α -inhibitor (TNFi) on levels of soluble biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and to identify predictors of impaired drug levels and development of anti-TNFi antibodies (anti-TNFi Abs). Methods Blood samples from 26 patients with established RA were taken at baseline and following 6 months of treatment with adalimumab or infliximab. Samples were analyzed for levels of TNFi, interleukin (IL)-6, and soluble TNF-receptors 1 and -2 (sTNF-R1 and -2) and for presence of anti-TNFi Abs. Clinical and demographic data were recorded as well. Results During the initial 6 months treatment, DAS28(CRP) (Disease activity score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein) and levels of IL-6 and sTNF-R2 decreased significantly in patients without anti-TNFi Abs and in patients retaining detectable drug levels. The levels of other tested cytokines (TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-1ra, IL-1b, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-33) were generally below detection limits. Higher baseline levels of IL-6 associated with undetectable levels of TNFi at follow-up. Anti-TNFi Abs were associated with decreased drug levels, but no predictors for anti-TNFi Ab development could be found. Conclusion The effect of treatment with TNFi on RA disease activity depends on levels of active drug, and by presence of anti-TNFi Abs. In patients who retain detectable drug levels, and in the absence of anti-TNFi Abs, clinical outcome is improved during treatment, and circulating levels of IL-6 and sTNF-R2 decrease. Baseline levels of IL-6 may predict depletion of TNFi and may identify patients at risk of treatment failure."

With GPRP present, the flux of thrombin increased to ∼0.5 × 10−12 nmol/μm2-s over the first 500 s of perfusion and then further increased by ∼2–3-fold over the next 300 s. The increased thrombin flux after 500 s was blocked by anti-FXIa antibody (O1A6), consistent with thrombin-feedback activation of FXI. Over the first 500 s, ∼92,000 molecules of thrombin were generated per surface TF molecule for the 250-μm-long coating. A single layer of platelets (obtained with αIIbβ3 antagonism preventing continued platelet deposition) was largely sufficient for thrombin production. Also, the overall thrombin-generating potential of a 1000-μm-long coating became less efficient on a per μm2 basis, likely due to distal boundary layer depletion of platelets. Overall, thrombin is robustly generated within clots by the extrinsic pathway followed by late-stage FXIa contributions, with fibrin localizing thrombin via its antithrombin-I activity as a potentially self-limiting hemostatic mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2513075299,"The red palm weevil (RPW, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus), one of the most widespread of all invasive insect pest species, is a major cause of severe damage to economically important palm trees. RPW exhibits behaviors very similar to those of its sympatric species, the Asian palm weevil (R. vulneratus), which is restricted geographically to the southern part of Southeast Asia. Although efficient and sustainable control of these pests remains challenging, olfactory-system disruption has been proposed as a promising approach for controlling palm weevils. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of an olfactory co-receptor (Orco) from R. ferrugineus (RferOrco) and R. vulneratus (RvulOrco) and examine the effects of RferOrco silencing (RNAi) on odorant detection. RferOrco and RvulOrco encoding 482 amino acids showing 99.58% identity. The injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from RferOrco into R. ferrugineus pupae significantly reduced RferOrco gene expression and led to the failure of odor-stimulus detection, as confirmed through olfactometer and electroantennography (EAG) assays. These results suggest that olfactory-system disruption leading to reduced pheromone detection holds great potential for RPW pest-control strategies."

In addition, H. pylori KatA is ubiquitous, present in both the cytoplasm and in the periplasm and on the cell surface as well as being readily detected (like Msr) extracellularly (7.Benoit S.L.

Taken together, this information (reactivity toward HOCl; presence of multiple Msr-repairable Met residues, enzyme abundance) caused us to investigate the possibility that the catalase primary sequence or composition represents a Met-recycling sink providing oxidant protection per se to this bacterium. This Met-mediated quenching role would be separate from the enzyme's catalytic role, and no such whole cell protective mechanism has yet been assigned to any protein. However, the possibility that a Met-rich protein could exist to serve a protective oxidant-quenching role (via cyclic turnover of Met residues) was raised 20 years ago (10.Levine R.L. Berlett B.S.

Ageing Dev. 1999; 107: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11.Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Methionine residues as endogenous antioxidants in proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), but results to support this have been unavailable. While our study identifies a new oxidant protective mechanism for catalase, the model organism we use, H. pylori, is an important pathogen. Although this bacterium is known to be the agent of human gastritis, which can develop into peptic ulcer disease (12.Blaser M.J. The role of Helicobacter pylori in gastritis and its progression to peptic ulcer disease.Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 9: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), factors that allow it to persist in the host need to be identified, as such persistence is responsible for the most severe outcomes of the infection, namely gastric and duodenal cancers (13.Sipponen P. Hyvärinen H. Seppälä K. Blaser M.J. Review article: Pathogenesis of the transformation from gastritis to malignancy.Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 12: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In response to H. pylori infection, the host produces a battery of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2̇̄), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (•HO), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Indeed, exposure of gastric cells (14.Bagchi D. Bhattacharya G. Stohs S.J. Production of reactive oxygen species by gastric cells in association with.Helicobacter pylori. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or phagocytes (15.Ramarao N. Gray-Owen S.D. Meyer T.F. Helicobacter pylori induces but survives the extracellular release of oxygen radicals from professional phagocytes using its catalase activity.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to H. pylori increases host cell ROS production, and H. pylori-infected patients show elevated levels of ROS (16.Davies G.R. Simmonds N.J. Stevens T.R. Sheaff M.T. Banatvala N. Laurenson I.F. Blake D.R. Rampton D.S. Helicobacter pylori stimulates antral mucosal reactive oxygen metabolite production in vivo.Gut. 1994; 35: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). HOCl is produced in large amounts by neutrophil myeloperoxidases; its concentration can reach up to 5 mm at inflammatory sites (17.Weiss S.J. Tissue destruction by neutrophils.N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar), and it is 100 times more toxic than H2O2 (18.Handa O. Naito Y. Yoshikawa T. Helicobacter pylori: a ROS-inducing bacterial species in the stomach.Inflamm. Res. 2010; 59: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HOCl primarily targets sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met), and indeed these residues are the preferred amino acids for oxidation under physiological conditions (19.Hawkins C.L. Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Hypochlorite-induced oxidation of amino acids, peptides and proteins.Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Met oxidation by HOCl and similar small molecule oxidants (superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) leads to formation of Met-O in many proteins, and further oxidation results in methionine sulfone formation within the peptides, and either oxidized form at Met residues can lead to protein dysfunction (20.Achilli C. Ciana A. Minetti G. The discovery of methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes: an historical account and future perspectives.BioFactors. 2015; 41: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Oxidation of Met residues within a protein can “protect” other susceptible residues in that same protein from oxidation (5.Kim G. Weiss S.J. Levine R.L. Methionine oxidation and reduction in proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but documentation of Met-containing residues within a protein to act as antioxidants in whole cell physiology is unavailable. Here, we address the roles of a catalase protein devoid of catalytic activity to provide oxidative stress protection. To investigate whether catalase can quench oxidants independently of its H2O2 removal activity, we engineered two H. pylori mutants to synthesize only apo-catalase, e.g. devoid of catalase activity. Based on the published crystal structure of H. pylori catalase, two residues are essential for catalysis as follows: the proximal Tyr-339, coordinated to the heme iron, and the distal His-56, essential for the formation of the main reaction intermediate, compound I (21.Loewen P.C. Carpena X. Rovira C. Ivancich A. Perez-Luque R. Haas R. Odenbreit S. Nicholls P. Fita I.

Biophys. 2012; 525: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, two markerless chromosomal katA mutant versions, katAH56A and katAY339A, were constructed in two H. pylori wild-type (WT) strains, strain 43504 and the mouse colonizing strain X47 (23.Kleanthous H. Tibbitts T.J. Gray H.L. Myers G.A. Lee C.K. Ermak T.H. Monath T.P. Sterilizing immunity against experimental Helicobacter pylori infection is challenge-strain dependent.Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4883-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Complete deletion of ΔkatA mutants were also constructed in both parental strains. When grown on plates, colonies of ΔkatA mutants, as well as katAH56A and katAY339A site-directed mutants, displayed strikingly different phenotypes compared with their individual parental strain (43504 or X47). While wild-type colonies were dark brown, the mutant strains were light brown (katAH56A) or yellow (katAY339A or ΔkatA) in color, suggesting that the heme b cofactor binding might be either disturbed (katAH56A) or even lacking (katAY339A or ΔkatA). Catalase assays revealed both 43504 ΔkatA and X47 ΔkatA mutants, as well as isogenic katAH56A and katAY339A site-directed mutants, had no detectable catalase activity (Table 1). However, catalase was still synthesized in both katAH56A and katAY339A strains, albeit to lower levels than WT (Fig. 1, A and B). No catalase protein was detected in ΔkatA gene deletion strains (Fig. 1, A and B).TABLE 1Catalase activity of purified KatA proteins and wild-type and mutant H. pylori strainsProteinaCatalase activity was measured as μmol of H2O2/min/μg of protein.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the respective involvement of each residue in the heme-binding ability of the Helicobacter H2O2-dissipating enzyme (24.Hazell S.L. Evans Jr., D.J. Graham D.Y. Helicobacter pylori catalase.J Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we likewise studied specific mutant versions. KatAH56A and KatAY339A as well as the native catalase KatAWT (control) were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. Purified proteins were phenotypically different. KatAWT was light brown; KatAH56A was dark brown, and KatAY339A was colorless (Fig. 2A). When protein samples were loaded on a gel in a non-reducing buffer without prior heating, both KatAWT and KatAH56A ran as apparent tetramers (apparent molecular mass above 200 kDa) (Fig. 2B), in agreement with previous studies (3.Mahawar M. Tran V. Sharp J.S. Maier R.J. Synergistic roles of Helicobacter pylori methionine sulfoxide reductase and GroEL in repairing oxidant-damaged catalase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19159-19169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24.Hazell S.L. Evans Jr., D.J. Graham D.Y. Helicobacter pylori catalase.J Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By contrast, KatAY339A was unable to tetramerize. When subjected to reducing conditions and boiling, KatAWT, KatAH56A, and KatAY339A proteins migrated as monomers with an apparent molecular mass below 60 kDa, in agreement with their calculated mass (58.6 kDa). Catalase activity of the purified KatAH56A was less than 1% of the activity of purified KatAWT, although KatAY339A had no detectable activity (Table 1). The three proteins were analyzed by UV-visible scan spectrophotometry (Fig. 2C). A heme b-specific absorption Soret peak centered at λ = 410 nm was observed for KatAWT; this peak was shifted for KatAH56A (λ = 402 nm) and was essentially absent for KatAY339A, indicating that the heme b environment is modified in KatAH56A, and it is abolished in KatAY339A protein. These results were expected based on heme ligands predicted from the crystal structure (21.Loewen P.C. Carpena X. Rovira C. Ivancich A. Perez-Luque R. Haas R. Odenbreit S. Nicholls P. Fita I. Structure of Helicobacter pylori catalase, with and without formic acid bound, at 1.6 A resolution.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3089-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22.Alfonso-Prieto M. Vidossich P. Rovira C. The reaction mechanisms of heme catalases: an atomistic view by ab initio molecular dynamics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2012; 525: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that HOCl reacts with H. pylori catalase, leading to catalase oligomerization, methionine oxidation, and enzyme inactivation (3.Mahawar M. Tran V. Sharp J.S. Maier R.J. Synergistic roles of Helicobacter pylori methionine sulfoxide reductase and GroEL in repairing oxidant-damaged catalase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19159-19169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether purified wild-type or variant catalase could quench HOCl, subsequently protecting H. pylori cells from oxidant-mediated death, non-growing H. pylori 43504 WT cells were incubated either with PBS buffer, or with HOCl, or with HOCl that had been pre-incubated for 15 min with either purified KatAWT, purified KatAH56A, or purified KatAY339A. In addition, two unrelated protein controls, HypC (high Met content, 6%) and UreE (low Met content, 1%), were included in the study. Exposure to HOCl only (no protein added) killed all the cells, e.g. we could not recover any CFU following this treatment (n = 3) (Fig. 3). In contrast, when HOCl was incubated with purified native or either variant catalase, the final CFU count was in the same range as the PBS only control, indicating that each purified catalase protein, whether active (KatAWT) or inactive (KatAH56A and KatAY339A), can protect H. pylori in vitro against the deadly effect of the oxidant (Fig. 3). When the same experiment was repeated with decreasing concentrations of catalase, cell survival rates decreased accordingly; however, there was no significant difference in protection between the native (WT) and mutant versions of KatA (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of HypC to the HOCl mixture conferred levels of protection similar to catalase, whereas addition of UreE was not protective, suggesting a correlation between Met content and HOCl quenching. This protective effect is apparently independent of Msr and Met recycling, as the Msr repair mixture was not added for this experiment. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the oxidant quenching capacity of catalase that is inherent in its sequence and independent of its catalytic activity. A previous biochemical study almost 30 years ago suggested that pure bovine catalase, at high concentration, and either active or azide-inactivated, could protect bovine α1-antiproteinase enzyme against inactivation by HOCl (25.Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Action of hypochlorous acid on the antioxidant protective enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase.Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); but it was concluded the heme ring of catalase likely reacted with HOCl to somehow dissipate the oxidant. To determine whether holo- or apo-catalase can protect H. pylori cells against HOCl in vivo, disk inhibition assays with HOCl were conducted using wild-type strain 43504 as well as ΔkatA, katAH56A, and katAY339A mutant strains (Fig. 4). In addition, because Msr was shown to interact with and repair KatA in H. pylori (3.Mahawar M. Tran V. Sharp J.S. Maier R.J.

Methionine sulfoxide reductase in Helicobacter pylori: interaction with methionine-rich proteins and stress-induced expression.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5839-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Δmsr single mutants, as well as Δmsr ΔkatA, Δmsr katAH56A, and Δmsr katAY339A double mutants were included in this study. The sensitivity (diameter of inhibition) of the ΔkatA mutant was significantly greater than the parental strain (43504) or the mutant strains katAH56A and katAY339A (p < 0.01, ANOVA). There was no significant difference between WT, katAH56A, and katAY339A strains (Fig. 4). These results suggest that catalase, even when inactive and lacking the heme moiety, enables H. pylori cells to combat HOCl. In addition, Δmsr single mutants were significantly (p < 0.01) more sensitive to HOCl than the WT strain, in agreement with previously published results (26.Benoit S.L. Bayyareddy K. Mahawar M. Sharp J.S. Maier R.J. Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase repair by Helicobacter pylori methionine sulfoxide reductase.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 5396-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Double mutants ΔkatA Δmsr, katAH56A Δmsr, and katAY339A Δmsr were also more sensitive than WT (p < 0.01). Mean diameters of inhibition for katAH56A Δmsr and katAY339A Δmsr were significantly greater than those of their respective parental backgrounds, e.g. katAH56A and katAY339A (p < 0.01), confirming the importance of Msr in repairing HOCl-oxidized Met-O residues. The ΔkatA Δmsr double mutant strain was as sensitive to HOCl as the ΔkatA mutant strain, suggesting that absence of catalase protein is the single most important factor contributing to HOCl sensitivity. The ability of katAH56A and katAY339A mutant strains to colonize the gastric mucosa of mice was investigated. Each mutant were orally given to mice, and their colonization levels after 3 weeks were compared with those obtained with the wild-type strain (X47) and the ΔkatA catalase negative mutant (Fig. 5). The WT strain was able to colonize 11 mice (n = 14 total), with an average of 1.34 × 106 CFU recovered per g of colonized stomach. In contrast, the ΔkatA deletion mutant was detected in only one mouse (n = 10 total), and the colonization load was low (5.5 × 103 CFU per g). Interestingly, the site-directed katAH56A catalase mutant was able to colonize 10 mice (n = 12 total), with an average CFU number of 5.7 × 105 CFU per g of colonized stomach, although the site-directed katAY339A catalase (heme-deficient) mutant successfully colonized 5 out of 10 mice, with an average of 1.1 × 106 CFU per g of colonized stomach. Colonization counts for both katAH56A and katAY339A mutants were not significantly different from those obtained for the WT, while ΔkatA deletion mutants had significantly lower counts compared with the other three strains. To rule out an effect of the presence of the KSF cassette on the colonization-deficient phenotype of ΔkatA::KSF mutants, we constructed a markerless X47 ΔkatA deletion mutant strain (see under “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, those mutants had no measurable catalase activity, and catalase could not be detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). In addition, mouse colonization assays revealed those markerless ΔkatA mutants were unable to colonize mice (no CFU detected, n = 4), although the X47 parental strain (WT control) colonized all inoculated mice (n = 4, average colonization of 3.9 × 105 CFU per g of stomach), therefore confirming that the lack of colonization by ΔkatA::KSF was likely due to the absence of the katA gene, rather than the presence of the KSF cassette. Taken together, these results suggest that catalase is critical for combating oxidants in vivo, and this does not depend on H2O2 dismutation catalytic activity. Results from a previous study suggested that katA was only needed for long-term colonization (24 weeks) in mice, as there was no significant difference (between the wild-type strain and a ΔkatA null mutant) in colonization after 8 days or 12 weeks (27.Harris A.G. Wilson J.E. Danon S.J. Dixon M.F. Donegan K. Hazell S.L. Catalase (KatA) and KatA-associated protein (KapA) are essential to persistent colonization in the Helicobacter pylori SS1 mouse model.Microbiology. 2003; 149: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, a major difference between that study and ours is the H. pylori parent strain (mouse colonizer) used. SS1 was used as parental strain in the previous study, and this strain is known to preferentially colonize the mouse stomach antrum (27.Harris A.G. Wilson J.E. Danon S.J. Dixon M.F. Donegan K. Hazell S.L. Catalase (KatA) and KatA-associated protein (KapA) are essential to persistent colonization in the Helicobacter pylori SS1 mouse model.Microbiology. 2003; 149: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By contrast, in this study, we used X47, a strain that is unrelated to SS1, and whose primary tropism is the mouse stomach corpus (28.Akada J.K. Ogura K. Dailidiene D. Dailide G. Cheverud J.M. Berg D.E. Helicobacter pylori tissue tropism: mouse-colonizing strains can target different gastric niches.Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, differences in oxidative stress levels between the corpus and the antrum, combined with genetic differences between SS1 and X47, are likely to account for the different outcomes in both colonization assays. At least two independent studies have suggested that catalase is a good vaccine candidate for prevention of gastric ulcers and cancers (29.Miyashita M. Joh T. Watanabe K. Todoroki I. Seno K. Ohara H. Nomura T. Miyata M. Kasugai K. Tochikubo K. Itoh M. Nitta M.

Hazell S.L. Kolesnikow T. Doidge C. Lee A. Catalase, a novel antigen for Helicobacter pylori vaccination.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one such study, 90% of the mice were protected from H. pylori (SS1 strain) colonization by raising anti-KatA antisera (30.Radcliff F.J. Hazell S.L. Kolesnikow T. Doidge C. Lee A. Catalase, a novel antigen for Helicobacter pylori vaccination.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strong protective immunization effect is another indication of the importance of this Met-containing enzyme. It would be of interest to assess whether the Helicobacter catalase could be detected in the mucus (i.e. extracellular to the bacterium) of infected animals, and if so, what downstream affects this catalase may have on the microflora. More than 100 years after the initial report describing catalase activity (1.Loew O. A new enzyme of general occurrence in organismis.Science. 1900; 11: 701-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we now know its physiological importance in at least one organism is due to an additional mechanism. The finding that inactive catalase was protective to the bacterium was not expected, but it was nevertheless hypothesized based on the known susceptibility of its Met residues to oxidation and to (Msr-mediated) turnover. It is possible this new role can only be documented in Helicobacter, as the bacterium makes a large amount of catalase, and the mouse model is a facile way to assess viability in a natural stress environment. We do not know whether the cyclic turnover (oxidation and repair) of catalase occurs extracellularly or in the host mucous lining, but the oxidant quenching must occur to some extent, and both enzymes (Msr and catalase) are readily detected outside the (Helicobacter) cell (at least in vitro).

https://openalex.org/W2518065896,"We estimated the disability weights in the South Korean population by using a paired comparison-only model wherein 'full health' and 'being dead' were included as anchor points, without resorting to a cardinal method, such as person trade-off. The study was conducted via 2 types of survey: a household survey involving computer-assisted face-to-face interviews and a web-based survey (similar to that of the GBD 2010 disability weight study). With regard to the valuation methods, paired comparison, visual analogue scale (VAS), and standard gamble (SG) were used in the household survey, whereas paired comparison and population health equivalence (PHE) were used in the web-based survey. Accordingly, we described a total of 258 health states, with 'full health' and 'being dead' designated as anchor points. In the analysis, 4 models were considered: a paired comparison-only model; hybrid model between paired comparison and PHE; VAS model; and SG model. A total of 2,728 and 3,188 individuals participated in the household and web-based survey, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the disability weights of health states between the GBD 2010 study and the current models were 0.802 for Model 2, 0.796 for Model 1, 0.681 for Model 3, and 0.574 for Model 4 (all P-values<0.001). The discrimination of values according to health state severity was most suitable in Model 1. Based on these results, the paired comparison-only model was selected as the best model for estimating disability weights in South Korea, and for maintaining simplicity in the analysis. Thus, disability weights can be more easily estimated by using paired comparison alone, with 'full health' and 'being dead' as one of the health states. As noted in our study, we believe that additional evidence regarding the universality of disability weight can be observed by using a simplified methodology of estimating disability weights."

Interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) are a broad gene family induced by Type I interferons, often as a response to viral infections, which evokes extensive immunomodulation.

Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of circulating neutrophils isolated from patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 19) were used to characterize ISG expression. Hierarchical clustering of expression identified 3 distinct subject groups with Low, Mid and High ISG expression. ISG accounting for the greatest variability in expression were identified (MX1, IFIT1, and ISG15) and used to analyze a prospective cohort at the Colorado ARDS Network site. One hundred twenty ARDS patients from four urban hospitals were enrolled within 72 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation. Circulating neutrophils were isolated from patients and expression of ISG determined by PCR. Samples were stratified by standard deviation from the mean into High (n = 21), Mid, (n = 82) or Low (n = 17) ISG expression. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with High or Low ISG expression to those with Mid-range expression. At enrollment, there were no differences in age, gender, co-existing medical conditions, or type of physiologic injury between cohorts. After adjusting for age, race, gender and BMI, patients with either High or Low ISG expression had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those in the Mid for number of 28-day ventilator- and ICU-free days (P = 0.0006 and 0.0004), as well as 90-day mortality and 90-day home with unassisted breathing (P = 0.02 and 0.004). These findings suggest extremes of ISG expression by circulating neutrophils from ARDS patients recovered early in the syndrome are associated with poorer clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2952073259,"Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by global and local anthropogenic stressors such as rising seawater temperature, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, and overfishing. Although many studies have investigated the impacts of local and global stressors on coral reefs, we still do not fully understand how these stressors influence coral community structure, particularly across environmental gradients on a reef system. Here, we investigate coral community composition across three different temperature and productivity regimes along a nearshore-offshore gradient on lagoonal reefs of the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). A novel metric was developed using ultra-high-resolution satellite-derived estimates of sea surface temperatures (SST) to classify reefs as exposed to low (lowTP), moderate (modTP), or high (highTP) temperature parameters over 10 years (2003 to 2012). Coral species richness, abundance, diversity, density, and percent cover were lower at highTP sites relative to lowTP and modTP sites, but these coral community traits did not differ significantly between lowTP and modTP sites. Analysis of coral life history strategies revealed that highTP sites were dominated by hardy stress-tolerant and fast-growing weedy coral species, while lowTP and modTP sites consisted of competitive, generalist, weedy, and stress-tolerant coral species. Satellite-derived estimates of Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were obtained for 13-years (2003-2015) as a proxy for primary production. Chl-a concentrations were highest at highTP sites, medial at modTP sites, and lowest at lowTP sites. Notably, thermal parameters correlated better with coral community traits between site types than productivity, suggesting that temperature (specifically number of days above the thermal bleaching threshold) played a greater role in defining coral community structure than productivity on the MBRS. Dominance of weedy and stress-tolerant genera at highTP sites suggests that corals utilizing these two life history strategies may be better suited to cope with warmer oceans and thus may warrant protective status under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2511474588,"Currently, fifteen bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types have been identified and classified into four genera: Deltapapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus, Dyoxipapillomavirus, and Xipapillomavirus. Here, the complete genome sequence of a new BPV type (BPV 04AC14) recovered from a papillomatous lesion is reported. The genome is 7,282 bp in length and exhibits the classic genetic organization and motifs of the members of Papillomaviridae. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed that BPV 04AC14 clusters with members of the Xipapillomavirus genus. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 capsid protein of the novel BPV is closely related to its counterpart, BPV3, with which it shares 79% similarity. These findings suggest that this virus is a new BPV type of the Xipapillomavirus genus."
https://openalex.org/W2510853225,"Simultaneous and proportional myocontrol of dexterous hand prostheses is to a large extent still an open problem. With the advent of commercially and clinically available multi-fingered hand prostheses there are now more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs) in prostheses than can be effectively controlled using surface electromyography (sEMG), the current standard human-machine interface for hand amputees. In particular, it is uncertain, whether several DOFs can be controlled simultaneously and proportionally by exclusively calibrating the intended activation of single DOFs. The problem is currently solved by training on all required combinations. However, as the number of available DOFs grows, this approach becomes overly long and poses a high cognitive burden on the subject. In this paper we present a novel approach to overcome this problem. Multi-DOF activations are artificially modelled from single-DOF ones using a simple linear combination of sEMG signals, which are then added to the training set. This procedure, which we named LET (Linearly Enhanced Training), provides an augmented data set to any machine-learning-based intent detection system. In two experiments involving intact subjects, one offline and one online, we trained a standard machine learning approach using the full data set containing single- and multi-DOF activations as well as using the LET-augmented data set in order to evaluate the performance of the LET procedure. The results indicate that the machine trained on the latter data set obtains worse results in the offline experiment compared to the full data set. However, the online implementation enables the user to perform multi-DOF tasks with almost the same precision as single-DOF tasks without the need of explicitly training multi-DOF activations. Moreover, the parameters involved in the system are statistically uniform across subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2510907068,"The south coast of Java has warmed at a much lower rate than adjacent ocean locations over the last three decades (1982-2015). This behavior can be observed during the upwelling season (July-October) and it is especially patent in August and September when upwelling attains the highest values. Although different warming rates (ocean-coast) had been previously observed in other areas around the world, this behavior was always linked to situations where upwelling increased or remained unchanged. South Java warming is observed at ocean locations and cooling near shore but under a scenario of decreasing upwelling (~30% in some cases). The origin of coastal cooling is due to changes in the vertical structure of the water column. A vein of subsurface water, which has cooled at a rate higher than 0.3°C per decade, is observed to enter from the northwestern part of the study area following the South Java Current. This water only manifests at surface near coast, where it is pumped up by coastal upwelling."

Demineralised bone matrix promotes healing of the tendon-bone interface but its role in the treatment of tendon tears with retraction has not been investigated. We hypothesized that cortical demineralised bone matrix used with minimally manipulated mesenchymal stem cells will result in improved function and restoration of the tendon-bone interface with no difference between xenogenic and allogenic scaffolds.In an ovine model, the patellar tendon was detached from the tibial tuberosity and a complete distal tendon transverse defect measuring 1 cm was created. Suture anchors were used to reattach the tendon and xenogenic demineralised bone matrix + minimally manipulated mesenchymal stem cells (n = 5), or allogenic demineralised bone matrix + minimally manipulated mesenchymal stem cells (n = 5) were used to bridge the defect. Graft incorporation into the tendon and its effect on regeneration of the enthesis was assessed using histomorphometry. Force plate analysis was used to assess functional recovery.Compared to the xenograft, the allograft was associated with significantly higher functional weight bearing at 6 (P = 0.047), 9 (P = 0.028), and 12 weeks (P = 0.009). In the allogenic group this was accompanied by greater remodeling of the demineralised bone matrix into tendon-like tissue in the region of the defect (p = 0.015), and a more direct type of enthesis characterized by significantly more fibrocartilage (p = 0.039). No failures of tendon-bone healing were noted in either group.Demineralised bone matrix used with minimally manipulated mesenchymal stem cells promotes healing of the tendon-bone interface in an ovine model of acute tendon retraction, with superior mechanical and histological results associated with use of an allograft."

No specific and effective treatment is available for patients with these infections, creating a need for the development of new therapies. Recombinant lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis was engineered to bind Shiga toxin by displaying novel designed albumin binding domains (ABD) against Shiga toxin 1 B subunit (Stx1B) on their surface. Functional recombinant Stx1B was produced in Escherichia coli and used as a target for selection of 17 different ABD variants (named S1B) from the ABD scaffold-derived high-complex combinatorial library in combination with a five-round ribosome display. Two most promising S1Bs (S1B22 and S1B26) were characterized into more details by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis. Addition of S1Bs changed the subcellular distribution of Stx1B, completely eliminating it from Golgi apparatus most likely by interfering with its retrograde transport. All ABD variants were successfully displayed on the surface of L. lactis by fusing to the Usp45 secretion signal and to the peptidoglycan-binding C terminus of AcmA. Binding of Stx1B by engineered lactococcal cells was confirmed using flow cytometry and whole cell ELISA. Lactic acid bacteria prepared in this study are potentially useful for the removal of Shiga toxin from human intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2508075175,"Although the remobilization of vegetative nitrogen (N) and post-silking N both contribute to grain N in maize (Zea mays L.), their regulation by grain sink strength is poorly understood. Here we use 15N labeling to analyze the dynamic behaviors of both pre- and post-silking N in relation to source and sink manipulation in maize plants. The results showed that the remobilization of pre-silking N started immediately after silking and the remobilized pre-silking N had a greater contribution to grain N during early grain filling, with post-silking N importance increasing during the later filling stage. The amount of post-silking N uptake was largely driven by post-silking dry matter accumulation in both grain as well as vegetative organs. Prevention of pollination during silking had less effect on post-silking N uptake, as a consequence of compensatory growth of stems, husk + cob and roots. Also, leaves continuously export N even though grain sink was removed. The remobilization efficiency of N in the leaf and stem increased with increasing grain yield (hence N requirement). It is suggested that the remobilization of N in the leaf is controlled by sink strength but not the leaf per se. Enhancing post-silking N uptake rather than N remobilization is more likely to increase grain N accumulation."

Here we report a breed-specific model to successfully perform the detection of SNPs in the pituitary gland of young growing bulls representing Polish Holstein-Friesian (HF), Polish Red, and Hereford breeds at three developmental ages viz., six months, nine months, and twelve months. A total of 18 bovine pituitary gland polyA transcriptome libraries were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequenced FastQ databases of all 18 young bulls were submitted to NCBI-SRA database with NCBI-SRA accession numbers SRS1296732. For the investigated young bulls, a total of 113,882,3098 raw paired-end reads with a length of 156 bases were obtained, resulting in an approximately 63 million paired-end reads per library. Breed-wise, a total of 515.38, 215.39, and 408.04 million paired-end reads were obtained for Polish HF, Polish Red, and Hereford breeds, respectively. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) read alignments showed 93.04%, 94.39%, and 83.46% of the mapped sequencing reads were properly paired to the Polish HF, Polish Red, and Hereford breeds, respectively. Constructed breed-specific SNP-db of three cattle breeds yielded at 13,775,885 SNPs. On an average 765,326 breed-specific SNPs per young bull were identified. Using two stringent filtering parameters, i.e., a minimum 10 SNP reads per base with an accuracy ≥ 90% and a minimum 10 SNP reads per base with an accuracy = 100%, SNP-db records were trimmed to construct a highly reliable SNP-db. This resulted in a reduction of 95,7% and 96,4% cut-off mark of constructed raw SNP-db. Finally, SNP discoveries using RNA-Seq data were validated by KASP™ SNP genotyping assay. The comprehensive QTLs/CGs analysis of 76 QTLs/CGs with RNA-seq data identified KCNIP4, CCSER1, DPP6, MAP3K5 and GHR CGs with highest SNPs hit loci in all three breeds and developmental ages. However, CAST CG with more than 100 SNPs hits were observed only in Polish HF and Hereford breeds.These findings are important for identification and construction of novel tissue specific SNP-db and breed specific SNP-db dataset by screening of putative SNPs according to QTL db and candidate genes for bovine growth and reproduction traits, one can develop genomic selection strategies for growth and reproductive traits."
https://openalex.org/W2511557968,"Objective The insulin-pancreatic acinar axis may play a major role in pancreatic function. Amylase is an exocrine enzyme that is produced by pancreatic acinar cells, and low serum amylase levels may be associated with endocrine diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes. We hypothesized that low serum amylase levels may be associated with impaired islet β cell function in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the serum amylase levels and islet β cell function in patients with early type 2 diabetes. Methods The cross-sectional study recruited 2327 patients with a mean of 1.71±1.62 years since their diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and all participants were treated with lifestyle intervention alone. Serum amylase levels, the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and metabolic risk factors were examined in all participants. The insulin sensitivity index (Matsuda index, ISIMatsuda) and insulin secretion index (ratio of total area-under-the-insulin-curve to glucose-curve, AUCins/glu) were derived from the OGTT. Integrated islet β cell function was assessed by the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) (ISIMatsuda multiplied by AUCins/glu). Results Serum amylase levels in the normal range were significantly correlated with ISIMatsuda, AUCins/glu and ISSI-2 (r = 0.203, 0.246 and 0.413, respectively, p<0.001). The association of the serum amylase levels with ISSI-2 (adjusted r = 0.363, p<0.001) was closer than the association with ISIMatsuda (adjusted r = 0.191, p<0.001) and AUCins/glu (adjusted r = 0.174, p<0.001) after adjusting for the anthropometric indices, time since the diagnosis of diabetes, lipid profiles, uric acid levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HbA1c levels, smoking and drinking using the partial correlation test. After adjusting for these metabolic risk factors in the multivariate regression analysis with the amylase levels as the dependent variable, ISSI-2 was the major independent contributor to the serum amylase levels (β = 0.416, t = 21.72, p<0.001). Meanwhile, in a comparison of the groups with the highest and lowest quartiles of serum amylase levels, the mean difference in logISSI-2 was 0.902 (95% CI 0.823 to 0.982), and after adjusting for metabolic risk factors, the mean difference in logISSI-2 was 0.610 (0.537 to 0.683). Conclusions Serum amylase levels in the normal range are positively associated with integrated islet β cell function in patients with early type 2 diabetes, as assessed by ISSI-2."
https://openalex.org/W2508047161,"Introduction In an African setting surgery is generally accepted as the treatment of first choice for glaucoma. A problem with trabeculectomy surgery for the glaucomas is the frequent co-existence and exacerbation of cataract. We report a randomized controlled trial to compare the use of beta radiation with 5FU in combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. Participants and Methods Consenting adults aged >40 years with glaucoma, an IOP>21mmHG and cataract were enrolled and randomised to receive either 1000cG β radiation application or sub-conjunctival 5fluorouracil (5FU) at the time of combined trabeculectomy and phaco-emulsification with lens implant surgery. Results 385 individuals were eligible for inclusion of whom 301 consented to inclusion in the study (one eye per patient). 150 were randomised to the 5FU arm and 151 received β radiation. In the 12 months following surgery there were 40 failures (IOP>21mmHg) in the 5FU arm and 34 failures in the beta arm. The hazard ratio for the beta radiation arm compared to the 5FU arm, adjusted for IOP at baseline, was 0.83 (95% c.i. 0.54 to 1.28; P = 0.40). The improvement from mean presenting visual acuities of 0.91 and 0.86 logMAR to 0.62 and 0.54 in the 5FU and beta arms respectively was comparable between groups (P = 0.4 adjusting for baseline VA). Incidence of complications did not differ between the two groups. Discussion This study highlights several important issues in the quest for a therapeutic strategy for the glaucomas in an African context. Firstly, there is no evidence of an important difference between the use of 5FU and beta radiation as an anti-metabolite in phacotrabeculectomy. Secondly phacotrabeculectomy is a successful operation that improves visual acuity as well as controlling IOP in a majority of patients. Although the success of trabeculectomy in lowering IOP is reduced when combined with phacoemulsification compared with trabeculectomy alone, this finding has to be set against the possible need for subsequent cataract surgery following trabeculectomy alone, which represents a second trip and expense for the patient and results in 10–61% failure of the trabeculectomy at one year post-cataract surgery.

https://openalex.org/W2516282184,"Warfarin oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) requires regular and frequent drug adjustment monitored by INR. Interindividual variability, drug and diet interferences, and genetics (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) make the maintenance/reaching of stable INR a not so easy task. HPLC assessment of warfarin/enantiomers was suggested as a valid monitoring-tool along with INR, but definite results are still lacking. We evaluated possible correlations between INR, warfarin/3'-hydroxywarfarin, and drug weekly dosage aimed at searching novel alternatives to OAT monitoring. VKORC1/CYP2C9 pharmacogenetics investigation was performed to account for the known influence on warfarin homeostasis.133 OAT patients were recruited and assessed for warfarin/3'-hydroxywarfarin serum levels (HPLC), INR, and VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes. A subgroup of 52 patients were monitored in detail (5 consecutive controls; c0-c4) till the target INR was reached. Correlation analyses were performed in both groups.In the whole OAT group both warfarin and 3'-hydroxywarfarin correlate with INR at comparable degree (r2 = 0.0388 and 0.0362 respectively). Conversely, warfarin weekly dosage better correlates with warfarin than with 3'-hydroxywarfarin (r2 = 0.0975 and r2 = 0.0381 respectively), but considering together warfarin plus 3'-hydroxywarfarin the correlation strongly increased (r2 = 0.1114; p<0.0001). Interestingly, 3'-hydroxywarfarin reached a strong correlation at c4 respect to warfarin (r2 = 0.2157 and r2 = 0.0549; p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0944 respectively) seeming less affected by drug adjustments in the subgroup of 52 patients who started OAT. The multivariate analyses aimed at estimating the true contribution of 3'-hydroxywarfarin on INR value ascribed it the unique significant value (p = 0.0021) in spite of warfarin who lost association. The pharmacogenetics studies confirmed that patients carrying the VKORC1 variant-allele required lower warfarin maintenance dosage and that the combination of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 yielded a warfarin responsive index (WRI) inversely related to the number variant alleles.Our results overall suggest that 3'-hydroxywarfarin monitoring could be of great advantage in INR monitoring respect to classical warfarin assessment showing significant contribution also in multivariate analysis. Therefore, additional active metabolites should be recognized and investigated as novel useful indicators."

However, whether this type of cross-regulation is part of the cyclic nucleotide signaling repertoire that controls AMPAR trafficking has yet to be determined. We hypothesize that PDE2 is an effector of cGMP signaling to regulate AMPAR dynamics and part of a cross-regulation signaling motif with other PDEs possessing cGMP degradation activity. MSNs express several PDEs families with a wide range of kinetic properties (24.Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J.

The complexity of cyclic nucleotide signaling makes it difficult to intuit the effect each PDEs has on observed AMPAR trafficking. Here we use a systems pharmacology approach, extending our previous computational model of dopamine signaling and AMPAR trafficking to investigate the role of cGMP on dopamine-induced AMPAR trafficking (39.Song R.S. Massenburg B. Wenderski W. Jayaraman V. Thompson L. Neves S.R. ERK regulation of phosphodiesterase 4 enhances dopamine-stimulated AMPA receptor membrane insertion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15437-15442Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We present a novel mechanism of how cGMP may be controlling striatal AMPAR trafficking in response to DA via the cross-regulation of PDEs. We show that increases in cGMP (either by enhancing cGMP production or decreasing cGMP degradation) result in PDE2 activation, leading to a reduction in DA-induced cAMP levels and AMPAR insertion. We also show that the interplay of PDE1 and PDE2 activities results in the counterintuitive regulation of cAMP levels and AMPAR response. MSNs express a number of PDEs that could potentially affect surface expression of GluA1-containing AMPAR (24.Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. Greengard P. Heintz N. A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We have previously shown the involvement of PDE4 (39.Song R.S. Massenburg B. Wenderski W. Jayaraman V. Thompson L. Neves S.R.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15437-15442Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in dopamine-mediated AMPAR trafficking in MSNs. Here we examined the role of PDE2, a highly enriched striatal PDE, in DA-induced GluA1 surface insertion using a pHluorin (SEP)-based imaging approach (40.Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E.

Glutamate receptor exocytosis and spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2000-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). First, we explored the contribution of PDE2 activity to DA-induced GluA1 surface insertion. After a stable baseline, we treated neurons with a D1R agonist (A68930, added at t = 0 min) and observed an increase in GluA1 surface insertion (Fig. 1A). After 10 min, we added the PDE2-specific inhibitor BAY60-7550, inducing a further increase in surface GluA1 levels. BAY60-7550 alone had no effect on GluA1 surface insertion, indicating that increasing cAMP levels induced by basal adenylyl cyclase activity may not be sufficient to drive GluA1 surface insertion (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that PDE2, by increasing cAMP signaling (Fig. 1C), is a regulator of dopamine-stimulated GluA1 trafficking in D1 MSNs. Because the pool of cAMP controlled by PDE2 could modulate surface GluA1 levels, we explored whether the cGMP-dependent allosteric activation of PDE2 activity could result in removal of surface GluA1. However, this cGMP regulation of PDE2 depends on a number of factors: the cellular levels of cGMP and cAMP, the affinity of cGMP for the allosteric site on PDE2, the cellular concentration of PDE2, and the catalytic activity of PDE2. Furthermore, reports that recombinant GAF domains can bind cGMP with high affinity, the activation constant for PDE2 is much higher (∼0.2–0.5 μm) (43.Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Identification of a noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain conserved in both the cGMP-stimulated and photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 44.Martinez S.E. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosophodiesterases in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2007: 55-78Google Scholar). Based on all of these variables, it is challenging to intuitively predict the effect of cGMP on PDE2 activity and GluA1 trafficking. In other words, given the affinity of cGMP for the allosteric site on PDE2, could biologically relevant changes to cGMP levels affect PDE2 activity sufficiently to have an impact on GluA1 trafficking? To answer this, we developed a dynamic model of PDE2 regulation of AMPAR trafficking in D1 MSNs by building upon our previous model (39.Song R.S. Massenburg B. Wenderski W. Jayaraman V. Thompson L. Neves S.R. ERK regulation of phosphodiesterase 4 enhances dopamine-stimulated AMPA receptor membrane insertion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15437-15442Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The novel connectivity (consisting of a detailed representation of PDE2 and its regulation by cGMP and PDE1 activity) is depicted in Fig. 2A (16.Noyama K. Maekawa S.

Blount M.A. Corbin J.D. Mammalian cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: molecular mechanisms and physiological functions.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 651-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). First, we constrained any unknown parameters to recapitulate the PDE2 inhibition increase in GluA1 surface insertion (supplemental Fig. S2A) and the cGMP-dependent activation of PDE2 (supplemental Fig. S2B) (22.Surapisitchat J. Jeon K.I. Yan C. Beavo J.A. Differential regulation of endothelial cell permeability by cGMP via phosphodiesterases 2 and 3.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Then we used the model to explore the effect of cGMP activation of PDE2 on surface GluA1 levels. We first probed the contribution of cGMP on surface GluA1 levels by simultaneously varying the concentration of PDE2 and cGMP. We calculated and plotted the area under the curve (AUC) from the resulting time course of GluA1 surface insertion (Fig. 2B) as a function of PDE2 and cGMP concentration (Fig. 2C). The AUC value was color-coded, with white representing no change from CT (dopamine stimulation of D1R), red representing an increase in surface AMPAR levels above CT levels (surface insertion), and blue representing a decrease in surface AMPAR levels below CT (surface removal). The resulting simulations show that, because of the activation of PDE2 by cGMP, an increase in cGMP results in a robust decrease in surface GluA1 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, a decrease in PDE2 levels (comparable with PDE2 inhibition) can reverse this effect on surface GluA1. This suggests that the balance between the cellular cGMP levels and PDE2 activity can determine the directionality of AMPAR trafficking. Next we wanted to gain insight into whether inhibiting a PDE with cGMP degradation activity could activate PDE2 activity and induce a decrease in surface AMPAR levels. This is an important question, as enhancing the basal cellular levels of cGMP may not be sufficient to support PDE2 activation. A possible candidate is PDE1, an MSN-enriched PDE with a preference for cGMP (24.Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. Greengard P. Heintz N.

Das S.B. Lakshmikuttyamma A. Selvakumar P. Shrivastav A. Regulation of calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE1): review.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 18: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar). We explored the role of PDE1 in AMPAR trafficking by varying the concentrations of PDE1 and PDE2 and plotting the AUC of the resulting time courses of GluA1 surface insertion as a function of PDE2 and PDE1 concentration (Fig. 2D). In these simulations, decreasing PDE1 levels resulted in a loss of surface GluA1. This suggested that inhibition of PDE1 could be a possible mechanism to enhance basal levels of cGMP and activate PDE2 to decrease surface GluA1 levels. We implemented two parallel approaches to modulate cellular levels of cGMP to experimentally test whether the predicted cGMP allosteric activation of PDE2 does indeed regulate GluA1 trafficking: increasing cGMP production by directly activating soluble guanylyl cyclase using NO donors and inhibiting cGMP degradation using the PDE1 inhibitor, MMPX. Based on the simulation results, we expected that cGMP-activated PDE2, because of its substrate specificity, would promote the preferential degradation of cAMP, resulting in a decrease in PKA activity and DA-induced GluA1 insertion. First, we increased cGMP levels using S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), an NO donor. As expected, SNAP treatment of D1 MSNs led to a rapid increase in cGMP (Fig. 3A). SNAP treatment also decreased cAMP levels, and this effect could be reversed with co-treatment with a PDE2 inhibitor (Fig. 3B), suggesting that cGMP enhanced the degradation activity of PDE2 as described previously (36.Lin D.T. Fretier P. Jiang C. Vincent S.R. Nitric oxide signaling via cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase in striatal neurons.Synapse. 2010; 64: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37.Polito M. Klarenbeek J. Jalink K. Paupardin-Tritsch D. Vincent P. Castro L.R. The NO/cGMP pathway inhibits transient cAMP signals through the activation of PDE2 in striatal neurons.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SNAP induced the removal of D1-induced surface GluA1 (Fig. 3C), and co-treatment with a PDE2 inhibitor rescued the SNAP-induced deficit, suggesting that PDE2 activation by cGMP contributes to the action of SNAP on GluA1 trafficking. The change in cAMP displayed similar temporal dynamics as those observed with GluA1 trafficking, further supporting the notion that the mode of action of SNAP on GluA1 trafficking is by augmenting cAMP degradation because of PDE2 activation. SNAP alone failed to affect surface GluA1 levels, indicating that G-protein signaling is required for cGMP regulation of GluA1 trafficking. Based on our simulation results, we predicted that PDE1 inhibition could enhance basal cGMP levels and activate PDE2, bringing about a reduction of cAMP levels and GluA1 surface insertion. Indeed, as expected, treatment with the PDE1 inhibitor MMPX increased cGMP levels (Fig. 4A) with a concomitant decrease in D1R-induced cAMP levels (Fig. 4B). Co-application of a PDE2 inhibitor reversed the PDE1 inhibition effect on cAMP (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the PDE1-induced increase in cGMP resulted in an activation of PDE2, and thus the interplay of PDE1 and PDE2 activities could regulate cAMP levels. Moreover, this cross-regulation of PDE1 and PDE2 also affected GluA1 surface expression, as PDE1 inhibition resulted in a decrease in GluA1 surface levels that was rescued by co-application of a PDE2 inhibitor (Fig. 4C). Most of our data that implicate PDE1 and PDE2 activity in the regulation of AMPAR trafficking were obtained using pharmacological agents that may have off-target actions. To address this concern, we expressed mutated forms of PDE2 lacking cGMP regulation (D485A) or catalytic activity (PDE2DN) in lieu of PDE2 pharmacological inhibition. Mutation D485A abolishes the ability of the GAF domain to bind cGMP and displays no allosteric regulation (21.Stangherlin A. Gesellchen F. Zoccarato A. Terrin A. Fields L.A. Berrera M. Surdo N.C.

https://openalex.org/W2518530930,"Dermatosis often as a chronic disease requires effective long-term treatment; a comprehensive evaluation of mental health of dermatology drug does not receive enough attention. An interaction between dermatology and psychiatry has been increasingly described. Substantial evidence has accumulated that psychological stress can be associated with pigmentation, endocrine and immune systems in skin to create the optimal responses against pathogens and other physicochemical stressors to maintain or restore internal homeostasis. Additionally, given the common ectodermal origin shared by the brain and skin, we are interested in assessing how disruption of skin systems (pigmentary, endocrine and immune systems) may play a key role in brain functions. Thus, we selected three drugs (hydroquinone, isotretinoin, tacrolimus) with percutaneous excessive delivery to respectively intervene in these systems and then evaluate the potential neurotoxic effects. Firstly, C57BL/6 mice were administrated a dermal dose of hydroquinone cream, isotretinoin gel or tacrolimus ointment (2%, 0.05%, 0.1%, respectively, 5 times of the clinical dose). Behavioral testing was performed and levels of proteins were measured in the hippocampus. It was found that mice treated with isotretinoin or tacrolimus, presented a lower activity in open-field test and obvious depressive-like behavior in tail suspension test. Besides, they damaged cytoarchitecture, reduced the level of 5-HT-5-HT1A/1B system and increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the hippocampus. To enable sensitive monitoring the dose-response characteristics of the consecutive neurobehavioral disorders, mice received gradient concentrations of hydroquinone (2%, 4%, 6%). Subsequently, hydroquinone induced behavioral disorders and hippocampal dysfunction in a dose-dependent response. When doses were high as 6% which was 3 times higher than 2% dose, then 100% of mice exhibited depressive-like behavior. Certainly, 6% hydroquinone exposure elicited the most serious impairment of hippocampal structure and survival. The fact that higher doses of hydroquinone are associated with a greater risk of depression is further indication that hydroquinone is responsible for the development of depression. These above data demonstrated that chronic administration of different dermatology drugs contributed into common mental distress. This surprising discovery of chemical stressors stimulating the hippocampal dysfunction, paves the way for exciting areas of study on the cross-talk between the skin and the brain, as well as is suggesting how to develop effective and safe usage of dermatological drugs in daily practice."

As the most prominent community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in Taiwan, CC59 has two major clones characterized as PVL-negative SCCmec IV (carrying the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IV but Panton-Valentine leukocidin-negative) and PVL-positive SCCmec V (5C2&5). We investigated the drug resistance, phylogeny and the distribution and sequence variation of SCCmec, staphylococcal bacteriophage φSA3, genomic island νSaβ and MES (an enterococcal mobile genetic element conferring multidrug resistance) in 195 CC59 S. aureus. Sequencing and PCR mapping revealed that all of the CC59/SCCmec V (5C2&5) MRSA strains had acquired MESPM1 or its segregants, and obtained a φSA3-related fragment in νSaβ. In contrast, MES6272-2 and MES4578, which showed gentamicin resistance that was not encoded by MESPM1, were dominant in SCCmec IVg MRSA. Translocation of a whole φSA3 into νSaβ instead of only a φSA3-related fragment was common in SCCmec IVg MRSA. However, the non-subtype-g SCCmec IV MRSA (SCCmec IVa is the major) still carried MES and νSaβ structures similar to those in SCCmec V (5C2&5) MRSA. A minimum spanning tree constructed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis revealed that SCCmec IVg MRSA and SCCmec V (5C2&5) MRSA grouped respectively in two major clades. The CC59 MSSA was equally distributed among the two clades, while the non-subtype-g SCCmec IV MRSA mostly clustered with SCCmec V (5C2&5) MRSA. Our findings strongly suggest that CC59 MSSA acquired divergent mobile genetic elements and evolved to SCCmec IVg MRSA and SCCmec V (5C2&5) MRSA/non-subtype-g SCCmec IV MRSA independently. The evolutionary history of CC59 S. aureus explains how mobile genetic elements increase the antimicrobial resistance and virulence and contribute to the success of CA-MRSA in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2507896805,"Introduction Reliable prospective estimates of annual severe acute malnutrition (SAM) caseloads for treatment are needed for policy decisions and planning of quality services in the context of competing public health priorities and limited resources. This paper compares the reliability of SAM caseloads of children 6–59 months of age in Niger estimated from prevalence at the start of the year and counted from incidence at the end of the year. Methods Secondary data from two health districts for 2012 and the country overall for 2013 were used to calculate annual caseload of SAM. Prevalence and coverage were extracted from survey reports, and incidence from weekly surveillance systems. Results The prospective caseload estimate derived from prevalence and duration of illness underestimated the true burden. Similar incidence was derived from two weekly surveillance systems, but differed from that obtained from the monthly system. Incidence conversion factors were two to five times higher than recommended. Discussion Obtaining reliable prospective caseloads was challenging because prevalence is unsuitable for estimating incidence of SAM. Different SAM indicators identified different SAM populations, and duration of illness, expected contact coverage and population figures were inaccurate. The quality of primary data measurement, recording and reporting affected incidence numbers from surveillance. Coverage estimated in population surveys was rarely available, and coverage obtained by comparing admissions with prospective caseload estimates was unrealistic or impractical. Conclusions Caseload estimates derived from prevalence are unreliable and should be used with caution. Policy and service decisions that depend on these numbers may weaken performance of service delivery. Niger may improve SAM surveillance by simplifying and improving primary data collection and methods using innovative information technologies for single data entry at the first contact with the health system. Lessons may be relevant for countries with a high burden of SAM, including for targeted emergency responses."
https://openalex.org/W2508861790,"In an age already saturated with information, the ongoing revolution in mobile computing has expanded the realm of immediate information access far beyond our homes and offices. In addition to changing where people can access information, mobile computing has changed what information people access—from finding specific directions to a restaurant to exploring nearby businesses when on the go. Does this ability to instantly gratify our information needs anytime and anywhere have any bearing on how much we trust those around us—from neighbors to strangers? Using data from a large nationally representative survey (World Values Survey: Wave 6), we found that the more people relied on their mobile phones for information, the less they trusted strangers, neighbors and people from other religions and nationalities. In contrast, obtaining information through any other method—including TV, radio, newspapers, and even the Internet more broadly—predicted higher trust in those groups.

https://openalex.org/W2513071705,"Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the effects of diagnostic discordance with or without a thoracolumbar spine lateral view X-ray in patients with osteoporosis. Methods We randomly enrolled 368 women over 65 years old (74.3 ± 6.0 years) from Tianliao Township in 2009 (response rate: 75.7%). A diagnosis of osteoporosis was confirmed using one of these criteria: (1) a history of non-traumatic fracture, (2) vertebral fractures based on a thoracolumbar spine lateral view X-ray, or (3) a bone mineral density T-score ≤ -2.5 for the total hip, the femoral neck, the lumbar spine, or all 3 sites. The prevalence of osteoporosis in three groups was compared based on Model I (criteria 1+2) vs. Model II (criteria 1+3) vs. Model III (criteria 1+2+3). The role of thoracolumbar X-ray reflected by the diagnostic discordance of osteoporosis between Models II and III was evaluated. Results The overall prevalence of osteoporosis was 78.3% (Model III, age-standardized 78.1%). The diagnostic discordance was 17.4% in the 368 participants. A logistic regression model showed that age was negatively associated with diagnostic discordance (odds ratio [OR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88–0.98, p < 0.05), but body mass index was positively associated (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00–1.15, p < 0.05). Conclusions A thoracolumbar spine lateral view X-ray should be added for women ≥ 65 years old or with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 to minimize the diagnostic discordance in osteoporosis, especially in highly endemic regions."

We present results from two example systems, firstly an active isotropic fluid boundary consisting of particles that can bind and unbind from the interface and generate surface tension gradients through active contractility. Secondly, a droplet filled with an active polar fluid with { homeotropic} anchoring at the droplet interface. These two systems demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking and steady state dynamics resembling cell motility and division and show complex feedback mechanisms with minimal degrees of freedom. The simulations outlined here will be useful for quantifying the wide range of dynamics observable in these active systems and modelling the effects of confinement in a consistent and adaptable way."
https://openalex.org/W2515440774,"Yersinia pestis Caf1 is a multifunctional protein responsible for antiphagocytic activity and is a key protective antigen. It is generally conserved between globally distributed Y. pestis strains, but Y. pestis subsp. microtus biovar caucasica strains circulating within populations of common voles in Georgia and Armenia were reported to carry a single substitution of alanine to serine. We investigated polymorphism of the Caf1 sequences among other Y. pestis subsp. microtus strains, which have a limited virulence in guinea pigs and in humans. Sequencing of caf1 genes from 119 Y. pestis strains belonging to different biovars within subsp. microtus showed that the Caf1 proteins exist in three isoforms, the global type Caf1NT1 (Ala48 Phe117), type Caf1NT2 (Ser48 Phe117) found in Transcaucasian-highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci #4-7, and a novel Caf1NT3 type (Ala48 Val117) endemic in Dagestan-highland natural plague focus #39. Both minor types are the progenies of the global isoform. In this report, Caf1 polymorphism was analyzed by comparing predicted intrinsic disorder propensities and potential protein-protein interactivities of the three Caf1 isoforms. The analysis revealed that these properties of Caf1 protein are minimally affected by its polymorphism. All protein isoforms could be equally detected by an immunochromatography test for plague at the lowest protein concentration tested (1.0 ng/mL), which is the detection limit. When compared to the classic Caf1NT1 isoform, the endemic Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 had lower immunoreactivity in ELISA and lower indices of self- and cross-protection. Despite a visible reduction in cross-protection between all Caf1 isoforms, our data suggest that polymorphism in the caf1 gene may not allow the carriers of Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 variants escaping from the Caf1NT1-mediated immunity to plague in the case of a low-dose flea-borne infection."

The mechanisms by which pathogens invade the ocular site, however, are unclear. Under normal circumstances, vascular endothelium and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which possess a well developed tight junction complex, form the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) to prevent pathogen invasion. We hypothesize that disruption of the BRB allows pathogen entry into ocular sites. The hypothesis was tested using in vitro models. We discovered that human RPE cells could bind to either HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins or HIV-1 viral particles. Furthermore, the binding was mediated by dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) expressed on RPE cells. Upon gp120 binding to DC-SIGN, cellular NF-κB signaling was triggered, leading to the induction of matrix metalloproteinases, which subsequently degraded tight junction proteins and disrupted the BRB integrity. DC-SIGN knockdown or prior blocking with a specific antibody abolished gp120-induced matrix metalloproteinase expression and reduced the degradation of tight junction proteins.

Other than HIV-1 and AIDS-associated opportunistic pathogens, Ebola virus had been detected in ocular tissues among survivors during convalescence (18.Bwaka M.A. Bonnet M.J. Calain P. Colebunders R.

One patient manifested severe unilateral uveitis during convalescence from Ebola; viable amounts of Ebola virus were detected in aqueous humor at the onset of disease as well as 9 weeks after the clearance of viremia (19.Varkey J.B.

How pathogens invade the ocular tissues and cause diseases is poorly understood. The human retina is a highly specialized neural tissue located at the posterior of the eye between the vitreous body and the choroid (20.Gardner T.W. Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. LaNoue K.F.

Antonetti D.A. Vascular permeability in ocular disease and the role of tight junctions.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is comprised of vascular cells, pigment epithelium, neurons, and microglia or resident macrophages that are organized into distinct layers. Both the vascular endothelium and RPE possess a well developed tight junction complex to form the BRB, which confers a stringent control of solute and fluid permeability and maintains the appropriate environment for a functional retina (21.Erickson K.K. Sundstrom J.M. Antonetti D.A. Vascular permeability in ocular disease and the role of tight junctions.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The tight junction complex includes the tight junction and adherens junction. Tight junctions form an apical impermeable barrier to fluid (22.Tietz S. Engelhardt B.

Molecular perspective on tight-junction assembly and epithelial polarity.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 815-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although many proteins contribute to the formation of the tight junction, the major types are transmembrane proteins, including claudins, occludins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), and the intracellular scaffolding protein zonula occludens (ZO) family (22.Tietz S. Engelhardt B. Brain barriers: crosstalk between complex tight junctions and adherens junctions.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24.González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Tight junction proteins.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The transmembrane proteins are linked to the cytoskeleton via an interaction with the ZO family of scaffolding proteins. The adherens junctions, such as endothelial cadherin-based or nectin-based adherens junctions, are essential for development of the barrier function and influence formation of the tight junction (22.Tietz S. Engelhardt B. Brain barriers: crosstalk between complex tight junctions and adherens junctions.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23.Miyoshi J. Takai Y.

HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 mediates viral entry by binding to receptors on host cells. Notably, gp120 can induce the degradation of tight junction proteins in human brain microvascular endothelial cells and has been associated with increased permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) during progressive HIV-1-associated dementia (25.Ricardo-Dukelow M.

Annunziata P. Circulating gp120 alters the blood-brain barrier permeability in HIV-1 gp120 transgenic mice.Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 330: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Treatment with HIV-1 gp120 down-regulated the expression of tight junction proteins in human RPE cells and led to increased monolayer permeability and consequent translocation of HIV-1 and bacteria across the epithelium (31.Tan S. Duan H. Xun T. Ci W. Qiu J. Yu F. Zhao X. Wu L. Li L. Lu L. Jiang S. Liu S. HIV-1 impairs human retinal pigment epithelial barrier function: possible association with the pathogenesis of HIV-associated retinopathy.Lab. Invest. 2014; 94: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which gp120 down-regulates tight junction proteins remains elusive. In this study, we found that HIV-1 gp120 or viral particles could be captured by human RPE cells through binding to DC-SIGN expressed on their surface. The binding then triggered cellular NF-κB signaling for the induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which degraded tight junction proteins and thus caused disruption of BRB integrity. These data elucidate a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 invades intraocular tissues and suggests a common pathway for ocular invasion by pathogens. ARPE-19 is a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line. To evaluate whether ARPE-19 cells have the molecular basis for interacting with HIV-1, we first examined their expression of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 and co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as well as the DC-SIGN molecule, which has been demonstrated previously to mediate HIV-1 binding (32.Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. DC-SIGN, a dendritic cell-specific HIV-1-binding protein that enhances trans-infection of T cells.Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). The results from flow cytometry showed that APRE-19 cells expressed DC-SIGN and CCR5 but not CD4 and CXCR4 (Fig. 1A). Next we investigated whether HIV-1 can bind to ARPE-19 cells. VLPs pseudotyped with envelope proteins from HIV-1 JRFL was used as a representative of the HIV virion, and the VLP/ΔEnv that do not incorporate HIV-1 envelope proteins were used as a control for monitoring nonspecific binding. At 4 °C, 23% of cells displayed Gag-GFP+, whereas nonspecific control VLP/ΔEnv showed less than 2% binding (Fig. 1B). The results from three independent repeats are summarized in Fig. 1C. To confirm the envelope-dependent binding, we examined the binding of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein to ARPE-19 cells and found that both HIV-1 JRFL and HXB2-dervied gp120 glycoprotein bound to these cells (Fig. 1D). When the temperature was increased to 37 °C to enable endocytosis, there was increased VLP/JRFL uptake, and more than 72.6% of cells showed Gag-GFP+ (Fig. 1E). Trypsin treatment could significantly but not completely remove the capture of VLPs, suggesting that both surface binding and internalization of viruses occurred (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HIV-1 VLPs can bind to ARPE-19 cells. The DC-SIGN molecule has been demonstrated previously to mediate HIV-1 binding (32.Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. DC-SIGN, a dendritic cell-specific HIV-1-binding protein that enhances trans-infection of T cells.Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). We next evaluated the role of the DC-SIGN molecule in the capture of VLP. Cells were pretreated with an anti-DC-SIGN-specific antibody and then pulsed with VLP. The results showed that blocking of DC-SIGN diminished VLP capture at 4 °C, resulting in a decrease in the percentage and MFI value for the Gag-GFP+ cell population (Fig. 2, A and B). When the DC-SIGN gene was knocked out by the CRISPR/Cas9 targeting system (Fig. 2, C and D), the binding of gp120 glycoprotein was dramatically decreased to the basal level (Fig. 2E); the same was true for the binding of VLP/JRFL or VLP/HXB2 to cells (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate the crucial role of DC-SIGN molecules in mediating the capture of VLPs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DC-SIGN molecules expressed on the surface of these cells mediate VLP binding through the interaction with viral envelope glycoprotein. The disruption of PRE barrier integrity was associated with the down-regulation of several tight junction proteins (21.Erickson K.K. Sundstrom J.M. Antonetti D.A. Vascular permeability in ocular disease and the role of tight junctions.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 31.Tan S. Duan H. Xun T. Ci W. Qiu J. Yu F. Zhao X.

Invest. 2014; 94: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gp120 glycoprotein can induce the down-regulation of tight junction proteins in human RPE cells (31.Tan S. Duan H. Xun T. Ci W. Qiu J. Yu F. Zhao X. Wu L. Li L. Lu L. Jiang S. Liu S. HIV-1 impairs human retinal pigment epithelial barrier function: possible association with the pathogenesis of HIV-associated retinopathy.Lab. Invest. 2014; 94: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It would be logical to see whether the same is true in ARPE-19 cells. To do this, we cultured ARPE-19 cells in the presence of gp120 glycoprotein for 48 h and then monitored the expression of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Claudin-5, Occludin, and JAM-2. Both gp120 glycoproteins derived from either HIV-1 JRFL or HXB2 down-regulated the expression of ZO-1, Claudin-5, Occludin, and JAM-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Intriguingly, blocking with anti-DC-SIGN antibody before the addition of gp120 prevented the down-regulation of these tight junction proteins (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that gp120 binding to DC-SIGN triggered downstream signaling involved in the modulation of tight junction protein expression. Gp120 glycoproteins-induced disruption of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin was also observed under confocal microscopy (Fig. 3D). Notably, knockdown of DC-SIGN abolished the gp120-induced disruption of these tight junction proteins (Fig. 3D). Together, these data demonstrate that gp120 glycoprotein induces down-regulation of tight junction proteins on RPE cells through the interaction with DC-SIGN. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that require calcium to function. They are responsible for degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and tight junction proteins. Increased expression of MMPs is well documented in various neurological disorders (33.Singh D. Srivastava S.K. Chaudhuri T.K. Upadhyay G. Multifaceted role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).Front.

HIV-1 gp120 can induce the expression of MMPs, resulting in disruption of BBB tight junctions (26.Louboutin J.P. Strayer D.S.

To investigate whether gp120 could also induce MMPs in ARPE-19 cells, we treated them with recombinant gp120 glycoprotein derived from HIV-1 JRFL. The expression of MMPs was measured at both transcription and translation levels. Gp120 glycoprotein treatment induced a 10- to 15-fold increase of MMP2 and MMP9, mRNA levels (Fig. 4, A and B) and markedly increased their protein expression (Fig. 4C). Coincidentally, treatment with gp120 also significantly induced expression of the inflammation factors IL-8, CCL-2, and TNF-α (Fig. 4A). To prove the role of the DC-SIGN-gp120 interaction in the induction of MMPs, an anti-DC-SIGN-specific antibody was used to treat ARPE-19 cells before the addition of gp120 protein. The treatment abolished the induction of MMP2 and MMP9 (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, when the DC-SIGN gene was knocked out by the CRISPR/Cas9 targeting system, treatment with gp120 glycoprotein was no longer able to induce MMP2 and MMP9 expression (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate that the binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN induces the expression of MMPs. To verify the role of induced MMPs in the down-regulation of tight junction proteins of RPE cells, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs, GM 6001, was used during gp120 treatment. The results show that the addition of GM6001 prevented gp120-induced down-regulation of the tight junction proteins ZO-1, Claudin-5, Occludin, and JAM-2 (Fig. 4E), confirming the role of MMPs in gp120-induced down-regulation of tight junction proteins. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN induces MMP expression and that MMPs are responsible for the down-regulation of tight junction proteins. The binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN could induce varied cellular signaling, including that of the NF-κB pathway (36.Chen Y. Hwang S.L. Chan V.S. Chung N.P. Wang S.R. Li Z. Ma J. Lin C.W. Hsieh Y.J.

HIV-1 gp120 protein downregulates Nef induced IL-6 release in immature dendritic cells through interplay of DC-SIGN.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e59073Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of this signaling pathway, we added gp120 to RPE cells and observed the induction of NF-κB activation, as demonstrated by the elevated phosphorylation of IKK-α/β and degradation of the inhibitory IκB subunit (Fig. 5A). To validate the role of the NF-κB pathway in gp120-induced expression of MMPs, an NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was used during the gp120 treatment. It has been reported that PDTC prevents the dissociation of inhibitory subunit IκB from NF-κB in the cytoplasm and thus suppresses the translocation of active NF-κB to the cell nucleus as a consequence of the inhibition of NF-κB activation and the reduced production of inflammatory cytokines (39.Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. Dithiocarbamates as potent inhibitors of nuclear factor κ B activation in intact cells.J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). In our experimental system, PDTC treatment suppressed dissociation of the IκB subunit for degradation (Fig. 5A), and consequently the gp120-induced expression of MMP2 and MMP9 and the production of inflammatory cytokines were abolished (Fig. 5, A–C). When the DC-SIGN gene was knocked out by the CRISPR/Cas9 targeting system, treatment with gp120 glycoprotein failed to active the NF-κB pathway and the subsequent induction of MMP2 and MMP9 expression (Fig. 5A). Having shown that gp120 could down-regulate the expression of tight junction proteins, we next examined whether it could disrupt the PRE barrier. We seeded ARPE-19 cells into a transwell to form a monolayer that mimics the RPE barrier, as described previously (31.Tan S. Duan H. Xun T. Ci W. Qiu J. Yu F. Zhao X. Wu L. Li L. Lu L. Jiang S.

We thus aimed to investigate the association between educational level and anticoagulation quality and clinical outcomes in elderly patients with acute VTE. We studied 817 patients aged ≥65 years with acute VTE from a Swiss prospective multicenter cohort study (09/2009-12/2013). We defined three educational levels: 1) less than high school, 2) high school, and 3) post-secondary degree. The primary outcome was the anticoagulation quality, expressed as the percentage of time spent in the therapeutic INR range (TTR). Secondary outcomes were the time to a first recurrent VTE and major bleeding. We adjusted for potential confounders and periods of anticoagulation. Overall, 56% of patients had less than high school, 25% a high school degree, and 18% a post-secondary degree. The mean percentage of TTR was similar across educational levels (less than high school, 61%; high school, 64%; and post-secondary, 63%; P = 0.36). Within three years of follow-up, patients with less than high school, high school, and a post-secondary degree had a cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE of 14.2%, 12.9%, and 16.4%, and a cumulative incidence of major bleeding of 13.3%, 15.1%, and 15.4%, respectively. After adjustment, educational level was neither associated with anticoagulation quality nor with recurrent VTE or major bleeding. In elderly patients with VTE, we did not find an association between educational level and anticoagulation quality or clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2517790121,"The association of pathological features of cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs) with somatic driver mutations and their molecular classification remain unclear. In this study, we explored the association between steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) expression and the driver mutations activating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling to identify the pathological markers of ACAs. Immunohistochemical staining for StAR and mutations in the protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha (PRKACA), protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha (PRKAR1A) and guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha stimulating (GNAS) genes were examined in 97 ACAs. The association of StAR expression with the clinical and mutational features of the ACAs was analyzed. ACAs with mutations in PRKACA, GNAS, and PRKAR1A showed strong immunopositive staining for StAR. The concordance between high StAR expression and mutations activating cAMP/PKA signaling in the ACAs was 99.0%. ACAs with high expression of StAR had significantly smaller tumor volume (P < 0.001) and higher urinary cortisol per tumor volume (P = 0.032) than those with low expression of StAR. Our findings suggest that immunohistochemical staining for StAR is a reliable pathological approach for the diagnosis and classification of ACAs with cAMP/PKA signaling-activating mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2518091309,"The United States federal animal welfare regulations and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals require that institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) conduct continuing reviews of all animal research activities. However, little is known about the lapse rate of IACUC continuing reviews, and how frequently investigators continue research activities during the lapse. It is also not clear what factors may contribute to an institution's lapse in IACUC continuing reviews. As part of the quality assurance program, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has collected performance metric data for animal care and use programs since 2011. We analyzed IACUC continuing review performance data at 74-75 VA research facilities from 2011 through 2015. The IACUC continuing review lapse rates improved from 5.6% in 2011 to 2.7% in 2015. The rate of investigators continuing research activities during the lapse also decreased from 47.2% in 2012 to 7.4% in 2015. The type of IACUCs used and the size of animal research programs appeared to have no effect in facility's rates of lapse in IACUC continuing reviews. While approximately 80% of facilities reported no lapse in IACUC continuing reviews, approximately 14% of facilities had lapse rates of >10% each year. Some facilities appeared to be repeat offenders. Four facilities had IACUC lapse rates of >10% in at least 3 out of 5 years, suggesting a system problem in these facilities requiring remedial actions to improve their IACUC continuing review processes."
https://openalex.org/W2508979721,"Neural mechanisms of selective attention must be capable of adapting to variation in the absolute size of an attended stimulus in the ever-changing visual environment. To date, little is known regarding how attentional selection interacts with fluctuations in the spatial expanse of an attended object. Here, we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the scaling of attentional enhancement and suppression across the visual field. We measured ERPs while participants performed a task at fixation that varied in its attentional demands (attentional load) and visual angle (1.0° or 2.5°). Observers were presented with a stream of task-relevant stimuli while foveal, parafoveal, and peripheral visual locations were probed by irrelevant distractor stimuli. We found two important effects in the N1 component of visual ERPs. First, N1 modulations to task-relevant stimuli indexed attentional selection of stimuli during the load task and further correlated with task performance. Second, with increased task size, attentional modulation of the N1 to distractor stimuli showed a differential pattern that was consistent with a scaling of attentional selection. Together, these results demonstrate that the size of an attended stimulus scales the profile of attentional selection across the visual field and provides insights into the attentional mechanisms associated with such spatial scaling."
https://openalex.org/W2512962056,"Closely-related, and otherwise morphologically similar insect species frequently show striking divergence in the shape and/or size of male genital structures, a phenomenon thought to be driven by sexual selection. Comparative interspecific studies can help elucidate the evolutionary forces acting on genital structures to drive this rapid differentiation. However, genetic dissection of sexual trait divergence between species is frequently hampered by the difficulty generating interspecific recombinants. Intraspecific variation can be leveraged to investigate the genetics of rapidly-evolving sexual traits, and here we carry out a genetic analysis of variation in the posterior lobe within D. melanogaster. The lobe is a male-specific process emerging from the genital arch of D. melanogaster and three closely-related species, is essential for copulation, and shows radical divergence in form across species. There is also abundant variation within species in the shape and size of the lobe, and while this variation is considerably more subtle than that seen among species, it nonetheless provides the raw material for QTL mapping. We created an advanced intercross population from a pair of phenotypically-different inbred strains, and after phenotyping and genotyping-by-sequencing the recombinants, mapped several QTL contributing to various measures of lobe morphology. The additional generations of crossing over in our mapping population led to QTL intervals that are smaller than is typical for an F2 mapping design. The intervals we map overlap with a pair of lobe QTL we previously identified in an independent mapping cross, potentially suggesting a level of shared genetic control of trait variation. Our QTL additionally implicate a suite of genes that have been shown to contribute to the development of the posterior lobe. These loci are strong candidates to harbor naturally-segregating sites contributing to phenotypic variation within D. melanogaster, and may also be those contributing to divergence in lobe morphology between species."
