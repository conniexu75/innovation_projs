https://openalex.org/W2008506563,"The tumor suppressive effect of p53 is believed to be rooted in its two primary functions: the implementation of cellular growth arrest and the execution of apoptotic cell death. While p53-regulated expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 appears to be central for the implementation of G1 arrest, the participation of p21Waf1/Cip1 in p53-triggered cell death remains controversial. In the present study, overexpression of p53 in human melanoma SK-MEL-110 cells through use of an adenoviral expression vector (AdCMV.p53) was found to result in apoptosis, while similar infection of primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) instead resulted in a moderate inhibition of growth. Expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 was strongly elevated in VSMC, but showed little change in SK-MEL-110 cells, although expression of another p53-regulated gene (GADD45) was comparable in both AdCMV.p53-infected cell types. Evidence that p21Waf1/Cip1 expression may be required for surviving p53-induced cell death was further supported by the finding that p53 overexpression was highly toxic for p21-deficient mouse embryonal fibroblasts (p21−/− MEFs). In both SK-MEL-110 and p21−/− MEFs, adenovirus-driven ectopic expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 resulted in a substantial protection against p53-induced apoptosis, indicating that p21Waf1/Cip1 rescued cells from a path of programmed cell death to one of enhanced survival."
https://openalex.org/W2023193192,"During development, growing motor axons are excluded from the ventral midline of the neural tube by diffusible chemorepellents emanating from this region. Molecular candidates for this chemorepellent activity include semaphorin D and netrin-1; the latter is known to repel trochlear motor axons. Qualitatively or quantitatively different responses to these molecules might underlie the initial deflection from the midline and subsequent segregation of motor axon trajectories. To test this idea, we have cocultured cell aggregates secreting netrin-1 or semaphorin D at a distance from tissue explants containing different motor neuron subpopulations, in collagen gels. Cranial motor axons that project dorsally in vivo such as those of the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nuclei were repelled by both netrin-1 and semaphorin D. By contrast, ventrally projecting spinal motor axons and abducens axons were not affected by netrin-1. Spinal and abducens motor neurons also responded to semaphorin D. The ventrally projecting axons of oculomotor neurons were not repelled by netrin-1 or semaphorin D. Differential responsiveness to netrin-1 and semaphorin D could thus contribute to the generation of dorsal and ventral motor axon pathways during development."
https://openalex.org/W2335761521,"The Ras proteins play a central role in regulating cell growth and their mutation can lead to abnormal proliferation. To analyse the potential link betwen AP1 activity, encoded by members of the jun and fos gene families, and Ras-mediated cellular transformation, we have studied several NIH3T3 clones which overexpress the Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras oncogenes. These transformed fibroblasts accumulated higher levels of cJun, JunB, Fra1 and Fra2 proteins relative to their normal counterparts. They also displayed increased AP1 DNA binding activity which was predominantly composed of cJun and Fra1 containing dimers. Following serum stimulation of Ras clones, the elevated levels of cJun and Fra1 remained steady, while the induction of JunB and Fra2 was partially attenuated. Moreover, deregulated Ras signaling resulted in a complete loss of the serum inducibility of cFos and FosB. Ectopic co-expression of cJun and Fra1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts led to a transformed phenotype, attenuation of cFos serum inducibility, increased AP1 activity and Cyclin D1 accumulation, all characteristics of oncogenic Ras expressing cells. These results demonstrate that cJun and Fra1 are crucial mediators of the Ras-transformation process."
https://openalex.org/W1987343743,"Axonin-1 and NrCAM were previously shown to be involved in the in vivo guidance of commissural growth cones across the floor plate of the embryonic chicken spinal cord. To further characterize their role in axon pathfinding, we developed a two-dimensional coculture system of commissural and floor-plate explants in which it was possible to study the behavior of growth cones upon floor-plate contact. Although commissural axons readily entered the floor plate under control conditions, perturbations of either axonin-1 or NrCAM interactions prevented the growth cones from entering the floor-plate explants. The presence of antiaxonin-1 resulted in the collapse of commissural growth cones upon contact with the floor plate. The perturbation of NrCAM interactions also resulted in an avoidance of the floor plate, but without inducing growth-cone collapse. Therefore, axonin-1 and NrCAM are crucial for the contact-mediated interaction between commissural growth cones and the floor plate, which in turn is required for the proper guidance of the axons across the ventral midline and their subsequent rostral turn into the longitudinal axis."

https://openalex.org/W2085807801,"We have analysed the different Jun and Fos proteins as NIH3T3 fibroblasts pass from exponential growth to quiescence and during the first 24 h after their re-entry into the cell cycle following serum stimulation. We show that these proteins can be divided into 3 subgroups based on their pattern of expression. The first contains c-Jun, Jun-D and Fra-2 which are expressed at high level in cycling cells and are only mildly induced by serum. The second contains Jun-B, c-Fos, Fos-B and deltaFos-B whose levels are low in cycling cells but increase strongly and rapidly after stimulation by serum. The third group contains only Fra-1, which is absent from cycling cells and behaves as a delayed early response protein after serum stimulation. AP-1 binding activity is low both in cycling and quiescent fibroblasts but increases after stimulation by serum with kinetics matching the induction of the various Jun and Fos proteins. Antibody supershift analyses demonstrate that the composition of AP-1 binding activity reflects the relative abundance of each Jun and Fos protein. Furthermore, the state of post-translational modification varies continuously for all of the AP-1 proteins as growth conditions change. These data indicate that AP-1 activity during the G0-G1 transition is finely regulated and complex, involving changes both in protein expression and in posttranslational modification."

https://openalex.org/W2316227579,"Activating germline mutations of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase are found in the majority of cases of inherited cancer syndrome MEN 2, and inactivating mutations in some cases of dominantly inherited Hirschsprung disease. Using RET activated by a MEN 2 mutation, we show that both the SH2 and PTB domains of the adaptor protein Shc interact with RET, and we identify the PTB domain interaction site. Interaction with both the SH2 and PTB domains of Shc contributes to the transcriptional activation of a serum response element. RET alternate splicing affects the strength of interaction with both the Shc SH2 and PTB domains. In addition, a splice isoform-specific HSCR missense mutation, which does not inactivate the RET kinase activity, decreases the strength of the PTB domain interaction and the level of RET-dependent Shc phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1970141188,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a large modular trimeric protein that has been proposed to play a diverse role in biological processes. Newly synthesized TSP-1 either is incorporated into the matrix or binds to the cell surface where it is rapidly internalized and degraded. TSP-1 catabolism is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a large endocytic receptor that is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer experiments, we demonstrate that the very low density lipoprotein receptor can also bind and internalize TSP-1. An objective of the current investigation was to identify the portion of TSP-1 that binds to these endocytic receptors. The current studies found that the amino-terminal heparin binding domain (HBD, residues 1-214) of mouse TSP-1, when prepared as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), bound to purified LRP with an apparent KD ranging from 10 to 25 nM. Recombinant HBD (rHBD) purified following proteolytic cleavage of GST-HBD, also bound to purified LRP, but with an apparent KD of 830 nM. The difference in affinity was attributed to the fact that GST-HBD exists in solution as a dimer, whereas rHBD is a monomer. Like TSP-1, 125I-labeled GST-HBD or 125I-labeled rHBD were internalized and degraded by wild type fibroblasts that express LRP, but not by fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in LRP. The catabolism of both 125I-labeled GST-HBD and rHBD in wild type fibroblast was blocked by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of LRP function. GST-HBD and rHBD both completely blocked catabolism of 125I-labeled TSP-1 in a dose-dependent manner, as did antibodies prepared against the HBD. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the amino-terminal domain of TSP-1 binds to LRP and thus the recognition determinants on TSP-1 for both LRP and for cell surface proteoglycans reside within the same TSP-1 domain. Further, high affinity binding of TSP-1 to LRP likely results from the trimeric structure of TSP-1.

This molecule is a part of a family of proteins that currently consists of five members (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bornstein P. J.

Each subunit of TSP-1 is composed of an amino-terminal heparin binding domain, a type I procollagen homology region, three properdin repeats, three epidermal growth factor-like repeats, seven calcium binding repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal domain (4Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). TSP-1 has been proposed to play a diverse role in numerous biological processes; these include embryonic development (5Shea O.K.S. Liu L.H. Kinnunen L.H. Dixit V.M. J. Cell.

Given that TSP-1 appears to influence a large number of biological processes, it is not surprising that levels of TSP-1 are carefully regulated. Protein levels of TSP-1 are controlled at the level of RNA synthesis and stability (9Donoviel D.B. Amacher S.L. Judge K.W. Bornstein P. J. Cell.

LRP is a member of the LDL receptor family, which includes the LDL receptor (13Yamamoto T. Davis G.C. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russel D.W.

LRP mediates the cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of proteinases, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (21Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). LRP is expressed in many tissues, and is a major endocytic receptor in the liver and in the central nervous system (for reviews, see Refs. 28Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 30Moestrup S.K. Biochim.

The goal of the present study was to identify additional LDL receptor family members capable of binding TSP-1, and to identify the region on TSP-1 responsible for its interaction with these receptors. These studies confirm that in addition to LRP and gp330/megalin, the VLDL receptor can also bind TSP-1 and mediate its cellular catabolism. Further, the studies identify the amino-terminal heparin binding domain of TSP-1 as a region responsible for mediating the catabolism of TSP-1 via interaction with LRP, and indicate that high affinity binding of TSP to LRP results from the trimeric structure of TSP. TSP-1 was purified from thrombin-activated platelets as described (31Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal heparin binding domain of TSP-1 was purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and size-exclusion chromatography following digestion of thrombospondin with chymotrypsin as described (32Dardik R. Lahav J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). LRP was isolated from human placenta as described by Ashcom et al. (23Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Human RAP, expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione S-transferase were prepared and purified as described previously (18Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin, fraction V (BSA) and heparin, fraction II (Mr 16,000) were purchased from Sigma. Thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Proteins were labeled with [125I]iodine to a specific activity ranging from 2 to 10 μCi/μg of protein using IODOGEN (Pierce). The heparin binding domain of TSP-1 was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli using pGEX-2T expression vector (Promega) as described previously (18Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding residues 1-214 of mouse TSP-1 were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using 21-base synthetic oligonucleotide primers and cDNA encoding mouse TSP-1 kindly provided by Vishva Dixit (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). The product was sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced during polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant heparin binding domain includes Cys-150 and Cys-214, which participate in intrachain disulfide bond formation, but does not include cysteines involved in trimerization of the thrombospondin subunits. GST-HBD was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on GSH-Sepharose and/or chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, followed by gel filtration on Superdex-75. Recombinant HBD (rHBD) was purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and size-exclusion chromatography after digestion of the fusion protein with thrombin. Amino acid sequencing analysis yielded a single, expected sequence. Protein concentrations were determined by using an extinction coefficient of 12,700 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for recombinant HBD and 53,700 M−1 cm−1 for GST-HBD, which were calculated as described (33Edelhock H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The molecular mass values of 23,500 and 49,000 daltons for rHBD and GST-HBD, respectively, were calculated from the amino acid sequence. Molecular mass values of 500,000, 23,500, and 97,000 daltons were used to calculate the molar concentrations of TSP, rHBD, and GST-HBD, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against the heparin binding domain of mouse thrombospondin were prepared by immunizing a rabbit with rHBD (residues 1-214 of mouse TSP-1, preceded by amino-terminal glycine and serine). For immunization, rHBD was prepared by digestion of GST-HBD with thrombin. GST and rHBD were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices containing rHBD were used for immunization. Antibodies were purified by chromatography on protein G-Sepharose. The specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that the antibody bound to rHBD and GST-HBD, as well as to purified human TSP-1. ELISAs were performed as detailed elsewhere (22Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with purified LRP at 5 μg/ml in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS), for 4 h at 37°C and then blocked with 3% BSA in TBS. The LRP-coated microtiter wells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of TSP-1, GST-HBD, and rHBD in 3% BSA, TBS, 5 mM CaCl2, for 18 h at 4°C. Bound proteins were detected with the rabbit polyclonal anti-HBD IgG (20 μg/ml) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the binding to BSA-coated wells, and was subtracted from the data prior to nonlinear regression analysis. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using the following equation. A is the absorbance at 650 nm, Amax is the absorbance value at saturation, Amin is the background absorbance in the absence of ligand, [ligand] is the molar concentration of free ligand, and KD is the dissociation constant. Since the free ligand concentration is unknown in these experiments, the use of this equation assumes that the total amount of added ligand is far greater than the amount of ligand bound to the microtiter wells. Under these conditions, the amount of free ligand is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration, and thus total ligand concentrations can be substituted into Equation 1. A normal mouse embryonic fibroblast line (MEF) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line that is genetically deficient in LRP biosynthesis (PEA13) were obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and maintained as described (34Schäfer B.M. Maier K. Eickhoff U. Todd R.F. Kramer M.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1269-1280PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into 12-well dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) at 1 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to the assay and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cellular internalization and degradation assays were conducted as described previously (11Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Surface binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-labeled proteins by cells was measured after incubation for indicated time intervals at 37°C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified medium (Mediatech, Washington, DC) containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA. Surface binding and internalization is defined as radioactivity that is sensitive or resistant, respectively, to release from cells by trypsin (50 μg/ml) and proteinase K (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) in buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Degradation is defined as radioactivity in the medium that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. In all experiments a control was included, in which the amount of degradation products generated in the absence of cells was also measured and subtracted from each data point. The binding of 125I-labeled TSP-1 to MEF was conducted at 4°C as described (35Isaacs I.J. Steiner J.P. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6709-6714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vectors were prepared as described (36Kozarsky K.F. Jooss K. Donahae M. Strauss J.F. Wilson J.M. Nature Genet. 1996; 13: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses used were Ad-LacZ, an adenovirus containing lacZ cDNA under the human cytomegalovirus enhancer and 3′-promoter, and Ad-VLDLR (also called Ad.CMVVLDLR in Ref. 36Kozarsky K.F. Jooss K. Donahae M. Strauss J.F. Wilson J.M.

PEA13 cells were infected as described previously (37Argraves K.M. Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D. McCrae K.R. Gåfvels M. Kozarsky K.F. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

To assess the effectiveness of the infection with Ad-VLDLR, immunoblotting and RAP ligand blotting of cell extracts were routinely employed. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored using an SLM8000 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter (Aminco). Protein (1 μM initial concentration) in TBS, pH 7.4, was denatured by stepwise titration with 10 M urea solution in TBS in a 4-mm pathlength cuvette (Hellma) with continuous stirring. Temperature was maintained at 25°C by using a thermostated cuvette holder connected to a Neslab water bath. The excitation wavelength was 285 nm, and emission spectra were recorded for each urea concentration. The spectrum of each sample was corrected by subtraction of the buffer alone and normalized to 1 μM protein concentration. Equilibrium sedimentation measurements were performed using a Beckman XL-A Optima Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and a Beckman An-60Ti rotor. Proteins were loaded at three concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM) in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, into a six-hole centerpiece and spun at 11,000 rpm (GST-HBD) or 24,000 rpm (rHBD and GST) for 24 h. Twenty data sets for three concentrations were averaged and jointly fitted for a singular molecular weight. Compositional partial specific volumes for the proteins were calculated according to Zamyatnin (38Zamyatnin A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Previous work has suggested that LRP plays an important role in the catabolism of TSP-1 (11Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z.

Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These studies documented that TSP-1 binds to LRP in vitro and that cells expressing LRP are able to catabolize TSP-1. The catabolism of 125I-labeled TSP-1 was inhibited by antibodies against LRP and by RAP (11Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a known antagonist of LRP activity, providing evidence that LRP-mediated endocytosis is a major pathway for TSP-1 catabolism. To determine if other mechanisms besides LRP-mediated endocytosis exist that lead to the degradation of TSP-1, the catabolism of 125I-labeled TSP-1 was measured in cells that are genetically deficient in LRP (PEA-13 mouse embryonic fibroblasts) (39Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was compared to the catabolism of 125I-labeled TSP-1 in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) expressing LRP. For these experiments, 125I-labeled TSP-1 was incubated with cells at 37°C, and at selected time intervals, the amount of radioactivity that was released with proteinase treatment (Fig. 1A), internalized (Fig. 1B), and released back into the medium as trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments (Fig. 1C) was measured. When added to cells at 37°C, 125I-labeled TSP-1 demonstrated a slow, time-dependent association with cells or matrix components, regardless of whether or not the cells expressed LRP. Heparin prevented the association of TSP-1 with the cell surface. In contrast, RAP did not inhibit this process; in fact, increased association of TSP-1 with cells expressing LRP was noted in the presence of RAP (Fig. 1A). We attribute this accumulation of 125I-labeled TSP-1 to blocking of the catabolic pathway for TSP-1 in the presence of RAP. In contrast, the internalization (Fig. 1B) and degradation (Fig. 1C) of 125I-labeled TSP-1 strongly correlated with LRP expression. LRP-containing fibroblasts rapidly internalize 125I-labeled TSP-1 leading to its degradation, and these processes were inhibited by RAP. Cells deficient in LRP are inefficient in internalizing and degrading TSP-1 (Fig. 1, panels B and C). These data indicate that LRP-mediated endocytosis is a major pathway for the cellular catabolism of TSP-1. Like LRP, the VLDL receptor also binds multiple ligands (37Argraves K.M. Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D. McCrae K.R. Gåfvels M. Kozarsky K.F. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D. McCrae K.R. Gåfvels M. Kozarsky K.F. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since TSP-1 is catabolized by endothelial cells (41Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if the VLDL receptor could mediate the cellular catabolism of TSP-1. For these experiments, an adenoviral vector was utilized to express the VLDL receptor in PEA-13 fibroblasts, a cell line that does not express this receptor or LRP. As a control, PEA13 fibroblasts were infected with an adenovirus vector, Ad-LacZ, containing the lacZ cDNA instead of the VLDL receptor cDNA. Fig. 2 shows that cells expressing the VLDL receptor are able to mediate the cellular degradation of 125I-labeled TSP-1 (left panel). In contrast, cells that lack the VLDL receptor (PEA-13 fibroblasts infected with Ad-LacZ, middle panel) are unable to mediate the degradation of 125I-labeled TSP-1. For comparison, the amount of cellular degradation of 125I-TSP observed in wild type fibroblasts, which express LRP, is also shown (right panel). These experiments demonstrate that like LRP, the VLDL receptor can bind and mediate the cellular internalization of TSP-1 leading to its degradation, and suggest that the RAP-sensitive receptor in endothelial cells that catabolizes TSP-1 (12Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) very likely is the VLDL receptor. The next goal of our studies was to identify the portion of TSP-1 responsible for binding to LRP. Based on the observation (12Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) 2I. Mikhailenko and 19Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Sottile J. Strickland D.K. Mosher D.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that a truncated form of TSP-1 containing the amino-terminal portion of the molecule is catabolized by cells, we speculated that heparin binding portions of TSP-1 may participate in the binding of TSP-1 to LRP. It is well known that the amino-terminal domain of TSP-1, consisting of residues 1-214, contains a high affinity heparin binding site (43Yabkowitz R. Lowe J.B. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Prochownik E.V. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that this region (called the heparin binding domain or HBD) may itself bind to LRP, we expressed this portion (residues 1-214) of mouse TSP-1 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Fig. 3 demonstrates an analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions of GST-HBD (lane 1), cleaved rHBD (lane 2), HBD isolated following chymotryptic cleavage of human TSP-1 (lane 3), and GST (lane 4). Under nonreducing conditions, the rHBD migrated close to its calculated molecular mass of 23.5 kDa. The reduced rHBD displayed a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than nonreduced rHBD (data not shown), an observation consistent with the notion that the cysteine residues in positions 150 and 214 form the expected intrachain disulfide bond. rHBD bound to heparin-Sepharose and was eluted at an ionic strength similar to that required to elute the HBD generated from TSP-1 by proteolytic digestion, which suggests that the rHBD is appropriately folded. To assess the folding properties of rHBD, the effect of increasing urea concentrations upon the intrinsic fluorescence of rHBD was monitored. The results (Fig. 4) demonstrate that the environment of the tryptophan residues in rHBD is dramatically altered as the urea concentration is increased. In the presence of urea, the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission is shifted to that expected for a more polar environment surrounding the tryptophan residue. These data are consistent with unfolding of the rHBD. A replot of the fluorescent intensities versus urea concentration (Fig. 4, inset) demonstrates that a cooperative unfolding transition was observed. These results provide compelling evidence that the rHBD is folded into a compact structure that can be disrupted with urea. A similar titration curve was obtained for HBD isolated by chymotryptic digestion of TSP-1 (Fig. 4, inset), although it appears to denature at a slightly lower concentration of urea, possibly due to the presence of carbohydrate.Fig. 4Cooperative unfolding of rHBD by urea as monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence. Fluorescence spectra of 1 μM rHBD in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, recorded at 25°C are shown in presence of increasing concentrations of urea. Excitation was at"

Distinct germ-line mutations of RET have been associated with the inherited cancer syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B and FMTC as well as with the congenital disorder Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), whereas somatic rearrangements (RET/PTCs) have been frequently detected in the papillary thyroid carcinoma. Despite these findings, suggesting a relevant role for RET product in development and neoplastic processes, little is known about the signalling triggered by this receptor. In this study, we have demonstrated that the transducing adaptor molecule Shc is recruited and activated by both Ret isoforms and by the rearranged cytoplasmatic Ret/ptc2 oncoproteins as well as by the membrane bound receptor activated by MEN2A or by MEN2B associated mutations. Moreover, our analysis has identified the Ret tyrosine residue and the Shc domains involved in the interaction. In fact, here we show that both the phosphotyrosine binding domains of Shc, PTB and SH2, interact with Ret/ptc2 in vitro. However, PTB domain binds 20 folds higher amount of Ret/ptc2 than SH2. The putative binding site for either SH2 and PTB domains has been identified as Tyr586 of Ret/ptc2 (Tyr1062 on proto-Ret). In keeping with this finding, by using RET/PTC2-Y586F mutant, we have demonstrated that this tyrosine residue, the last amino acid but one before the divergence of the two Ret isoforms, is the docking site for Shc."

The data we have obtained show that loss of the wild-type TP53 gene is observed in under half (44%) of all tumours, and that the pattern of LOH at TP53 may be mutation specific. LOH has been observed in premalignant as well as invasive tumours. Two tumours (6%) show loss of the mutant allele and retention of the wild-type. To confirm that TP53 is indeed the target for LOH events on chromosome 17, we have used additional microsatellite repeats to examine patterns of allelic imbalance along the length of chromosome 17. Data from this analysis indicate that TP53 is the target of loss, but reveal some other interesting patterns of allelic imbalance at other loci on chromosome 17."
https://openalex.org/W2331400535,"Functional interactions between protein kinase A (PKA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) signalling pathways have been suggested. Unlike the type II isoform of PKA (PKAII), the type I (PKAI) and/or its regulatory subunit RIα are generally overexpressed in cancer cells and are induced following transforming growth factor α (TGFα)/EGF-R-dependent transformation. Downregulation of RIα/PKAI inhibits TGFα expression and EGF-R-dependent signalling. We have previously shown that addition of EGF to quiescent human normal epithelial MCF-10A cells determines PKAI expression and cell membrane translocation before cells enter S phase, while PKAI inhibition prevents S phase entry. Constitutive overexpression of PKAI confers the ability to grow in serum free medium, bypassing EGF requirement. Here we demonstrate a direct interaction of PKAI, but not of PKAII, with the activated EGF-R, that occurs within 5 min following EGF treatment of MCF-10A cells. Moreover, induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity following EGF-R activation is mimicked by PKAI overexpression and inhibited by downregulators of PKAI. Finally, the PKAI – EGF-R association occurs through the binding of RIα to the SH3 domain(s) of Grb2 adaptor protein, thus allowing the recruitment of the PKAI holoenzyme to the activated EGF-R. This is the first demonstration of a direct interaction of PKAI with the activated EGF-R macromolecular signalling complex."

To analyse the mechanisms of regulation, we have studied activation of several ets factors by Ras expression. We show that expression of Ha-Ras strongly activates the Ets1 p68 and p54 isoforms and Ets2 in F9 EC cells. We have mapped the Ras responsive elements of Ets1 p68 to two domains, RI+II and RIII. Mutation of threonine 82 to alanine in RI+II abolishes both Ras activation and phosphorylation by MAP kinase. Threonine 82 is part of a sequence that is conserved in Drosophila Pointed P2, an ets protein that has been shown both genetically and biochemically to mediate Ras signalling in Drosophila cells. We extend the comparison of these evolutionary related proteins by showing that Pointed P2 is activated by Ras in mammalian cells and mutation of the homologous threonine abolishes activation. Furthermore, we show that Pointed P2 resembles Ets1, in that it has conserved sequences in a similar position adjacent to the ets DNA binding domain that negatively auto-regulates DNA binding. These results go towards showing that the Drosophila Pointed and vertebrate Ets1 are evolutionary related proteins that have remarkably conserved Ras regulatory mechanisms downstream from MAP kinase."

Pol I transcription is up-regulated in growing cells and down-regulated in quiescent cells, presumably reflecting the demand for ribosomes and protein synthesis. However, the signal transduction pathways responsible for pol I regulation are poorly understood. We tested the effects of exogenously applied plant hormones on promoter-dependent rRNA transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana Gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, and ethylene had no detectable effect on rRNA transcription, but kinetin (a cytokinin) stimulated rRNA transcription within 1 h of treatment. Increased steady-state levels of accurately initiated rRNA transcripts, detected by S1 nuclease protection, were paralleled by increased levels of nascent rRNA transcripts in isolated nuclei. Therefore, the primary effect of cytokinin appears to be at the level of transcription initiation rather than rRNA stability. Pol I accounts for ∼34% of total nuclear transcription in untreated plants and ∼60% following cytokinin treatment. The specific responsiveness of pol I transcription to kinetin suggests that cytokinins may act as general regulators of protein synthetic capacity and growth status in plant cells.

We tested the effects of exogenously applied plant hormones on promoter-dependent rRNA transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana Gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, and ethylene had no detectable effect on rRNA transcription, but kinetin (a cytokinin) stimulated rRNA transcription within 1 h of treatment. Increased steady-state levels of accurately initiated rRNA transcripts, detected by S1 nuclease protection, were paralleled by increased levels of nascent rRNA transcripts in isolated nuclei. Therefore, the primary effect of cytokinin appears to be at the level of transcription initiation rather than rRNA stability. Pol I accounts for ∼34% of total nuclear transcription in untreated plants and ∼60% following cytokinin treatment. The specific responsiveness of pol I transcription to kinetin suggests that cytokinins may act as general regulators of protein synthetic capacity and growth status in plant cells. Eukaryotes have evolved three nuclear RNA polymerases with specialized functions. RNA polymerase I transcribes the tandemly repeated genes encoding the precursor of 17-18, 5.8, and 25-28 S ribosomal RNA (1Reeder R.H. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R.

Glucocorticoid hormones have also been shown to stimulate or repress pol I transcription in different tissues (25Cavanaugh A.H. Thompson E.A.

Using the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we have begun to define the rRNA gene loci and cis-acting DNA sequences essential for accurate pol I transcription initiation (32Doelling J.H.

Recent progress toward dissecting hormone signaling pathways in A. thaliana prompted us to investigate reports that plant hormones such as auxin and cytokinin affect pol I activity in cell-free extracts, isolated chromatin, or nuclei (37Guilfoyle T.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6112-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Guilfoyle T.J. Jacob S.T. Enzymes of Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Modification.

Pflanz. 1981; 176: 614-624Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined hormonal effects on transcription initiation at the rRNA gene promoters as well as elongation of nascent rRNA transcripts. We show that exogenous cytokinin induces pol I transcription within 1 h of treatment, and the stimulatory effect persists for at least 24 h. The effect of cytokinin on rRNA transcription is consistent with its role in growth regulation and cell division. A. thaliana Columbia seeds were sterilized in 95% ethanol (five washes, 5 min each), followed by 3% sodium hypochlorite wash (10 min) and three washes in sterile distilled water (5 min each). Seeds were recovered by filtration (Nalgene sterile filter unit) and dried for 2 days in a desiccator containing sterile Dri-Rite. Approximately 100 seeds were sprinkled onto semisolid germination medium (42Valvekens D. Van Montagu M. Van Lijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) in 75-mm diameter Petri dishes. Seeds were germinated and plantlets grown for 14-21 days in a growth chamber (16 h day length, 22°C, 70% relative humidity) prior to hormone treatment. Plant hormones were purchased from Sigma and dissolved as 0.1 M− 0.2 M stocks. Kinetin was initially dissolved in 1 N NaOH then diluted with water to 0.1 M. Stocks of abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were prepared in 100% ethanol. All hormone stocks were made just prior to use and filter-sterilized. Plants were sprayed to run-off with a fine mist, essentially according to Guilfoyle (37Guilfoyle T.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6112-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and harvested by pulling them from the agar with forceps. Plantlets were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation or homogenized immediately for nuclei isolation. For S1 nuclease assays, RNA was isolated according to Chirgwin et al. (43Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. RNA was resuspended in 400 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; v/v) followed by extraction with 1 volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v). Sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added to 0.25 M and nucleic acids precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min (4°C). Pellets was resuspended in 300 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water followed by addition of 600 μl of ice-cold 4 M lithium chloride to precipitate RNA. Tubes were vortexed and incubated overnight on ice. Following centrifugation as above, pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. All RNA samples were also checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining to verify their quality and equivalent concentrations. rRNA transcripts were detected using S1 nuclease protection (44Berk A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) and 5′ end-labeled probes as described previously (32Doelling J.H. Gaudino R.J. Pikaard C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7528-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Doelling J.H. Pikaard C.S. Plant J. 1995; 8: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit mRNAs were detected using an oligonucleotide perfectly complementary to the A. thaliana Ats3B clone, but capable of hybridizing to transcripts of all four (known) genes (45Krebbers E. Seurinck J. Herdies L. Cashmore A.R. Timko M.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotide is 5′ CCACAGCGGCGGAGGAGAGCATAGAGGAAGCCATTACTACTTCTTGTTG 3′; the underlined nucleotides at the 3′ end are not homologous to any Rubisco mRNAs and are removed by S1 nuclease, discriminating the longest protected fragments from undigested probe. Nuclei were isolated according to Feinbaum and Ausubel (46Feinbaum R.L. Ausubel F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1985-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 47Guilfoyle T.J. Methods Cell. Biol. 1995; 50: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with modifications. Arabidopsis plants (∼800) were harvested from 8 to 10 agar plates, washed in ice-cold sterile water, and kept at 4°C. Plants were submerged in cold diethyl ether for 5 min, then washed twice (5 min each) in ice-cold sterile water. Plants were homogenized in 100 ml (approximately 3 volumes) of nuclei isolation buffer (1 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF) with a motorized homogenizer (Fisher Scientific Powergen 700). The homogenate was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth, one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem), and one layer of 50-μm nylon mesh. The filtrate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of nuclei isolation buffer using a 15-ml Dounce homogenizer (A pestle), and the final volume was measured. One volume of “100%” Percoll solution (34.23 g of sucrose, 5 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.5 ml of 1 M MgCl2, 0.5 ml 1 M KCl, 34 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μl of 2 mM PMSF, and Percoll to 100 ml) was added to 19 volumes of nuclei. 7 ml of crude nuclei in 5% Percoll solution was then layered onto a four-step discontinuous Percoll gradient with 5-ml layers of 15, 30, 45, and 60% Percoll solutions (diluted from the 100% Percoll solution using nuclei isolation buffer). Gradients were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, then 8000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 4°C. Nuclei were harvested from the 30%/45% and 45%/60% boundaries and pooled as both were found to be transcriptionally equivalent. Nuclei were diluted with 5 volumes of nuclei isolation buffer, mixed by inversion, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g, 10 min, 4°C in a clinical centrifuge (Beckman). Nuclei were resuspended gently in 50 ml (approximately 25 volumes) of nuclei isolation buffer and again collected by centrifugation. Final resuspension was in 1 ml of nuclei storage buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 50% glycerol). Aliquots were transferred to prechilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Frozen nuclei were thawed on ice, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and counted in a hemacytometer using fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear run-ons for filter hybridizations involved 1 × 106 nuclei; for total incorporation experiments, 1 × 105 nuclei were used. All nuclear run-on reactions were for 10 min (unless otherwise stated) at 30°C in a final volume of 50 μl (40 μl of run-on reaction buffer, 10 μl of nuclei). Nuclear run-on reaction buffer was: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 75 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM MnCl2, 300 μM each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 4.5 μM CTP, 0.5 μM [α-32P]CTP, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 2 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), 10% glycerol, and 150 μg/ml α-amanitin (increasing the amanitin level to 500 μg/ml was found to have no additional effect). 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega RQ1 DNase) was then added and the incubation continued 10 min. 250 μl of 2 mg/ml Pronase, 1% SDS was added, and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 55°C. Reactions were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform. Ammonium acetate was added to a final concentration of 2 M, and RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Following centrifugation, RNA was pelleted and washed twice with 70% ethanol. Dried pellets were resuspended in filter hybridization solution, formamide RNA loading buffer, or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA) (pH 7.2) for hybridization, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or scintillation counting, respectively. Nuclear run-ons using 1 × 105 nuclei were performed in the presence of 0 or 150 μg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma). Purified RNA was resuspended in 10 μl of TE (pH 7.2) and spotted onto DE81 paper (Whatman; ∼1 cm2). Filters were washed five times in 300 ml of 5% Na2HPO4 and twice with 250 ml of sterile Milli-Q water. Washes were at room temperature, 5 min each. Filters were rinsed briefly in 100% ethanol to aid drying. After air-drying, filters were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. 435 μg of plasmid DNA (with or without cloned rDNA) was denatured for 10 min in 40 ml of boiling 0.4 M NaOH and loaded onto a 44-mm diameter circle of Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane by vacuum filtration in a Millipore filter apparatus. A wash with 40 ml of 0.4 M NaOH was followed by two washes with 200 ml of sterile water. DNA was covalently cross-linked to the membrane using UV light (Bio-Rad Gene Linker GS; program C1). Filters were neutralized with 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and rinsed in water. Circular filters of ∼7-mm diameter were cut from the large filter using a sterilized hole punch. Each filter contained ∼15 μg of DNA. Filters were coded for later identification and were stored under vacuum. Filters were prewetted with sterile water and submerged in 0.4-0.6 ml of hybridization solution (50% deionized formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSC, 10 mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA) in 15-ml plastic snap-cap tubes for 1 h at 43°C. Each 15-ml tube contained a plain filter (no DNA), two filters with pBluescript (Stratagene) plasmid DNA, and two filters with cloned rRNA gene sequences (essentially a complete gene cloned in pBluescript). Radioactive RNA from a nuclear run-on reaction was resuspended in 200 μl of hybridization solution, denatured at 65°C, 10 min and added to a tube with a set of filters. Hybridization reactions were incubated overnight at 43°C. Filters were rinsed in 2 × SSC, incubated in 20 μg/ml RNase A (in 2 × SSC) at 30°C for 30 min to remove unhybridized RNA, then washed at high stringency (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65°C, 1 h). Filters were subjected to autoradiography and quantitation by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The A. thaliana rRNA gene promoter is located within the intergenic spacer approximately 2 kilobases upstream of the 18 S coding sequences (Fig. 1). Noncoding sequences are removed in several processing steps, the first involving cleavage within the external transcribed spacer (ETS) (9Warner J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 48Warner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 256-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Paule M.R. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). ETS processing occurs rapidly and is thought to be a co-transcriptional event (50Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The promoter-proximal ETS RNA is then rapidly degraded, unlike coding sequences which can have half-lives longer than a cell cycle. Because ETS RNA does not accumulate, steady-state levels of transcripts just downstream of the promoter are expected to closely reflect rRNA gene transcription activity. Consequently, we measured transcripts accurately initiated at +1 to initially survey plant hormones for effects on rRNA gene transcription. Aqueous solutions of gibberellic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, abscisic acid, and kinetin were sprayed onto 3-week-old A. thaliana plantlets until run-off, according to the experimental protocol of Guilfoyle (37Guilfoyle T.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6112-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Concentrations tested ranged from 10−7 to 10−3M. Ethylene was also tested by gassing plants at 10-60 ppm in a specially designed chamber (with the kind assistance of Dr. Harry Klee and the Monsanto Company, St. Louis, MO). RNA was isolated from control and treated plants at various times after treatment, and rRNA transcripts were detected using S1 nuclease protection as described previously (32Doelling J.H. Gaudino R.J. Pikaard C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7528-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Doelling J.H. Pikaard C.S. Plant J. 1995; 8: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Only cytokinin exerted a response in this initial survey (data not shown). Cytokinin treatment induced nascent rRNA transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Six hours after treatment, transcript levels were increased by kinetin at concentrations of 10−5M or higher (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-6), reaching their maximum with 10−3M exogenous hormone (lane 5). However, if RNA was isolated 12 or 24 h following treatment, an effect was discerned at concentrations as low as 10−6M (lane 2). Note that these are the concentrations sprayed onto the exposed upper surfaces of the plants; internal concentrations are expected to be at least 100-fold lower based on surface area to volume estimations. Maximal induction of accurately initiated rRNA transcripts was approximately 6-fold and was observed 24 h after treatment at the highest kinetin concentrations (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The experiment of Fig. 2A showed that pre-rRNA transcripts increase within a fixed amount of total RNA in response to cytokinin. However, because ∼80% of total RNA is ribosomal RNA coding sequences, our estimates of cytokinin responsiveness would be underestimates if the total ribosome pool were increased by cytokinin. At early time points, the ribosome pool is so large that such effects might not be significant. Nonetheless, we compared transcription initiation from the rRNA gene promoters to initiation from promoters of the Rubisco small subunit gene family, among the most highly expressed genes in green leaves. rRNA and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase gene promoters showed different responsiveness to kinetin treatment (Fig. 2B). Whereas nascent rRNA transcript levels were increased severalfold per unit of total RNA in response to increased exogenous cytokinin concentrations (lanes 2-6), transcripts from the Rubisco gene family were unaffected or reduced at high concentrations. The decrease in Rubisco transcripts could be due to a kinetin-dependent inhibition of transcription, as reported for phytochrome mRNA (56Cotton J.L.S. Ross C.W. Byrne D.H. Colbert J.T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or a decrease in Rubisco RNA relative to the total RNA pool. Nonetheless, the data suggest that increased steady-state levels of rRNA transcripts is not part of a general positive response to cytokinin. Although steady-state levels of nascent rRNA transcripts are thought to reflect transcription rates, due to the rapid turnover of ETS sequences, this has not been demonstrated in plants. Therefore, we also performed transcription run-on assays with nuclei of control and hormone treated plants (Fig. 3). Plants were again mock-treated (solution lacking hormone) or sprayed with various concentrations of cytokinin. Twelve hours later, nuclei were isolated and treated in four different ways. [32P]GTP was added to all reactions, but the remaining three nucleotides were withheld from half of the tubes (reactions 1 and 2, Fig. 3A) to control for possible nontranscriptional incorporation of the label. The remaining reactions (reactions 3 and 4) were provided with unlabeled ATP, CTP, and UTP to allow transcript elongation. In half of the reactions, α-amanitin was added to 150 μg/ml to inhibit pol II and pol III transcription, but not pol I (reactions 2 and 4). After a 10-min period to allow nascent transcripts to be elongated by template-engaged polymerases, RNA was purified and hybridized to an excess of DNA affixed to filters. Duplicate filters (lanes a and b) were used for each reaction. The DNA bound to the filters was either a denatured ribosomal gene clone or denatured pBluescript plasmid DNA, the latter serving as a control for the specificity of the hybridization conditions. After washing at high stringency, filters were exposed to x-ray film and were also quantified by phosphorimaging. As can be seen in Fig. 3, A and B, reactions 1 and 2, no signal was obtained if only the labeled nucleotide was provided to the nuclei. In contrast, adding all four nucleotides allowed the synthesis of radioactive transcripts that hybridized to rRNA gene filters (reactions 3 and 4), but not to pBluescript DNA filters (B). Note that run-on transcription signals were unaffected by α-amanitin (compare reactions 3 and 4), as expected for pol I transcription of rRNA. Importantly, the amount of run-on transcription was increased by kinetin treatment prior to nuclei isolation. Nuclear run-on signals were maximal following 10−3M kinetin treatment and were 3.8-fold higher than in mock-treated plants (Fig. 3A). An increase in the kinetin concentration to 10−2M decreased the response, suggesting inhibition at excessive concentrations. The agreement between the nuclear run-on results and the S1 protection results of Fig. 2A is noteworthy (the 12-h time point of Fig. 2A is the relevant comparison). At 10−6M kinetin, nuclear run-on assays showed a 1.4-fold increase over control nuclei (based on the average signals from the duplicate filters quantified by phosphorimaging), whereas S1 protection detected a 1.5-fold change. Likewise, relative signals at 10−5M kinetin were 2.1- versus 1.9-fold; at 10−4M were 2.7- versus 3.5-fold; and at 10−3M were 3.8- versus 4.9-fold. For unknown reasons, the only large discrepancy was at the highest concentration of kinetin tested, 10−2M, yielding a signal 1.7-fold higher than the control in the nuclear run-on assay, but 3.8-fold higher in the S1 protection assay. Nonetheless, we conclude that in Arabidopsis, as in other species, steady-state levels of rRNA transcripts initiated at +1 (detected by S1 protection) closely reflects levels of transcription. Using the sensitive nuclear run-on assay, we examined the kinetics of the cytokinin response. Plants were mock-treated or sprayed with 10−4M kinetin, and nuclei were isolated 1 or 6 h later (Fig. 3B). One hour after hormone treatment, rRNA transcription was stimulated 1.8-fold relative to control nuclei. At 6 h, the response was 2.4-fold in agreement with other experiments (Figs. 2A and 3A). For technical reasons, time periods shorter than 1 h were impractical. Nonetheless, these data suggest that induction of rRNA transcription by cytokinin occurs rapidly. Increased rRNA synthesis in nuclear run-on assays could be due to transcription of more rRNA genes, a higher polymerase density on the same number of genes or more rapid transcript elongation. The latter possibility seems unlikely given that hormone-induced increases in transcripts initiated at +1 (detected by S1 protection) were paralleled by increased transcription throughout the body of the gene (detected by nuclear run-on). These data are most easily explained by kinetin affecting the frequency of polymerase I initiation rather than the rate of elongation. Time courses of nuclear run-on reactions also support the hypothesis that more RNA polymerase I molecules are engaged in transcription in hormone-treated plants. In the experiment of Fig. 4, nuclear run-on reactions were performed using our standard conditions, but early time points in the reaction were examined. Even at the earliest time point (about 12 s), there is an approximately 2-fold increase in label incorporated in nuclei of treated plants. We interpret this to mean that an increased number of polymerase molecules are stalled on the rDNA of kinetin-treated nuclei. Upon addition of nucleotides, these resume transcription, the higher starting level in hormone-treated nuclei presumably reflecting the increased number of engaged polymerases. In contrast, if the same number of polymerase molecules were template-engaged but altered in their transcription rates, total isotope incorporation would be similar initially but would diverge with time (i.e. the lines connecting the data points would converge if extrapolated to time 0). Note that the zero time point provides no data in this assay, because endogenous transcripts are not labeled until transcripts begin to elongate. For this reason, there are no time 0 data points in Fig. 4. An experiment done in parallel with the one represented by Fig. 4 was performed to estimate the number of nucleotides incorporated per second in the nuclear run-on assays; these data are worth mentioning, though the data are not shown. Nuclei were treated with DNase-free ribonuclease to digest nascent transcripts protruding from the bound polymerase molecules. Nuclei were then washed and incubated in run-on conditions. Aliquots were taken at various intervals (10-300 s), and labeled transcripts were separated on a sequencing gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. Despite substantial size heterogeneity, computer imaging allowed us to identify the average transcript size at each time point by identifying the size range where the radioactive signal was highest. Such analyses led to an estimated average elongation rate of ∼2 nucleotides/s. This is in the same range as elongation rates of ∼5 nucleotides/s within isolated animal nuclei (57Marzluff W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, we observed no obvious difference in average transcript size over time in nuclei of hormone-treated and control plants. However, transcription signals were approximately twice as strong in kinetin-treated nuclei. These data are consistent with those of Figs. 2, 3, 4, suggesting that kinetin increases the number of polymerase I enzymes engaged in rRNA transcription. Because pol I accounts for a large proportion of all nuclear transcription, we estimated the effect of kinetin on overall transcription by measuring total and α-amanitin-resistant [32P]GTP incorporation in nuclei of control and treated plants (12 h following 10−4M treatment). Radioactive RNA from run-on reactions was purified and bound to positively charged DE81 filters. These were washed extensively to remove free nucleotides and quantified by scintillation counting. In control nuclei of two independent experiments, pol I transcription accounted for 32 or 36% of total RNA polymerase activity, whereas in cytokinin-treated plants, pol I activity accounted for 56 or 63% of the total (Fig. 5). These data are in line with studies in animal cells showing that rRNA transcription can account for 40-80% of total transcription (12Jacob S.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine plant hormone effects on transcription initiation directly at the rRNA gene promoter. Kinetin-induced increases in steady-state transcript levels were mirrored by nuclear run-on data, suggesting that cytokinin elicits a response at the level of gene transcription rather than rRNA stability. In general, our results support the conclusions of prior studies using isolated nuclei of detached cotyledons (58Ananiev E.D. Karagyozov L.K. Karanov E.N. Planta. 1987; 170: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Agreement between S1 protection and nuclear run-on data also suggests that transcripts upstream of the ETS processing site are rapidly degraded in plants, such that steady-state measurement of these unstable RNAs can essentially substitute for nuclear run-on assays. Responsiveness of rRNA genes to kinetin is reasonable in light of the role of cytokinins in cell division (cytokinesis). Dividing cells partition their ribosomes among daughter cells, thus rRNA synthesis might need to be up-regulated to replenish the ribosome pool. However, up-regulation within 1 h of kinetin treatment is unlikely to be a consequence of cell division. Furthermore, DNA content in total nucleic acid extracts, detected by Hoechst dye binding and fluorometry, was not appreciably increased at 1, 6, or 12 h following cytokinin treatment and was only slightly increased at 24 h (data not shown). In contrast, if rRNA transcription were up-regulated only as a consequence of DNA replication and cell division, every 2-fold increase in rRNA transcription should be paralleled by a 2-fold increase in DNA content. Other data not shown include our observation that rRNA transcription is similarly induced in roots, floral tissues, and whole plants, suggesting that cytokinin responsiveness is not tissue-specific. We were surprised that other hormones did not exert an effect on rRNA gene transcription in our initial screen. In particular, we thought auxin (specifically 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) might elicit a positive response. Guilfoyle (37Guilfoyle T.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6112-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) clearly showed that RNA polymerase I activity on heterologous template DNA (e.g. sheared calf thymus DNA) was about 10-fold higher in cell-free extracts of soybean hypocotyl treated with 2.5 × 10−3M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Lack of an auxin effect in our experiments might suggest that pol I levels alone are not limiting for promoter-dependent rRNA gene transcription within the plant cell. Perhaps increased levels or modifications of other transcription factors are also needed to facilitate promoter-dependent rRNA transcription, and these events are affected by cytokinin but not auxin. Cytokinins are the least understood class of plant hormones in terms of their mechanisms of action and signal transduction pathways (59Hobbie L. Timpte C. Estelle M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1499-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 60Brzobohaty B. Moore I. Palme K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Few mutants affecting cytokinin metabolism are available. The A. thaliana mutant, amp1 (61Chaudhury A.M. Letham S. Craig S. Dennis E.S. Plant J. 1993; 4: 907-916Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar), has endogenous cytokinin levels six times higher than normal and displays a rapid growth phenotype. Using the S1 protection assay, we found nascent rRNA transcripts in amp1 plants to be slightly higher than in wild-type plants (data not shown). However, kinetin responsiveness was similar in amp1 and wild-type plants. We also tested several mutants we have isolated that are resistant to cytokinin levels that inhibit seed germination and plantlet growth. Thus far, rRNA transcript levels are also increased in these lines in response to exogenous cytokinin treatment, although slight differences relative to control plants are suggested in some lines. 2R. Van Sambeek and R. J. Gaudino, unpublished. Mutants disrupted in cytokinin signaling would clearly be valuable for future studies. The specific responsiveness of rRNA gene transcription to kinetin suggests that in plants, cytokinins may be key signaling molecules involved in communicating cellular growth status to the transcription and protein synthetic machinery. It is intriguing that kinetin and ppGpp (in prokaryotes) are both modified purines. However, at present it is not clear if this is coincidence or a hint of a functional similarity. We are grateful to Dr. David Ho (Biology Department, Washington University, St. Louis) and members of our laboratory for numerous helpful discussions and constructive criticisms."

In order to gain insights on the biochemical pathways leading to p53 stabilization, the effect of (+/-) 7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9, 10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)-pyrene [(+/-)-anti-BPDE] induced DNA damage on p53 protein levels was investigated in various repair-proficient and repair-deficient human cells. Brief exposure of normal human fibroblasts to 0.05-1 microM (+/-)-anti-BPDE resulted in elevated p53 protein levels as compared to the constitutive levels of control cells. The rapid induction response, detectable within a few hours, was sustained up to a period of at least 24 h. Repair-proficient and repair-deficient (XPA) human lymphoblastoid cells showed a similar response. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), diminished the p53 induction response by concomitantly decreasing the extent of (+/-)-anti-BPDE induced DNA damage in cells pretreated with the inhibitor. However, the direct involvement of poly ADP-ribosylation was also apparent as 3-AB was able to attenuate (approximately 50%) the p53 response by post-damage inhibitor treatment of the cells. Inhibition of cellular DNA replication by hydroxyurea and AraC, in the presence or absence of DNA damage, also resulted in rapid p53 accumulation in repair-deficient cells. On the contrary, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by calphostin-C led to an abrogation of (+/-)-anti-BPDE mediated p53 induction. Analysis of the downstream effects of carcinogen treatment showed that the lymphoblastoid cells undergo DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis while fibroblasts exhibit cell cycle arrest at the G1-S boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2326196126,"The notion that an increased expression of immediate early genes such as c-fos and c-jun is an absolute requirement for the G0-G1 transition of the hepatocytes has recently been challenged by the finding that rat liver cell proliferation induced by primary mitogens may occur in the absence of such changes (Columbano and Shinozuka, 1996). To further investigate the relationship between immediate early genes and hepatocyte proliferation, we have compared the hepatic levels of c-fos, c-jun and LRF-1 transcripts during mouse liver cell proliferation in two conditions: (i) direct hyperplasia induced by the non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene, and (ii) compensatory regeneration caused by a necrogenic dose of carbon tetrachloride. The results show striking differences in the activation of early genes. In spite of a rapid stimulation of S phase by 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (approximately 8% of hepatocytes were BrdU-positive as early as 24 h after mitogen treatment versus 1% of labelled hepatocytes after 2/3 partial hepatectomy), no changes in the expression of c-fos, c-jun and LRF-1 could be observed. Moreover, no change in steady state mRNA hepatic levels of IGFBP-1 (a gene highly expressed in rat liver following partial hepatectomy), and only a slight increase in c-myc and PRL-1, was found after mitogen administration. On the contrary, a rapid, massive and transient increase in the hepatic mRNA levels of all these genes was observed during carbon tetrachloride induced regeneration. The results indicate that increased expression of immediate early genes may be dependent upon the nature of the proliferative stimulus, and it may not be a prerequisite in certain in vivo conditions such as proliferation induced in the absence of liver tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2329850533,"Helix – loop – helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo- and hetero-dimers mediated by the helix – loop – helix domain. Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein-protein interactions in the affected cell. In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations, the full complement of interacting proteins must be known. To identify proteins interacting with the basic-helix – loop – helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed E47 protein, a `sandwich'-screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo- and hetero-oligomers, and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA. Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic-helix – loop – helix domains, including a novel clone termed eip1 which is distantly related in the basic-helix – loop – helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer-of-split m7 protein. Using epitope-tagging, interaction of E47 basic-helix – loop – helix protein with the eip1 protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells. Interaction was also observed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Three cDNAs encoding proteins without basic-helix – loop – helix domains were also found to interact in the sandwich-expression screen. Interactions with human PARP and mouse replication factor 1a were confirmed using glutathione transferase-tagged cDNAs. A cDNA encoding part of the nucleolin protein sequence interacted with the E47 basic-helix – loop – helix only when fused to a β-galactosidase tag."
https://openalex.org/W2028508763,"Using an extensive series of deletion and site-specific mutation constructs, we have identified five new phosphorylation sites in c-Myc in the N-terminal transactivation domain and near the C-terminal DNA binding/heterodimerization domain. We have also found that Thr-58 phosphorylation is regulated by specific cellular events. When c-Myc is overexpressed in cells Thr-58 phosphorylation was greatly enhanced in the overexpressed, exogenous c-Myc as compared with the endogenous protein. In contrast, an inhibition of Thr-58 phosphorylation and an enhancement of Serine 62 phosphorylation was observed in c-Myc from immortalized cells compared with primary cells. No significant changes in c-Myc phosphorylation were found when transformed and nontransformed cells were compared. Finally, mutations at these phosphorylation sites, either individually or in combination with previously described sites, did not affect the ability of c-Myc to transactivate through the CACGTG Myc/Max DNA binding sites. These results further suggest that either the molecular role for c-Myc phosphorylation does not involve modulating transcriptional activity of c-Myc or that the CACGTG site does not represent a physiological promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W2313851623,"Alterations of NF-κB family members have been found to be associated with various forms of lymphoid malignancies. In order to determine whether alterations of the RelA gene are involved in lymphomagenesis, we analysed a large and representative panel (200 cases) of such tumors. Southern blot analysis did not reveal any rearrangements or locus amplification, suggesting that structural alterations of the RelA gene may represent rare events in lymphoid neoplasia. By means of PCR-SSCP analysis, we were able to identify a single point mutation leading to amino acid substitution (codon 494, Glu-Asp) in the transactivating (TA) domain in one case of multiple myeloma. The mutated allele was expressed in the pathological bone marrow sample but not in the peripheral blood cells of the patient. We demonstrate that the RelA protein carrying this specific mutation (called RelA494D) has less transactivating ability than the normal RelA protein. Interestingly, the mutated protein has a lower affinity for κB binding sites both as a homodimer or in association with the NFKB1/p50 subunit. Transfection experiments using a Gal4-RelA494D fusion protein indicated that the mutation does not alter the intrinsic transactivating ability of the TA domain of RelA. Furthermore, in vitro translated RelA494D is able to dimerize efficiently with other NF-κB members, such as p50, cREL and IκBα. Our data therefore suggest that this mutation may alter the specific structural conformation needed for the DNA interaction of RelA, and provide insights into the amino acid sequences involved in mediating the biological activities of RelA."
https://openalex.org/W2042101074,"Induction of heat shock gene expression is mediated by specific heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), but the signaling pathways leading to activation of HSFs are poorly understood. To elucidate whether protein kinase C-responsive signaling pathways could be involved in the regulation of heat shock gene expression, we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on the heat-induced stress response in K562 cells. We demonstrate that TPA treatment markedly enhances heat shock gene expression during heat stress, although TPA alone does not induce the heat shock response. This TPA-mediated enhancement can initially be detected as an accelerated acquisition of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of HSF1 resulting in elevated Hsp70 protein concentrations. In the presence of TPA, the attenuation of HSF1 DNA binding activity during continuous exposure to heat shock occurs more rapidly and in concert with the appearance of newly synthesized Hsp70, which supports earlier studies on the autoregulatory role of Hsp70 in deactivation of HSF1.

https://openalex.org/W2334674063,"To examine the ability of ras to activate signal transduction pathways in the absence of lipid modifications, fusion proteins were constructed that target rasWT or activated ras61L to cellular membranes as integral membrane proteins, using the first transmembrane domain of the E1 protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which contains a cis-Golgi targeting signal. Golgi-targeted derivatives of activated ras were completely inactive in transformation assays. However, when examined in focus formation assays, transformation of NIH3T3 cells were seen with derivatives of ras61L containing a mutated E1 targeting sequence that results in plasma membrane localization. Removal of the lipid modification sites in and upstream of the CAAX motif did not abrogate the transforming activity of plasma membrane-localized ras61L derivatives, indicating that these lipid modifications are not essential for ras activity, as long as the protein is correctly localized to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the activity of integral membrane versions of ras61L was strictly dependent on a minimum distance between the transmembrane domain anchor region and the coding sequence of ras. Derivatives with only a 3-amino acid linker were inactive, while linkers of either 11- or 22-amino acids were sufficient to restore transforming activity. These results demonstrate that: (1) activated ras targeted to Golgi membranes is unable to cause transformation; (2) lipid modifications at the C-terminus are not required for the transforming activity of plasma membrane-anchored ras61L derivatives, and serve primarily a targeting function; (3) a transmembrane domain can effectively substitute for C-terminal modifications that would normally target ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, indicating that ras61L does not need to reversibly dissociate from the membrane as might be allowed by the normal lipidation; and (4) in order to function properly, there exists a critical distance that the ras protein must reside from the plasma membrane."

The recently described erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 plays an important role in the regulation of the transcription of globin genes and recognizes a sequence containing an AP-1 site. NF-E2 is a complex of two bZip proteins, p45 and p18/Maf. In order to determine whether c-Jun can interact with NF-E2/AP-1 sites to regulate transcriptional activation from them, we have compared the activity of AP-1 and NF-E2 in transient transcriptional assays, in erythroid and nonerythroid cells in the presence of c-jun sense and antisense expression vectors. In non-erythroid cells, c-Jun activates and NF-E2p18 inhibits both AP-1 and NF-E2 activities, suggesting that NF-E2/AP-1 sites function as AP-1 binding sites in these cells. In contrast, NF-E2p18 is a positive regulator of NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells. c-Jun alone is also a positive regulator of NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells but in association with NF-E2p18 inhibits this activity. Moreover antisense c-jun increases endogenous NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells. These results suggest that c-Jun could act as a repressor of NF-E2 transcriptional activity by forming inactive c-Jun/NF-E2p18 heterocomplexes which interfer with the transcription of globin genes in Friend erythroleukemia cells."

Here, we report negative feedback regulation of t-PA expression, exerted by t-PA or complexes of t-PA with its physiological inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Inhibition of t-PA expression could be induced by addition of exogenous t-PA or t-PA·PAI-1 complexes and reversed by monoclonal antibody directed against the active site of t-PA. Analysis of metabolically radiolabeled protein and cellular mRNA showed that both t-PA protein and mRNA levels declined considerably after 24 h. When <sup>125</sup>I-labeled t-PA or t-PA·PAI-1 complexes were incubated with HCF, monensin-inhibitable endocytosis and catabolism were observed. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) was found to be expressed by HCF and to mediate these events. Addition of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist for ligand interactions with LRP, removed the block to t-PA expression and restored its accumulation in the medium. Moreover, RAP completely prevented the degradation of exogenous <sup>125</sup>I-labeled t-PA by HCF, suggesting that LRP is the endocytic receptor for t-PA in these cells. These results demonstrate that cellular modulation of t-PA expression in HCF involves LRP receptor-mediated clearance of t-PA.

Contrary to normal senescing cells, those of most immortal or transformed cell lines are karyotypically unstable and permissive for amplification. Permissivity for amplification can be generated by gene products of several DNA tumor viruses whereby their interaction with the tumorsuppressor protein p53 is important. p53 is the major protein involved in check point control of DNA damage. Polyomavirus large T antigen is also involved in immortalization and transformation of cells but it does not interact with p53. We, therefore, examined whether this protein could still make the non-permissive cell line REF52 permissive for gene amplification. To this end REF52 cell lines were constructed which conditionally expressed the wild type polyomavirus large T antigen or a mutant form unable to bind the retinoblastoma protein. Using the inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, phosphonoacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), as selective agent we found that PALA resistant cells arise with a frequency of about 5 x 10(-5) and that the interaction of polyomavirus large T protein with the retinoblastoma protein or another related pocket protein is important for this to occur. PALA resistant cells have an increased number of chromosomes and dicentric chromosomes which are considered as starting point for DNA structures characteristic for amplified DNA. Such structures were indeed found with the help of fluorescence in situ hybridization. PALA resistant cells appear normal with respect to p53. Our data indicate that PALA induces a G1 block which can be partially overcome by polyomavirus large T protein by its interaction with E2F-pocket protein complexes providing further evidence that these complexes are downstream targets of p53."
