Brown2, the possible keratin nature of coelenterate nematocysts has directed my attention to the subject. In 1952 I had observed the pronounced metachromatic colour produced by dilute thionin on large nematocysts from a siphonophore, Halistemma sp. It is known that the metachromatic colour of a dye, as taken up by a substance, is characteristic of an acidic mucopolysaccharide content, associated or not, with proteins to form mucoproteins3. The fact interested me, since I had studied such substances in the envelopes of pagurid and cephalopod spermatophores4."

https://openalex.org/W1996266130,"IN a recent communication, Kleiber1 has discussed two different definitions of the term ‘turnover-rate’. Some workers, particularly those associated with Chaikoff, regard the turnover-rate as the rate at which a substance is replaced in the tissue cells (definition 1). This is essentially the concentration of the substance in the tissue divided by the turnover-time. Others, including Kleiber, consider it to be the rate at which the whole ‘pool’ of the substance, however large or small, is replaced in the tissue, given by the reciprocal of the turnover-time (definition 2). Both groups agree that the turnover-time is the biological ‘average life’, given by 1.44 × biological half-life."

https://openalex.org/W2050416964,"IN a previous communication1, a staining technique was described for demonstrating the wide difference in basophilia of growing and non-growing cells of E. coli. The high basophilia of growing E. coli cells has been attributed by Belosersky2 to the presence of pentose nucleic acid which is not attached to protein. Apart from the work of Belosersky and his collaborators, the nature of the additional ribonucleic acid has received little attention, although it has been known for some years that rapidly growing and dividing cells of bacteria have a substantially higher concentration of ribonucleic acid than resting cells, and there is ample evidence of the heterogeneity of ribonucleic acid in metazoan cells3."

The necessary preparations were made by metal-shadowing the dried crystals lying on a glass surface, coating with collodion, freeing this composite layer and dissolving the crystalline deposit from the replica thus produced. The molecular order on several kinds of crystal was seen in this way; but a broader application of the method was limited by factors such as the fragility of the collodion film and the need to work with proteins not denatured by vacuum desiccation and the evaporation of metal."

Our previous work2 has indicated that the mouse ovary, provided it is in the luteal phase, has an effect similar to that of the adrenal cortex. While appreciating that major species differences may occur, this finding led us to commence experiments on the adrenal–gonad relationship in the guinea pig, since the urinary steroids in this species are excreted in sufficiently large amounts to be determined by routine chemical methods. It has now been shown that the response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is modified by the simultaneous administration of gonadotrophins."

https://openalex.org/W1985279396,"DURING recent years, many rare blood-group antigens, co-called ‘private’ or ‘family’ antigens, have been discovered. A survey of eleven of these was recently made by van Loghem and his associates, who described two new antigens. Most of the antigens were found exclusively in the members of one family; but as suggested by Dunsford, who studied the Wright system, some of these antigens may be ordinary blood-group factors with a very low frequency. Most of the corresponding antibodies were the results of iso-immunization during pregnancy or by blood transfusion, but a few of them were naturally occurring antibodies."

A minor field characteristic of the male African pochard is the brilliant vermilion iris—a feature easily discernible with binoculars at up to about a hundred yards. The female's irises are umber.
